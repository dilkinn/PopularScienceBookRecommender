0,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,4,"Years ago I had an extraordinary experience with squids when I was snorkelling off an unknown reef very close to a tiny island about 100 yards from shore. If the reef had been known there would have been very few parrotfish and cowfish, both of which are good eating. There would also have been no supermale parrotfish. A supermale is a female that has turned into a male and is double or more the size of the other fish and also much more beautiful and brightly coloured and absolutely delicious to eat. So I was snorkelling and I saw a little squid, it stayed still in the water and was rapidly changing colour. Then it was joined by another, then another until there were about 7 of them of varying sizes from about the size of your hand up to forearm sized all in a row and all rapidly cycling colours. I called out to my ex to come and see but come slowly not to scare them. I didn't think they would stay. He swam over and by then there were about 11 squids and it was apparent to both of us that they were staring at me. They were as curious and interested in me as I was in them and they didn't go away for quite a few minutes. They were no more shy than I was and as I had called my ex, so they had 'called' each other. Perhaps it was because no one knows of the reef they live in they weren't frightened of people, I don't know. What I learned from this book:1. If we thought of fish as we do mammals we would stop thinking of them as 'other' and realise that they have the same five senses (plus more). Having the senses means using them and implies learning from experience (don't touch that sea urchin again, it not only stings, but poisons).2. That people judge intelligence by how like us the animal thinks. We do too. All those books on animal intelligence are just about measuring how like us the animals solve problems that humans set them.3. That scientists rail against anthropomorphising animals, but if we did a bit more with fish, if we were more empathetic and understanding we would see that they have personalities, liked to play and not pretend that they can't feel pain and have no consciousness so it's ok to come into my shop and say (as plenty of customers do) that they are 'basically vegetarians' but eat fish. Here in the Caribbean, diving is good career. People come every week and want to be taken to see the reefs. The divers nurture relationships with generally-friendly fish like rays, giant groupers (Goliath fish) and some of the sharks so that their clients will have an interesting experience. Not all of these relationships are based on food. They never are with sharks. It would be foolish to feed sharks! But nevertheless, over years the divers and individual sharks get friendly and the sharks come and rub against the divers, much as cats do, and like to be caressed. What's in it for the fish is the same as what's in it for the people, it's entertaining, it's nice to see friends, what else could it be?The book, to sum up, was quite boring. I was hoping for more than the author's conjectures based on our common senses, what is known about fish and their life cycles, and anecdotes (like mine). Few of his assumptions and conclusions were ones that were new to me. I don't think it's the fault of the author, it's just that fishes inner lives are mostly a mystery. 3.5 stars rounded up because the author did his best and at least opened a dialogue into the idea that fish are as deserving as consideration as other animals when it comes to protecting them from pain and harm."

Don't think I will ever look at fish the same way again. So many characteristics that make us human do come into play with fish. Communication skills, empathy, using tools and other clever ways to get what they need, including cleaning. The chapters are nicely separated, covering a topic at a time.So many different types of fish, I spent much time looking them up to see their pictures. Some can change from femsle to make, what a clever advantage. Some have elaborate courtships in order to attract a mate. My favorite little puffer fish for instance uses his fins, to create an unusual and elaborate sand circle, much like the crop circles in farmers fields. In the middle he further furnishes his new lady love with broken shells, seaweed, other types of bling. All this for one mating session. Intrepid little fella. So many fascinating facts, well worth a read. Audio listeners be aware that illustrations are in the book. So many times the sudio does not contain a PDF file."
2,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2077536-navi,5,"This is the most delightfully charming work of nonfiction I have read in a long time!I have heard on numerous occasions that fish are nothing more than “water vegetables”, lacking feelings of pain, memory, familial love and social structure. They are continuously looked upon as a distinct species separate from the rest of the animal kingdom because they do not embody features we associate with more “sentient beings”. I used to work in a Fish and Reptile department at a pet store. I have intimate memories of fish that recognized me when I came near their tank, liked to be touched, and had specific preferences with which fish they spend their time with. At the time, I thought it was all in my head and I was giving fish more credit than they deserved by anthropomorphizing them. However, there was always a lingering doubt in the back of my mind.This book was a luminous revelation to me. The author's sincere passion and care for the welfare and advocacy of all ""fishes"" (instead of grouping them all together as a singular fish, the author makes a point of using the plural form to indicate that they are a group of individual fish with different likes, dislikes etc.) is embedded throughout the text.Some interesting things I learned:- Our assumption that fish are quiet is false. They make an array of different sounds to communicate with one another - one comical method is through (I kid you not) farting!- There was a study exploring the relationship that Koi have with music. The researchers found that Koi correctly discerned different musical cues and were able to classify music by artistic genre (blues, classics etc).- Fish are curious beings and gain stimulation through various modes of play. There is an anecdotal case where a cat and a fish play a running game with each other that was endearing. This is especially important for fish owners. I can’t imagine what a fish must feel living in an empty tank isolated without anything providing a source of entertainment or aesthetic comfort.- The intricacies involved with the symbiotic relationship between fish and their cleaner were fascinating.After reading this, I have a much deeper understanding and respect for our underwater cousins. I cannot recommend this book highly enough!"
3,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,4,"Fish get short shrift when we are thinking about animal behaviour. Consider the poor maligned gold fish, which is reputed to have an attention span of mere seconds. Incorrect, as it turns out—gold fish can learn tasks and retain that learning for months. I’m not a diver. I can’t swim and water will always be a scary place for me, but I can see where this book would be very interesting to anyone who spends time in the underwater world. Fish are much more interesting that I gave them credit for. I’m a birder, after all, and so I’m a little biased (although I certainly know that the term “bird brain” is actually more of a compliment than an insult). It’s difficult for us to imagine what a fish’s life is like—they live in a completely different medium than we do, have extra senses that we can’t fathom, and have unexpressive faces. I think that last point is the one that leads us to underestimate fishes—we value expressiveness over evidence, I think, because it’s something we’re good at.If you are interested in matters of animal intelligence (and human judginess) I would recommend Franz de Waal’s excellent book Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?."
4,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7206839-jenny,5,"""What many of these people like about fishes is not that they are like us. What is beautiful about them, and equally worthy of respect, is how they are not like us. Their different ways of being in the world are a source of fascination and admiration, and cause for sympathy. We can connect across the great divide that separates us, as when I have felt the gentle tugs of discus fishes rising to pluck food from my fingertips, or when a grouper fish approaches a trusted diver to receive caresses.Among other things, fishes use their brains to survive and flourish, and one of the ways I have sought to raise the status of fishes has been to draw attention to their awareness and cognitive skills. But extolling the mental virtues of other species inflates the importance of intelligence, when intelligence really has little to do with moral standing... Sentience--the capacity to feel, to suffer pain, to experience joy--is the bedrock of ethics. It is what qualifies one for the moral community.""-""Epilogue""This book is excellent. It taught me more about fishes than I'd ever expected to learn, and it is fascinating in the details Balcombe selected to share with his readers. What impresses me the most, other than the awesomeness and strangeness of creation expressed through fishes, is Balcombe's obvious love for and admiration of fishes. He makes them real to me through scientific evidence but also through anecdotal evidence. I appreciate that he mixes stories with science to not only prove his points but to also add sympathy and emotion to his arguments.The main claim in this book is that fishes are not fish. They are not a mass of creatures without individuality, emotion, intelligence, or knowledge. They are individuals with personalities, memories, and culture. The way that fishes interact with each other, socially, sexually, and culturally is so similar to we humans that it makes it impossible not to see fishes as sentient beings, deserving of our respect. Finally, I love the subtitle. For Balcombe, I know that it refers to evolution and the concept that life on our planet started in the water, and that at some point, our first land ancestors emerged out of the ocean and started developing bodies that could function on land. For me, it means that God created us all, so we all have common ancestry. Also, there was water before God created anything else, so in creation, the concept of life beginning in the water is the same as it is in evolutionary biology. Fishes existed before people, and they had more time to develop, evolve, and bond with the rest of creation. Why would we humans think we are any better than fishes? We have the same creator, and we are made from the same materials. We are all birthed from water. I highly recommend this book to people who already love fishes but especially to people who are convinced that the things who live in water and don't blink are not intelligent individuals. You'll be shocked to find you are very wrong!"
5,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32532051-montzalee-wittmann,5,"What a Fish Knows by Jonathan Balcombe and narrated by Graham Winton is a delightful and very informative book on fish. It explains how fish can feel pain, probably pleasure too, can plan, remember, scheme, communicate, and think! They have preferences, can be trained, seem to enjoy certain activities or people over others, and they use tools. I am a vegetarian and I don't eat fish due to this reason but it is nice to hear the science behind it. I learned so much in here too! Wow! How different fish mate, communicate, use tools, and more! In the end, the author discusses the fishing industry today...ugh! I recommend this to anyone and everyone! So heartwarming all the things the little fish can do and no one seems to know about!"
6,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41559-lori-ann,4,Brain candy for any diver...a must read. The last two chapters point out a ton of inconvenient truths for fish eaters. Looks like there are going to be more nuts and beans in my diet.
7,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2014250-tim-martin,5,"_What A Fish Knows_ was a quick, enjoyable read that veered between being a popular science book on the latest findings on fish behavior, memory, sensory abilities, and intelligence and a book strongly advocating for a kinder, more empathetic treatment of fish (and also essentially never, ever eating fish again). I can understand how one type of writing (fish are both surprisingly intelligent and quite aware of their environment and what happens to them in ways that might surprise most readers) would lead to the other (in the words of the author, “fishes are individual beings whose lives have intrinsic value – that is, value to themselves quite apart from any utilitarian value they might have to us,” very much echoing the views of _Relicts of a Beautiful Sea_ by Christopher Norment, who covered rare desert pupfish of the American Southwest at length, a book well worth reading). I rather preferred the more straightforward presentation of the latest findings on fish behavior and cognition than the more advocate aspects (most prevalent in the opening section and again towards the end), though even I cringed after reading the chapter at the end of the book describing the suffering and waste brought about by modern fishing practices (I am unsure if having read the book made that section even more cringeworthy, as I have always lamented so many things about modern fishing, such as the massive death of animals in the form of bycatch and the damage brought about by trawling nets). I will admit that some of the more advocacy type claims made early in the book (such as on page 19, “we’ll explore how fishes are not just sentient, but aware, communicative, social, tool-using, virtuous, even Machiavellian” or on page 20 “[a]nother prejudice we hold against fish is that they are “primitive,” which in this context has a host of unflattering connotations; simple, undeveloped, dim, inflexible, and unfeeling”) made me think twice about reading the book but also, after reading it, deciding I was a bit too hasty, as the author did indeed provide examples of fish tool use, evidence of perhaps friendships among fish and among fish and non-fish, and lots of examples of Machiavellian behavior. It’s not that I thought fish were stupid or dim-witted or was surprised that they had some complex behaviors, but the more emotional aspects of what he wrote I was a little leery of (were the fish being anthromorphized or was this part of a philosophy that granted sentience to just about any animal and what did virtuous mean in this context?). Another aspect of the book, which the author identified very early on, was his heavily reliance on anecdotes. While studies were definitely mentioned (and documented in the copious bibliography), there were lots and lots of examples, often provided by non-scientists, of fish behavior and intelligence indicating levels of cognition and recognition of individuals (be they other fish or non-fish like pet owners or individual divers) well beyond what most people would think of with regards to fish (a relevant quote on page 6, “I have sought to sprinkle the science with stories of people’s encounters with fishes, and I will be sharing some of these as we go along. Anecdotes carry little credibility with scientists, but they provide insight into what animals may be capable of that science has yet to explore”). They were fun to read and did indicate that so much more research can be done, but I sometimes found myself preferring the studies rather than the stories. As far as the science of the book goes, most of it was fascinating. The author organized the book into different sections (“what a fish perceives,” “what a fish feels,” “what a fish thinks,” “who a fish knows,” and “how a fish breeds”), each section two or three chapters and filled with lots of fascinating facts. The reader learns in the “what a fish perceives” section that some fish, such as bluegill, can see predators in a different part of the pond as they use the underside of the water’s surface as a mirror, that seemingly identical looking fish (such as various species of highly territorial damselfish) can distinguish between various individuals owing to distinctive facial patterns of dots and arcs only visible in UV, each pattern as unique as a human fingerprint, some fish (such as American shad and Gulf menhaden) can hear the ultrasonic sounds produced by predatory dolphins while others, such as cods, perches, and plaices, can hear infrasounds as low as 1 Hz, enabling the fish to migrate long distances using the ambient infrasound produced by waves, tides, and currents moving against cliffs, beaches, and reefs. Far from living in a silent realm, some fish have truly remarkable hearing as well as the mental ability to process it; one study with koi showed that the fish could even “discriminate polyphonic music [playing multiple notes simultaneously], discriminate between melodic patterns, and even classify music by artistic genre.” Not just eyesight and hearing are examined but also the sense of smell and electrorecption, the “biological ability to perceive natural electrical stimuli,” such as by electric eels (as an aside, I did not know that South American electric eels weren’t true eels at all but actually of the knifefish family, more closely related to catfish). The section on fish sensory abilities was not terribly controversial and often backed up some common sense knowledge of fishermen and aquarium owners. The next section, “what a fish feels,” was a bit more, as it often went to heart of people saying that fish don’t feel anything, that they don’t feel pain, that when they look distressed from being handled or hooked it is just a reflex. Early on in the chapter, the author cautioned against “corticocentrism,” the idea that to “possess a humanlike capacity for pain” one must have a neocortex (though quickly acknowledging that few think birds don’t feel pain and also at the same time birds do not possess a neocortex). I feared that the section would be emotional or spiritual or the like (despite the solid science of the previous section), but again I was surprised at the series of very good studies on fish sensory capabilities and the solid science behind assertions that fish experience pain, react to it, and plan to avoid it in the future if possible. Also to my surprise the section didn’t just dwell on fish pain and stress but also fish joy, providing studies (and a lot of anecdotal examples) of fish experiencing joy and playing even as adults. I think my favorite section was next, “what a fish thinks.” By this point I was swept away by some of the fascinating studies and anecdotes of the surprising mental abilities of fish. My favorite by far was the example of the frillfin goby (a fish of the intertidal zones of both eastern and western Atlantic shores). This fish prefers to stay safe in isolated tide pools at low tides, but when danger threatens it can leap with a high degree of success to neighboring pools. As studies showed, the fish does not sense these pools from its own pool, but remarkably “memorizes the topography of the intertidal zone – fixing in its mind the layout of depressions that will form future pools in the rocks at low tide – while swimming over them at high tide.” Also in this section the author demolishes popular conceptions of goldfish memories measured in seconds, provided an example of tool use discovered in 2009 (orange-dotted tuskfish near Palau using “rapid head-flicks and well-timed releases” to open clams against undersea rocks), showing how in one study vermiculate river stingrays in South America (a freshwater species) could problem solve to get food treats, even in several cases “moving away from a strongly attractive cue – the smell of food at one end of the tube [used in the experiment] – and trying the other side…not a trivial a thing…it means they have to work against their natural impulse,” and how archerfish (able to spray jets of water up to ten feet through the air to help them prey on insects) are able to get better at aiming not just from practice but actually watching other archerfish hunt, “a form of grasping something from the perspective of another.” “Who a fish knows” was fascinating, going into aspects of fish sociology. The reader learns the differences between shoals and schools (shoals are groups of fish gathered together and socially interacting but each swim independently and may be facing different directions, while a school is more disciplined with the fish moving at the same speed and in the same direction at a fairly constant distance from one another). Another excellent section, the author covered predator inspection (behavior that lets a predatory fish know it has been spotted by other fish and highly suggestive it should move on) and two extremely interesting sections on cleaner fish and also on cooperative hunting (my favorite example being cooperative hunting between groupers and moray eels, with the groupers actually able to understand and have the moray eels in turn understand pointing, this accomplished by a grouper doing a headstand over a spot where a prey has hidden; this is a “referential gesture, which outside of humans, has only previously been attributed to great apes and ravens”). There was also coverage of fish culture, that non-inherited information passed on by “informed individuals” such as migration routes, ideal forage spots, which predators to avoid, etc. may be lost in overfished species and could be lost forever, complicating recovery efforts. The last section, “how a fish breeds,” was much as I expected it, covering fish breeding, but was still interesting, covering the different ways fish are actually care givers and may protect eggs and young (the cichlids of the great lakes of east Africa get lots of attention) as well as elaborate gender hierarchies and courtship rituals. It included the latest research, such as the 2012 discovery of elaborate, geometric “crop circles” created by male pufferfish off the southern tip of Japan, huge mandalas up to six feet wide and decorated by shells, created by fish only five inches long. The book closed (after a horrifying section on fishing) with another appeal that fish are deserving of empathy. “In those flat, glassy eyes we struggle to see anything more than a vacant stare...[t]heir unblinking eyes – constantly bathed in water and thus in no need of lids – amplify the illusion that they feel nothing.” It was a good book and I am definitely glad I read it. "

9,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/829466-sara,5,"Once I heard this book was coming out, I had to have it because, as the author points out, you can't really find an entire book devoted to fish ethology (behavior). Now, this author undoubtedly has a bit of an agenda as you can tell from prior books. He's for animal rights so I wanted to see if he strayed too far from hyperbole. Generally I don't think he did. Mostly he stays with the science and makes some excellent points such as a) fish came way before us so it's not like they've stopped evolving for millions of years and b) fish reaction to pain stimuli and response to pain meds and some parallels to birds indicate they Can feel pain. However, I do mostly maintain my initial ideas that yes... Fish feel pain and think but not to the degree of mammals. (He intimates that they feel acute more than chronic pain). The strong emotional component was even more spurious barring a few anecdotes. That's not to say nothing surprises me though: the mental calculation and deception of certain fishes was surprising and very interesting (the cleaner fish chapter was great!) and the chapter on fish sensory adaptations was wonderful as well. It was a really fun book and it does raise interesting questions on how to treat fish ethically. (I don't eat fish either). However, given the scope of the problems of overfishing, the author didn't give a ton of suggestions. An obvious one would be to explore Which fish are more sentient as people have suggested for apes and birds (macaws and the Corvid families) and maybe give them more consideration (he suggested wrasses but makes some points for chiclids too). I would recommend this book. It will surprise and entertain you! "
10,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5933158-wendy,3,"I gave this book 3 stars because I think the subject matter is so critical, but I have read some of Balcombe's other work and am left here with the same feeling as with those: the writing is slow, and only sporadically does it pick up into something really enjoyable. This is a shame. I am reminded of books I've read on animal rights, like There Is No Happy Meat and compare it to Jonathan Saffron Foer's Eating Animals - and though I much prefer the message of Bohanec's, it was actually Foer's that moved me much more (this after being vegan for some years when I first read it). I recently finished another book on animal behavior - Beyond Words by Carl Safina, and I am hard pressed to figure out the difference between his writing and Balcombe's. Could it be the way Safina takes his time and presents the worlds he shows? Could it be that he inserts himself fully into the information he shares? But Balcombe does the same, and I am much more aligned with Balcombe's thoughts and feelings; Safina sees problems and doesn't, say, stop eating salmon. Balcombe sees problems and tries to change them.But from a writing and reading standpoint, I just found this one difficult to get through. I don't doubt Balcombe's science, and I am happy to have the information. It's just not a sit-down-and-enjoy kind of book. "
11,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4837365-jonathan-maas,5,"An incredible array of fish facts that slowly work their way into a thesisWhat a Fish Knows: The Inner Lives of Our Underwater Cousins, by Jonathan Balcombe is first and foremost, an incredible assortment of fish facts. Secondly, it is a book.This is not to diminish it as a book - the incredible insight from the first gives it its power.One of my favorite non-fiction books about the ocean is Deep: Freediving, Renegade Science, and What the Ocean Tells Us about Ourselves, where James Nestor acts as a writer/journalist first, and a diver second. Nestor goes to the widest array of the trope - and investigates the Ama, divers, dolphin researchers and everyone else.Balcombe does not do this - he finds fish facts, and keeps at them until the reader gets the tale.Again, this is not to his detriment - it's just his style is facts first, tale second.In his spirit, I'll list some of his insights, and let you come to your own conclusions -On the sheer number of fishWhat we casually refer to as “fish” is in fact a collection of animals of fabulous diversity. According to FishBase—the largest and most often consulted online database on fishes—33,249 species, in 564 families and 64 orders, had been described as of January 2016. That’s more than the combined total of all mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. When we refer to “fish” we are referring to 60 percent of all the known species on Earth with backbones.On perhaps the root of our prejudice against fishAmong the vertebrate animals—mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fishes—it is the fishes that are the most alien to our sensibilities. Lacking detectable facial expressions and appearing mute, fishes are more easily dismissed than our fellow air breathers.A great concept to try to understand things from an animal's point of view - it may be impossible, but at least you can understand what you are trying to doOne of my favorite concepts learned as a student of animal behavior is umwelt—a term created early in the twentieth century by the German biologist Jakob von Uexküll. You can think of an animal’s umwelt as its sensory world. Because their sensory apparatus varies, different species may have different perceptions of the world even if they inhabit the same environment.On the fact that many fish just see more than we doIn the ages since, fishes have evolved visual capacities beyond our own. For example, most modern bony fishes are tetrachromatic, allowing them to see colors more vividly than we do. We are trichromatic creatures, which means we possess only three types of cone cells in our eyes and our color spectrum is more limited. Having four types of cone cells, fishes’ eyes provide four independent channels for conveying color information.On an eel's sense of smellBut the champion sniffer among all fishes (as far as we know) is the American eel, which can detect the equivalent of less than one ten millionth of a drop of their home water in the Olympic pool. Like salmons, eels make long migrations back to specific spawning sites, and they follow a subtle gradient of scent to get there.On the tastebuds of a fishTaste buds are also more numerous in fishes than in any other animal. For instance, a fifteen-inch channel catfish had approximately 680,000 taste buds on his entire body, including fins—nearly 100 times the human quota.In conclusionAnd so on! I could go on and on - in short, if you want to know about fish in general, this is a good place to start. Even if you already know quite a bit, I'd give this a shot - you might get a lot!"
12,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8300581-sam-sattler,4,"It is difficult to look into the eyes of another living creature without wondering what that creature thinks of what he sees in your own eyes. Does that animal wonder what we are and what our intentions might be? Is it perhaps seeing us as an equal that deserves the benefit of the doubt? Or is anything really going on in the brain behind those eyes at all other than the hope that we will provide the animal with something to eat or drink? Humans find it easy to relate to pets, especially dogs and cats, because those animals readily exhibit affection via their actions and variable facial expressions. But other animals, especially those incapable of changing facial expressions, find it more difficult to claim the respect of human beings. And Jonathon Balcombe contends that fish, of all the members of this too easily written off group of static-faced animals, is probably the most underestimated of the lot.Balcombe offers What a Fish Knows: The Inner Lives of Our Underwater Cousins in hope that the book will change the way that we think about the more than thirty thousand species of fish that exist today before it is too late to save many of them from extinction. Balcombe strives to make us see fish as individuals that can think, feel emotions and pain, make choices, enjoy play, hunt in cooperative groups, learn to use tools, and live complicated social lives. The author rightfully believes that the world’s commercial fishing industry is still so unregulated and out of control that it is in the process of relentlessly destroying the very fish species that make it a viable proposition for today’s fishermen. I submit that anyone who reads What a Fish Knows with an open mind will find it difficult, it not impossible, to argue otherwise.Balcombe builds his case by using both the latest scientific breakthrough discoveries and anecdotal evidence from fish owners, recreational and professional divers, and others whose lifework is caring for and studying fish. The book is split into seven sections: “The Misunderstood Fish,” “What a Fish Perceives,” “What a Fish Feels,” “What a Fish Thinks,” “Who a Fish Knows,” “How a Fish Breeds,” and “Fish Out of Water.” For the most part, the content of each section is as clear as the title, but two of the sections demand a bit of an explanation.“The Misunderstood Fish” section focuses on the point that fish are not the “lowly” creatures that most of us believe them to be. As Balcombe puts it:“Lacking detectable facial expressions and appearing mute, fishes are more easily dismissed than our fellow air breathers. Their place in human culture falls almost universally into two entwined contexts: (1) something to be caught, and (2) something to be eaten.” The “Fish Out of Water” section is the one in which the author stresses “it isn’t easy being a fish in an age of humans.” This is where he exposes the commercial fishing practices that do so much collateral damage to the populations of non-targeted fish, practices that see the wasted-by-catch tonnage rivaling the targeted tonnage taken by some commercial shrimpers and fishermen. According to Balcombe, right at one-third “of the world’s fish catch…is not eaten by humans.”Two paragraphs from What a Fish Knows beautifully summarize what Jonathon Balcombe hopes his readers will take away from his book. The first paragraph appears on page 177 in the “Who a Fish Knows” section, and I quote a portion of it below:“The main conclusion we may draw from these aspects of what a fish knows is that fishes are individuals with minds and memories, able to plan, capable of recognizing others, equipped with instincts and able to learn from experience. In some cases, fishes have culture. As we’ve seen, fishes also show virtue through cooperative relationships both within and between species.”The second paragraph I want to quote from appears on page 207 in the “How a Fish Breeds” section of the book:“Fishes are not merely alive – they have lives. They are not just things, but beings. A fish is an individual with a personality and relationships. He or she can plan and learn, perceive and innovate, soothe and scheme, experience moments of pleasure, fear, playfulness, pain, and – I suspect – joy. A fish feels and knows.”Bottom Line: What a Fish Knows is guaranteed to make the reader rethink his relationship with everything from his pet goldfish to the largest whale in the ocean. It is an eye-opener with a message, but it is also an entertaining book about a cousin of ours we all too often take for granted."

Did you know fish do have feelings, intelligence, use tools, plan, and have culture? Balcombe has that powerful combination as a writer to bring scientific studies alive, and we get lots of fascinating studies in this book presented in such a lively and clear manner. I also appreciate that Balcombe continually presents -well, this is another way we might interpret these results. And, unlike Sy Montgomery's books that I find to be simply too emotional. Balcombe is not overly sentimental. In fact the information and style is balanced. I've bought my friends copies of this book!"

That’s 99% of our experience of fish, but it’s not Balcombe’s experience, and he wants us to know that fish have interesting cognition (learning and performing complex tasks), sophisticated memories, relationships, social bonding, and a real sense of pain that we continuously violate. The book tells us that fish have these rich lives, but we don’t understand them because they’re so alien to us. Without a leg to stand on, literally, or a face to express emotion, or even voices with which to scream, understanding fish requires some sympathy and a deeper understanding that we normally give them. Usually, our experience of fish is a protein on a plate. But they are much more than that. In seven chapters, the book gives the view that we are incredibly species-ist about understanding animals in general, and fish in particular.  Chapter 2—what a fish perceives: They see, touch, and sense a rich underwater world in ways that we can’t imagine. What would it be like to have taste buds all over your body, or see the electrical fields of other animals, or feel every tiny passing pressure wave. We feel air pressure when it’s large enough—but imagine feeling every passing breeze at 100X the resolution, or hearing sounds of other fishes pressure wave as they pass by. Chapter 3—what a fish feels: Unlike what your grandfather might have told you, a fish definitely feels pain. That hook in the mouth hurts. But it’s worse to but hauled up in a net from 1000 fathoms down, crushed together with a million of your kind, crushed, suffocated, and decompressed with your guts coming out of your throat. We can’t pretend this isn’t just slaughtering creatures that don’t feel pain. Chapter 4—what a fish thinks: Much to my surprise, fish have a lot more intelligence (and long-term memory) than I’d thought. It’s not just clever skills, but also learning by observation of others behavior (perspective taking), planning out future actions, and remembering skills and patterns for a very long period. There are fish that engage in inter-species social communication, along with temporary upsets, fights, and reconciliation. (Yes, there are even fish that are tool users, which is quite a feat without fingers or hands.) Chapter 5—Who a fish knows: Yes, they have social intelligence as well. They have friends, they mourn the loss of a companion, and even organize hunting parties together. Certain groupers even use referential gestures to point out where food is hiding for a moray. The eel sees the grouper “pointing” at the food (with his whole body), rushes in for the kill, and the grouper benefits by cleaning up the leftovers. That is, the grouper is signaling to his hunting partner, “there’s a fish hiding in here.. go get him!” This is all very much more than I ever would have expected of a fish. Chapter 6—how a fish breeds: I thought I knew a lot about the variety and depth of fish mating and fish-rearing behavior, but since I last read about this, research has shown even more remarkable insights. Yes, there are remarkable swimming displays to attract a mate, and there are amazing constructions that fish will build (without hands!) to show off their prowess and fitness for mating. But there are novel reproduction methods I didn’t know about. Example: the female armored catfish (Corydoras) attaches herself to the genitals of the male to drink his sperm (who knew they had oral sex?), BUT it’s not digested, but pass through her body in seconds to be carefully excreted atop her clutch of just released eggs. (Which means she has a special “pass-through” mode for things she ingests, and not digests.) It goes on and on: fish that deposit their fertilized eggs inside of a mussel for safe harbor and development until the fish are born, and leave the borrowed bivalve womb. Since sex and mating drives a lot of behavior, it’s no surprise that it drives fish behavior as well. Male Atlantic mollies have a gonopodium (which looks and functions a lot like a penis) that they use to mate. The males also practice deception—they will show a false interest in a smaller female (which then attracts other males to the smaller female), and the largely endowed gonopodium male will then run off with the larger (and more attractive) female. (And, in an interesting twist, there are mollies that live in the Amazon that are (appropriately enough) all female. BUT, they can produce viable eggs only if they mate with male mollies… of a different species. They mate and generate eggs, but the eggs aren’t fertilized by the spermatic contribution of the other-species male. It’s a case of “immaculate deception.”) Equally amazing, some female fish take care of their young post-birth. Some go so far as to excrete a special kind of immunity-boosting mucus from their scales, which the little fry are encouraged to eat. Like mammalian mother’s-milk, the fish-mother’s mucus is early stage, specially adapted food for the infant fish. Overall, “What a Fish Knows” is a beautifully written paen to fishes, and a call for humanity to stop the killing of an entire category of sensing, perceiving, attentive animals. Fish are the only wild “bush meat” that we consume on a massive, industrial scale. Yes, there are farmed fish, but that has its own set of problems. Not only are we being cruel about the way we capture them, but we’ve destroyed many populations along the way. That orange roughy you had with a light cream sauce was probably 100 years old when caught. Since orange roughy are slow-growing and late to mature, this means they have very low resilience, making them extremely susceptible to overfishing. Likewise for sharks, cod, etc etc etc. Would we do anything differently if cows took 100 years to mature to edibility? But because the orange roughly lives in the deep sea at 1000 meters down, we don’t see this, and we don’t know what’s really going on. What’s worse, it’s become clear that some fishes have cultural knowledge that’s passed down between generations (primarily around good breeding places). It’s very possible that some kinds of fish are not bouncing back after fishing is halted because they’ve FORGOTTEN how to have a viable population. There’s a lot more going on with fish than you might have known. It’s enough to make you stop eating fish. I’m certainly decreasing the amount and kind that I eat. "
15,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"Interesting facts about fish:Do fish feel pain? It seems that they do. If you expose fish to a pain condition, such as exposure to vinegar, they cannot complete their task. However, if you give fish pain medication, they can complete the task, despite the vinegar exposure. Fish express anxiety over a variety of things (e.g. finding the correct shelter). Researchers observe various fish doing various tasks and identify the anxious fish, give the fish anxiety meds, and observe that they are less anxious and can make better decisions - the decisions non anxious fish make. Large fish have spa days. They go to cleaner fish stations to get cleaned, mostly of parasites. They observe the cleaners to see who is an honest cleaner and who is a non honest cleaner (honest = little or no biting of the precious mucus that covers the large fish's skin/ dishonest = taking tasty bits of the mucus skin). Just as humans use Yelp or Google to rate businesses, cleaner fish seem to get reputations as honest or dishonest. Honest cleaner get more clients. When being cleaned, if the large fish senses danger, it will open its mouth and chomp down, trapping the small cleaner fish inside. After the danger passes, the large fish will open up and allow the cleaner fish to swim free. Some fish love to be petted, just as a dog enjoys it. The author thinks this is worth studying. Do they experience pleasure? He wants to find out. "
16,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16857218-christian-d-orr,4,"Not only are we learning from other scientific studies that birds are (and dinosaurs were) much more intelligent than longstanding paradigms had assumed for so many decades, this fascinating book shows that the same is true of fish as well; their cold, seemingly robotic and unfeeling automaton appearance notwithstanding, their actually sentient beings with intelligence and even personalities. The author offers his evidence with plenty of solid science, with detailed information backed by a witty writing style.The author injects some bleeding-heart liberal politics at several points in the book (not just in the animal rights arena but also a totally irrelevant interjection at one point on gender identity politics), which brings my rating from 5 stars down to 4.....but at least, unlike many animal rights and environmentalist extremists, he doesn't advocate the total abolition of fish consumption; rather, he brings up some valid concerns about overfishing (i.e. excessive depletion of a precious, valuable resource) and about the need for more humane methods of killing fish intended for human consumption.RANDOM STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS (and noteworthy passages)--""One author, Alison Mood, has estimated, based on analysis of Food and Agriculture Organization fisheries capture statistics for the period 1999–2007, that the number of fishes killed each year by humans is between 1 and 2.7 trillion.*"" Funny, most people don't talk about ""killing"" fish that they catch like they would talk about ""killing"" mammals and birds that they hunt.--""dizzying numbers like these tend to mask the fact that each fish is a unique individual, not just with a biology, but with a biography. Just as each sunfish, whale shark, manta ray, and leopard grouper has a distinctive pattern from which you can recognize individuals on the outside, each has a one-of-a-kind life on the inside, too. And therein lies the locus of change in human-fish relations. It is a fact of biology that every fish, like the proverbial grain of sand, is one of a kind. But unlike grains of sand, fishes are living beings. This is no trivial distinction. When we come to understand fishes as conscious individuals, we may cultivate a new relationship to them. In the immortal words of an unknown poet: 'Nothing has changed except my attitude—so everything has changed.'"" Profound.""According to FishBase—the largest and most often consulted online database on fishes—33,249 species, in 564 families and 64 orders, had been described as of January 2016. That’s more than the combined total of all mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. When we refer to 'fish' we are referring to 60 percent of all the known species on Earth with backbones."" Mind-blowing stats.--""Bony fishes, scientifically termed teleosts (from the Greek teleios = complete, and osteon = bone),"" I thought they were termed Ostichthyians?--""The bony fishes are at least as evolutionarily distinct from the cartilaginous fishes as mammals are from birds. A tuna is actually more closely related to a human than to a shark, and the coelacanth—a 'living fossil' first discovered in 1937—sprouted closer to us than to a tuna on the tree of life. So there are at least six major vertebrate groups if one counts the cartilaginous fishes."" Wow, thought-provoking, and dare I say (borderline) paradigm-shifting?--""In any event, brain size is only marginally meaningful in terms of cognitive advancement. As the author Sy Montgomery notes in an essay on octopus minds, it is well known in electronics that anything can be miniaturized. A small squid can learn mazes faster than dogs do, and a small goby fish can memorize in one trial the topography of a tide pool by swimming over it at high tide—a feat few if any humans could achieve."" And to use a mechanical & technological analogy, look at microchips and microprocessors vs. older and bigger vacuum tubes. --""As far as we know there is only one way to achieve internal fertilization: sex with an intromittent organ. So it appears that fishes were the first to enjoy 'the fun kind' of sex. About this discovery and John Long, the Australian paleontologist who brought it to light, [David] Attenborough expressed ambivalence during a public lecture: 'This is the first known example of any vertebrate copulating in the history of life … and he names it after me.'"" Ha!--""fishes are not easily fathomed."" Pun intended?""A seven-month survey using echo soundings of the mesopelagic zone (between 100 and 1,000 meters—330 to 3,300 feet—below the ocean surface), published in early 2014, concluded that there are between ten and thirty times more fishes living there than was previously thought."" Fascinating revelation.--""In exchange for the male being the ultimate couch potato, the female never has to wonder where her mate is on a Saturday evening."" Haha, amusing metaphors/analogies.--""Frilled sharks carry their babies for over three years, the longest known pregnancy in nature. I sure hope they don’t get morning sickness."" Haha, this author sure is witty.--""Speaking of superlatives, and names, surely one of the longest belongs to Hawaii’s state fish, the rectangular triggerfish, known by the locals as humuhumunukunukuapua’a (translation: the fish that sews with a needle and grunts like a pig). Perhaps the award for least flattering name should go to an anglerfish dubbed the hairy-jawed sack-mouth, and for most preposterous to the sarcastic fringehead. For the title of crudest, I nominate a small coastal dweller, the slippery dick (Halichoeres bivittatus)."" A literal limp wet fish, the latter species? Nyuk nyuk?--""In March 2015, scientists described the first truly endothermic fish, the opah, which maintains its body temperature at about 9 degrees Fahrenheit above the cold waters it swims in at depths of several hundred feet,""--""There isn’t anything musical about the sounds that herrings make, but their innovative method might warrant a fish Grammy Award. One paper describes the first example of what might loosely be termed flatulent communication. Both Pacific and Atlantic herrings break wind by releasing gas bubbles from the anal duct region, producing distinctive bursts of pulses, or what the research team playfully named Fast Repetitive Ticks (FRTs). A bout of FRTs can last up to seven seconds. Try that at home! The gas probably originates in the gut or the swim bladder. It isn’t clear how these sounds function in herring society, but since per capita rates of sound production are higher in denser schools of herrings, a social function is suspected. So far there is no evidence that herrings ever beg your pardon."" Heh heh, I gotta share that one with Dave Writer!--""Male deep-sea anglerfishes illustrate the interplay of senses. **They have the largest nostrils relative to head size of any animal on Earth**, according to Ted Pietsch, the world’s go-to guy on anglerfishes."" [emphasis added]--""Consider also that the elephantfishes have the largest brain cerebellum of any fish, and that their brain-to-body-weight ratio—a highly touted marker of intelligence—is about the same as ours.""--""perceptions of fishes, I received unsolicited accounts from eight of a thousand random respondents who described behavior like that of the Midas cichlid we just met. These fishes would allow their humans to pet, touch, hold, and stroke them.""--""'To suggest that fishes cannot feel pain because they don’t have sufficient neuroanatomy is like arguing that balloons cannot fly because they don’t have wings.' Or that humans cannot swim because they don’t have fins.""--""Tool use was long believed unique to humans, and it is only in the last decade that scientists have begun to appreciate the behavior beyond mammals and birds.""--""Aquariums illustrate what science demonstrates: fishes have social lives.""--""Creatures like Grandma and The Whisperer defy the common prejudice that sharks are terrorists and bony fishes primitive and dull.

17,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40442912-ncsark,4,"This book could have been titled ""Fish Are Awesome"" and it would still be an accurate title. Not only are there over 33,000 species of fish, humans have only begun to scratch the surface of what fishes are truly capable of. Fishes (I'm with the author that referring, ""...to a trillion fish by the singular term lumps them together like rows of corn"") are indeed awesome: from complex social structures and behaviours to organized hunting, feeding and mating rituals, fishes remain perhaps the most misunderstood beings in the animal kingdom. This book is not just a fascinating look into ""the inner lives of our underwater cousins"", it is incredibly well-researched and lovingly written; the author Jonathan Balcombe clearly respects fishes and their lives. The book is written with humour, interspersed with personal anecdotes that he admits ""...carry little credibility with scientists, but they provide insight into what animals may be capable of that science has yet to explore."" As a vegan reader, I also appreciate that the author addresses the issue of some studies that have been conducted on fishes that have been inhumane, cruel, and like so many animal experiments, unnecessary, many of which could be avoided if humans were simply more willing to accept that animals ARE capable of suffering and to just leave them the hell alone in the first place. But I digress. From elaborate nest-building to the use of tools to some pretty unique sex acts, I certainly have a new respect for fishes and feel honoured to have gotten to understand them a little better. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in animal behaviour and especially to those who ""just eat fish."" A timely and fascinating book. "
18,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50961138-william,5,"This was delightful. Jonathan Balcombe tackles the subject of the inner lives of fish with an exceptional balance of science, argument, and anecdote. His prose never loses the deep compassion he has for fish but it doesn't become pedantic or pollyannish. He treats fish with respect and joy and wonder. I think I've learned a great deal from reading this book. I'd recommend it to anybody who is curious about, well, fish! They'll blow you away. I swear they will."
19,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17746077-joshua-buhs,3,"Admirable.Balcombe is a (former?) ethologist, working (in some capacity) for the Humane Society. In this book, he reviews what's known about fish thinking and feeling, the research that undergirds this knowledge, and speculates on further lines of study based on anecdotes he has collected.The book is organized around the (Romantic German biologist) Jakob von Uexküll's idea of Umwelt: the notion that an organism's understanding of the environment is shaped by its senses. Already, this approach puts the book above Jennifer Ackerman's similar book on bird intelligence. Balcombe is sensitive to the idea that fish are different than humans, and so may have their own forms of intelligence. He never mentions the name, but he's clearly thinking of Thomas Nagel's classic philosophical paper """"What is it like to be a bat?""I learned a lot from the book. Not about fish biology, which is presented here in a very basic way, but about fish behavior and signs of intelligence. Balcombe makes his case--though, admittedly, I'm relatively sympathetic to it in the first place. I do not think that he advances the general case for animal consciousness beyond what Donald Griffin did lo those many years ago, but he did so in very specific ways.In going over the material, Balcombe is careful to not get too far over his skies--and when he does, he's good at labeling those parts that are speculation or based on anecdote (0r in which he is criticizing the limitations of some study). True enough he spends a lot of time on a few anecdotes, which may give them undue weight, but it seems to be in the service of encouraging further research, which seems fair, given the general bias against the notion that fish have any kind of intelligence. (A bias he reasonable blames on their relatively fixed facial features, so different than expressive humans.)For the most part, Balcombe is a graceful stylist, though his penchant for joking does become tiresome. And his structural organization is uninspired. The book is divided thematically, first by senses, later by other ethological topics: emotions, thought, social behavior, reproduction. The chapters themselves, though, have no real drive to them; while he transitions from topic to topic without much problem, the movement can sometimes feel like a forced march.Part of the gracefulness of his prose is the way that he tucks his larger argument into each section, leaving hints--that he then never completely ties together, rather allowing the reader to draw the conclusion that Balcombe wants: leading the reader to water, thirsty, without saying what must be done. It's clear that Balcombe wants the reader to question whether eating fish is a reasonable choice--not because of the way fish have been over-harvested, or the oceans turned into giant toilet bowls, but because fish are sentient, feeling, thoughtful creatures with a right to exist on the planet.And while I do not plan on stopping eating fish altogether--I don't much, at any rate, because of over-harvesting and pollution--I will stop and give respect to the fish whose life has been cut short to supply my own.I don't think that's everything Balcombe was after, but he did move me along."
20,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1194182-liz,2,"In the history of persuasion no one has ever changed their mind while being talked at. Preaching is the quickest way to lose an unconverted audience. The best way to change someone's mind is to make them curious. Ask them questions and then calmly lay out your interesting facts. Then after you've let the evidence speak for itself you ask if the status quo should change. Does what you thought still seem true? Sadly this book did the opposite. It started fast and hard condemning people's unfeeling, speciesist view of these poor creatures. Espousing cruelties and the author's own, lone kind heart. While I agreed with him on the folly of people classing fish as somehow less alive or more easily eaten than say cows, it is not just fish or the mamailian bias that I think of as strange. Life is life. Trees have memoirs, loyalties and language. We are land fish that can only survive outside the ocean by carrying the sea inside our bodies. These are facts. They awaken compassion and understanding, but they do so on their own with my telling you what you should feel. If this book had just contained interesting, relatable facts about our fellow fish I would have enjoyed the whole thing. Alas, it did not, it was a sermon of why humans are unfeeling and biased. Yes, yes, I know that, I did not pick up this book to hear about people, I picked it up to learn about fish. "

If you’ve ever wondered about life in the underwater world, this book will teach you a lot, from fascinating facts like tapetum lucidum—the layer of the retina that enables marine creatures to see at night and is also responsible for creating the eyeshine in the eyes of cats and dogs—to the complexity of fish feeling. There are more species of fish than of all other vertebrates—mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians—combined, yet they’re a mystery to us. Not after reading this book.Jonathan Balcombe speaks about fishes intelligently, eloquently, and passionately. The book is a trove of information and insight."
22,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24382403-james-scheid,5,I will never look at a fish the same way again. They are sentient beings with problem solving skills. Some can recognize their humans and like to be petted. One species of fish float near the top of the water at high tide and memorize the map of the sea floor so they know where to hide when the tide is low. This book is full of fascinating facts but also gives examples of the cruelty we inflict on them. It ends with a glimmer of hope for a better future. The writing just flows. (No pun intended)
23,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1394552-keith-akers,4,"This excellent book about fish sentience is much better than we have any right to expect based on its subject matter. Fish seem hopelessly alien, a topic that Balcombe addresses early on. Without needlessly sexing up the topic, Jonathan Balcombe gives us an entertaining, organized, and scientific exposition of what it is that fishes know. As it turns out, this is quite a bit. Fish have language, can feel pain (this should be obvious, but now you know), like to play, are affectionate, and can use tools. Balcombe gives anecdotes and chooses pictures that illustrate what he is talking about that are well chosen. I loved the picture of a woman staring at her pet pufferfish in a long “gazing session.” This book should inspire sympathy for fish and give anyone who has been fishing some second thoughts about this activity. Especially intriguing is the discussion of fish sexuality; some fish can, as the situation demands, switch sexes or even be both at once, and fertilize themselves. But this is not a heavy-handed plea for animal kindness by any means. Quite the contrary, it is so quiet that any feelings of sympathy the reader has for animals must be coming from within. "

I agree 100% with what the author says about humans not realizing fish are sentient beings because fish are unable to change their expressions. I never thought about it before, but it is true; we tend to see those who make/have cute faces as lovable and loving. The material was presented in an easy to understand format, and there really weren't any points where he lost my interest. Some parts were humorous; for instance, who expected to find a section about whether size matters to fish (and yes, he is referring to THAT!!) in this type of book. THe book was well narrated, I learned interesting things about fish, and it caused me to rethink about my persepctive on fish. The part about how fish are killed/farmed was eye opening, and although difficult to read, it is important to know. Overall, I found this informative and interesting."

Fish tend to accumulate various pollutants, therefore frequent consumption is mostly detrimental to human health. The farmed fish usually eats wild fish (since we apparently have a taste for carnivorous fish) and they are kept in conditions so bad that a 10%-30% death rate is considered acceptable, while various diseases and parasites run unchecked through the overcrowded populations.

If you’re a fish enthusiast, the first bit might be a bit tedious for you, but it’s worth it for all the cool facts later on.

33,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105791880-george-jacobs,5,"Jonathan Balcombe, the author of this New York Times best-selling book, has worked for many years as an ethologist (a scientist who studies animal behaviour). He is director of animal sentience at the Humane Society Institute for Science and Policy. His website is www.jonathanbalcombe.com. His other books are The Exultant Art: A Pictorial Tour of Animal Pleasure, Second Nature: The Iinner Livers of Animals, Pleasurable Kingdom: Animals and the Nature of Feeling Good, and The Use of Aanimals in Higher Education: Problems, Alternatives, and Recommendations. 	This review attempts to give readers an understanding of the structure of the book and a sample of some the book’s main points. The review ends with some comments by the reviewer. The book consists of seven parts, some of which are divided into chapters. Balcombe dedicates the book to the “anonymous trillions” of fishes, and he hopes that after reading this book (or a summary thereof) that humans will appreciate that fishes are not objects or grains of sand, but that each of the trillions of fishes is an individual who thinks and feels. Referring to his hopes for each of the approximately 7.4 billion humans’ attitudes towards fishes, Balcombe quotes an anonymous poet, “Nothing has changed except my attitude—so everything has changed” (p. 8). The reviewer believes this book provides valuable resources which ecolinguists can use to change people’s attitudes towards finishes. Prologue	That quote was from the book’s prologue, which includes basic information on fishes and their plight. Balcombe contends that although many, many books have been written about fishes, his is the first book written on behalf of fishes. Other works that seem to be concerned about fishes, talking about endangered species and overexploitation of fish “stocks”, actually focus on fishes as commodities for human use. The lives of fishes, Balcombe believes, have value not primarily for what they offer humans. Instead, all fishes’ lives have value to each of those fishes and those in their communities. 	One estimate puts the number of land animals killed annually for food for humans at about 70 billion. How many fishes are killed each year to feed humans? Balcombe uses an estimate, based on FAO data, that 1 trillion to 2.7 trillion fishes are killed by humans each year. (For other stats, please visit http://www.fishcount.org.uk.) These fishes die mostly from a combination of asphyxiation (when they are taken out of the water), decompression (due to pressure change as they are brought out of the water, being crushed under the weight of the fishes and other marine animals caught with them in the same net and being slaughtered.Part 1 – The Misunderstood Fish	Fishes are an extremely diverse collection of animals, accounting for 33,249 species, 60% of all the known vertebrates, with many more fish species likely yet to be discovered. The two main types of fishes are bony fishes (the largest group), including eels, salmons, basses, goldfishes and carps, and cartilaginous fishes, including sharks and rays. Fishes have been on the Earth much longer than humans: “[Fishes] had graced planet Earth fifty times longer than we have before they even left the water” (p. 13). As to the criticism that fishes’ small brains mean that they must not be able to think or feel, Balcombe counters with the point that miniaturisation allows small objects to function as well as larger ones.		Another misconception about fishes is that because fishes have been on Earth for so many geologic ages, fishes must be primitive creatures who stopped evolving, while other vertebrates, especially mammals, continued evolving. Balcombe (p. 21) explains:All of the fish species that were living at the dawn of legs and lungs are long gone. … The descents of early fishes have been evolving eons longer than their terrestrial counterparts, and on these terms fishes are the most highly evolved of all vertebrates. You might be surprised to know that fishes have the genetic machinery to make fingers—something that shows how similar fishes are to modern mammals. They just don’t develop fingers, but fins instead, since fins are better for swimming than fingers are. Part II – What a Fish Perceives	Part II consists of three chapters – What a Fish Sees, What a Fish Hears, Smells and Tastes, and Navigation, Touch and Beyond - focusing on the senses fishes use to perceive the world around them. All of these abilities are keenly affected by the fact that fishes live in water. For instance, sound travels much faster in water than in air. Given this and other differences in perception, humans may have difficulty understanding how fishes perceive their worlds. What a Fish Sees Fishes’ eyes are much like human eyes, with three pairs of muscles which enable the eyes to swivel. However, fishes’ vision does differ from that of humans, the main difference being that humans have eyelids, while fishes do not. However, other differences also exist. For instance, some fishes, such as adult flounders, have both their eyes on the same side of their bodies. Also, in regard to sight, just as humans use camouflage to fool hostiles, fishes also use visual cues to fool predators. For example, comet fishes lure predators to attack their rear ends, instead of their more sensitive heads. Comet fishes are able to do this because their rear side looks like the face of a parrot fish. What a Fish Hears, Smells and TastesBefore looking at how fishes hear, Balcombe clears up the misconception that fishes are silent creatures. Some of the mechanisms fishes use to make sounds include vibrating their swim bladders, grating and grinding their teeth, rubbing together their bones and pushing bubbles out of their anuses. Indeed, some fishes are named for the sounds they make, for example, grunters, croakers, drums and trumpeters. 	Believing fishes to be silent led to the belief that they were also deaf. This was an easy mistake for human-centric scientists, because fishes have no external hearing devices. Balcombe describes the study by Nobel Prize winning scientist, Karl van Frisch, which demonstrated fishes’ ability to hear, in much the same way that Pavlov demonstrated classical conditioning with dogs. The study’s sole participant was a blind catfish. van Frisch put food on a stick into the fish’s home. Upon smelling the food, the fish would swim towards it. Next, the researcher started whistling before lowering the food for the fish. After a while, all the fish needed was to hear whistling and he would swim towards the usual location of the food. 	Fishes can hear, and they can hear an amazing range of sounds. The fishes in one study demonstrated the ability to categorise human music (Chase, 2011). Chase’s study involved three carps. A speaker was placed in their home, an apparatus for operant conditioning was set up and the fishes learned to discriminate between blues music and classical music, and to categorise newly introduced music as either blues or classical. Another study found that listening to classical music enhanced the health of a group of fishes (Papoutsoglou, Karakatsouli, Papoutsoglou, & Vasilikos, 2010). 	Fishes use their sense of smell for such purposes as identifying their location, locating food and mates and recognising danger. Unlike human nostrils, which function for both smelling and breathing, fish nostrils have only an olfactory function. In some cases, fishes’ olfactory capabilities far exceed those of humans. Balcombe provides examples (p. 50):Salmon can detect the smell of a seal or sea lion diluted to one eighty billionth of water volume … . the American eel … can detect the equivalent of less than one ten millionth of a drop of their home water in [an] Olympic pool. Like salmons, eels make long migrations back to specific spawn sites, and they follow a subtle gradient of scent to get there. 	As to taste, one outstanding aspect of fish anatomy is the presence of taste buds in widely different parts of the body, not just in their mouths. These other locations can include the lips, snout and fins. Also, just as groups of humans tend to have similar tastes in food, e.g., spicy foods are favoured by some cultures, so too are particular foods favoured by given fish species. However, just as is the case with humans, individual fishes may have their idiosyncratic food preferences.Navigation, Touch, and Beyond Fishes, not surprisingly, have superb navigational skills. They navigate by such means as feeling water turbulence caused by the presence of objects, sun compassing, dead reckoning, a natural GPS system, smell, vision and electroreception. How do schools of fishes swim together in unison? Balcombe explains (p. 59):[Fishes have] a row of specialized scales running horizontally along their flanks, forming what is called the lateral line. ... [Each scale ] is populated by neuromasts, clusters of sensory cells each with a hair-like project encased in a tiny cup of gel. … The lateral line acts as a sonarlike system and is especially useful at night and in murky waters.Some fishes seem to enjoy touching and being touched. Touching appears to play a part in courting, in relationships between cleanerfishes and their clients, and even as a form of interaction between fishes and human divers. For example, while the evidence here is anecdotal, Balcombe reports stories of sunbathing fishes and fishes who enjoy the stimulation of the bubbles from divers’ regulators. Part III – What a Fish Feels	Part III consists of two chapters - Pain, Consciousness, and Awareness, and From Stress to Joy. Advocates on behalf of animals are fond of the following quote from the 18th century philosopher, Jeremy Bentham: “The question is not, ‘Can they reason?’ nor, ‘Can they talk?’ but ‘Can they suffer?’”. The two chapters of Part III start with this question and then proceed to happier topics. Pain, Consciousness, and AwarenessNot surprisingly, Balcombe believes that fishes do feel pain. In the book’s previous pages, he made the case for fishes having the same senses and other basic structures as other vertebrates. In this chapter, he notes that fishes have A-delta and C fibres in their nerves; mammals use these fibres to experience pain (Braithwaite, 2010; Sneddon, 2003). However, fishes and other nonmammal vertebrates do not have a neocortex, the body part posited to be the centre of consciousness. Balcombe counters that birds do not have a neocortex either, yet scientists agree that birds have consciousness and can feel pain. Furthermore, fishes’ brains have the pallium which carries out some of the same functions as the neocortex. In additional rebuttal, Balcombe makes the analogy that just as humans can swim despite lacking the fins that fishes employ for that purpose, so too are fishes conscious despite lacking a neocortex. 	While Balcombe cautions that opinion may never be unanimous on the issue of fishes and pain, he quotes a document of the American Veterinary Medical Association to argue that a general consensus has developed among scientists who study fishes (AVMA, 2013):Suggestions that finfish [fish that are not shellfish] responses to pain merely represent simple reflexes have been refuted by studies demonstrating forebrain and midbrain electrical activity in response to stimulation and different with type of nociceptor stimulation. Learning and memory consolidation in trials where finfish are taught to avoid noxious stimuli have moved the issue of finfish cognition and sentience forward to the point where the preponderance of accumulated evidence supports the position that finfish should be accorded the same considerations as terrestrial vertebrates in regard to relief from pain. Balcombe summarises the chapter by stating (pp. 84-85):Fishes show the hallmarks of pain both physiologically and behaviourally. They possess the specialized nerve fibers that mammals and birds use to detect noxious stimuli. They can learn to avoid electric shocks and anglers’ hooks. They are cognitively impaired when subjected to nasty insults to their bodies, and this impairment can be reversed if they are provided with pain relief.From Stress to JoyWhile the first chapter in Part III focused on fishes feeling pain, the second chapter focuses on emotions, beginning with fear and stress but then traveling to happier emotions. Balcombe notes that, “Emotions involve relatively old brain circuits conserved through evolution and shared by all vertebrates” (p. 88). Something similar seems to be the case for hormones that link to emotions. For instance, humans produce the hormone oxytocin, which promotes bonding, and fishes appear to have a similar hormone (Reddon et al., 2012). As to pleasurable emotions, scientists have been witnessing fishes play since 1898 (Groos, 1898). Much more recently, Burghardt, Dinets and Murphy (2014) studied three bfishes apparently playing with a thermometer which had been designed to float vertically. Each of the three fishes had their own way of playing with the thermometer. The first fish pushed down on the top of the thermometer, while the second swam round and round the thermometer occasionally touching and thereby moving it, and the third fish was the most aggressive, hitting the object at various points, thereby making it move around the tank. Part IV – What a Fish Thinks	Part IV consists of two chapters – Fins, Scales and Intelligence, and Tools, Plans and Monkey Minds. Balcombe frames these topics by recognising that the intelligences which different creatures develop are guided by those creatures’ life circumstances. Furthermore, he quotes Dinets to warn against underestimating the cognitive capabilities of nonhuman animals (p. 105), “Every other animal currently considered stupid and boring has its own amazing secrets. It’s just that nobody has been able to discover them yet”. At the same time, Balcombe cautions that just because one fish species or one individual fish demonstrates a particular ability does not mean that all species or all members of a particular species possess or can develop that ability.Fins, Scales and IntelligenceIn what may be the most amazing story in the book, Balcombe describes the cognitive mapping abilities of gobies (White & Brown, 2015). Gobies find their food in small tide pools. However, being in these pools exposes gobies to such predators as octopuses and herons. To escape predation, gobies jump to other pools. But how do they know where these other pools are? Their cognitive mapping abilities guide them.To read the entire review: https://www.academia.edu/30147532/Rev..."

35,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"The highlight, for me, occurred early in the book when the author pointed out that because fish can be fooled by optical illusions, some amount of consciousness must exist. It had occurred to me before that you can't have an illusion without consciousness - you can't make someone mis-perceive something if there's noone home to misperceive it (which is, incidentally, part of my problem with Daniel C. Dennett's claim we don't really have consciousness). So that was a wonderful bit of cleverness for me - trying to determine consciousness by fooling the fish.Anyway, fish can be fooled by some of the same stuff we are! They can see the smaller of two circles as larger if there are extra nearby circles making their relative sizes seem different. They also 'finish' shapes in their mind, 'seeing' a triangle that's only hinted at.They also can distinguish musical genres! And he provides convincing evidence that fish feel pain (which, of course, for most of us, is ""duh,"" but science requries agnosticism without good evidence, and some other people are just apologists who reject it out of hand because it's inconvenient).They can tell humans apart. They can cooperate. They make referential gestures across species! Before people noticed moray eels pointing out prey for groupers, the only species known to do that were humans (and tangentially, dogs understanding those gestures), some other apes, and ravens! Of course, the book ends with a section about how humans are evil and we're all doomed because we're killing the planet. I don't deny it - I get it and think it's a critical message, but it came out of left field for me in this book. Still, even that part was interesting, if only for some of the forehead-slappingness of it. For instance - ignoring the morality, farmed fish helps make the industry more sustainable, right? Well, no. Guess what they mostly feed farm fishes? Fish. What's the worst species in an ecosystem to hunt? The apex predator, right? Guess what tuna and marlin and sharks are. Oops.I'm going off on tangents, like the book did at the end. But there's a lot of great, well-explained stuff in here."

38,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/324370-lisa,4,"Jonathan Balcombe is an advocate for fish—or, as he prefers, fishes: “individuals with personalities and relationships”—and makes a strong case for piscine perception in What a Fish Knows: The Inner Lives of Our Underwater Cousins (Farrar, Straus). Weaving together decades of scientific studies of fish consciousness, cognition, and social structure, ethologist Balcombe (author of the lovely The Exultant Ark) offers a picture of fish(es) as complex and sentient beings. Not only do they have acute senses of sight, hearing, and smell, they have the capacity to feel pleasure as well as pain, and some form hierarchical grooming cooperatives, hunt in interspecies packs, help raise nonbiological offspring while waiting their turn to fertilize eggs, or recognize each other after months apart. At times the recitation of “believe it or not” knowledge bites can feel like overreaching to make a point; at others Balcombe edges toward a decidedly unscientific whimsy—he never met a fish pun he didn’t like. But altogether, What a Fish Knows is lively and surprising, making a good argument for sport and food fishing reform.VERDICT: This may ruin readers’ fish dinners forever, but will appeal to fans of odd science and animal rights advocates alike.—My Library Journal review"
39,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2290905-jimmy,5,"Fish are friends. Not food.Very well spoken by some sharks in the beloved movie Finding Nemo. But just how true are those words, especially to us humans? There's plenty of fish out in the sea, and no amount of fishing could ever deplete the vast ocean of all its fish. Could it? The sad answer is yes.Fish are animals, and they have personalities and social lives and experience emotions just like us and any other animal. Balcombe makes the case in his fascinating book What a Fish Knows, and you may come away learning something new from reading this. Perhaps it's the fact that fish are in an entirely different environment separate from our own world that we don't think twice about the sport of fishing, aquaculture, or the delicious baked salmon on the dinner plate. But after reading this, I find myself just a little bit more attuned to the life of a fish.I'll never look at a fish in a tank the same way again. As we develop better technologies and ways to be sustainable, the fishing industry should certainly be on everyone's radar."
40,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2028832-kathleen,3,"I enjoyed the premise of this book, that fish are interesting, evolved animals just as much as many birds and mammals. We should consider as much when we discuss fishing and farming practices, which may involve a great degree of cruelty. Including many interesting facts, studies, and anecdotes, this is a good choice for the casual reader looking for a little natural science. It did not have quite as many photographs in the picture section as I might have liked, but I would look at pictures of fish all day, so that's fair. I suspect this author may be a secret vegan, and I certainly have no intention of not eating fish any time soon, but we can certainly all be more conscious consumers. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who does eat fish, or just wants to learn a little bit about the fascinating underwater world. "

Instead I got a book where the science is used to support the author's personal belief that we need to dramatically change our relationship with fish.And I am sympathetic to that worldview. I think the environmental and ethical issues are genuine and worth examining. But the preaching, which is undeniably the main point of this book, had the opposite effect on me. I questioned whether or not the science presented was genuine or misleading, because there was such an obvious agenda. It didn't help that there were many many places where the conclusions did not follow from the evidence presented. I wanted... a more intellectually honest book."

If they feel pain and if they are aware. Do they have fun? The author also discusses what a fish thinks and if they are intelligent and if they can use tools. The social contracts, co-operation and fish democracy involved in fishey lives, as well as the strange variety of breeding and parenting methods make for interesting reading. As the author says: ""fishes are individuals"", and he does a good job in showing why he thinks that. The book comes with a nice selection of colour photographs."

I thought, now that was something you don't see every day. In the back of my head that fish was still in my head a few weeks later I walked into the library to return a book and saw What A Fish Knows on a highlight shelf. Jonathan Balcombe's volume on the lives of fish is a captivating read, specially considering that the subjects are well fish. Luckily this book is a great dive in the myriad lives of different fishes throughout the world. And it's really about fish, you won't get a lot of talk about mollusks, crustaceans, whales, or other non fish things. It's packed with interesting facts about those denizens of the deep, but it's not just a dry volume of fish facts. There are dozens of charming stories and surprises in What A Fish Knows that I wouldn't have expected, I mean they are fish! There are parts where it boils down to ""no one knows why fish X thing happens."" Which just highlights how little people know about water bound life. It's a fun read until the last chapter that highlights the hellish fishing industries, which really, really, really bummed me out. Not that I was unaware of such things, but it was even harder to read about after learning that fish aren't just biological swimming automatons. The whole thing makes me really think about my tuna sandwiches. But where does that stop? Where is my sympathy towards the tomato pickers? What about the tons of garbage generated by the plastic industry, keeping in mind that the mustard in the fridge is in a plastic container? What's the bread I have really made from? I'm not here to have a crisis of consciousness about my lunch when all I wanted to do is say: every chapter in What a Fish knows can be its own book and the book is worth your time to read. I really liked it and I don't even like going to the aquarium (not from guilt, it just makes me feel oddly claustrophobic) plus finding the ocean just fucking terrifying if I think about it. While it does have some pictures it's not illustrated all the way, so I spent some time looking up various types of fishes that are featured in the book and I can't wait to see what my targeted ads are going to look like soon."
49,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83179136-catherine-puma,3,"Published in 2016, ""What a Fish Knows"" is a popular science nonfiction book that has been on my To Read list for a few years now. Jonathan Balcombe uses anecdotes, interviews, and studies he finds interesting to mention some of what humans have observed about the lives of our underwater cousins. While aquariums, household pets, and decorative koi ponds are also mentioned, most of the tales in this book are about wild examples from African cichlids, to Hawaiian cleaner wrasses, Atlantic goliath grouper, deep-sea lantern fish, and even some touches upon sharks and rays (my personal favorites). I do appreciate the way this is structured. Different parts are about what a fish perceives, feels, thinks, who a fish knows, and how a fish breeds. These parts are then further broken up into chapters on various senses and stimulii, intelligence and problem-solving, social contracts and interactions, and sexual and parenting activities.This book does not have to be read in order, so although a conversation-driven chapter book with a few photos or charts/diagrams/maps, readers can skip to the topics they find most interesting. However, although there are parts of this I really enjoyed and I did learn some interesting facts about different fish species, overall there is something off about the content's presentation. What's being said about fishes is important, but ethologist Balcombe's tone is nearly unbearably pretentious, self-righteous, self-centered, and judgmental. He scoffs at experts and makes fun of the scientific process. He is anti-fisheries and vehemently vegan, but doesn't have anything bad to say about decorative privately-owned aquariums or entertainment facilities like SeaWorld. He's entitled to his own opinions, but he spends too much time JUST being opinionated in this book. This would have been significantly improved if it stressed more on the end of explaining fish-facts. While reading this, I kept thinking about the other popular science nonfiction books about fishes that are so much BETTER than this one. Top choices that come to mind include: - Mark Kurlansky's ""Salmon"", - Sy Montgomery's ""The Soul of an Octopus"", - Paul Greenberg's ""Four Fish"", and - Danna Staaf's ""Squid Empire"". Overall, am I glad I read this? Sure, I guess. But I will be recommending many other books to people before I ever think of recommending this one. "
50,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16959053-seinka,5,"Wonderful, amazing. The writing is at times a little bit dry, but luckily the objects of the author's book are more than making up for that. Did you know that fishes like to be caressed, that some of them have taste buds all over their bodies (650.000 taste buds in total) so they can taste their whole environment (imagine that). Some fishes can split their eyes in 4 so that they can see what's happening above and under water, others can roll over their eyes to one side of the body. Did you know that some fish can change their gender during their lifetimes (hence, the cartoon Finding Nemo is inaccurate in the sense that after Nemo's mom died the father should have taken the female gender and fill in the role as mother), and that length does play a role for fish (they prefer longer over shorter, yes). Fishes take care of their eggs and babies. Some fishes carry their babies in their mouth during the whole pregnancy period, not allowing to eat for months. Some fishes have their penises between their eyes. Culture also plays a role among fishes, or actually many other animals, and fishes have feelings (sense of happiness, joy, sadness). There are many examples of fishes who help each other (one fish swam under the other fish because the one above could not swim well). In this day and age, unfortunately animal knowledge is linked with animal extinction, and the same goes for fishes. Industrialization has created big crates that scrape the bottoms of the oceans to fill our needs for omega 3 and in doing so generating a lot of collateral damage. Factories where fishes are being harvested for our food chain are living in despicable conditions, where some don't get to have food for 8 months simply because it generates more eggs. I probably said too much here, but this is merely a brief summary. The book contains many more marvels and facts about fishes and animals in general. In the worst it will give you some new information. In the best case it will change your world view. We are surrounded by beautiful sentient beings, not just by humans. And that realization on itself is already worth the read."
51,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61946844-amy,5,"What a Fish Knows is a systematic review of research supporting the hypothesis that fish - like our cousins, chimpanzees - are sentient. The book is sorted into sections (such as What a Fish Perceives, What a Fish Feels, Who a Fish Knows), each with chapters exploring a different aspect of the section (the section on Who a Fish Knows, for example, has chapters on cooperative hunting, social contracts, and peacekeeping behavior in intra-species and inter-species pairs/groups). I found the formatting of the chapters and sections to be very helpful and I like the emphasis on evidence-based conclusions. Though there is a liberal sprinkling of anecdotes throughout the book, they are clearly there for illustrative purposes only. The emphasis of each conclusion undoubtedly rests on the weight of the evidence that is cited in every chapter. The last chapter, Fish Out of Water, and the Epilogue are the only parts of the book that are a bit different. Though human actions in relation to fish are referenced throughout the book (and mostly in a research context), Fish Out of Water discusses the actions of humans in the context of fishing practices and the human consumption of sea life. While Balcombe takes pains to point out the already belabored but still important point that current fishing practices are unsustainable, the emphasis of the chapter is on how unethical human actions are in relation to what the reader has just learned about the sentience of fish. Quite frankly, it makes for a nauseating read, but it is a wake-up call that people should have. The epilogue focuses on the people and groups that are currently taking action to include fish in the widely accepted circle of moral concern. It is a very moving chapter that ends on a note of hope for people and for our underwater cousins. Overall, What a Fish Knows is an excellent book, and I would gladly recommend it. "
52,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2790863-allison,5,"I loved this book - and I learned so much. I love all animals and have an appreciation of how they are each individuals, with their own personalities. And while I have believed that fishes are sentient beings, I was not aware of their complexity. I loved the behavioral trial that took a certain type of fish 40 tries to solve it, primates 100 tries and a human child who didn't get it after 100 tries. Unfortunately, though, while the evidence posed in this book should get people to think again about the pain and suffering imposed on these animals, those who believe that all animals are there for us to eat because we're at the top of the food chain won't really care. People see the horrible treatment, pain and suffering on factory farms -- what cows, pigs, chickens and other animals that are used for human consumption are subjected to -- and they don't care. So whether or not they believe that fishes are sentient beings and feel pain, joy, compassion... certainly won't change their behavior. It is a sad, sad fact. However, for those who do care enough about the animals, but might think that it's okay to do this to fishes, because they don't really suffer anyway, well, this book should be a real eye-opener. Just to share a brief story. The last animal I stopped eating (30 years ago) was fish, because I too thought that fish were just above plant life. But one defining moment changed that for me. I was snorkeling for the first time in my life, and a school of beautiful fishes were below me, so I floated above them, trying to swim quietly so I could watch them. They all looked at me as they were swimming below me. It was amazing. I hope you enjoy this book. Whether or not you eat animals, you'll learn a lot. And if you call yourself a vegetarian but you eat fish, please stop. "
53,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40961426-gwen-vandendriessche,4,"Before starting to read this book, I didn’t think much of fishes. I never met that many fishes on my walks except for those who had been caught by birds (Herons, Kingfishers, Gannets, etc.) as food and that didn’t disturb me as I was happy for the birds. However, the sight of a trout looking blindly from my neighbour’s plate was enough to prevent me from eating anything and I had already been attached to a goldfish when I was young, so that was a good start for wanting to know more about them and reading Jonathan Balcombe’s book. At the first page, you understand that the author is really attached to the fishes he is talking about. He isn’t only teaching you facts, but sharing his wonder. This wonder is totally understandable for the lives of many fishes are amazingly complex. Here are a the three facts I was most amazed to learn: fishes can smell fear, some fishes lay their eggs on leaves out of the water and fire water on them to keep them moist, Nemo’s dad should have become a female after the death of his partner! As for many scientific books, I regret that much knowledge about living beings is brought by experiments which often appear really cruel to me. I’d rather not know what it is to be a fish than to know that some of them might have suffered to give me that knowledge (e.g.: injecting stuff in their eyes to know whether they use their sight to navigate!?!). Fortunaltely, only part of the book talks about these experiments.At the end of the book, the author also reminds us of the negative impact of farmed fishes on wildlife and of the disastrous slaughter of sharks and many other species for the food industry. The major part of the book just wants to amaze us, but I think those last pages are also very important to highlighten that the oceans are not endless and that we are making huges damages to their populations."
54,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43848794-samuel,4,"”And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.”‭Of the countless ideas the Bible is responsible for, ”dominion” has arguably been the worst. Instead of understanding life as vast systems of interconnected organisms, of which man is just one, man has made himself arbiter of all other living things. This has allowed us to overlook and diminish the life and intelligence of all other species. Our ignorance has allowed us to remain complacent as we destroy the oceans. Reading ’What A Fish Knows’ by Jonathan Balcombe is eye-opening, though some of it reads like trivia. Did you know that goldfish can recognize individual humans they haven’t seen in months? That tuna is more closely related to humans than they are to sharks? That a lot of fishes enjoy being petted? That they have personal friends and enemies? That cleaner fish do a better job if there are customers waiting their turn (and evaluating the services)? That different species of fish can communicate with one another to help eachother hunt for dinner? Etc etc. Why haven’t we bothered to find out till now? It seems that it may have something to do with facial muscles. Since fish can’t raise eye-brows or smile happily we have simply assumed they’re incognizant. ”What A Fish Knows” is packed with remarkable discoveries about fish. So much so that the last chapter about what we’re doing to destroy the ocean ecology is deeply disturbing. Many species of fish are indeed living in the end days. There’s an ocean apocalypse going on, and man is the destroyer of worlds."
55,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7709596-g-na,5,"Every once in awhile I am lucky enough to read a book that feels like it was written just for me, and this is one of those books. Here Balcombe takes a good look at the cognition and senses of fishes, with chapters on their consciousness, social lives, tool use, and more. Fishes have individual personalities and are much smarter than people realize, and that's something I have seen myself in the many hours I've spent underwater with them.Too many people think of fishes as primitive and unfeeling, and I know many think that fish cannot feel pain - they absolutely can, and studies have proved it! Yes, they live in an environment that is foreign to us, and they have no limbs or eyelids (unnecessary when your surroundings keep your eyes permanently moist), but they are still advanced vertebrates with complex and fully-functioning nervous systems. Because fishes are so different from us people seem to have no qualms about killing them, and the author has devoted a chapter to this sad fact. Today, commercial fisheries pull millions of tons (billions and billions of fish) out of the sea every year, which has resulted in the collapse of various fisheries, and populations of these fishes are dropping to the point where many species are nearing extinction.What a Fish Knows is well-researched and has over 30 pages of references, many of which are peer-reviewed journals. Balcomb did a good job of translating the scientific articles into everyday language for the layperson. This is a fantastic book."
56,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,3,"Early in the book, the author asks why we tend to relegate fishes ""... beyond the outer orbit of our moral concern?"" This obvious object of this book is to raise awareness of the more complex aspects of fish life, hopefully increasing our concern.Part 2 of the book starts by examining fishes in some detail, revealing some surprising facts such as the vast number of eggs some species produce (300 million for an Ocean Sunfish), but also providing a good overview of their vision (they see UV and so some fish body markings are only visible in the UV range), hearing, smelling, touch and navigation senses.Part 3 examines evidence that fish care for each other and play. The author even suggests that when fish jump it may sometimes be for sheer joy.Fish intelligence is the subject of part 4, where the ability of fishes to map their environment and to solve problems suggests at least some species have unexpected abilities.Part 5 looks at relationships and evidence that fish recognize their neighbours, and the possibility that they recognize specific humans. Groupers have been seen to use a headstand signal to indicate to partner moray eels the location of hidden prey. This is interpreted as planning and one group of researchers ""... concluded that the collaborative capabilities of groupers compare favorably with those of chimpanzees.""The complexities of fish sex and parenting are discussed in part 6.The unsustainable practices of fishing are examined in part 7. The book ends with a plea for greater compassion for fishes."
57,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34895792-stacie,3,"3.75 starsWell, now I know some cool stuff about fish. That was mostly interesting, I really enjoyed learning about the different observations and anecdotes throughout the book. I'm fascinated by animals, so any peak into their behavior is a cool experience for me. Though, I do think the writing in certain places became a tad dry and the author's humor was like a bad dad joke (which is why I can't bring myself to give this 4 stars). Also, I saw some other reviews saying the book came off as preachy. I don't know if I fully feel that way. However, full-disclosure, I've been plant-based for a few years so maybe I'm used to the whole animal rights spiel. That being said, from an animal rights/humane side of things, this book didn't really bring anything new to the table. I feel like Balcombe just watched a few documentaries on animal activism and summarized their points in the book's epilogue. But, all of that aside, feel what you want to about fish. I think that the facts and studies about the fish are the more interesting point to pay attention to in the book anyway.If you like marine bio or are interested in animal behavior, this seems like a good introduction to that genre."
58,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32960023-judith,5,"This book has almost (98%) persuaded me to give up eating fish; well, it and what I have read about mercury levels in fish and bits of plastic as well. Given the pollution of our oceans, fish are not a healthy food source; given Balcombe's examination of the intelligence, awareness/consciousness of fish, and the inhumanity of how we capture and kill them, we need to rethink how we ""harvest"" them (and we all should rethink how many children we should have--the projected increase in human population by 2030 is not sustainable at the western world's way of living). Balcombe uses a number of sources, scientific as well as some personal/individual experiences, to argue that fish have intelligence, some at least have exhibited compassion, they can communicate intra- and extra-species (the grouper/moray eel cooperation is astounding), they do feel pain, they can learn from experience (and some kinds of situations they do better than our young children).Readers who are serious about ecology, living lives more sustainably and in amity with other species (rather than recklessly and thoughtlessly exploitatively) should read this book."
59,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65519162-cathy-church,5,"This would be a surprise to anyone who has never even thought that a fish might actually experience pain, fear, avoidance, and much, much more. but the best part is how entertaining Jonathan Balcombe's writing is. This is not a scientific tome, but a refreshing overview of a myriad experiments. As an active scuba diver, I have often wondered just how much a fish really does know. I felt that they remembered me after repeated visits with the same behavior. And sure enough, even a year later, they remember. And Jonathan describes experiments with fish proving that they can even recognize individual human faces when wearing the same red hat when one feeds them and the other doesn't. The red hatted non feeder gets no reaction. The face of the red-hatted feeder sends them scurrying to the surface for food. That may seem minor, but humans certainly can not discern just the facial differences among fish who all look the same to us. There are many more, and better examples, of how cunning they are, how they work to trick others, or cheat others, or show remorse. It will hopefully help you to stop thinking that catch and release is OK. "

63,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105791880-george-jacobs,5,"Jonathan Balcombe, the author of this New York Times best-selling book, has worked for many years as an ethologist (a scientist who studies animal behaviour). He is director of animal sentience at the Humane Society Institute for Science and Policy. His website is www.jonathanbalcombe.com. His other books are The Exultant Art: A Pictorial Tour of Animal Pleasure, Second Nature: The Iinner Livers of Animals, Pleasurable Kingdom: Animals and the Nature of Feeling Good, and The Use of Aanimals in Higher Education: Problems, Alternatives, and Recommendations. 	This review attempts to give readers an understanding of the structure of the book and a sample of some the book’s main points. The review ends with some comments by the reviewer. The book consists of seven parts, some of which are divided into chapters. Balcombe dedicates the book to the “anonymous trillions” of fishes, and he hopes that after reading this book (or a summary thereof) that humans will appreciate that fishes are not objects or grains of sand, but that each of the trillions of fishes is an individual who thinks and feels. Referring to his hopes for each of the approximately 7.4 billion humans’ attitudes towards fishes, Balcombe quotes an anonymous poet, “Nothing has changed except my attitude—so everything has changed” (p. 8). The reviewer believes this book provides valuable resources which ecolinguists can use to change people’s attitudes towards finishes. Prologue	That quote was from the book’s prologue, which includes basic information on fishes and their plight. Balcombe contends that although many, many books have been written about fishes, his is the first book written on behalf of fishes. Other works that seem to be concerned about fishes, talking about endangered species and overexploitation of fish “stocks”, actually focus on fishes as commodities for human use. The lives of fishes, Balcombe believes, have value not primarily for what they offer humans. Instead, all fishes’ lives have value to each of those fishes and those in their communities. 	One estimate puts the number of land animals killed annually for food for humans at about 70 billion. How many fishes are killed each year to feed humans? Balcombe uses an estimate, based on FAO data, that 1 trillion to 2.7 trillion fishes are killed by humans each year. (For other stats, please visit http://www.fishcount.org.uk.) These fishes die mostly from a combination of asphyxiation (when they are taken out of the water), decompression (due to pressure change as they are brought out of the water, being crushed under the weight of the fishes and other marine animals caught with them in the same net and being slaughtered.Part 1 – The Misunderstood Fish	Fishes are an extremely diverse collection of animals, accounting for 33,249 species, 60% of all the known vertebrates, with many more fish species likely yet to be discovered. The two main types of fishes are bony fishes (the largest group), including eels, salmons, basses, goldfishes and carps, and cartilaginous fishes, including sharks and rays. Fishes have been on the Earth much longer than humans: “[Fishes] had graced planet Earth fifty times longer than we have before they even left the water” (p. 13). As to the criticism that fishes’ small brains mean that they must not be able to think or feel, Balcombe counters with the point that miniaturisation allows small objects to function as well as larger ones.		Another misconception about fishes is that because fishes have been on Earth for so many geologic ages, fishes must be primitive creatures who stopped evolving, while other vertebrates, especially mammals, continued evolving. Balcombe (p. 21) explains:All of the fish species that were living at the dawn of legs and lungs are long gone. … The descents of early fishes have been evolving eons longer than their terrestrial counterparts, and on these terms fishes are the most highly evolved of all vertebrates. You might be surprised to know that fishes have the genetic machinery to make fingers—something that shows how similar fishes are to modern mammals. They just don’t develop fingers, but fins instead, since fins are better for swimming than fingers are. Part II – What a Fish Perceives	Part II consists of three chapters – What a Fish Sees, What a Fish Hears, Smells and Tastes, and Navigation, Touch and Beyond - focusing on the senses fishes use to perceive the world around them. All of these abilities are keenly affected by the fact that fishes live in water. For instance, sound travels much faster in water than in air. Given this and other differences in perception, humans may have difficulty understanding how fishes perceive their worlds. What a Fish Sees Fishes’ eyes are much like human eyes, with three pairs of muscles which enable the eyes to swivel. However, fishes’ vision does differ from that of humans, the main difference being that humans have eyelids, while fishes do not. However, other differences also exist. For instance, some fishes, such as adult flounders, have both their eyes on the same side of their bodies. Also, in regard to sight, just as humans use camouflage to fool hostiles, fishes also use visual cues to fool predators. For example, comet fishes lure predators to attack their rear ends, instead of their more sensitive heads. Comet fishes are able to do this because their rear side looks like the face of a parrot fish. What a Fish Hears, Smells and TastesBefore looking at how fishes hear, Balcombe clears up the misconception that fishes are silent creatures. Some of the mechanisms fishes use to make sounds include vibrating their swim bladders, grating and grinding their teeth, rubbing together their bones and pushing bubbles out of their anuses. Indeed, some fishes are named for the sounds they make, for example, grunters, croakers, drums and trumpeters. 	Believing fishes to be silent led to the belief that they were also deaf. This was an easy mistake for human-centric scientists, because fishes have no external hearing devices. Balcombe describes the study by Nobel Prize winning scientist, Karl van Frisch, which demonstrated fishes’ ability to hear, in much the same way that Pavlov demonstrated classical conditioning with dogs. The study’s sole participant was a blind catfish. van Frisch put food on a stick into the fish’s home. Upon smelling the food, the fish would swim towards it. Next, the researcher started whistling before lowering the food for the fish. After a while, all the fish needed was to hear whistling and he would swim towards the usual location of the food. 	Fishes can hear, and they can hear an amazing range of sounds. The fishes in one study demonstrated the ability to categorise human music (Chase, 2011). Chase’s study involved three carps. A speaker was placed in their home, an apparatus for operant conditioning was set up and the fishes learned to discriminate between blues music and classical music, and to categorise newly introduced music as either blues or classical. Another study found that listening to classical music enhanced the health of a group of fishes (Papoutsoglou, Karakatsouli, Papoutsoglou, & Vasilikos, 2010). 	Fishes use their sense of smell for such purposes as identifying their location, locating food and mates and recognising danger. Unlike human nostrils, which function for both smelling and breathing, fish nostrils have only an olfactory function. In some cases, fishes’ olfactory capabilities far exceed those of humans. Balcombe provides examples (p. 50):Salmon can detect the smell of a seal or sea lion diluted to one eighty billionth of water volume … . the American eel … can detect the equivalent of less than one ten millionth of a drop of their home water in [an] Olympic pool. Like salmons, eels make long migrations back to specific spawn sites, and they follow a subtle gradient of scent to get there. 	As to taste, one outstanding aspect of fish anatomy is the presence of taste buds in widely different parts of the body, not just in their mouths. These other locations can include the lips, snout and fins. Also, just as groups of humans tend to have similar tastes in food, e.g., spicy foods are favoured by some cultures, so too are particular foods favoured by given fish species. However, just as is the case with humans, individual fishes may have their idiosyncratic food preferences.Navigation, Touch, and Beyond Fishes, not surprisingly, have superb navigational skills. They navigate by such means as feeling water turbulence caused by the presence of objects, sun compassing, dead reckoning, a natural GPS system, smell, vision and electroreception. How do schools of fishes swim together in unison? Balcombe explains (p. 59):[Fishes have] a row of specialized scales running horizontally along their flanks, forming what is called the lateral line. ... [Each scale ] is populated by neuromasts, clusters of sensory cells each with a hair-like project encased in a tiny cup of gel. … The lateral line acts as a sonarlike system and is especially useful at night and in murky waters.Some fishes seem to enjoy touching and being touched. Touching appears to play a part in courting, in relationships between cleanerfishes and their clients, and even as a form of interaction between fishes and human divers. For example, while the evidence here is anecdotal, Balcombe reports stories of sunbathing fishes and fishes who enjoy the stimulation of the bubbles from divers’ regulators. Part III – What a Fish Feels	Part III consists of two chapters - Pain, Consciousness, and Awareness, and From Stress to Joy. Advocates on behalf of animals are fond of the following quote from the 18th century philosopher, Jeremy Bentham: “The question is not, ‘Can they reason?’ nor, ‘Can they talk?’ but ‘Can they suffer?’”. The two chapters of Part III start with this question and then proceed to happier topics. Pain, Consciousness, and AwarenessNot surprisingly, Balcombe believes that fishes do feel pain. In the book’s previous pages, he made the case for fishes having the same senses and other basic structures as other vertebrates. In this chapter, he notes that fishes have A-delta and C fibres in their nerves; mammals use these fibres to experience pain (Braithwaite, 2010; Sneddon, 2003). However, fishes and other nonmammal vertebrates do not have a neocortex, the body part posited to be the centre of consciousness. Balcombe counters that birds do not have a neocortex either, yet scientists agree that birds have consciousness and can feel pain. Furthermore, fishes’ brains have the pallium which carries out some of the same functions as the neocortex. In additional rebuttal, Balcombe makes the analogy that just as humans can swim despite lacking the fins that fishes employ for that purpose, so too are fishes conscious despite lacking a neocortex. 	While Balcombe cautions that opinion may never be unanimous on the issue of fishes and pain, he quotes a document of the American Veterinary Medical Association to argue that a general consensus has developed among scientists who study fishes (AVMA, 2013):Suggestions that finfish [fish that are not shellfish] responses to pain merely represent simple reflexes have been refuted by studies demonstrating forebrain and midbrain electrical activity in response to stimulation and different with type of nociceptor stimulation. Learning and memory consolidation in trials where finfish are taught to avoid noxious stimuli have moved the issue of finfish cognition and sentience forward to the point where the preponderance of accumulated evidence supports the position that finfish should be accorded the same considerations as terrestrial vertebrates in regard to relief from pain. Balcombe summarises the chapter by stating (pp. 84-85):Fishes show the hallmarks of pain both physiologically and behaviourally. They possess the specialized nerve fibers that mammals and birds use to detect noxious stimuli. They can learn to avoid electric shocks and anglers’ hooks. They are cognitively impaired when subjected to nasty insults to their bodies, and this impairment can be reversed if they are provided with pain relief.From Stress to JoyWhile the first chapter in Part III focused on fishes feeling pain, the second chapter focuses on emotions, beginning with fear and stress but then traveling to happier emotions. Balcombe notes that, “Emotions involve relatively old brain circuits conserved through evolution and shared by all vertebrates” (p. 88). Something similar seems to be the case for hormones that link to emotions. For instance, humans produce the hormone oxytocin, which promotes bonding, and fishes appear to have a similar hormone (Reddon et al., 2012). As to pleasurable emotions, scientists have been witnessing fishes play since 1898 (Groos, 1898). Much more recently, Burghardt, Dinets and Murphy (2014) studied three bfishes apparently playing with a thermometer which had been designed to float vertically. Each of the three fishes had their own way of playing with the thermometer. The first fish pushed down on the top of the thermometer, while the second swam round and round the thermometer occasionally touching and thereby moving it, and the third fish was the most aggressive, hitting the object at various points, thereby making it move around the tank. Part IV – What a Fish Thinks	Part IV consists of two chapters – Fins, Scales and Intelligence, and Tools, Plans and Monkey Minds. Balcombe frames these topics by recognising that the intelligences which different creatures develop are guided by those creatures’ life circumstances. Furthermore, he quotes Dinets to warn against underestimating the cognitive capabilities of nonhuman animals (p. 105), “Every other animal currently considered stupid and boring has its own amazing secrets. It’s just that nobody has been able to discover them yet”. At the same time, Balcombe cautions that just because one fish species or one individual fish demonstrates a particular ability does not mean that all species or all members of a particular species possess or can develop that ability.Fins, Scales and IntelligenceIn what may be the most amazing story in the book, Balcombe describes the cognitive mapping abilities of gobies (White & Brown, 2015). Gobies find their food in small tide pools. However, being in these pools exposes gobies to such predators as octopuses and herons. To escape predation, gobies jump to other pools. But how do they know where these other pools are? Their cognitive mapping abilities guide them.To read the entire review: https://www.academia.edu/30147532/Rev..."

65,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"The highlight, for me, occurred early in the book when the author pointed out that because fish can be fooled by optical illusions, some amount of consciousness must exist. It had occurred to me before that you can't have an illusion without consciousness - you can't make someone mis-perceive something if there's noone home to misperceive it (which is, incidentally, part of my problem with Daniel C. Dennett's claim we don't really have consciousness). So that was a wonderful bit of cleverness for me - trying to determine consciousness by fooling the fish.Anyway, fish can be fooled by some of the same stuff we are! They can see the smaller of two circles as larger if there are extra nearby circles making their relative sizes seem different. They also 'finish' shapes in their mind, 'seeing' a triangle that's only hinted at.They also can distinguish musical genres! And he provides convincing evidence that fish feel pain (which, of course, for most of us, is ""duh,"" but science requries agnosticism without good evidence, and some other people are just apologists who reject it out of hand because it's inconvenient).They can tell humans apart. They can cooperate. They make referential gestures across species! Before people noticed moray eels pointing out prey for groupers, the only species known to do that were humans (and tangentially, dogs understanding those gestures), some other apes, and ravens! Of course, the book ends with a section about how humans are evil and we're all doomed because we're killing the planet. I don't deny it - I get it and think it's a critical message, but it came out of left field for me in this book. Still, even that part was interesting, if only for some of the forehead-slappingness of it. For instance - ignoring the morality, farmed fish helps make the industry more sustainable, right? Well, no. Guess what they mostly feed farm fishes? Fish. What's the worst species in an ecosystem to hunt? The apex predator, right? Guess what tuna and marlin and sharks are. Oops.I'm going off on tangents, like the book did at the end. But there's a lot of great, well-explained stuff in here."

Please note the assignment of ONE star to this... umm... publication. I HAD to give it a star to review it. It actually deserves ZERO stars. I guess I could give it one star for the apparent effort it took to pull together the information the author so brutally misused in the text. But then I realized how easy it is for an unpaid intern to do that job with any reasonable search engine. So... ZERO STARS!The Book can best be described as ""one dry fact stated and (mis)interpreted followed by another dry fact stated and anthropomorphized."" Repeat. Repeat. YAWN Repeat.This book epitomizes the very worst of science writing. Mary Roach would be appalled at the lack of rigor. She would cringe at the author's worse-than-lame attempts at humour. Journal articles laying out the base-pair sequence of some obscure gene are no less boring.Apart from being a waste of ink and causing the senseless death of many trees, this book provides any untrained and/or naive reader with a totally warped view of mainstream research into the physiology, ecology, evolution and ethology of fishes. If you read it and take the information to your next cocktail party as grist for the banter mill, you will be guilty of crimes against fish and crimes against science.Budding authors... pay heed... if you want to learn how NOT to write popularized science, read this book.

68,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/324370-lisa,4,"Jonathan Balcombe is an advocate for fish—or, as he prefers, fishes: “individuals with personalities and relationships”—and makes a strong case for piscine perception in What a Fish Knows: The Inner Lives of Our Underwater Cousins (Farrar, Straus). Weaving together decades of scientific studies of fish consciousness, cognition, and social structure, ethologist Balcombe (author of the lovely The Exultant Ark) offers a picture of fish(es) as complex and sentient beings. Not only do they have acute senses of sight, hearing, and smell, they have the capacity to feel pleasure as well as pain, and some form hierarchical grooming cooperatives, hunt in interspecies packs, help raise nonbiological offspring while waiting their turn to fertilize eggs, or recognize each other after months apart. At times the recitation of “believe it or not” knowledge bites can feel like overreaching to make a point; at others Balcombe edges toward a decidedly unscientific whimsy—he never met a fish pun he didn’t like. But altogether, What a Fish Knows is lively and surprising, making a good argument for sport and food fishing reform.VERDICT: This may ruin readers’ fish dinners forever, but will appeal to fans of odd science and animal rights advocates alike.—My Library Journal review"
69,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2290905-jimmy,5,"Fish are friends. Not food.Very well spoken by some sharks in the beloved movie Finding Nemo. But just how true are those words, especially to us humans? There's plenty of fish out in the sea, and no amount of fishing could ever deplete the vast ocean of all its fish. Could it? The sad answer is yes.Fish are animals, and they have personalities and social lives and experience emotions just like us and any other animal. Balcombe makes the case in his fascinating book What a Fish Knows, and you may come away learning something new from reading this. Perhaps it's the fact that fish are in an entirely different environment separate from our own world that we don't think twice about the sport of fishing, aquaculture, or the delicious baked salmon on the dinner plate. But after reading this, I find myself just a little bit more attuned to the life of a fish.I'll never look at a fish in a tank the same way again. As we develop better technologies and ways to be sustainable, the fishing industry should certainly be on everyone's radar."
70,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2028832-kathleen,3,"I enjoyed the premise of this book, that fish are interesting, evolved animals just as much as many birds and mammals. We should consider as much when we discuss fishing and farming practices, which may involve a great degree of cruelty. Including many interesting facts, studies, and anecdotes, this is a good choice for the casual reader looking for a little natural science. It did not have quite as many photographs in the picture section as I might have liked, but I would look at pictures of fish all day, so that's fair. I suspect this author may be a secret vegan, and I certainly have no intention of not eating fish any time soon, but we can certainly all be more conscious consumers. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who does eat fish, or just wants to learn a little bit about the fascinating underwater world. "

Instead I got a book where the science is used to support the author's personal belief that we need to dramatically change our relationship with fish.And I am sympathetic to that worldview. I think the environmental and ethical issues are genuine and worth examining. But the preaching, which is undeniably the main point of this book, had the opposite effect on me. I questioned whether or not the science presented was genuine or misleading, because there was such an obvious agenda. It didn't help that there were many many places where the conclusions did not follow from the evidence presented. I wanted... a more intellectually honest book."

If they feel pain and if they are aware. Do they have fun? The author also discusses what a fish thinks and if they are intelligent and if they can use tools. The social contracts, co-operation and fish democracy involved in fishey lives, as well as the strange variety of breeding and parenting methods make for interesting reading. As the author says: ""fishes are individuals"", and he does a good job in showing why he thinks that. The book comes with a nice selection of colour photographs."
73,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309689-lara,4,"Very interesting look at how we tend to view fish and how maybe we should change our perspective. The parts towards the end about fishing were pretty horrifying to me, especially after all the indications that fish are individual creatures with individual lives and intelligence and personalities and that definitely feel pain, and it made me very thankful that I became a vegetarian years ago. If I hadn't, this book might have put me over the edge. "
74,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4152463-s,2,"To the good: I liked the description of many facets of fishes lives, behaviors, and putative experiences. To the bad: The language is sometimes a little clunky, and Balcombe doesn't disguise his agenda, which is to convince you to empathize more with fish.

I thought, now that was something you don't see every day. In the back of my head that fish was still in my head a few weeks later I walked into the library to return a book and saw What A Fish Knows on a highlight shelf. Jonathan Balcombe's volume on the lives of fish is a captivating read, specially considering that the subjects are well fish. Luckily this book is a great dive in the myriad lives of different fishes throughout the world. And it's really about fish, you won't get a lot of talk about mollusks, crustaceans, whales, or other non fish things. It's packed with interesting facts about those denizens of the deep, but it's not just a dry volume of fish facts. There are dozens of charming stories and surprises in What A Fish Knows that I wouldn't have expected, I mean they are fish! There are parts where it boils down to ""no one knows why fish X thing happens."" Which just highlights how little people know about water bound life. It's a fun read until the last chapter that highlights the hellish fishing industries, which really, really, really bummed me out. Not that I was unaware of such things, but it was even harder to read about after learning that fish aren't just biological swimming automatons. The whole thing makes me really think about my tuna sandwiches. But where does that stop? Where is my sympathy towards the tomato pickers? What about the tons of garbage generated by the plastic industry, keeping in mind that the mustard in the fridge is in a plastic container? What's the bread I have really made from? I'm not here to have a crisis of consciousness about my lunch when all I wanted to do is say: every chapter in What a Fish knows can be its own book and the book is worth your time to read. I really liked it and I don't even like going to the aquarium (not from guilt, it just makes me feel oddly claustrophobic) plus finding the ocean just fucking terrifying if I think about it. While it does have some pictures it's not illustrated all the way, so I spent some time looking up various types of fishes that are featured in the book and I can't wait to see what my targeted ads are going to look like soon."
79,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83179136-catherine-puma,3,"Published in 2016, ""What a Fish Knows"" is a popular science nonfiction book that has been on my To Read list for a few years now. Jonathan Balcombe uses anecdotes, interviews, and studies he finds interesting to mention some of what humans have observed about the lives of our underwater cousins. While aquariums, household pets, and decorative koi ponds are also mentioned, most of the tales in this book are about wild examples from African cichlids, to Hawaiian cleaner wrasses, Atlantic goliath grouper, deep-sea lantern fish, and even some touches upon sharks and rays (my personal favorites). I do appreciate the way this is structured. Different parts are about what a fish perceives, feels, thinks, who a fish knows, and how a fish breeds. These parts are then further broken up into chapters on various senses and stimulii, intelligence and problem-solving, social contracts and interactions, and sexual and parenting activities.This book does not have to be read in order, so although a conversation-driven chapter book with a few photos or charts/diagrams/maps, readers can skip to the topics they find most interesting. However, although there are parts of this I really enjoyed and I did learn some interesting facts about different fish species, overall there is something off about the content's presentation. What's being said about fishes is important, but ethologist Balcombe's tone is nearly unbearably pretentious, self-righteous, self-centered, and judgmental. He scoffs at experts and makes fun of the scientific process. He is anti-fisheries and vehemently vegan, but doesn't have anything bad to say about decorative privately-owned aquariums or entertainment facilities like SeaWorld. He's entitled to his own opinions, but he spends too much time JUST being opinionated in this book. This would have been significantly improved if it stressed more on the end of explaining fish-facts. While reading this, I kept thinking about the other popular science nonfiction books about fishes that are so much BETTER than this one. Top choices that come to mind include: - Mark Kurlansky's ""Salmon"", - Sy Montgomery's ""The Soul of an Octopus"", - Paul Greenberg's ""Four Fish"", and - Danna Staaf's ""Squid Empire"". Overall, am I glad I read this? Sure, I guess. But I will be recommending many other books to people before I ever think of recommending this one. "
80,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16959053-seinka,5,"Wonderful, amazing. The writing is at times a little bit dry, but luckily the objects of the author's book are more than making up for that. Did you know that fishes like to be caressed, that some of them have taste buds all over their bodies (650.000 taste buds in total) so they can taste their whole environment (imagine that). Some fishes can split their eyes in 4 so that they can see what's happening above and under water, others can roll over their eyes to one side of the body. Did you know that some fish can change their gender during their lifetimes (hence, the cartoon Finding Nemo is inaccurate in the sense that after Nemo's mom died the father should have taken the female gender and fill in the role as mother), and that length does play a role for fish (they prefer longer over shorter, yes). Fishes take care of their eggs and babies. Some fishes carry their babies in their mouth during the whole pregnancy period, not allowing to eat for months. Some fishes have their penises between their eyes. Culture also plays a role among fishes, or actually many other animals, and fishes have feelings (sense of happiness, joy, sadness). There are many examples of fishes who help each other (one fish swam under the other fish because the one above could not swim well). In this day and age, unfortunately animal knowledge is linked with animal extinction, and the same goes for fishes. Industrialization has created big crates that scrape the bottoms of the oceans to fill our needs for omega 3 and in doing so generating a lot of collateral damage. Factories where fishes are being harvested for our food chain are living in despicable conditions, where some don't get to have food for 8 months simply because it generates more eggs. I probably said too much here, but this is merely a brief summary. The book contains many more marvels and facts about fishes and animals in general. In the worst it will give you some new information. In the best case it will change your world view. We are surrounded by beautiful sentient beings, not just by humans. And that realization on itself is already worth the read."
81,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61946844-amy,5,"What a Fish Knows is a systematic review of research supporting the hypothesis that fish - like our cousins, chimpanzees - are sentient. The book is sorted into sections (such as What a Fish Perceives, What a Fish Feels, Who a Fish Knows), each with chapters exploring a different aspect of the section (the section on Who a Fish Knows, for example, has chapters on cooperative hunting, social contracts, and peacekeeping behavior in intra-species and inter-species pairs/groups). I found the formatting of the chapters and sections to be very helpful and I like the emphasis on evidence-based conclusions. Though there is a liberal sprinkling of anecdotes throughout the book, they are clearly there for illustrative purposes only. The emphasis of each conclusion undoubtedly rests on the weight of the evidence that is cited in every chapter. The last chapter, Fish Out of Water, and the Epilogue are the only parts of the book that are a bit different. Though human actions in relation to fish are referenced throughout the book (and mostly in a research context), Fish Out of Water discusses the actions of humans in the context of fishing practices and the human consumption of sea life. While Balcombe takes pains to point out the already belabored but still important point that current fishing practices are unsustainable, the emphasis of the chapter is on how unethical human actions are in relation to what the reader has just learned about the sentience of fish. Quite frankly, it makes for a nauseating read, but it is a wake-up call that people should have. The epilogue focuses on the people and groups that are currently taking action to include fish in the widely accepted circle of moral concern. It is a very moving chapter that ends on a note of hope for people and for our underwater cousins. Overall, What a Fish Knows is an excellent book, and I would gladly recommend it. "
82,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2790863-allison,5,"I loved this book - and I learned so much. I love all animals and have an appreciation of how they are each individuals, with their own personalities. And while I have believed that fishes are sentient beings, I was not aware of their complexity. I loved the behavioral trial that took a certain type of fish 40 tries to solve it, primates 100 tries and a human child who didn't get it after 100 tries. Unfortunately, though, while the evidence posed in this book should get people to think again about the pain and suffering imposed on these animals, those who believe that all animals are there for us to eat because we're at the top of the food chain won't really care. People see the horrible treatment, pain and suffering on factory farms -- what cows, pigs, chickens and other animals that are used for human consumption are subjected to -- and they don't care. So whether or not they believe that fishes are sentient beings and feel pain, joy, compassion... certainly won't change their behavior. It is a sad, sad fact. However, for those who do care enough about the animals, but might think that it's okay to do this to fishes, because they don't really suffer anyway, well, this book should be a real eye-opener. Just to share a brief story. The last animal I stopped eating (30 years ago) was fish, because I too thought that fish were just above plant life. But one defining moment changed that for me. I was snorkeling for the first time in my life, and a school of beautiful fishes were below me, so I floated above them, trying to swim quietly so I could watch them. They all looked at me as they were swimming below me. It was amazing. I hope you enjoy this book. Whether or not you eat animals, you'll learn a lot. And if you call yourself a vegetarian but you eat fish, please stop. "
83,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40961426-gwen-vandendriessche,4,"Before starting to read this book, I didn’t think much of fishes. I never met that many fishes on my walks except for those who had been caught by birds (Herons, Kingfishers, Gannets, etc.) as food and that didn’t disturb me as I was happy for the birds. However, the sight of a trout looking blindly from my neighbour’s plate was enough to prevent me from eating anything and I had already been attached to a goldfish when I was young, so that was a good start for wanting to know more about them and reading Jonathan Balcombe’s book. At the first page, you understand that the author is really attached to the fishes he is talking about. He isn’t only teaching you facts, but sharing his wonder. This wonder is totally understandable for the lives of many fishes are amazingly complex. Here are a the three facts I was most amazed to learn: fishes can smell fear, some fishes lay their eggs on leaves out of the water and fire water on them to keep them moist, Nemo’s dad should have become a female after the death of his partner! As for many scientific books, I regret that much knowledge about living beings is brought by experiments which often appear really cruel to me. I’d rather not know what it is to be a fish than to know that some of them might have suffered to give me that knowledge (e.g.: injecting stuff in their eyes to know whether they use their sight to navigate!?!). Fortunaltely, only part of the book talks about these experiments.At the end of the book, the author also reminds us of the negative impact of farmed fishes on wildlife and of the disastrous slaughter of sharks and many other species for the food industry. The major part of the book just wants to amaze us, but I think those last pages are also very important to highlighten that the oceans are not endless and that we are making huges damages to their populations."
84,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43848794-samuel,4,"”And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.”‭Of the countless ideas the Bible is responsible for, ”dominion” has arguably been the worst. Instead of understanding life as vast systems of interconnected organisms, of which man is just one, man has made himself arbiter of all other living things. This has allowed us to overlook and diminish the life and intelligence of all other species. Our ignorance has allowed us to remain complacent as we destroy the oceans. Reading ’What A Fish Knows’ by Jonathan Balcombe is eye-opening, though some of it reads like trivia. Did you know that goldfish can recognize individual humans they haven’t seen in months? That tuna is more closely related to humans than they are to sharks? That a lot of fishes enjoy being petted? That they have personal friends and enemies? That cleaner fish do a better job if there are customers waiting their turn (and evaluating the services)? That different species of fish can communicate with one another to help eachother hunt for dinner? Etc etc. Why haven’t we bothered to find out till now? It seems that it may have something to do with facial muscles. Since fish can’t raise eye-brows or smile happily we have simply assumed they’re incognizant. ”What A Fish Knows” is packed with remarkable discoveries about fish. So much so that the last chapter about what we’re doing to destroy the ocean ecology is deeply disturbing. Many species of fish are indeed living in the end days. There’s an ocean apocalypse going on, and man is the destroyer of worlds."
85,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7709596-g-na,5,"Every once in awhile I am lucky enough to read a book that feels like it was written just for me, and this is one of those books. Here Balcombe takes a good look at the cognition and senses of fishes, with chapters on their consciousness, social lives, tool use, and more. Fishes have individual personalities and are much smarter than people realize, and that's something I have seen myself in the many hours I've spent underwater with them.Too many people think of fishes as primitive and unfeeling, and I know many think that fish cannot feel pain - they absolutely can, and studies have proved it! Yes, they live in an environment that is foreign to us, and they have no limbs or eyelids (unnecessary when your surroundings keep your eyes permanently moist), but they are still advanced vertebrates with complex and fully-functioning nervous systems. Because fishes are so different from us people seem to have no qualms about killing them, and the author has devoted a chapter to this sad fact. Today, commercial fisheries pull millions of tons (billions and billions of fish) out of the sea every year, which has resulted in the collapse of various fisheries, and populations of these fishes are dropping to the point where many species are nearing extinction.What a Fish Knows is well-researched and has over 30 pages of references, many of which are peer-reviewed journals. Balcomb did a good job of translating the scientific articles into everyday language for the layperson. This is a fantastic book."
86,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,3,"Early in the book, the author asks why we tend to relegate fishes ""... beyond the outer orbit of our moral concern?"" This obvious object of this book is to raise awareness of the more complex aspects of fish life, hopefully increasing our concern.Part 2 of the book starts by examining fishes in some detail, revealing some surprising facts such as the vast number of eggs some species produce (300 million for an Ocean Sunfish), but also providing a good overview of their vision (they see UV and so some fish body markings are only visible in the UV range), hearing, smelling, touch and navigation senses.Part 3 examines evidence that fish care for each other and play. The author even suggests that when fish jump it may sometimes be for sheer joy.Fish intelligence is the subject of part 4, where the ability of fishes to map their environment and to solve problems suggests at least some species have unexpected abilities.Part 5 looks at relationships and evidence that fish recognize their neighbours, and the possibility that they recognize specific humans. Groupers have been seen to use a headstand signal to indicate to partner moray eels the location of hidden prey. This is interpreted as planning and one group of researchers ""... concluded that the collaborative capabilities of groupers compare favorably with those of chimpanzees.""The complexities of fish sex and parenting are discussed in part 6.The unsustainable practices of fishing are examined in part 7. The book ends with a plea for greater compassion for fishes."
87,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34895792-stacie,3,"3.75 starsWell, now I know some cool stuff about fish. That was mostly interesting, I really enjoyed learning about the different observations and anecdotes throughout the book. I'm fascinated by animals, so any peak into their behavior is a cool experience for me. Though, I do think the writing in certain places became a tad dry and the author's humor was like a bad dad joke (which is why I can't bring myself to give this 4 stars). Also, I saw some other reviews saying the book came off as preachy. I don't know if I fully feel that way. However, full-disclosure, I've been plant-based for a few years so maybe I'm used to the whole animal rights spiel. That being said, from an animal rights/humane side of things, this book didn't really bring anything new to the table. I feel like Balcombe just watched a few documentaries on animal activism and summarized their points in the book's epilogue. But, all of that aside, feel what you want to about fish. I think that the facts and studies about the fish are the more interesting point to pay attention to in the book anyway.If you like marine bio or are interested in animal behavior, this seems like a good introduction to that genre."
88,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32960023-judith,5,"This book has almost (98%) persuaded me to give up eating fish; well, it and what I have read about mercury levels in fish and bits of plastic as well. Given the pollution of our oceans, fish are not a healthy food source; given Balcombe's examination of the intelligence, awareness/consciousness of fish, and the inhumanity of how we capture and kill them, we need to rethink how we ""harvest"" them (and we all should rethink how many children we should have--the projected increase in human population by 2030 is not sustainable at the western world's way of living). Balcombe uses a number of sources, scientific as well as some personal/individual experiences, to argue that fish have intelligence, some at least have exhibited compassion, they can communicate intra- and extra-species (the grouper/moray eel cooperation is astounding), they do feel pain, they can learn from experience (and some kinds of situations they do better than our young children).Readers who are serious about ecology, living lives more sustainably and in amity with other species (rather than recklessly and thoughtlessly exploitatively) should read this book."
89,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65519162-cathy-church,5,"This would be a surprise to anyone who has never even thought that a fish might actually experience pain, fear, avoidance, and much, much more. but the best part is how entertaining Jonathan Balcombe's writing is. This is not a scientific tome, but a refreshing overview of a myriad experiments. As an active scuba diver, I have often wondered just how much a fish really does know. I felt that they remembered me after repeated visits with the same behavior. And sure enough, even a year later, they remember. And Jonathan describes experiments with fish proving that they can even recognize individual human faces when wearing the same red hat when one feeds them and the other doesn't. The red hatted non feeder gets no reaction. The face of the red-hatted feeder sends them scurrying to the surface for food. That may seem minor, but humans certainly can not discern just the facial differences among fish who all look the same to us. There are many more, and better examples, of how cunning they are, how they work to trick others, or cheat others, or show remorse. It will hopefully help you to stop thinking that catch and release is OK. "

93,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105791880-george-jacobs,5,"Jonathan Balcombe, the author of this New York Times best-selling book, has worked for many years as an ethologist (a scientist who studies animal behaviour). He is director of animal sentience at the Humane Society Institute for Science and Policy. His website is www.jonathanbalcombe.com. His other books are The Exultant Art: A Pictorial Tour of Animal Pleasure, Second Nature: The Iinner Livers of Animals, Pleasurable Kingdom: Animals and the Nature of Feeling Good, and The Use of Aanimals in Higher Education: Problems, Alternatives, and Recommendations. 	This review attempts to give readers an understanding of the structure of the book and a sample of some the book’s main points. The review ends with some comments by the reviewer. The book consists of seven parts, some of which are divided into chapters. Balcombe dedicates the book to the “anonymous trillions” of fishes, and he hopes that after reading this book (or a summary thereof) that humans will appreciate that fishes are not objects or grains of sand, but that each of the trillions of fishes is an individual who thinks and feels. Referring to his hopes for each of the approximately 7.4 billion humans’ attitudes towards fishes, Balcombe quotes an anonymous poet, “Nothing has changed except my attitude—so everything has changed” (p. 8). The reviewer believes this book provides valuable resources which ecolinguists can use to change people’s attitudes towards finishes. Prologue	That quote was from the book’s prologue, which includes basic information on fishes and their plight. Balcombe contends that although many, many books have been written about fishes, his is the first book written on behalf of fishes. Other works that seem to be concerned about fishes, talking about endangered species and overexploitation of fish “stocks”, actually focus on fishes as commodities for human use. The lives of fishes, Balcombe believes, have value not primarily for what they offer humans. Instead, all fishes’ lives have value to each of those fishes and those in their communities. 	One estimate puts the number of land animals killed annually for food for humans at about 70 billion. How many fishes are killed each year to feed humans? Balcombe uses an estimate, based on FAO data, that 1 trillion to 2.7 trillion fishes are killed by humans each year. (For other stats, please visit http://www.fishcount.org.uk.) These fishes die mostly from a combination of asphyxiation (when they are taken out of the water), decompression (due to pressure change as they are brought out of the water, being crushed under the weight of the fishes and other marine animals caught with them in the same net and being slaughtered.Part 1 – The Misunderstood Fish	Fishes are an extremely diverse collection of animals, accounting for 33,249 species, 60% of all the known vertebrates, with many more fish species likely yet to be discovered. The two main types of fishes are bony fishes (the largest group), including eels, salmons, basses, goldfishes and carps, and cartilaginous fishes, including sharks and rays. Fishes have been on the Earth much longer than humans: “[Fishes] had graced planet Earth fifty times longer than we have before they even left the water” (p. 13). As to the criticism that fishes’ small brains mean that they must not be able to think or feel, Balcombe counters with the point that miniaturisation allows small objects to function as well as larger ones.		Another misconception about fishes is that because fishes have been on Earth for so many geologic ages, fishes must be primitive creatures who stopped evolving, while other vertebrates, especially mammals, continued evolving. Balcombe (p. 21) explains:All of the fish species that were living at the dawn of legs and lungs are long gone. … The descents of early fishes have been evolving eons longer than their terrestrial counterparts, and on these terms fishes are the most highly evolved of all vertebrates. You might be surprised to know that fishes have the genetic machinery to make fingers—something that shows how similar fishes are to modern mammals. They just don’t develop fingers, but fins instead, since fins are better for swimming than fingers are. Part II – What a Fish Perceives	Part II consists of three chapters – What a Fish Sees, What a Fish Hears, Smells and Tastes, and Navigation, Touch and Beyond - focusing on the senses fishes use to perceive the world around them. All of these abilities are keenly affected by the fact that fishes live in water. For instance, sound travels much faster in water than in air. Given this and other differences in perception, humans may have difficulty understanding how fishes perceive their worlds. What a Fish Sees Fishes’ eyes are much like human eyes, with three pairs of muscles which enable the eyes to swivel. However, fishes’ vision does differ from that of humans, the main difference being that humans have eyelids, while fishes do not. However, other differences also exist. For instance, some fishes, such as adult flounders, have both their eyes on the same side of their bodies. Also, in regard to sight, just as humans use camouflage to fool hostiles, fishes also use visual cues to fool predators. For example, comet fishes lure predators to attack their rear ends, instead of their more sensitive heads. Comet fishes are able to do this because their rear side looks like the face of a parrot fish. What a Fish Hears, Smells and TastesBefore looking at how fishes hear, Balcombe clears up the misconception that fishes are silent creatures. Some of the mechanisms fishes use to make sounds include vibrating their swim bladders, grating and grinding their teeth, rubbing together their bones and pushing bubbles out of their anuses. Indeed, some fishes are named for the sounds they make, for example, grunters, croakers, drums and trumpeters. 	Believing fishes to be silent led to the belief that they were also deaf. This was an easy mistake for human-centric scientists, because fishes have no external hearing devices. Balcombe describes the study by Nobel Prize winning scientist, Karl van Frisch, which demonstrated fishes’ ability to hear, in much the same way that Pavlov demonstrated classical conditioning with dogs. The study’s sole participant was a blind catfish. van Frisch put food on a stick into the fish’s home. Upon smelling the food, the fish would swim towards it. Next, the researcher started whistling before lowering the food for the fish. After a while, all the fish needed was to hear whistling and he would swim towards the usual location of the food. 	Fishes can hear, and they can hear an amazing range of sounds. The fishes in one study demonstrated the ability to categorise human music (Chase, 2011). Chase’s study involved three carps. A speaker was placed in their home, an apparatus for operant conditioning was set up and the fishes learned to discriminate between blues music and classical music, and to categorise newly introduced music as either blues or classical. Another study found that listening to classical music enhanced the health of a group of fishes (Papoutsoglou, Karakatsouli, Papoutsoglou, & Vasilikos, 2010). 	Fishes use their sense of smell for such purposes as identifying their location, locating food and mates and recognising danger. Unlike human nostrils, which function for both smelling and breathing, fish nostrils have only an olfactory function. In some cases, fishes’ olfactory capabilities far exceed those of humans. Balcombe provides examples (p. 50):Salmon can detect the smell of a seal or sea lion diluted to one eighty billionth of water volume … . the American eel … can detect the equivalent of less than one ten millionth of a drop of their home water in [an] Olympic pool. Like salmons, eels make long migrations back to specific spawn sites, and they follow a subtle gradient of scent to get there. 	As to taste, one outstanding aspect of fish anatomy is the presence of taste buds in widely different parts of the body, not just in their mouths. These other locations can include the lips, snout and fins. Also, just as groups of humans tend to have similar tastes in food, e.g., spicy foods are favoured by some cultures, so too are particular foods favoured by given fish species. However, just as is the case with humans, individual fishes may have their idiosyncratic food preferences.Navigation, Touch, and Beyond Fishes, not surprisingly, have superb navigational skills. They navigate by such means as feeling water turbulence caused by the presence of objects, sun compassing, dead reckoning, a natural GPS system, smell, vision and electroreception. How do schools of fishes swim together in unison? Balcombe explains (p. 59):[Fishes have] a row of specialized scales running horizontally along their flanks, forming what is called the lateral line. ... [Each scale ] is populated by neuromasts, clusters of sensory cells each with a hair-like project encased in a tiny cup of gel. … The lateral line acts as a sonarlike system and is especially useful at night and in murky waters.Some fishes seem to enjoy touching and being touched. Touching appears to play a part in courting, in relationships between cleanerfishes and their clients, and even as a form of interaction between fishes and human divers. For example, while the evidence here is anecdotal, Balcombe reports stories of sunbathing fishes and fishes who enjoy the stimulation of the bubbles from divers’ regulators. Part III – What a Fish Feels	Part III consists of two chapters - Pain, Consciousness, and Awareness, and From Stress to Joy. Advocates on behalf of animals are fond of the following quote from the 18th century philosopher, Jeremy Bentham: “The question is not, ‘Can they reason?’ nor, ‘Can they talk?’ but ‘Can they suffer?’”. The two chapters of Part III start with this question and then proceed to happier topics. Pain, Consciousness, and AwarenessNot surprisingly, Balcombe believes that fishes do feel pain. In the book’s previous pages, he made the case for fishes having the same senses and other basic structures as other vertebrates. In this chapter, he notes that fishes have A-delta and C fibres in their nerves; mammals use these fibres to experience pain (Braithwaite, 2010; Sneddon, 2003). However, fishes and other nonmammal vertebrates do not have a neocortex, the body part posited to be the centre of consciousness. Balcombe counters that birds do not have a neocortex either, yet scientists agree that birds have consciousness and can feel pain. Furthermore, fishes’ brains have the pallium which carries out some of the same functions as the neocortex. In additional rebuttal, Balcombe makes the analogy that just as humans can swim despite lacking the fins that fishes employ for that purpose, so too are fishes conscious despite lacking a neocortex. 	While Balcombe cautions that opinion may never be unanimous on the issue of fishes and pain, he quotes a document of the American Veterinary Medical Association to argue that a general consensus has developed among scientists who study fishes (AVMA, 2013):Suggestions that finfish [fish that are not shellfish] responses to pain merely represent simple reflexes have been refuted by studies demonstrating forebrain and midbrain electrical activity in response to stimulation and different with type of nociceptor stimulation. Learning and memory consolidation in trials where finfish are taught to avoid noxious stimuli have moved the issue of finfish cognition and sentience forward to the point where the preponderance of accumulated evidence supports the position that finfish should be accorded the same considerations as terrestrial vertebrates in regard to relief from pain. Balcombe summarises the chapter by stating (pp. 84-85):Fishes show the hallmarks of pain both physiologically and behaviourally. They possess the specialized nerve fibers that mammals and birds use to detect noxious stimuli. They can learn to avoid electric shocks and anglers’ hooks. They are cognitively impaired when subjected to nasty insults to their bodies, and this impairment can be reversed if they are provided with pain relief.From Stress to JoyWhile the first chapter in Part III focused on fishes feeling pain, the second chapter focuses on emotions, beginning with fear and stress but then traveling to happier emotions. Balcombe notes that, “Emotions involve relatively old brain circuits conserved through evolution and shared by all vertebrates” (p. 88). Something similar seems to be the case for hormones that link to emotions. For instance, humans produce the hormone oxytocin, which promotes bonding, and fishes appear to have a similar hormone (Reddon et al., 2012). As to pleasurable emotions, scientists have been witnessing fishes play since 1898 (Groos, 1898). Much more recently, Burghardt, Dinets and Murphy (2014) studied three bfishes apparently playing with a thermometer which had been designed to float vertically. Each of the three fishes had their own way of playing with the thermometer. The first fish pushed down on the top of the thermometer, while the second swam round and round the thermometer occasionally touching and thereby moving it, and the third fish was the most aggressive, hitting the object at various points, thereby making it move around the tank. Part IV – What a Fish Thinks	Part IV consists of two chapters – Fins, Scales and Intelligence, and Tools, Plans and Monkey Minds. Balcombe frames these topics by recognising that the intelligences which different creatures develop are guided by those creatures’ life circumstances. Furthermore, he quotes Dinets to warn against underestimating the cognitive capabilities of nonhuman animals (p. 105), “Every other animal currently considered stupid and boring has its own amazing secrets. It’s just that nobody has been able to discover them yet”. At the same time, Balcombe cautions that just because one fish species or one individual fish demonstrates a particular ability does not mean that all species or all members of a particular species possess or can develop that ability.Fins, Scales and IntelligenceIn what may be the most amazing story in the book, Balcombe describes the cognitive mapping abilities of gobies (White & Brown, 2015). Gobies find their food in small tide pools. However, being in these pools exposes gobies to such predators as octopuses and herons. To escape predation, gobies jump to other pools. But how do they know where these other pools are? Their cognitive mapping abilities guide them.To read the entire review: https://www.academia.edu/30147532/Rev..."

95,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"The highlight, for me, occurred early in the book when the author pointed out that because fish can be fooled by optical illusions, some amount of consciousness must exist. It had occurred to me before that you can't have an illusion without consciousness - you can't make someone mis-perceive something if there's noone home to misperceive it (which is, incidentally, part of my problem with Daniel C. Dennett's claim we don't really have consciousness). So that was a wonderful bit of cleverness for me - trying to determine consciousness by fooling the fish.Anyway, fish can be fooled by some of the same stuff we are! They can see the smaller of two circles as larger if there are extra nearby circles making their relative sizes seem different. They also 'finish' shapes in their mind, 'seeing' a triangle that's only hinted at.They also can distinguish musical genres! And he provides convincing evidence that fish feel pain (which, of course, for most of us, is ""duh,"" but science requries agnosticism without good evidence, and some other people are just apologists who reject it out of hand because it's inconvenient).They can tell humans apart. They can cooperate. They make referential gestures across species! Before people noticed moray eels pointing out prey for groupers, the only species known to do that were humans (and tangentially, dogs understanding those gestures), some other apes, and ravens! Of course, the book ends with a section about how humans are evil and we're all doomed because we're killing the planet. I don't deny it - I get it and think it's a critical message, but it came out of left field for me in this book. Still, even that part was interesting, if only for some of the forehead-slappingness of it. For instance - ignoring the morality, farmed fish helps make the industry more sustainable, right? Well, no. Guess what they mostly feed farm fishes? Fish. What's the worst species in an ecosystem to hunt? The apex predator, right? Guess what tuna and marlin and sharks are. Oops.I'm going off on tangents, like the book did at the end. But there's a lot of great, well-explained stuff in here."

98,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/324370-lisa,4,"Jonathan Balcombe is an advocate for fish—or, as he prefers, fishes: “individuals with personalities and relationships”—and makes a strong case for piscine perception in What a Fish Knows: The Inner Lives of Our Underwater Cousins (Farrar, Straus). Weaving together decades of scientific studies of fish consciousness, cognition, and social structure, ethologist Balcombe (author of the lovely The Exultant Ark) offers a picture of fish(es) as complex and sentient beings. Not only do they have acute senses of sight, hearing, and smell, they have the capacity to feel pleasure as well as pain, and some form hierarchical grooming cooperatives, hunt in interspecies packs, help raise nonbiological offspring while waiting their turn to fertilize eggs, or recognize each other after months apart. At times the recitation of “believe it or not” knowledge bites can feel like overreaching to make a point; at others Balcombe edges toward a decidedly unscientific whimsy—he never met a fish pun he didn’t like. But altogether, What a Fish Knows is lively and surprising, making a good argument for sport and food fishing reform.VERDICT: This may ruin readers’ fish dinners forever, but will appeal to fans of odd science and animal rights advocates alike.—My Library Journal review"

But just how true are those words, especially to us humans? There's plenty of fish out in the sea, and no amount of fishing could ever deplete the vast ocean of all its fish. Could it? The sad answer is yes.Fish are animals, and they have personalities and social lives and experience emotions just like us and any other animal. Balcombe makes the case in his fascinating book What a Fish Knows, and you may come away learning something new from reading this. Perhaps it's the fact that fish are in an entirely different environment separate from our own world that we don't think twice about the sport of fishing, aquaculture, or the delicious baked salmon on the dinner plate. But after reading this, I find myself just a little bit more attuned to the life of a fish.I'll never look at a fish in a tank the same way again. As we develop better technologies and ways to be sustainable, the fishing industry should certainly be on everyone's radar."
100,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2028832-kathleen,3,"I enjoyed the premise of this book, that fish are interesting, evolved animals just as much as many birds and mammals. We should consider as much when we discuss fishing and farming practices, which may involve a great degree of cruelty. Including many interesting facts, studies, and anecdotes, this is a good choice for the casual reader looking for a little natural science. It did not have quite as many photographs in the picture section as I might have liked, but I would look at pictures of fish all day, so that's fair. I suspect this author may be a secret vegan, and I certainly have no intention of not eating fish any time soon, but we can certainly all be more conscious consumers. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who does eat fish, or just wants to learn a little bit about the fascinating underwater world. "
101,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1638985-daniel-kuo,2,"I was hoping for a book that used science to share the author's awe and wonder at the natural world. Instead I got a book where the science is used to support the author's personal belief that we need to dramatically change our relationship with fish.And I am sympathetic to that worldview. I think the environmental and ethical issues are genuine and worth examining. But the preaching, which is undeniably the main point of this book, had the opposite effect on me. I questioned whether or not the science presented was genuine or misleading, because there was such an obvious agenda. It didn't help that there were many many places where the conclusions did not follow from the evidence presented. I wanted... a more intellectually honest book."
102,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,4,"A beautifully written book that summarises the life of fishes - what they see, hear, small, taste, touch, navigate, feel. If they feel pain and if they are aware. Do they have fun? The author also discusses what a fish thinks and if they are intelligent and if they can use tools. The social contracts, co-operation and fish democracy involved in fishey lives, as well as the strange variety of breeding and parenting methods make for interesting reading. As the author says: ""fishes are individuals"", and he does a good job in showing why he thinks that. The book comes with a nice selection of colour photographs."
103,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309689-lara,4,"Very interesting look at how we tend to view fish and how maybe we should change our perspective. The parts towards the end about fishing were pretty horrifying to me, especially after all the indications that fish are individual creatures with individual lives and intelligence and personalities and that definitely feel pain, and it made me very thankful that I became a vegetarian years ago. If I hadn't, this book might have put me over the edge. "
104,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4152463-s,2,"To the good: I liked the description of many facets of fishes lives, behaviors, and putative experiences. To the bad: The language is sometimes a little clunky, and Balcombe doesn't disguise his agenda, which is to convince you to empathize more with fish. Despite being sympathetic, I found the tone was sometimes preachy and overly credulous."

108,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1945152-abraham-thunderwolf,4,"A few weeks ago I was watching Blue Planet, a documentary series on oceans by the same people who make Planet Earth, when I saw a fish doing something I didn't know fish do: it was using a rock to break open a mussel's shell to eat the inside, a fish using a tool. I thought, now that was something you don't see every day. In the back of my head that fish was still in my head a few weeks later I walked into the library to return a book and saw What A Fish Knows on a highlight shelf. Jonathan Balcombe's volume on the lives of fish is a captivating read, specially considering that the subjects are well fish. Luckily this book is a great dive in the myriad lives of different fishes throughout the world. And it's really about fish, you won't get a lot of talk about mollusks, crustaceans, whales, or other non fish things. It's packed with interesting facts about those denizens of the deep, but it's not just a dry volume of fish facts. There are dozens of charming stories and surprises in What A Fish Knows that I wouldn't have expected, I mean they are fish! There are parts where it boils down to ""no one knows why fish X thing happens."" Which just highlights how little people know about water bound life. It's a fun read until the last chapter that highlights the hellish fishing industries, which really, really, really bummed me out. Not that I was unaware of such things, but it was even harder to read about after learning that fish aren't just biological swimming automatons. The whole thing makes me really think about my tuna sandwiches. But where does that stop? Where is my sympathy towards the tomato pickers? What about the tons of garbage generated by the plastic industry, keeping in mind that the mustard in the fridge is in a plastic container? What's the bread I have really made from? I'm not here to have a crisis of consciousness about my lunch when all I wanted to do is say: every chapter in What a Fish knows can be its own book and the book is worth your time to read. I really liked it and I don't even like going to the aquarium (not from guilt, it just makes me feel oddly claustrophobic) plus finding the ocean just fucking terrifying if I think about it. While it does have some pictures it's not illustrated all the way, so I spent some time looking up various types of fishes that are featured in the book and I can't wait to see what my targeted ads are going to look like soon."
109,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83179136-catherine-puma,3,"Published in 2016, ""What a Fish Knows"" is a popular science nonfiction book that has been on my To Read list for a few years now. Jonathan Balcombe uses anecdotes, interviews, and studies he finds interesting to mention some of what humans have observed about the lives of our underwater cousins. While aquariums, household pets, and decorative koi ponds are also mentioned, most of the tales in this book are about wild examples from African cichlids, to Hawaiian cleaner wrasses, Atlantic goliath grouper, deep-sea lantern fish, and even some touches upon sharks and rays (my personal favorites). I do appreciate the way this is structured. Different parts are about what a fish perceives, feels, thinks, who a fish knows, and how a fish breeds. These parts are then further broken up into chapters on various senses and stimulii, intelligence and problem-solving, social contracts and interactions, and sexual and parenting activities.This book does not have to be read in order, so although a conversation-driven chapter book with a few photos or charts/diagrams/maps, readers can skip to the topics they find most interesting. However, although there are parts of this I really enjoyed and I did learn some interesting facts about different fish species, overall there is something off about the content's presentation. What's being said about fishes is important, but ethologist Balcombe's tone is nearly unbearably pretentious, self-righteous, self-centered, and judgmental. He scoffs at experts and makes fun of the scientific process. He is anti-fisheries and vehemently vegan, but doesn't have anything bad to say about decorative privately-owned aquariums or entertainment facilities like SeaWorld. He's entitled to his own opinions, but he spends too much time JUST being opinionated in this book. This would have been significantly improved if it stressed more on the end of explaining fish-facts. While reading this, I kept thinking about the other popular science nonfiction books about fishes that are so much BETTER than this one. Top choices that come to mind include: - Mark Kurlansky's ""Salmon"", - Sy Montgomery's ""The Soul of an Octopus"", - Paul Greenberg's ""Four Fish"", and - Danna Staaf's ""Squid Empire"". Overall, am I glad I read this? Sure, I guess. But I will be recommending many other books to people before I ever think of recommending this one. "
110,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16959053-seinka,5,"Wonderful, amazing. The writing is at times a little bit dry, but luckily the objects of the author's book are more than making up for that. Did you know that fishes like to be caressed, that some of them have taste buds all over their bodies (650.000 taste buds in total) so they can taste their whole environment (imagine that). Some fishes can split their eyes in 4 so that they can see what's happening above and under water, others can roll over their eyes to one side of the body. Did you know that some fish can change their gender during their lifetimes (hence, the cartoon Finding Nemo is inaccurate in the sense that after Nemo's mom died the father should have taken the female gender and fill in the role as mother), and that length does play a role for fish (they prefer longer over shorter, yes). Fishes take care of their eggs and babies. Some fishes carry their babies in their mouth during the whole pregnancy period, not allowing to eat for months. Some fishes have their penises between their eyes. Culture also plays a role among fishes, or actually many other animals, and fishes have feelings (sense of happiness, joy, sadness). There are many examples of fishes who help each other (one fish swam under the other fish because the one above could not swim well). In this day and age, unfortunately animal knowledge is linked with animal extinction, and the same goes for fishes. Industrialization has created big crates that scrape the bottoms of the oceans to fill our needs for omega 3 and in doing so generating a lot of collateral damage. Factories where fishes are being harvested for our food chain are living in despicable conditions, where some don't get to have food for 8 months simply because it generates more eggs. I probably said too much here, but this is merely a brief summary. The book contains many more marvels and facts about fishes and animals in general. In the worst it will give you some new information. In the best case it will change your world view. We are surrounded by beautiful sentient beings, not just by humans. And that realization on itself is already worth the read."
111,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61946844-amy,5,"What a Fish Knows is a systematic review of research supporting the hypothesis that fish - like our cousins, chimpanzees - are sentient. The book is sorted into sections (such as What a Fish Perceives, What a Fish Feels, Who a Fish Knows), each with chapters exploring a different aspect of the section (the section on Who a Fish Knows, for example, has chapters on cooperative hunting, social contracts, and peacekeeping behavior in intra-species and inter-species pairs/groups). I found the formatting of the chapters and sections to be very helpful and I like the emphasis on evidence-based conclusions. Though there is a liberal sprinkling of anecdotes throughout the book, they are clearly there for illustrative purposes only. The emphasis of each conclusion undoubtedly rests on the weight of the evidence that is cited in every chapter. The last chapter, Fish Out of Water, and the Epilogue are the only parts of the book that are a bit different. Though human actions in relation to fish are referenced throughout the book (and mostly in a research context), Fish Out of Water discusses the actions of humans in the context of fishing practices and the human consumption of sea life. While Balcombe takes pains to point out the already belabored but still important point that current fishing practices are unsustainable, the emphasis of the chapter is on how unethical human actions are in relation to what the reader has just learned about the sentience of fish. Quite frankly, it makes for a nauseating read, but it is a wake-up call that people should have. The epilogue focuses on the people and groups that are currently taking action to include fish in the widely accepted circle of moral concern. It is a very moving chapter that ends on a note of hope for people and for our underwater cousins. Overall, What a Fish Knows is an excellent book, and I would gladly recommend it. "
112,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2790863-allison,5,"I loved this book - and I learned so much. I love all animals and have an appreciation of how they are each individuals, with their own personalities. And while I have believed that fishes are sentient beings, I was not aware of their complexity. I loved the behavioral trial that took a certain type of fish 40 tries to solve it, primates 100 tries and a human child who didn't get it after 100 tries. Unfortunately, though, while the evidence posed in this book should get people to think again about the pain and suffering imposed on these animals, those who believe that all animals are there for us to eat because we're at the top of the food chain won't really care. People see the horrible treatment, pain and suffering on factory farms -- what cows, pigs, chickens and other animals that are used for human consumption are subjected to -- and they don't care. So whether or not they believe that fishes are sentient beings and feel pain, joy, compassion... certainly won't change their behavior. It is a sad, sad fact. However, for those who do care enough about the animals, but might think that it's okay to do this to fishes, because they don't really suffer anyway, well, this book should be a real eye-opener. Just to share a brief story. The last animal I stopped eating (30 years ago) was fish, because I too thought that fish were just above plant life. But one defining moment changed that for me. I was snorkeling for the first time in my life, and a school of beautiful fishes were below me, so I floated above them, trying to swim quietly so I could watch them. They all looked at me as they were swimming below me. It was amazing. I hope you enjoy this book. Whether or not you eat animals, you'll learn a lot. And if you call yourself a vegetarian but you eat fish, please stop. "
113,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40961426-gwen-vandendriessche,4,"Before starting to read this book, I didn’t think much of fishes. I never met that many fishes on my walks except for those who had been caught by birds (Herons, Kingfishers, Gannets, etc.) as food and that didn’t disturb me as I was happy for the birds. However, the sight of a trout looking blindly from my neighbour’s plate was enough to prevent me from eating anything and I had already been attached to a goldfish when I was young, so that was a good start for wanting to know more about them and reading Jonathan Balcombe’s book. At the first page, you understand that the author is really attached to the fishes he is talking about. He isn’t only teaching you facts, but sharing his wonder. This wonder is totally understandable for the lives of many fishes are amazingly complex. Here are a the three facts I was most amazed to learn: fishes can smell fear, some fishes lay their eggs on leaves out of the water and fire water on them to keep them moist, Nemo’s dad should have become a female after the death of his partner! As for many scientific books, I regret that much knowledge about living beings is brought by experiments which often appear really cruel to me. I’d rather not know what it is to be a fish than to know that some of them might have suffered to give me that knowledge (e.g.: injecting stuff in their eyes to know whether they use their sight to navigate!?!). Fortunaltely, only part of the book talks about these experiments.At the end of the book, the author also reminds us of the negative impact of farmed fishes on wildlife and of the disastrous slaughter of sharks and many other species for the food industry. The major part of the book just wants to amaze us, but I think those last pages are also very important to highlighten that the oceans are not endless and that we are making huges damages to their populations."
114,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43848794-samuel,4,"”And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.”‭Of the countless ideas the Bible is responsible for, ”dominion” has arguably been the worst. Instead of understanding life as vast systems of interconnected organisms, of which man is just one, man has made himself arbiter of all other living things. This has allowed us to overlook and diminish the life and intelligence of all other species. Our ignorance has allowed us to remain complacent as we destroy the oceans. Reading ’What A Fish Knows’ by Jonathan Balcombe is eye-opening, though some of it reads like trivia. Did you know that goldfish can recognize individual humans they haven’t seen in months? That tuna is more closely related to humans than they are to sharks? That a lot of fishes enjoy being petted? That they have personal friends and enemies? That cleaner fish do a better job if there are customers waiting their turn (and evaluating the services)? That different species of fish can communicate with one another to help eachother hunt for dinner? Etc etc. Why haven’t we bothered to find out till now? It seems that it may have something to do with facial muscles. Since fish can’t raise eye-brows or smile happily we have simply assumed they’re incognizant. ”What A Fish Knows” is packed with remarkable discoveries about fish. So much so that the last chapter about what we’re doing to destroy the ocean ecology is deeply disturbing. Many species of fish are indeed living in the end days. There’s an ocean apocalypse going on, and man is the destroyer of worlds."
115,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7709596-g-na,5,"Every once in awhile I am lucky enough to read a book that feels like it was written just for me, and this is one of those books. Here Balcombe takes a good look at the cognition and senses of fishes, with chapters on their consciousness, social lives, tool use, and more. Fishes have individual personalities and are much smarter than people realize, and that's something I have seen myself in the many hours I've spent underwater with them.Too many people think of fishes as primitive and unfeeling, and I know many think that fish cannot feel pain - they absolutely can, and studies have proved it! Yes, they live in an environment that is foreign to us, and they have no limbs or eyelids (unnecessary when your surroundings keep your eyes permanently moist), but they are still advanced vertebrates with complex and fully-functioning nervous systems. Because fishes are so different from us people seem to have no qualms about killing them, and the author has devoted a chapter to this sad fact. Today, commercial fisheries pull millions of tons (billions and billions of fish) out of the sea every year, which has resulted in the collapse of various fisheries, and populations of these fishes are dropping to the point where many species are nearing extinction.What a Fish Knows is well-researched and has over 30 pages of references, many of which are peer-reviewed journals. Balcomb did a good job of translating the scientific articles into everyday language for the layperson. This is a fantastic book."

This obvious object of this book is to raise awareness of the more complex aspects of fish life, hopefully increasing our concern.Part 2 of the book starts by examining fishes in some detail, revealing some surprising facts such as the vast number of eggs some species produce (300 million for an Ocean Sunfish), but also providing a good overview of their vision (they see UV and so some fish body markings are only visible in the UV range), hearing, smelling, touch and navigation senses.Part 3 examines evidence that fish care for each other and play. The author even suggests that when fish jump it may sometimes be for sheer joy.Fish intelligence is the subject of part 4, where the ability of fishes to map their environment and to solve problems suggests at least some species have unexpected abilities.Part 5 looks at relationships and evidence that fish recognize their neighbours, and the possibility that they recognize specific humans. Groupers have been seen to use a headstand signal to indicate to partner moray eels the location of hidden prey. This is interpreted as planning and one group of researchers ""... concluded that the collaborative capabilities of groupers compare favorably with those of chimpanzees.""The complexities of fish sex and parenting are discussed in part 6.The unsustainable practices of fishing are examined in part 7. The book ends with a plea for greater compassion for fishes."

That was mostly interesting, I really enjoyed learning about the different observations and anecdotes throughout the book. I'm fascinated by animals, so any peak into their behavior is a cool experience for me. Though, I do think the writing in certain places became a tad dry and the author's humor was like a bad dad joke (which is why I can't bring myself to give this 4 stars). Also, I saw some other reviews saying the book came off as preachy. I don't know if I fully feel that way. However, full-disclosure, I've been plant-based for a few years so maybe I'm used to the whole animal rights spiel. That being said, from an animal rights/humane side of things, this book didn't really bring anything new to the table. I feel like Balcombe just watched a few documentaries on animal activism and summarized their points in the book's epilogue. But, all of that aside, feel what you want to about fish. I think that the facts and studies about the fish are the more interesting point to pay attention to in the book anyway.If you like marine bio or are interested in animal behavior, this seems like a good introduction to that genre."

Given the pollution of our oceans, fish are not a healthy food source; given Balcombe's examination of the intelligence, awareness/consciousness of fish, and the inhumanity of how we capture and kill them, we need to rethink how we ""harvest"" them (and we all should rethink how many children we should have--the projected increase in human population by 2030 is not sustainable at the western world's way of living). Balcombe uses a number of sources, scientific as well as some personal/individual experiences, to argue that fish have intelligence, some at least have exhibited compassion, they can communicate intra- and extra-species (the grouper/moray eel cooperation is astounding), they do feel pain, they can learn from experience (and some kinds of situations they do better than our young children).Readers who are serious about ecology, living lives more sustainably and in amity with other species (rather than recklessly and thoughtlessly exploitatively) should read this book."

This is not a scientific tome, but a refreshing overview of a myriad experiments. As an active scuba diver, I have often wondered just how much a fish really does know. I felt that they remembered me after repeated visits with the same behavior. And sure enough, even a year later, they remember. And Jonathan describes experiments with fish proving that they can even recognize individual human faces when wearing the same red hat when one feeds them and the other doesn't. The red hatted non feeder gets no reaction. The face of the red-hatted feeder sends them scurrying to the surface for food. That may seem minor, but humans certainly can not discern just the facial differences among fish who all look the same to us. There are many more, and better examples, of how cunning they are, how they work to trick others, or cheat others, or show remorse. It will hopefully help you to stop thinking that catch and release is OK. "

123,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105791880-george-jacobs,5,"Jonathan Balcombe, the author of this New York Times best-selling book, has worked for many years as an ethologist (a scientist who studies animal behaviour). He is director of animal sentience at the Humane Society Institute for Science and Policy. His website is www.jonathanbalcombe.com. His other books are The Exultant Art: A Pictorial Tour of Animal Pleasure, Second Nature: The Iinner Livers of Animals, Pleasurable Kingdom: Animals and the Nature of Feeling Good, and The Use of Aanimals in Higher Education: Problems, Alternatives, and Recommendations. 	This review attempts to give readers an understanding of the structure of the book and a sample of some the book’s main points. The review ends with some comments by the reviewer. The book consists of seven parts, some of which are divided into chapters. Balcombe dedicates the book to the “anonymous trillions” of fishes, and he hopes that after reading this book (or a summary thereof) that humans will appreciate that fishes are not objects or grains of sand, but that each of the trillions of fishes is an individual who thinks and feels. Referring to his hopes for each of the approximately 7.4 billion humans’ attitudes towards fishes, Balcombe quotes an anonymous poet, “Nothing has changed except my attitude—so everything has changed” (p. 8). The reviewer believes this book provides valuable resources which ecolinguists can use to change people’s attitudes towards finishes. Prologue	That quote was from the book’s prologue, which includes basic information on fishes and their plight. Balcombe contends that although many, many books have been written about fishes, his is the first book written on behalf of fishes. Other works that seem to be concerned about fishes, talking about endangered species and overexploitation of fish “stocks”, actually focus on fishes as commodities for human use. The lives of fishes, Balcombe believes, have value not primarily for what they offer humans. Instead, all fishes’ lives have value to each of those fishes and those in their communities. 	One estimate puts the number of land animals killed annually for food for humans at about 70 billion. How many fishes are killed each year to feed humans? Balcombe uses an estimate, based on FAO data, that 1 trillion to 2.7 trillion fishes are killed by humans each year. (For other stats, please visit http://www.fishcount.org.uk.) These fishes die mostly from a combination of asphyxiation (when they are taken out of the water), decompression (due to pressure change as they are brought out of the water, being crushed under the weight of the fishes and other marine animals caught with them in the same net and being slaughtered.Part 1 – The Misunderstood Fish	Fishes are an extremely diverse collection of animals, accounting for 33,249 species, 60% of all the known vertebrates, with many more fish species likely yet to be discovered. The two main types of fishes are bony fishes (the largest group), including eels, salmons, basses, goldfishes and carps, and cartilaginous fishes, including sharks and rays. Fishes have been on the Earth much longer than humans: “[Fishes] had graced planet Earth fifty times longer than we have before they even left the water” (p. 13). As to the criticism that fishes’ small brains mean that they must not be able to think or feel, Balcombe counters with the point that miniaturisation allows small objects to function as well as larger ones.		Another misconception about fishes is that because fishes have been on Earth for so many geologic ages, fishes must be primitive creatures who stopped evolving, while other vertebrates, especially mammals, continued evolving. Balcombe (p. 21) explains:All of the fish species that were living at the dawn of legs and lungs are long gone. … The descents of early fishes have been evolving eons longer than their terrestrial counterparts, and on these terms fishes are the most highly evolved of all vertebrates. You might be surprised to know that fishes have the genetic machinery to make fingers—something that shows how similar fishes are to modern mammals. They just don’t develop fingers, but fins instead, since fins are better for swimming than fingers are. Part II – What a Fish Perceives	Part II consists of three chapters – What a Fish Sees, What a Fish Hears, Smells and Tastes, and Navigation, Touch and Beyond - focusing on the senses fishes use to perceive the world around them. All of these abilities are keenly affected by the fact that fishes live in water. For instance, sound travels much faster in water than in air. Given this and other differences in perception, humans may have difficulty understanding how fishes perceive their worlds. What a Fish Sees Fishes’ eyes are much like human eyes, with three pairs of muscles which enable the eyes to swivel. However, fishes’ vision does differ from that of humans, the main difference being that humans have eyelids, while fishes do not. However, other differences also exist. For instance, some fishes, such as adult flounders, have both their eyes on the same side of their bodies. Also, in regard to sight, just as humans use camouflage to fool hostiles, fishes also use visual cues to fool predators. For example, comet fishes lure predators to attack their rear ends, instead of their more sensitive heads. Comet fishes are able to do this because their rear side looks like the face of a parrot fish. What a Fish Hears, Smells and TastesBefore looking at how fishes hear, Balcombe clears up the misconception that fishes are silent creatures. Some of the mechanisms fishes use to make sounds include vibrating their swim bladders, grating and grinding their teeth, rubbing together their bones and pushing bubbles out of their anuses. Indeed, some fishes are named for the sounds they make, for example, grunters, croakers, drums and trumpeters. 	Believing fishes to be silent led to the belief that they were also deaf. This was an easy mistake for human-centric scientists, because fishes have no external hearing devices. Balcombe describes the study by Nobel Prize winning scientist, Karl van Frisch, which demonstrated fishes’ ability to hear, in much the same way that Pavlov demonstrated classical conditioning with dogs. The study’s sole participant was a blind catfish. van Frisch put food on a stick into the fish’s home. Upon smelling the food, the fish would swim towards it. Next, the researcher started whistling before lowering the food for the fish. After a while, all the fish needed was to hear whistling and he would swim towards the usual location of the food. 	Fishes can hear, and they can hear an amazing range of sounds. The fishes in one study demonstrated the ability to categorise human music (Chase, 2011). Chase’s study involved three carps. A speaker was placed in their home, an apparatus for operant conditioning was set up and the fishes learned to discriminate between blues music and classical music, and to categorise newly introduced music as either blues or classical. Another study found that listening to classical music enhanced the health of a group of fishes (Papoutsoglou, Karakatsouli, Papoutsoglou, & Vasilikos, 2010). 	Fishes use their sense of smell for such purposes as identifying their location, locating food and mates and recognising danger. Unlike human nostrils, which function for both smelling and breathing, fish nostrils have only an olfactory function. In some cases, fishes’ olfactory capabilities far exceed those of humans. Balcombe provides examples (p. 50):Salmon can detect the smell of a seal or sea lion diluted to one eighty billionth of water volume … . the American eel … can detect the equivalent of less than one ten millionth of a drop of their home water in [an] Olympic pool. Like salmons, eels make long migrations back to specific spawn sites, and they follow a subtle gradient of scent to get there. 	As to taste, one outstanding aspect of fish anatomy is the presence of taste buds in widely different parts of the body, not just in their mouths. These other locations can include the lips, snout and fins. Also, just as groups of humans tend to have similar tastes in food, e.g., spicy foods are favoured by some cultures, so too are particular foods favoured by given fish species. However, just as is the case with humans, individual fishes may have their idiosyncratic food preferences.Navigation, Touch, and Beyond Fishes, not surprisingly, have superb navigational skills. They navigate by such means as feeling water turbulence caused by the presence of objects, sun compassing, dead reckoning, a natural GPS system, smell, vision and electroreception. How do schools of fishes swim together in unison? Balcombe explains (p. 59):[Fishes have] a row of specialized scales running horizontally along their flanks, forming what is called the lateral line. ... [Each scale ] is populated by neuromasts, clusters of sensory cells each with a hair-like project encased in a tiny cup of gel. … The lateral line acts as a sonarlike system and is especially useful at night and in murky waters.Some fishes seem to enjoy touching and being touched. Touching appears to play a part in courting, in relationships between cleanerfishes and their clients, and even as a form of interaction between fishes and human divers. For example, while the evidence here is anecdotal, Balcombe reports stories of sunbathing fishes and fishes who enjoy the stimulation of the bubbles from divers’ regulators. Part III – What a Fish Feels	Part III consists of two chapters - Pain, Consciousness, and Awareness, and From Stress to Joy. Advocates on behalf of animals are fond of the following quote from the 18th century philosopher, Jeremy Bentham: “The question is not, ‘Can they reason?’ nor, ‘Can they talk?’ but ‘Can they suffer?’”. The two chapters of Part III start with this question and then proceed to happier topics. Pain, Consciousness, and AwarenessNot surprisingly, Balcombe believes that fishes do feel pain. In the book’s previous pages, he made the case for fishes having the same senses and other basic structures as other vertebrates. In this chapter, he notes that fishes have A-delta and C fibres in their nerves; mammals use these fibres to experience pain (Braithwaite, 2010; Sneddon, 2003). However, fishes and other nonmammal vertebrates do not have a neocortex, the body part posited to be the centre of consciousness. Balcombe counters that birds do not have a neocortex either, yet scientists agree that birds have consciousness and can feel pain. Furthermore, fishes’ brains have the pallium which carries out some of the same functions as the neocortex. In additional rebuttal, Balcombe makes the analogy that just as humans can swim despite lacking the fins that fishes employ for that purpose, so too are fishes conscious despite lacking a neocortex. 	While Balcombe cautions that opinion may never be unanimous on the issue of fishes and pain, he quotes a document of the American Veterinary Medical Association to argue that a general consensus has developed among scientists who study fishes (AVMA, 2013):Suggestions that finfish [fish that are not shellfish] responses to pain merely represent simple reflexes have been refuted by studies demonstrating forebrain and midbrain electrical activity in response to stimulation and different with type of nociceptor stimulation. Learning and memory consolidation in trials where finfish are taught to avoid noxious stimuli have moved the issue of finfish cognition and sentience forward to the point where the preponderance of accumulated evidence supports the position that finfish should be accorded the same considerations as terrestrial vertebrates in regard to relief from pain. Balcombe summarises the chapter by stating (pp. 84-85):Fishes show the hallmarks of pain both physiologically and behaviourally. They possess the specialized nerve fibers that mammals and birds use to detect noxious stimuli. They can learn to avoid electric shocks and anglers’ hooks. They are cognitively impaired when subjected to nasty insults to their bodies, and this impairment can be reversed if they are provided with pain relief.From Stress to JoyWhile the first chapter in Part III focused on fishes feeling pain, the second chapter focuses on emotions, beginning with fear and stress but then traveling to happier emotions. Balcombe notes that, “Emotions involve relatively old brain circuits conserved through evolution and shared by all vertebrates” (p. 88). Something similar seems to be the case for hormones that link to emotions. For instance, humans produce the hormone oxytocin, which promotes bonding, and fishes appear to have a similar hormone (Reddon et al., 2012). As to pleasurable emotions, scientists have been witnessing fishes play since 1898 (Groos, 1898). Much more recently, Burghardt, Dinets and Murphy (2014) studied three bfishes apparently playing with a thermometer which had been designed to float vertically. Each of the three fishes had their own way of playing with the thermometer. The first fish pushed down on the top of the thermometer, while the second swam round and round the thermometer occasionally touching and thereby moving it, and the third fish was the most aggressive, hitting the object at various points, thereby making it move around the tank. Part IV – What a Fish Thinks	Part IV consists of two chapters – Fins, Scales and Intelligence, and Tools, Plans and Monkey Minds. Balcombe frames these topics by recognising that the intelligences which different creatures develop are guided by those creatures’ life circumstances. Furthermore, he quotes Dinets to warn against underestimating the cognitive capabilities of nonhuman animals (p. 105), “Every other animal currently considered stupid and boring has its own amazing secrets. It’s just that nobody has been able to discover them yet”. At the same time, Balcombe cautions that just because one fish species or one individual fish demonstrates a particular ability does not mean that all species or all members of a particular species possess or can develop that ability.Fins, Scales and IntelligenceIn what may be the most amazing story in the book, Balcombe describes the cognitive mapping abilities of gobies (White & Brown, 2015). Gobies find their food in small tide pools. However, being in these pools exposes gobies to such predators as octopuses and herons. To escape predation, gobies jump to other pools. But how do they know where these other pools are? Their cognitive mapping abilities guide them.To read the entire review: https://www.academia.edu/30147532/Rev..."

125,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"The highlight, for me, occurred early in the book when the author pointed out that because fish can be fooled by optical illusions, some amount of consciousness must exist. It had occurred to me before that you can't have an illusion without consciousness - you can't make someone mis-perceive something if there's noone home to misperceive it (which is, incidentally, part of my problem with Daniel C. Dennett's claim we don't really have consciousness). So that was a wonderful bit of cleverness for me - trying to determine consciousness by fooling the fish.Anyway, fish can be fooled by some of the same stuff we are! They can see the smaller of two circles as larger if there are extra nearby circles making their relative sizes seem different. They also 'finish' shapes in their mind, 'seeing' a triangle that's only hinted at.They also can distinguish musical genres! And he provides convincing evidence that fish feel pain (which, of course, for most of us, is ""duh,"" but science requries agnosticism without good evidence, and some other people are just apologists who reject it out of hand because it's inconvenient).They can tell humans apart. They can cooperate. They make referential gestures across species! Before people noticed moray eels pointing out prey for groupers, the only species known to do that were humans (and tangentially, dogs understanding those gestures), some other apes, and ravens! Of course, the book ends with a section about how humans are evil and we're all doomed because we're killing the planet. I don't deny it - I get it and think it's a critical message, but it came out of left field for me in this book. Still, even that part was interesting, if only for some of the forehead-slappingness of it. For instance - ignoring the morality, farmed fish helps make the industry more sustainable, right? Well, no. Guess what they mostly feed farm fishes? Fish. What's the worst species in an ecosystem to hunt? The apex predator, right? Guess what tuna and marlin and sharks are. Oops.I'm going off on tangents, like the book did at the end. But there's a lot of great, well-explained stuff in here."

128,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/324370-lisa,4,"Jonathan Balcombe is an advocate for fish—or, as he prefers, fishes: “individuals with personalities and relationships”—and makes a strong case for piscine perception in What a Fish Knows: The Inner Lives of Our Underwater Cousins (Farrar, Straus). Weaving together decades of scientific studies of fish consciousness, cognition, and social structure, ethologist Balcombe (author of the lovely The Exultant Ark) offers a picture of fish(es) as complex and sentient beings. Not only do they have acute senses of sight, hearing, and smell, they have the capacity to feel pleasure as well as pain, and some form hierarchical grooming cooperatives, hunt in interspecies packs, help raise nonbiological offspring while waiting their turn to fertilize eggs, or recognize each other after months apart. At times the recitation of “believe it or not” knowledge bites can feel like overreaching to make a point; at others Balcombe edges toward a decidedly unscientific whimsy—he never met a fish pun he didn’t like. But altogether, What a Fish Knows is lively and surprising, making a good argument for sport and food fishing reform.VERDICT: This may ruin readers’ fish dinners forever, but will appeal to fans of odd science and animal rights advocates alike.—My Library Journal review"
129,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2290905-jimmy,5,"Fish are friends. Not food.Very well spoken by some sharks in the beloved movie Finding Nemo. But just how true are those words, especially to us humans? There's plenty of fish out in the sea, and no amount of fishing could ever deplete the vast ocean of all its fish. Could it? The sad answer is yes.Fish are animals, and they have personalities and social lives and experience emotions just like us and any other animal. Balcombe makes the case in his fascinating book What a Fish Knows, and you may come away learning something new from reading this. Perhaps it's the fact that fish are in an entirely different environment separate from our own world that we don't think twice about the sport of fishing, aquaculture, or the delicious baked salmon on the dinner plate. But after reading this, I find myself just a little bit more attuned to the life of a fish.I'll never look at a fish in a tank the same way again. As we develop better technologies and ways to be sustainable, the fishing industry should certainly be on everyone's radar."

We should consider as much when we discuss fishing and farming practices, which may involve a great degree of cruelty. Including many interesting facts, studies, and anecdotes, this is a good choice for the casual reader looking for a little natural science. It did not have quite as many photographs in the picture section as I might have liked, but I would look at pictures of fish all day, so that's fair. I suspect this author may be a secret vegan, and I certainly have no intention of not eating fish any time soon, but we can certainly all be more conscious consumers.

Instead I got a book where the science is used to support the author's personal belief that we need to dramatically change our relationship with fish.And I am sympathetic to that worldview. I think the environmental and ethical issues are genuine and worth examining. But the preaching, which is undeniably the main point of this book, had the opposite effect on me. I questioned whether or not the science presented was genuine or misleading, because there was such an obvious agenda. It didn't help that there were many many places where the conclusions did not follow from the evidence presented. I wanted... a more intellectually honest book."

The social contracts, co-operation and fish democracy involved in fishey lives, as well as the strange variety of breeding and parenting methods make for interesting reading. As the author says: ""fishes are individuals"", and he does a good job in showing why he thinks that. The book comes with a nice selection of colour photographs."

Some bony fishes produce their own electrical charges, like electric eels South American river dwellers...not true eels, use low-voltage discharges to navigate in murky habitats by detecting electric fields that bounce off solid objects, and can produce stunning electrical discharges up to 600 volts (stacked cells like a battery) -- built-in Taser gun used to stun or kill prey and repel intruders. Also Torpedo rays, use to communicate using 1,000 pulses per second. (EOD pulses.) Ability to discern pulse time down to millionth of a second, rivaling echolocation by bats as the fastest form of communication in the animal kingdom.Touch: orange Midas cichlid: returned to be stroked, picked up, playfully tossed back by a man.

Corticocentrism: the claim that to “possess a humanlike capacity for pain” one must have a neocortex, which only mammal brains have. So claim non-mammals lack consciousness. But:Birds lack neocortex yet clearly conscious, cognitive feats of birds include making tools, remembering for months locations of thousands of buried objects, categorizing objects according to combined characteristics such as color and shape (Alex parrot), recognizing neighbor’s voice over years, using names to call one’s chicks back to the nest at sunset, inventive play (slide down snowbanks), clever mischief like stealing sandwiches from tourists not watching, also can recognize faces.So both birds and fish have sufficient neuroanatomy...to argue otherwise, would mean humans can’t swim bC ;acl fins.

I thought, now that was something you don't see every day. In the back of my head that fish was still in my head a few weeks later I walked into the library to return a book and saw What A Fish Knows on a highlight shelf. Jonathan Balcombe's volume on the lives of fish is a captivating read, specially considering that the subjects are well fish. Luckily this book is a great dive in the myriad lives of different fishes throughout the world. And it's really about fish, you won't get a lot of talk about mollusks, crustaceans, whales, or other non fish things. It's packed with interesting facts about those denizens of the deep, but it's not just a dry volume of fish facts. There are dozens of charming stories and surprises in What A Fish Knows that I wouldn't have expected, I mean they are fish! There are parts where it boils down to ""no one knows why fish X thing happens."" Which just highlights how little people know about water bound life. It's a fun read until the last chapter that highlights the hellish fishing industries, which really, really, really bummed me out. Not that I was unaware of such things, but it was even harder to read about after learning that fish aren't just biological swimming automatons. The whole thing makes me really think about my tuna sandwiches. But where does that stop? Where is my sympathy towards the tomato pickers? What about the tons of garbage generated by the plastic industry, keeping in mind that the mustard in the fridge is in a plastic container? What's the bread I have really made from? I'm not here to have a crisis of consciousness about my lunch when all I wanted to do is say: every chapter in What a Fish knows can be its own book and the book is worth your time to read. I really liked it and I don't even like going to the aquarium (not from guilt, it just makes me feel oddly claustrophobic) plus finding the ocean just fucking terrifying if I think about it. While it does have some pictures it's not illustrated all the way, so I spent some time looking up various types of fishes that are featured in the book and I can't wait to see what my targeted ads are going to look like soon."
139,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83179136-catherine-puma,3,"Published in 2016, ""What a Fish Knows"" is a popular science nonfiction book that has been on my To Read list for a few years now. Jonathan Balcombe uses anecdotes, interviews, and studies he finds interesting to mention some of what humans have observed about the lives of our underwater cousins. While aquariums, household pets, and decorative koi ponds are also mentioned, most of the tales in this book are about wild examples from African cichlids, to Hawaiian cleaner wrasses, Atlantic goliath grouper, deep-sea lantern fish, and even some touches upon sharks and rays (my personal favorites). I do appreciate the way this is structured. Different parts are about what a fish perceives, feels, thinks, who a fish knows, and how a fish breeds. These parts are then further broken up into chapters on various senses and stimulii, intelligence and problem-solving, social contracts and interactions, and sexual and parenting activities.This book does not have to be read in order, so although a conversation-driven chapter book with a few photos or charts/diagrams/maps, readers can skip to the topics they find most interesting. However, although there are parts of this I really enjoyed and I did learn some interesting facts about different fish species, overall there is something off about the content's presentation. What's being said about fishes is important, but ethologist Balcombe's tone is nearly unbearably pretentious, self-righteous, self-centered, and judgmental. He scoffs at experts and makes fun of the scientific process. He is anti-fisheries and vehemently vegan, but doesn't have anything bad to say about decorative privately-owned aquariums or entertainment facilities like SeaWorld. He's entitled to his own opinions, but he spends too much time JUST being opinionated in this book. This would have been significantly improved if it stressed more on the end of explaining fish-facts. While reading this, I kept thinking about the other popular science nonfiction books about fishes that are so much BETTER than this one. Top choices that come to mind include: - Mark Kurlansky's ""Salmon"", - Sy Montgomery's ""The Soul of an Octopus"", - Paul Greenberg's ""Four Fish"", and - Danna Staaf's ""Squid Empire"". Overall, am I glad I read this? Sure, I guess. But I will be recommending many other books to people before I ever think of recommending this one. "
140,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16959053-seinka,5,"Wonderful, amazing. The writing is at times a little bit dry, but luckily the objects of the author's book are more than making up for that. Did you know that fishes like to be caressed, that some of them have taste buds all over their bodies (650.000 taste buds in total) so they can taste their whole environment (imagine that). Some fishes can split their eyes in 4 so that they can see what's happening above and under water, others can roll over their eyes to one side of the body. Did you know that some fish can change their gender during their lifetimes (hence, the cartoon Finding Nemo is inaccurate in the sense that after Nemo's mom died the father should have taken the female gender and fill in the role as mother), and that length does play a role for fish (they prefer longer over shorter, yes). Fishes take care of their eggs and babies. Some fishes carry their babies in their mouth during the whole pregnancy period, not allowing to eat for months. Some fishes have their penises between their eyes. Culture also plays a role among fishes, or actually many other animals, and fishes have feelings (sense of happiness, joy, sadness). There are many examples of fishes who help each other (one fish swam under the other fish because the one above could not swim well). In this day and age, unfortunately animal knowledge is linked with animal extinction, and the same goes for fishes. Industrialization has created big crates that scrape the bottoms of the oceans to fill our needs for omega 3 and in doing so generating a lot of collateral damage. Factories where fishes are being harvested for our food chain are living in despicable conditions, where some don't get to have food for 8 months simply because it generates more eggs. I probably said too much here, but this is merely a brief summary. The book contains many more marvels and facts about fishes and animals in general. In the worst it will give you some new information. In the best case it will change your world view. We are surrounded by beautiful sentient beings, not just by humans. And that realization on itself is already worth the read."
141,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61946844-amy,5,"What a Fish Knows is a systematic review of research supporting the hypothesis that fish - like our cousins, chimpanzees - are sentient. The book is sorted into sections (such as What a Fish Perceives, What a Fish Feels, Who a Fish Knows), each with chapters exploring a different aspect of the section (the section on Who a Fish Knows, for example, has chapters on cooperative hunting, social contracts, and peacekeeping behavior in intra-species and inter-species pairs/groups). I found the formatting of the chapters and sections to be very helpful and I like the emphasis on evidence-based conclusions. Though there is a liberal sprinkling of anecdotes throughout the book, they are clearly there for illustrative purposes only. The emphasis of each conclusion undoubtedly rests on the weight of the evidence that is cited in every chapter. The last chapter, Fish Out of Water, and the Epilogue are the only parts of the book that are a bit different. Though human actions in relation to fish are referenced throughout the book (and mostly in a research context), Fish Out of Water discusses the actions of humans in the context of fishing practices and the human consumption of sea life. While Balcombe takes pains to point out the already belabored but still important point that current fishing practices are unsustainable, the emphasis of the chapter is on how unethical human actions are in relation to what the reader has just learned about the sentience of fish. Quite frankly, it makes for a nauseating read, but it is a wake-up call that people should have. The epilogue focuses on the people and groups that are currently taking action to include fish in the widely accepted circle of moral concern. It is a very moving chapter that ends on a note of hope for people and for our underwater cousins. Overall, What a Fish Knows is an excellent book, and I would gladly recommend it. "
142,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2790863-allison,5,"I loved this book - and I learned so much. I love all animals and have an appreciation of how they are each individuals, with their own personalities. And while I have believed that fishes are sentient beings, I was not aware of their complexity. I loved the behavioral trial that took a certain type of fish 40 tries to solve it, primates 100 tries and a human child who didn't get it after 100 tries. Unfortunately, though, while the evidence posed in this book should get people to think again about the pain and suffering imposed on these animals, those who believe that all animals are there for us to eat because we're at the top of the food chain won't really care. People see the horrible treatment, pain and suffering on factory farms -- what cows, pigs, chickens and other animals that are used for human consumption are subjected to -- and they don't care. So whether or not they believe that fishes are sentient beings and feel pain, joy, compassion... certainly won't change their behavior. It is a sad, sad fact. However, for those who do care enough about the animals, but might think that it's okay to do this to fishes, because they don't really suffer anyway, well, this book should be a real eye-opener. Just to share a brief story. The last animal I stopped eating (30 years ago) was fish, because I too thought that fish were just above plant life. But one defining moment changed that for me. I was snorkeling for the first time in my life, and a school of beautiful fishes were below me, so I floated above them, trying to swim quietly so I could watch them. They all looked at me as they were swimming below me. It was amazing. I hope you enjoy this book. Whether or not you eat animals, you'll learn a lot. And if you call yourself a vegetarian but you eat fish, please stop. "
143,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40961426-gwen-vandendriessche,4,"Before starting to read this book, I didn’t think much of fishes. I never met that many fishes on my walks except for those who had been caught by birds (Herons, Kingfishers, Gannets, etc.) as food and that didn’t disturb me as I was happy for the birds. However, the sight of a trout looking blindly from my neighbour’s plate was enough to prevent me from eating anything and I had already been attached to a goldfish when I was young, so that was a good start for wanting to know more about them and reading Jonathan Balcombe’s book. At the first page, you understand that the author is really attached to the fishes he is talking about. He isn’t only teaching you facts, but sharing his wonder. This wonder is totally understandable for the lives of many fishes are amazingly complex. Here are a the three facts I was most amazed to learn: fishes can smell fear, some fishes lay their eggs on leaves out of the water and fire water on them to keep them moist, Nemo’s dad should have become a female after the death of his partner! As for many scientific books, I regret that much knowledge about living beings is brought by experiments which often appear really cruel to me. I’d rather not know what it is to be a fish than to know that some of them might have suffered to give me that knowledge (e.g.: injecting stuff in their eyes to know whether they use their sight to navigate!?!). Fortunaltely, only part of the book talks about these experiments.At the end of the book, the author also reminds us of the negative impact of farmed fishes on wildlife and of the disastrous slaughter of sharks and many other species for the food industry. The major part of the book just wants to amaze us, but I think those last pages are also very important to highlighten that the oceans are not endless and that we are making huges damages to their populations."
144,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43848794-samuel,4,"”And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.”‭Of the countless ideas the Bible is responsible for, ”dominion” has arguably been the worst. Instead of understanding life as vast systems of interconnected organisms, of which man is just one, man has made himself arbiter of all other living things. This has allowed us to overlook and diminish the life and intelligence of all other species. Our ignorance has allowed us to remain complacent as we destroy the oceans. Reading ’What A Fish Knows’ by Jonathan Balcombe is eye-opening, though some of it reads like trivia. Did you know that goldfish can recognize individual humans they haven’t seen in months? That tuna is more closely related to humans than they are to sharks? That a lot of fishes enjoy being petted? That they have personal friends and enemies? That cleaner fish do a better job if there are customers waiting their turn (and evaluating the services)? That different species of fish can communicate with one another to help eachother hunt for dinner? Etc etc. Why haven’t we bothered to find out till now? It seems that it may have something to do with facial muscles. Since fish can’t raise eye-brows or smile happily we have simply assumed they’re incognizant. ”What A Fish Knows” is packed with remarkable discoveries about fish. So much so that the last chapter about what we’re doing to destroy the ocean ecology is deeply disturbing. Many species of fish are indeed living in the end days. There’s an ocean apocalypse going on, and man is the destroyer of worlds."
145,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7709596-g-na,5,"Every once in awhile I am lucky enough to read a book that feels like it was written just for me, and this is one of those books. Here Balcombe takes a good look at the cognition and senses of fishes, with chapters on their consciousness, social lives, tool use, and more. Fishes have individual personalities and are much smarter than people realize, and that's something I have seen myself in the many hours I've spent underwater with them.Too many people think of fishes as primitive and unfeeling, and I know many think that fish cannot feel pain - they absolutely can, and studies have proved it! Yes, they live in an environment that is foreign to us, and they have no limbs or eyelids (unnecessary when your surroundings keep your eyes permanently moist), but they are still advanced vertebrates with complex and fully-functioning nervous systems. Because fishes are so different from us people seem to have no qualms about killing them, and the author has devoted a chapter to this sad fact. Today, commercial fisheries pull millions of tons (billions and billions of fish) out of the sea every year, which has resulted in the collapse of various fisheries, and populations of these fishes are dropping to the point where many species are nearing extinction.What a Fish Knows is well-researched and has over 30 pages of references, many of which are peer-reviewed journals. Balcomb did a good job of translating the scientific articles into everyday language for the layperson. This is a fantastic book."
146,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,3,"Early in the book, the author asks why we tend to relegate fishes ""... beyond the outer orbit of our moral concern?"" This obvious object of this book is to raise awareness of the more complex aspects of fish life, hopefully increasing our concern.Part 2 of the book starts by examining fishes in some detail, revealing some surprising facts such as the vast number of eggs some species produce (300 million for an Ocean Sunfish), but also providing a good overview of their vision (they see UV and so some fish body markings are only visible in the UV range), hearing, smelling, touch and navigation senses.Part 3 examines evidence that fish care for each other and play. The author even suggests that when fish jump it may sometimes be for sheer joy.Fish intelligence is the subject of part 4, where the ability of fishes to map their environment and to solve problems suggests at least some species have unexpected abilities.Part 5 looks at relationships and evidence that fish recognize their neighbours, and the possibility that they recognize specific humans. Groupers have been seen to use a headstand signal to indicate to partner moray eels the location of hidden prey. This is interpreted as planning and one group of researchers ""... concluded that the collaborative capabilities of groupers compare favorably with those of chimpanzees.""The complexities of fish sex and parenting are discussed in part 6.The unsustainable practices of fishing are examined in part 7. The book ends with a plea for greater compassion for fishes."
147,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34895792-stacie,3,"3.75 starsWell, now I know some cool stuff about fish. That was mostly interesting, I really enjoyed learning about the different observations and anecdotes throughout the book. I'm fascinated by animals, so any peak into their behavior is a cool experience for me. Though, I do think the writing in certain places became a tad dry and the author's humor was like a bad dad joke (which is why I can't bring myself to give this 4 stars). Also, I saw some other reviews saying the book came off as preachy. I don't know if I fully feel that way. However, full-disclosure, I've been plant-based for a few years so maybe I'm used to the whole animal rights spiel. That being said, from an animal rights/humane side of things, this book didn't really bring anything new to the table. I feel like Balcombe just watched a few documentaries on animal activism and summarized their points in the book's epilogue. But, all of that aside, feel what you want to about fish. I think that the facts and studies about the fish are the more interesting point to pay attention to in the book anyway.If you like marine bio or are interested in animal behavior, this seems like a good introduction to that genre."
148,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32960023-judith,5,"This book has almost (98%) persuaded me to give up eating fish; well, it and what I have read about mercury levels in fish and bits of plastic as well. Given the pollution of our oceans, fish are not a healthy food source; given Balcombe's examination of the intelligence, awareness/consciousness of fish, and the inhumanity of how we capture and kill them, we need to rethink how we ""harvest"" them (and we all should rethink how many children we should have--the projected increase in human population by 2030 is not sustainable at the western world's way of living). Balcombe uses a number of sources, scientific as well as some personal/individual experiences, to argue that fish have intelligence, some at least have exhibited compassion, they can communicate intra- and extra-species (the grouper/moray eel cooperation is astounding), they do feel pain, they can learn from experience (and some kinds of situations they do better than our young children).Readers who are serious about ecology, living lives more sustainably and in amity with other species (rather than recklessly and thoughtlessly exploitatively) should read this book."
149,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65519162-cathy-church,5,"This would be a surprise to anyone who has never even thought that a fish might actually experience pain, fear, avoidance, and much, much more. but the best part is how entertaining Jonathan Balcombe's writing is. This is not a scientific tome, but a refreshing overview of a myriad experiments. As an active scuba diver, I have often wondered just how much a fish really does know. I felt that they remembered me after repeated visits with the same behavior. And sure enough, even a year later, they remember. And Jonathan describes experiments with fish proving that they can even recognize individual human faces when wearing the same red hat when one feeds them and the other doesn't. The red hatted non feeder gets no reaction. The face of the red-hatted feeder sends them scurrying to the surface for food. That may seem minor, but humans certainly can not discern just the facial differences among fish who all look the same to us. There are many more, and better examples, of how cunning they are, how they work to trick others, or cheat others, or show remorse. It will hopefully help you to stop thinking that catch and release is OK. "

153,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105791880-george-jacobs,5,"Jonathan Balcombe, the author of this New York Times best-selling book, has worked for many years as an ethologist (a scientist who studies animal behaviour). He is director of animal sentience at the Humane Society Institute for Science and Policy. His website is www.jonathanbalcombe.com. His other books are The Exultant Art: A Pictorial Tour of Animal Pleasure, Second Nature: The Iinner Livers of Animals, Pleasurable Kingdom: Animals and the Nature of Feeling Good, and The Use of Aanimals in Higher Education: Problems, Alternatives, and Recommendations. 	This review attempts to give readers an understanding of the structure of the book and a sample of some the book’s main points. The review ends with some comments by the reviewer. The book consists of seven parts, some of which are divided into chapters. Balcombe dedicates the book to the “anonymous trillions” of fishes, and he hopes that after reading this book (or a summary thereof) that humans will appreciate that fishes are not objects or grains of sand, but that each of the trillions of fishes is an individual who thinks and feels. Referring to his hopes for each of the approximately 7.4 billion humans’ attitudes towards fishes, Balcombe quotes an anonymous poet, “Nothing has changed except my attitude—so everything has changed” (p. 8). The reviewer believes this book provides valuable resources which ecolinguists can use to change people’s attitudes towards finishes. Prologue	That quote was from the book’s prologue, which includes basic information on fishes and their plight. Balcombe contends that although many, many books have been written about fishes, his is the first book written on behalf of fishes. Other works that seem to be concerned about fishes, talking about endangered species and overexploitation of fish “stocks”, actually focus on fishes as commodities for human use. The lives of fishes, Balcombe believes, have value not primarily for what they offer humans. Instead, all fishes’ lives have value to each of those fishes and those in their communities. 	One estimate puts the number of land animals killed annually for food for humans at about 70 billion. How many fishes are killed each year to feed humans? Balcombe uses an estimate, based on FAO data, that 1 trillion to 2.7 trillion fishes are killed by humans each year. (For other stats, please visit http://www.fishcount.org.uk.) These fishes die mostly from a combination of asphyxiation (when they are taken out of the water), decompression (due to pressure change as they are brought out of the water, being crushed under the weight of the fishes and other marine animals caught with them in the same net and being slaughtered.Part 1 – The Misunderstood Fish	Fishes are an extremely diverse collection of animals, accounting for 33,249 species, 60% of all the known vertebrates, with many more fish species likely yet to be discovered. The two main types of fishes are bony fishes (the largest group), including eels, salmons, basses, goldfishes and carps, and cartilaginous fishes, including sharks and rays. Fishes have been on the Earth much longer than humans: “[Fishes] had graced planet Earth fifty times longer than we have before they even left the water” (p. 13). As to the criticism that fishes’ small brains mean that they must not be able to think or feel, Balcombe counters with the point that miniaturisation allows small objects to function as well as larger ones.		Another misconception about fishes is that because fishes have been on Earth for so many geologic ages, fishes must be primitive creatures who stopped evolving, while other vertebrates, especially mammals, continued evolving. Balcombe (p. 21) explains:All of the fish species that were living at the dawn of legs and lungs are long gone. … The descents of early fishes have been evolving eons longer than their terrestrial counterparts, and on these terms fishes are the most highly evolved of all vertebrates. You might be surprised to know that fishes have the genetic machinery to make fingers—something that shows how similar fishes are to modern mammals. They just don’t develop fingers, but fins instead, since fins are better for swimming than fingers are. Part II – What a Fish Perceives	Part II consists of three chapters – What a Fish Sees, What a Fish Hears, Smells and Tastes, and Navigation, Touch and Beyond - focusing on the senses fishes use to perceive the world around them. All of these abilities are keenly affected by the fact that fishes live in water. For instance, sound travels much faster in water than in air. Given this and other differences in perception, humans may have difficulty understanding how fishes perceive their worlds. What a Fish Sees Fishes’ eyes are much like human eyes, with three pairs of muscles which enable the eyes to swivel. However, fishes’ vision does differ from that of humans, the main difference being that humans have eyelids, while fishes do not. However, other differences also exist. For instance, some fishes, such as adult flounders, have both their eyes on the same side of their bodies. Also, in regard to sight, just as humans use camouflage to fool hostiles, fishes also use visual cues to fool predators. For example, comet fishes lure predators to attack their rear ends, instead of their more sensitive heads. Comet fishes are able to do this because their rear side looks like the face of a parrot fish. What a Fish Hears, Smells and TastesBefore looking at how fishes hear, Balcombe clears up the misconception that fishes are silent creatures. Some of the mechanisms fishes use to make sounds include vibrating their swim bladders, grating and grinding their teeth, rubbing together their bones and pushing bubbles out of their anuses. Indeed, some fishes are named for the sounds they make, for example, grunters, croakers, drums and trumpeters. 	Believing fishes to be silent led to the belief that they were also deaf. This was an easy mistake for human-centric scientists, because fishes have no external hearing devices. Balcombe describes the study by Nobel Prize winning scientist, Karl van Frisch, which demonstrated fishes’ ability to hear, in much the same way that Pavlov demonstrated classical conditioning with dogs. The study’s sole participant was a blind catfish. van Frisch put food on a stick into the fish’s home. Upon smelling the food, the fish would swim towards it. Next, the researcher started whistling before lowering the food for the fish. After a while, all the fish needed was to hear whistling and he would swim towards the usual location of the food. 	Fishes can hear, and they can hear an amazing range of sounds. The fishes in one study demonstrated the ability to categorise human music (Chase, 2011). Chase’s study involved three carps. A speaker was placed in their home, an apparatus for operant conditioning was set up and the fishes learned to discriminate between blues music and classical music, and to categorise newly introduced music as either blues or classical. Another study found that listening to classical music enhanced the health of a group of fishes (Papoutsoglou, Karakatsouli, Papoutsoglou, & Vasilikos, 2010). 	Fishes use their sense of smell for such purposes as identifying their location, locating food and mates and recognising danger. Unlike human nostrils, which function for both smelling and breathing, fish nostrils have only an olfactory function. In some cases, fishes’ olfactory capabilities far exceed those of humans. Balcombe provides examples (p. 50):Salmon can detect the smell of a seal or sea lion diluted to one eighty billionth of water volume … . the American eel … can detect the equivalent of less than one ten millionth of a drop of their home water in [an] Olympic pool. Like salmons, eels make long migrations back to specific spawn sites, and they follow a subtle gradient of scent to get there. 	As to taste, one outstanding aspect of fish anatomy is the presence of taste buds in widely different parts of the body, not just in their mouths. These other locations can include the lips, snout and fins. Also, just as groups of humans tend to have similar tastes in food, e.g., spicy foods are favoured by some cultures, so too are particular foods favoured by given fish species. However, just as is the case with humans, individual fishes may have their idiosyncratic food preferences.Navigation, Touch, and Beyond Fishes, not surprisingly, have superb navigational skills. They navigate by such means as feeling water turbulence caused by the presence of objects, sun compassing, dead reckoning, a natural GPS system, smell, vision and electroreception. How do schools of fishes swim together in unison? Balcombe explains (p. 59):[Fishes have] a row of specialized scales running horizontally along their flanks, forming what is called the lateral line. ... [Each scale ] is populated by neuromasts, clusters of sensory cells each with a hair-like project encased in a tiny cup of gel. … The lateral line acts as a sonarlike system and is especially useful at night and in murky waters.Some fishes seem to enjoy touching and being touched. Touching appears to play a part in courting, in relationships between cleanerfishes and their clients, and even as a form of interaction between fishes and human divers. For example, while the evidence here is anecdotal, Balcombe reports stories of sunbathing fishes and fishes who enjoy the stimulation of the bubbles from divers’ regulators. Part III – What a Fish Feels	Part III consists of two chapters - Pain, Consciousness, and Awareness, and From Stress to Joy. Advocates on behalf of animals are fond of the following quote from the 18th century philosopher, Jeremy Bentham: “The question is not, ‘Can they reason?’ nor, ‘Can they talk?’ but ‘Can they suffer?’”. The two chapters of Part III start with this question and then proceed to happier topics. Pain, Consciousness, and AwarenessNot surprisingly, Balcombe believes that fishes do feel pain. In the book’s previous pages, he made the case for fishes having the same senses and other basic structures as other vertebrates. In this chapter, he notes that fishes have A-delta and C fibres in their nerves; mammals use these fibres to experience pain (Braithwaite, 2010; Sneddon, 2003). However, fishes and other nonmammal vertebrates do not have a neocortex, the body part posited to be the centre of consciousness. Balcombe counters that birds do not have a neocortex either, yet scientists agree that birds have consciousness and can feel pain. Furthermore, fishes’ brains have the pallium which carries out some of the same functions as the neocortex. In additional rebuttal, Balcombe makes the analogy that just as humans can swim despite lacking the fins that fishes employ for that purpose, so too are fishes conscious despite lacking a neocortex. 	While Balcombe cautions that opinion may never be unanimous on the issue of fishes and pain, he quotes a document of the American Veterinary Medical Association to argue that a general consensus has developed among scientists who study fishes (AVMA, 2013):Suggestions that finfish [fish that are not shellfish] responses to pain merely represent simple reflexes have been refuted by studies demonstrating forebrain and midbrain electrical activity in response to stimulation and different with type of nociceptor stimulation. Learning and memory consolidation in trials where finfish are taught to avoid noxious stimuli have moved the issue of finfish cognition and sentience forward to the point where the preponderance of accumulated evidence supports the position that finfish should be accorded the same considerations as terrestrial vertebrates in regard to relief from pain. Balcombe summarises the chapter by stating (pp. 84-85):Fishes show the hallmarks of pain both physiologically and behaviourally. They possess the specialized nerve fibers that mammals and birds use to detect noxious stimuli. They can learn to avoid electric shocks and anglers’ hooks. They are cognitively impaired when subjected to nasty insults to their bodies, and this impairment can be reversed if they are provided with pain relief.From Stress to JoyWhile the first chapter in Part III focused on fishes feeling pain, the second chapter focuses on emotions, beginning with fear and stress but then traveling to happier emotions. Balcombe notes that, “Emotions involve relatively old brain circuits conserved through evolution and shared by all vertebrates” (p. 88). Something similar seems to be the case for hormones that link to emotions. For instance, humans produce the hormone oxytocin, which promotes bonding, and fishes appear to have a similar hormone (Reddon et al., 2012). As to pleasurable emotions, scientists have been witnessing fishes play since 1898 (Groos, 1898). Much more recently, Burghardt, Dinets and Murphy (2014) studied three bfishes apparently playing with a thermometer which had been designed to float vertically. Each of the three fishes had their own way of playing with the thermometer. The first fish pushed down on the top of the thermometer, while the second swam round and round the thermometer occasionally touching and thereby moving it, and the third fish was the most aggressive, hitting the object at various points, thereby making it move around the tank. Part IV – What a Fish Thinks	Part IV consists of two chapters – Fins, Scales and Intelligence, and Tools, Plans and Monkey Minds. Balcombe frames these topics by recognising that the intelligences which different creatures develop are guided by those creatures’ life circumstances. Furthermore, he quotes Dinets to warn against underestimating the cognitive capabilities of nonhuman animals (p. 105), “Every other animal currently considered stupid and boring has its own amazing secrets. It’s just that nobody has been able to discover them yet”. At the same time, Balcombe cautions that just because one fish species or one individual fish demonstrates a particular ability does not mean that all species or all members of a particular species possess or can develop that ability.Fins, Scales and IntelligenceIn what may be the most amazing story in the book, Balcombe describes the cognitive mapping abilities of gobies (White & Brown, 2015). Gobies find their food in small tide pools. However, being in these pools exposes gobies to such predators as octopuses and herons. To escape predation, gobies jump to other pools. But how do they know where these other pools are? Their cognitive mapping abilities guide them.To read the entire review: https://www.academia.edu/30147532/Rev..."

155,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"The highlight, for me, occurred early in the book when the author pointed out that because fish can be fooled by optical illusions, some amount of consciousness must exist. It had occurred to me before that you can't have an illusion without consciousness - you can't make someone mis-perceive something if there's noone home to misperceive it (which is, incidentally, part of my problem with Daniel C. Dennett's claim we don't really have consciousness). So that was a wonderful bit of cleverness for me - trying to determine consciousness by fooling the fish.Anyway, fish can be fooled by some of the same stuff we are! They can see the smaller of two circles as larger if there are extra nearby circles making their relative sizes seem different. They also 'finish' shapes in their mind, 'seeing' a triangle that's only hinted at.They also can distinguish musical genres! And he provides convincing evidence that fish feel pain (which, of course, for most of us, is ""duh,"" but science requries agnosticism without good evidence, and some other people are just apologists who reject it out of hand because it's inconvenient).They can tell humans apart. They can cooperate. They make referential gestures across species! Before people noticed moray eels pointing out prey for groupers, the only species known to do that were humans (and tangentially, dogs understanding those gestures), some other apes, and ravens! Of course, the book ends with a section about how humans are evil and we're all doomed because we're killing the planet. I don't deny it - I get it and think it's a critical message, but it came out of left field for me in this book. Still, even that part was interesting, if only for some of the forehead-slappingness of it. For instance - ignoring the morality, farmed fish helps make the industry more sustainable, right? Well, no. Guess what they mostly feed farm fishes? Fish. What's the worst species in an ecosystem to hunt? The apex predator, right? Guess what tuna and marlin and sharks are. Oops.I'm going off on tangents, like the book did at the end. But there's a lot of great, well-explained stuff in here."

158,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/324370-lisa,4,"Jonathan Balcombe is an advocate for fish—or, as he prefers, fishes: “individuals with personalities and relationships”—and makes a strong case for piscine perception in What a Fish Knows: The Inner Lives of Our Underwater Cousins (Farrar, Straus). Weaving together decades of scientific studies of fish consciousness, cognition, and social structure, ethologist Balcombe (author of the lovely The Exultant Ark) offers a picture of fish(es) as complex and sentient beings. Not only do they have acute senses of sight, hearing, and smell, they have the capacity to feel pleasure as well as pain, and some form hierarchical grooming cooperatives, hunt in interspecies packs, help raise nonbiological offspring while waiting their turn to fertilize eggs, or recognize each other after months apart. At times the recitation of “believe it or not” knowledge bites can feel like overreaching to make a point; at others Balcombe edges toward a decidedly unscientific whimsy—he never met a fish pun he didn’t like. But altogether, What a Fish Knows is lively and surprising, making a good argument for sport and food fishing reform.VERDICT: This may ruin readers’ fish dinners forever, but will appeal to fans of odd science and animal rights advocates alike.—My Library Journal review"
159,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2290905-jimmy,5,"Fish are friends. Not food.Very well spoken by some sharks in the beloved movie Finding Nemo. But just how true are those words, especially to us humans? There's plenty of fish out in the sea, and no amount of fishing could ever deplete the vast ocean of all its fish. Could it? The sad answer is yes.Fish are animals, and they have personalities and social lives and experience emotions just like us and any other animal. Balcombe makes the case in his fascinating book What a Fish Knows, and you may come away learning something new from reading this. Perhaps it's the fact that fish are in an entirely different environment separate from our own world that we don't think twice about the sport of fishing, aquaculture, or the delicious baked salmon on the dinner plate. But after reading this, I find myself just a little bit more attuned to the life of a fish.I'll never look at a fish in a tank the same way again. As we develop better technologies and ways to be sustainable, the fishing industry should certainly be on everyone's radar."
160,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2028832-kathleen,3,"I enjoyed the premise of this book, that fish are interesting, evolved animals just as much as many birds and mammals. We should consider as much when we discuss fishing and farming practices, which may involve a great degree of cruelty. Including many interesting facts, studies, and anecdotes, this is a good choice for the casual reader looking for a little natural science. It did not have quite as many photographs in the picture section as I might have liked, but I would look at pictures of fish all day, so that's fair. I suspect this author may be a secret vegan, and I certainly have no intention of not eating fish any time soon, but we can certainly all be more conscious consumers. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who does eat fish, or just wants to learn a little bit about the fascinating underwater world. "

Instead I got a book where the science is used to support the author's personal belief that we need to dramatically change our relationship with fish.And I am sympathetic to that worldview. I think the environmental and ethical issues are genuine and worth examining. But the preaching, which is undeniably the main point of this book, had the opposite effect on me. I questioned whether or not the science presented was genuine or misleading, because there was such an obvious agenda. It didn't help that there were many many places where the conclusions did not follow from the evidence presented. I wanted... a more intellectually honest book."

If they feel pain and if they are aware. Do they have fun? The author also discusses what a fish thinks and if they are intelligent and if they can use tools. The social contracts, co-operation and fish democracy involved in fishey lives, as well as the strange variety of breeding and parenting methods make for interesting reading. As the author says: ""fishes are individuals"", and he does a good job in showing why he thinks that. The book comes with a nice selection of colour photographs."

I thought, now that was something you don't see every day. In the back of my head that fish was still in my head a few weeks later I walked into the library to return a book and saw What A Fish Knows on a highlight shelf. Jonathan Balcombe's volume on the lives of fish is a captivating read, specially considering that the subjects are well fish. Luckily this book is a great dive in the myriad lives of different fishes throughout the world. And it's really about fish, you won't get a lot of talk about mollusks, crustaceans, whales, or other non fish things. It's packed with interesting facts about those denizens of the deep, but it's not just a dry volume of fish facts. There are dozens of charming stories and surprises in What A Fish Knows that I wouldn't have expected, I mean they are fish! There are parts where it boils down to ""no one knows why fish X thing happens."" Which just highlights how little people know about water bound life. It's a fun read until the last chapter that highlights the hellish fishing industries, which really, really, really bummed me out. Not that I was unaware of such things, but it was even harder to read about after learning that fish aren't just biological swimming automatons. The whole thing makes me really think about my tuna sandwiches. But where does that stop? Where is my sympathy towards the tomato pickers? What about the tons of garbage generated by the plastic industry, keeping in mind that the mustard in the fridge is in a plastic container? What's the bread I have really made from? I'm not here to have a crisis of consciousness about my lunch when all I wanted to do is say: every chapter in What a Fish knows can be its own book and the book is worth your time to read. I really liked it and I don't even like going to the aquarium (not from guilt, it just makes me feel oddly claustrophobic) plus finding the ocean just fucking terrifying if I think about it. While it does have some pictures it's not illustrated all the way, so I spent some time looking up various types of fishes that are featured in the book and I can't wait to see what my targeted ads are going to look like soon."
169,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83179136-catherine-puma,3,"Published in 2016, ""What a Fish Knows"" is a popular science nonfiction book that has been on my To Read list for a few years now. Jonathan Balcombe uses anecdotes, interviews, and studies he finds interesting to mention some of what humans have observed about the lives of our underwater cousins. While aquariums, household pets, and decorative koi ponds are also mentioned, most of the tales in this book are about wild examples from African cichlids, to Hawaiian cleaner wrasses, Atlantic goliath grouper, deep-sea lantern fish, and even some touches upon sharks and rays (my personal favorites). I do appreciate the way this is structured. Different parts are about what a fish perceives, feels, thinks, who a fish knows, and how a fish breeds. These parts are then further broken up into chapters on various senses and stimulii, intelligence and problem-solving, social contracts and interactions, and sexual and parenting activities.This book does not have to be read in order, so although a conversation-driven chapter book with a few photos or charts/diagrams/maps, readers can skip to the topics they find most interesting. However, although there are parts of this I really enjoyed and I did learn some interesting facts about different fish species, overall there is something off about the content's presentation. What's being said about fishes is important, but ethologist Balcombe's tone is nearly unbearably pretentious, self-righteous, self-centered, and judgmental. He scoffs at experts and makes fun of the scientific process. He is anti-fisheries and vehemently vegan, but doesn't have anything bad to say about decorative privately-owned aquariums or entertainment facilities like SeaWorld. He's entitled to his own opinions, but he spends too much time JUST being opinionated in this book. This would have been significantly improved if it stressed more on the end of explaining fish-facts. While reading this, I kept thinking about the other popular science nonfiction books about fishes that are so much BETTER than this one. Top choices that come to mind include: - Mark Kurlansky's ""Salmon"", - Sy Montgomery's ""The Soul of an Octopus"", - Paul Greenberg's ""Four Fish"", and - Danna Staaf's ""Squid Empire"". Overall, am I glad I read this? Sure, I guess. But I will be recommending many other books to people before I ever think of recommending this one. "
170,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16959053-seinka,5,"Wonderful, amazing. The writing is at times a little bit dry, but luckily the objects of the author's book are more than making up for that. Did you know that fishes like to be caressed, that some of them have taste buds all over their bodies (650.000 taste buds in total) so they can taste their whole environment (imagine that). Some fishes can split their eyes in 4 so that they can see what's happening above and under water, others can roll over their eyes to one side of the body. Did you know that some fish can change their gender during their lifetimes (hence, the cartoon Finding Nemo is inaccurate in the sense that after Nemo's mom died the father should have taken the female gender and fill in the role as mother), and that length does play a role for fish (they prefer longer over shorter, yes). Fishes take care of their eggs and babies. Some fishes carry their babies in their mouth during the whole pregnancy period, not allowing to eat for months. Some fishes have their penises between their eyes. Culture also plays a role among fishes, or actually many other animals, and fishes have feelings (sense of happiness, joy, sadness). There are many examples of fishes who help each other (one fish swam under the other fish because the one above could not swim well). In this day and age, unfortunately animal knowledge is linked with animal extinction, and the same goes for fishes. Industrialization has created big crates that scrape the bottoms of the oceans to fill our needs for omega 3 and in doing so generating a lot of collateral damage. Factories where fishes are being harvested for our food chain are living in despicable conditions, where some don't get to have food for 8 months simply because it generates more eggs. I probably said too much here, but this is merely a brief summary. The book contains many more marvels and facts about fishes and animals in general. In the worst it will give you some new information. In the best case it will change your world view. We are surrounded by beautiful sentient beings, not just by humans. And that realization on itself is already worth the read."
171,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61946844-amy,5,"What a Fish Knows is a systematic review of research supporting the hypothesis that fish - like our cousins, chimpanzees - are sentient. The book is sorted into sections (such as What a Fish Perceives, What a Fish Feels, Who a Fish Knows), each with chapters exploring a different aspect of the section (the section on Who a Fish Knows, for example, has chapters on cooperative hunting, social contracts, and peacekeeping behavior in intra-species and inter-species pairs/groups). I found the formatting of the chapters and sections to be very helpful and I like the emphasis on evidence-based conclusions. Though there is a liberal sprinkling of anecdotes throughout the book, they are clearly there for illustrative purposes only. The emphasis of each conclusion undoubtedly rests on the weight of the evidence that is cited in every chapter. The last chapter, Fish Out of Water, and the Epilogue are the only parts of the book that are a bit different. Though human actions in relation to fish are referenced throughout the book (and mostly in a research context), Fish Out of Water discusses the actions of humans in the context of fishing practices and the human consumption of sea life. While Balcombe takes pains to point out the already belabored but still important point that current fishing practices are unsustainable, the emphasis of the chapter is on how unethical human actions are in relation to what the reader has just learned about the sentience of fish. Quite frankly, it makes for a nauseating read, but it is a wake-up call that people should have. The epilogue focuses on the people and groups that are currently taking action to include fish in the widely accepted circle of moral concern. It is a very moving chapter that ends on a note of hope for people and for our underwater cousins. Overall, What a Fish Knows is an excellent book, and I would gladly recommend it. "
172,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2790863-allison,5,"I loved this book - and I learned so much. I love all animals and have an appreciation of how they are each individuals, with their own personalities. And while I have believed that fishes are sentient beings, I was not aware of their complexity. I loved the behavioral trial that took a certain type of fish 40 tries to solve it, primates 100 tries and a human child who didn't get it after 100 tries. Unfortunately, though, while the evidence posed in this book should get people to think again about the pain and suffering imposed on these animals, those who believe that all animals are there for us to eat because we're at the top of the food chain won't really care. People see the horrible treatment, pain and suffering on factory farms -- what cows, pigs, chickens and other animals that are used for human consumption are subjected to -- and they don't care. So whether or not they believe that fishes are sentient beings and feel pain, joy, compassion... certainly won't change their behavior. It is a sad, sad fact. However, for those who do care enough about the animals, but might think that it's okay to do this to fishes, because they don't really suffer anyway, well, this book should be a real eye-opener. Just to share a brief story. The last animal I stopped eating (30 years ago) was fish, because I too thought that fish were just above plant life. But one defining moment changed that for me. I was snorkeling for the first time in my life, and a school of beautiful fishes were below me, so I floated above them, trying to swim quietly so I could watch them. They all looked at me as they were swimming below me. It was amazing. I hope you enjoy this book. Whether or not you eat animals, you'll learn a lot. And if you call yourself a vegetarian but you eat fish, please stop. "
173,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40961426-gwen-vandendriessche,4,"Before starting to read this book, I didn’t think much of fishes. I never met that many fishes on my walks except for those who had been caught by birds (Herons, Kingfishers, Gannets, etc.) as food and that didn’t disturb me as I was happy for the birds. However, the sight of a trout looking blindly from my neighbour’s plate was enough to prevent me from eating anything and I had already been attached to a goldfish when I was young, so that was a good start for wanting to know more about them and reading Jonathan Balcombe’s book. At the first page, you understand that the author is really attached to the fishes he is talking about. He isn’t only teaching you facts, but sharing his wonder. This wonder is totally understandable for the lives of many fishes are amazingly complex. Here are a the three facts I was most amazed to learn: fishes can smell fear, some fishes lay their eggs on leaves out of the water and fire water on them to keep them moist, Nemo’s dad should have become a female after the death of his partner! As for many scientific books, I regret that much knowledge about living beings is brought by experiments which often appear really cruel to me. I’d rather not know what it is to be a fish than to know that some of them might have suffered to give me that knowledge (e.g.: injecting stuff in their eyes to know whether they use their sight to navigate!?!). Fortunaltely, only part of the book talks about these experiments.At the end of the book, the author also reminds us of the negative impact of farmed fishes on wildlife and of the disastrous slaughter of sharks and many other species for the food industry. The major part of the book just wants to amaze us, but I think those last pages are also very important to highlighten that the oceans are not endless and that we are making huges damages to their populations."
174,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43848794-samuel,4,"”And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.”‭Of the countless ideas the Bible is responsible for, ”dominion” has arguably been the worst. Instead of understanding life as vast systems of interconnected organisms, of which man is just one, man has made himself arbiter of all other living things. This has allowed us to overlook and diminish the life and intelligence of all other species. Our ignorance has allowed us to remain complacent as we destroy the oceans. Reading ’What A Fish Knows’ by Jonathan Balcombe is eye-opening, though some of it reads like trivia. Did you know that goldfish can recognize individual humans they haven’t seen in months? That tuna is more closely related to humans than they are to sharks? That a lot of fishes enjoy being petted? That they have personal friends and enemies? That cleaner fish do a better job if there are customers waiting their turn (and evaluating the services)? That different species of fish can communicate with one another to help eachother hunt for dinner? Etc etc. Why haven’t we bothered to find out till now? It seems that it may have something to do with facial muscles. Since fish can’t raise eye-brows or smile happily we have simply assumed they’re incognizant. ”What A Fish Knows” is packed with remarkable discoveries about fish. So much so that the last chapter about what we’re doing to destroy the ocean ecology is deeply disturbing. Many species of fish are indeed living in the end days. There’s an ocean apocalypse going on, and man is the destroyer of worlds."
175,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7709596-g-na,5,"Every once in awhile I am lucky enough to read a book that feels like it was written just for me, and this is one of those books. Here Balcombe takes a good look at the cognition and senses of fishes, with chapters on their consciousness, social lives, tool use, and more. Fishes have individual personalities and are much smarter than people realize, and that's something I have seen myself in the many hours I've spent underwater with them.Too many people think of fishes as primitive and unfeeling, and I know many think that fish cannot feel pain - they absolutely can, and studies have proved it! Yes, they live in an environment that is foreign to us, and they have no limbs or eyelids (unnecessary when your surroundings keep your eyes permanently moist), but they are still advanced vertebrates with complex and fully-functioning nervous systems. Because fishes are so different from us people seem to have no qualms about killing them, and the author has devoted a chapter to this sad fact. Today, commercial fisheries pull millions of tons (billions and billions of fish) out of the sea every year, which has resulted in the collapse of various fisheries, and populations of these fishes are dropping to the point where many species are nearing extinction.What a Fish Knows is well-researched and has over 30 pages of references, many of which are peer-reviewed journals. Balcomb did a good job of translating the scientific articles into everyday language for the layperson. This is a fantastic book."
176,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,3,"Early in the book, the author asks why we tend to relegate fishes ""... beyond the outer orbit of our moral concern?"" This obvious object of this book is to raise awareness of the more complex aspects of fish life, hopefully increasing our concern.Part 2 of the book starts by examining fishes in some detail, revealing some surprising facts such as the vast number of eggs some species produce (300 million for an Ocean Sunfish), but also providing a good overview of their vision (they see UV and so some fish body markings are only visible in the UV range), hearing, smelling, touch and navigation senses.Part 3 examines evidence that fish care for each other and play. The author even suggests that when fish jump it may sometimes be for sheer joy.Fish intelligence is the subject of part 4, where the ability of fishes to map their environment and to solve problems suggests at least some species have unexpected abilities.Part 5 looks at relationships and evidence that fish recognize their neighbours, and the possibility that they recognize specific humans. Groupers have been seen to use a headstand signal to indicate to partner moray eels the location of hidden prey. This is interpreted as planning and one group of researchers ""... concluded that the collaborative capabilities of groupers compare favorably with those of chimpanzees.""The complexities of fish sex and parenting are discussed in part 6.The unsustainable practices of fishing are examined in part 7. The book ends with a plea for greater compassion for fishes."
177,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34895792-stacie,3,"3.75 starsWell, now I know some cool stuff about fish. That was mostly interesting, I really enjoyed learning about the different observations and anecdotes throughout the book. I'm fascinated by animals, so any peak into their behavior is a cool experience for me. Though, I do think the writing in certain places became a tad dry and the author's humor was like a bad dad joke (which is why I can't bring myself to give this 4 stars). Also, I saw some other reviews saying the book came off as preachy. I don't know if I fully feel that way. However, full-disclosure, I've been plant-based for a few years so maybe I'm used to the whole animal rights spiel. That being said, from an animal rights/humane side of things, this book didn't really bring anything new to the table. I feel like Balcombe just watched a few documentaries on animal activism and summarized their points in the book's epilogue. But, all of that aside, feel what you want to about fish. I think that the facts and studies about the fish are the more interesting point to pay attention to in the book anyway.If you like marine bio or are interested in animal behavior, this seems like a good introduction to that genre."
178,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32960023-judith,5,"This book has almost (98%) persuaded me to give up eating fish; well, it and what I have read about mercury levels in fish and bits of plastic as well. Given the pollution of our oceans, fish are not a healthy food source; given Balcombe's examination of the intelligence, awareness/consciousness of fish, and the inhumanity of how we capture and kill them, we need to rethink how we ""harvest"" them (and we all should rethink how many children we should have--the projected increase in human population by 2030 is not sustainable at the western world's way of living). Balcombe uses a number of sources, scientific as well as some personal/individual experiences, to argue that fish have intelligence, some at least have exhibited compassion, they can communicate intra- and extra-species (the grouper/moray eel cooperation is astounding), they do feel pain, they can learn from experience (and some kinds of situations they do better than our young children).Readers who are serious about ecology, living lives more sustainably and in amity with other species (rather than recklessly and thoughtlessly exploitatively) should read this book."
179,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65519162-cathy-church,5,"This would be a surprise to anyone who has never even thought that a fish might actually experience pain, fear, avoidance, and much, much more. but the best part is how entertaining Jonathan Balcombe's writing is. This is not a scientific tome, but a refreshing overview of a myriad experiments. As an active scuba diver, I have often wondered just how much a fish really does know. I felt that they remembered me after repeated visits with the same behavior. And sure enough, even a year later, they remember. And Jonathan describes experiments with fish proving that they can even recognize individual human faces when wearing the same red hat when one feeds them and the other doesn't. The red hatted non feeder gets no reaction. The face of the red-hatted feeder sends them scurrying to the surface for food. That may seem minor, but humans certainly can not discern just the facial differences among fish who all look the same to us. There are many more, and better examples, of how cunning they are, how they work to trick others, or cheat others, or show remorse. It will hopefully help you to stop thinking that catch and release is OK. "

183,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105791880-george-jacobs,5,"Jonathan Balcombe, the author of this New York Times best-selling book, has worked for many years as an ethologist (a scientist who studies animal behaviour). He is director of animal sentience at the Humane Society Institute for Science and Policy. His website is www.jonathanbalcombe.com. His other books are The Exultant Art: A Pictorial Tour of Animal Pleasure, Second Nature: The Iinner Livers of Animals, Pleasurable Kingdom: Animals and the Nature of Feeling Good, and The Use of Aanimals in Higher Education: Problems, Alternatives, and Recommendations. 	This review attempts to give readers an understanding of the structure of the book and a sample of some the book’s main points. The review ends with some comments by the reviewer. The book consists of seven parts, some of which are divided into chapters. Balcombe dedicates the book to the “anonymous trillions” of fishes, and he hopes that after reading this book (or a summary thereof) that humans will appreciate that fishes are not objects or grains of sand, but that each of the trillions of fishes is an individual who thinks and feels. Referring to his hopes for each of the approximately 7.4 billion humans’ attitudes towards fishes, Balcombe quotes an anonymous poet, “Nothing has changed except my attitude—so everything has changed” (p. 8). The reviewer believes this book provides valuable resources which ecolinguists can use to change people’s attitudes towards finishes. Prologue	That quote was from the book’s prologue, which includes basic information on fishes and their plight. Balcombe contends that although many, many books have been written about fishes, his is the first book written on behalf of fishes. Other works that seem to be concerned about fishes, talking about endangered species and overexploitation of fish “stocks”, actually focus on fishes as commodities for human use. The lives of fishes, Balcombe believes, have value not primarily for what they offer humans. Instead, all fishes’ lives have value to each of those fishes and those in their communities. 	One estimate puts the number of land animals killed annually for food for humans at about 70 billion. How many fishes are killed each year to feed humans? Balcombe uses an estimate, based on FAO data, that 1 trillion to 2.7 trillion fishes are killed by humans each year. (For other stats, please visit http://www.fishcount.org.uk.) These fishes die mostly from a combination of asphyxiation (when they are taken out of the water), decompression (due to pressure change as they are brought out of the water, being crushed under the weight of the fishes and other marine animals caught with them in the same net and being slaughtered.Part 1 – The Misunderstood Fish	Fishes are an extremely diverse collection of animals, accounting for 33,249 species, 60% of all the known vertebrates, with many more fish species likely yet to be discovered. The two main types of fishes are bony fishes (the largest group), including eels, salmons, basses, goldfishes and carps, and cartilaginous fishes, including sharks and rays. Fishes have been on the Earth much longer than humans: “[Fishes] had graced planet Earth fifty times longer than we have before they even left the water” (p. 13). As to the criticism that fishes’ small brains mean that they must not be able to think or feel, Balcombe counters with the point that miniaturisation allows small objects to function as well as larger ones.		Another misconception about fishes is that because fishes have been on Earth for so many geologic ages, fishes must be primitive creatures who stopped evolving, while other vertebrates, especially mammals, continued evolving. Balcombe (p. 21) explains:All of the fish species that were living at the dawn of legs and lungs are long gone. … The descents of early fishes have been evolving eons longer than their terrestrial counterparts, and on these terms fishes are the most highly evolved of all vertebrates. You might be surprised to know that fishes have the genetic machinery to make fingers—something that shows how similar fishes are to modern mammals. They just don’t develop fingers, but fins instead, since fins are better for swimming than fingers are. Part II – What a Fish Perceives	Part II consists of three chapters – What a Fish Sees, What a Fish Hears, Smells and Tastes, and Navigation, Touch and Beyond - focusing on the senses fishes use to perceive the world around them. All of these abilities are keenly affected by the fact that fishes live in water. For instance, sound travels much faster in water than in air. Given this and other differences in perception, humans may have difficulty understanding how fishes perceive their worlds. What a Fish Sees Fishes’ eyes are much like human eyes, with three pairs of muscles which enable the eyes to swivel. However, fishes’ vision does differ from that of humans, the main difference being that humans have eyelids, while fishes do not. However, other differences also exist. For instance, some fishes, such as adult flounders, have both their eyes on the same side of their bodies. Also, in regard to sight, just as humans use camouflage to fool hostiles, fishes also use visual cues to fool predators. For example, comet fishes lure predators to attack their rear ends, instead of their more sensitive heads. Comet fishes are able to do this because their rear side looks like the face of a parrot fish. What a Fish Hears, Smells and TastesBefore looking at how fishes hear, Balcombe clears up the misconception that fishes are silent creatures. Some of the mechanisms fishes use to make sounds include vibrating their swim bladders, grating and grinding their teeth, rubbing together their bones and pushing bubbles out of their anuses. Indeed, some fishes are named for the sounds they make, for example, grunters, croakers, drums and trumpeters. 	Believing fishes to be silent led to the belief that they were also deaf. This was an easy mistake for human-centric scientists, because fishes have no external hearing devices. Balcombe describes the study by Nobel Prize winning scientist, Karl van Frisch, which demonstrated fishes’ ability to hear, in much the same way that Pavlov demonstrated classical conditioning with dogs. The study’s sole participant was a blind catfish. van Frisch put food on a stick into the fish’s home. Upon smelling the food, the fish would swim towards it. Next, the researcher started whistling before lowering the food for the fish. After a while, all the fish needed was to hear whistling and he would swim towards the usual location of the food. 	Fishes can hear, and they can hear an amazing range of sounds. The fishes in one study demonstrated the ability to categorise human music (Chase, 2011). Chase’s study involved three carps. A speaker was placed in their home, an apparatus for operant conditioning was set up and the fishes learned to discriminate between blues music and classical music, and to categorise newly introduced music as either blues or classical. Another study found that listening to classical music enhanced the health of a group of fishes (Papoutsoglou, Karakatsouli, Papoutsoglou, & Vasilikos, 2010). 	Fishes use their sense of smell for such purposes as identifying their location, locating food and mates and recognising danger. Unlike human nostrils, which function for both smelling and breathing, fish nostrils have only an olfactory function. In some cases, fishes’ olfactory capabilities far exceed those of humans. Balcombe provides examples (p. 50):Salmon can detect the smell of a seal or sea lion diluted to one eighty billionth of water volume … . the American eel … can detect the equivalent of less than one ten millionth of a drop of their home water in [an] Olympic pool. Like salmons, eels make long migrations back to specific spawn sites, and they follow a subtle gradient of scent to get there. 	As to taste, one outstanding aspect of fish anatomy is the presence of taste buds in widely different parts of the body, not just in their mouths. These other locations can include the lips, snout and fins. Also, just as groups of humans tend to have similar tastes in food, e.g., spicy foods are favoured by some cultures, so too are particular foods favoured by given fish species. However, just as is the case with humans, individual fishes may have their idiosyncratic food preferences.Navigation, Touch, and Beyond Fishes, not surprisingly, have superb navigational skills. They navigate by such means as feeling water turbulence caused by the presence of objects, sun compassing, dead reckoning, a natural GPS system, smell, vision and electroreception. How do schools of fishes swim together in unison? Balcombe explains (p. 59):[Fishes have] a row of specialized scales running horizontally along their flanks, forming what is called the lateral line. ... [Each scale ] is populated by neuromasts, clusters of sensory cells each with a hair-like project encased in a tiny cup of gel. … The lateral line acts as a sonarlike system and is especially useful at night and in murky waters.Some fishes seem to enjoy touching and being touched. Touching appears to play a part in courting, in relationships between cleanerfishes and their clients, and even as a form of interaction between fishes and human divers. For example, while the evidence here is anecdotal, Balcombe reports stories of sunbathing fishes and fishes who enjoy the stimulation of the bubbles from divers’ regulators. Part III – What a Fish Feels	Part III consists of two chapters - Pain, Consciousness, and Awareness, and From Stress to Joy. Advocates on behalf of animals are fond of the following quote from the 18th century philosopher, Jeremy Bentham: “The question is not, ‘Can they reason?’ nor, ‘Can they talk?’ but ‘Can they suffer?’”. The two chapters of Part III start with this question and then proceed to happier topics. Pain, Consciousness, and AwarenessNot surprisingly, Balcombe believes that fishes do feel pain. In the book’s previous pages, he made the case for fishes having the same senses and other basic structures as other vertebrates. In this chapter, he notes that fishes have A-delta and C fibres in their nerves; mammals use these fibres to experience pain (Braithwaite, 2010; Sneddon, 2003). However, fishes and other nonmammal vertebrates do not have a neocortex, the body part posited to be the centre of consciousness. Balcombe counters that birds do not have a neocortex either, yet scientists agree that birds have consciousness and can feel pain. Furthermore, fishes’ brains have the pallium which carries out some of the same functions as the neocortex. In additional rebuttal, Balcombe makes the analogy that just as humans can swim despite lacking the fins that fishes employ for that purpose, so too are fishes conscious despite lacking a neocortex. 	While Balcombe cautions that opinion may never be unanimous on the issue of fishes and pain, he quotes a document of the American Veterinary Medical Association to argue that a general consensus has developed among scientists who study fishes (AVMA, 2013):Suggestions that finfish [fish that are not shellfish] responses to pain merely represent simple reflexes have been refuted by studies demonstrating forebrain and midbrain electrical activity in response to stimulation and different with type of nociceptor stimulation. Learning and memory consolidation in trials where finfish are taught to avoid noxious stimuli have moved the issue of finfish cognition and sentience forward to the point where the preponderance of accumulated evidence supports the position that finfish should be accorded the same considerations as terrestrial vertebrates in regard to relief from pain. Balcombe summarises the chapter by stating (pp. 84-85):Fishes show the hallmarks of pain both physiologically and behaviourally. They possess the specialized nerve fibers that mammals and birds use to detect noxious stimuli. They can learn to avoid electric shocks and anglers’ hooks. They are cognitively impaired when subjected to nasty insults to their bodies, and this impairment can be reversed if they are provided with pain relief.From Stress to JoyWhile the first chapter in Part III focused on fishes feeling pain, the second chapter focuses on emotions, beginning with fear and stress but then traveling to happier emotions. Balcombe notes that, “Emotions involve relatively old brain circuits conserved through evolution and shared by all vertebrates” (p. 88). Something similar seems to be the case for hormones that link to emotions. For instance, humans produce the hormone oxytocin, which promotes bonding, and fishes appear to have a similar hormone (Reddon et al., 2012). As to pleasurable emotions, scientists have been witnessing fishes play since 1898 (Groos, 1898). Much more recently, Burghardt, Dinets and Murphy (2014) studied three bfishes apparently playing with a thermometer which had been designed to float vertically. Each of the three fishes had their own way of playing with the thermometer. The first fish pushed down on the top of the thermometer, while the second swam round and round the thermometer occasionally touching and thereby moving it, and the third fish was the most aggressive, hitting the object at various points, thereby making it move around the tank. Part IV – What a Fish Thinks	Part IV consists of two chapters – Fins, Scales and Intelligence, and Tools, Plans and Monkey Minds. Balcombe frames these topics by recognising that the intelligences which different creatures develop are guided by those creatures’ life circumstances. Furthermore, he quotes Dinets to warn against underestimating the cognitive capabilities of nonhuman animals (p. 105), “Every other animal currently considered stupid and boring has its own amazing secrets. It’s just that nobody has been able to discover them yet”. At the same time, Balcombe cautions that just because one fish species or one individual fish demonstrates a particular ability does not mean that all species or all members of a particular species possess or can develop that ability.Fins, Scales and IntelligenceIn what may be the most amazing story in the book, Balcombe describes the cognitive mapping abilities of gobies (White & Brown, 2015). Gobies find their food in small tide pools. However, being in these pools exposes gobies to such predators as octopuses and herons. To escape predation, gobies jump to other pools. But how do they know where these other pools are? Their cognitive mapping abilities guide them.To read the entire review: https://www.academia.edu/30147532/Rev..."

185,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"The highlight, for me, occurred early in the book when the author pointed out that because fish can be fooled by optical illusions, some amount of consciousness must exist. It had occurred to me before that you can't have an illusion without consciousness - you can't make someone mis-perceive something if there's noone home to misperceive it (which is, incidentally, part of my problem with Daniel C. Dennett's claim we don't really have consciousness). So that was a wonderful bit of cleverness for me - trying to determine consciousness by fooling the fish.Anyway, fish can be fooled by some of the same stuff we are! They can see the smaller of two circles as larger if there are extra nearby circles making their relative sizes seem different. They also 'finish' shapes in their mind, 'seeing' a triangle that's only hinted at.They also can distinguish musical genres! And he provides convincing evidence that fish feel pain (which, of course, for most of us, is ""duh,"" but science requries agnosticism without good evidence, and some other people are just apologists who reject it out of hand because it's inconvenient).They can tell humans apart. They can cooperate. They make referential gestures across species! Before people noticed moray eels pointing out prey for groupers, the only species known to do that were humans (and tangentially, dogs understanding those gestures), some other apes, and ravens! Of course, the book ends with a section about how humans are evil and we're all doomed because we're killing the planet. I don't deny it - I get it and think it's a critical message, but it came out of left field for me in this book. Still, even that part was interesting, if only for some of the forehead-slappingness of it. For instance - ignoring the morality, farmed fish helps make the industry more sustainable, right? Well, no. Guess what they mostly feed farm fishes? Fish. What's the worst species in an ecosystem to hunt? The apex predator, right? Guess what tuna and marlin and sharks are. Oops.I'm going off on tangents, like the book did at the end. But there's a lot of great, well-explained stuff in here."

Please note the assignment of ONE star to this... umm... publication. I HAD to give it a star to review it. It actually deserves ZERO stars. I guess I could give it one star for the apparent effort it took to pull together the information the author so brutally misused in the text. But then I realized how easy it is for an unpaid intern to do that job with any reasonable search engine. So... ZERO STARS!The Book can best be described as ""one dry fact stated and (mis)interpreted followed by another dry fact stated and anthropomorphized."" Repeat. Repeat. YAWN Repeat.This book epitomizes the very worst of science writing. Mary Roach would be appalled at the lack of rigor. She would cringe at the author's worse-than-lame attempts at humour. Journal articles laying out the base-pair sequence of some obscure gene are no less boring.Apart from being a waste of ink and causing the senseless death of many trees, this book provides any untrained and/or naive reader with a totally warped view of mainstream research into the physiology, ecology, evolution and ethology of fishes. If you read it and take the information to your next cocktail party as grist for the banter mill, you will be guilty of crimes against fish and crimes against science.Budding authors... pay heed... if you want to learn how NOT to write popularized science, read this book.

188,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/324370-lisa,4,"Jonathan Balcombe is an advocate for fish—or, as he prefers, fishes: “individuals with personalities and relationships”—and makes a strong case for piscine perception in What a Fish Knows: The Inner Lives of Our Underwater Cousins (Farrar, Straus). Weaving together decades of scientific studies of fish consciousness, cognition, and social structure, ethologist Balcombe (author of the lovely The Exultant Ark) offers a picture of fish(es) as complex and sentient beings. Not only do they have acute senses of sight, hearing, and smell, they have the capacity to feel pleasure as well as pain, and some form hierarchical grooming cooperatives, hunt in interspecies packs, help raise nonbiological offspring while waiting their turn to fertilize eggs, or recognize each other after months apart. At times the recitation of “believe it or not” knowledge bites can feel like overreaching to make a point; at others Balcombe edges toward a decidedly unscientific whimsy—he never met a fish pun he didn’t like. But altogether, What a Fish Knows is lively and surprising, making a good argument for sport and food fishing reform.VERDICT: This may ruin readers’ fish dinners forever, but will appeal to fans of odd science and animal rights advocates alike.—My Library Journal review"
189,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2290905-jimmy,5,"Fish are friends. Not food.Very well spoken by some sharks in the beloved movie Finding Nemo. But just how true are those words, especially to us humans? There's plenty of fish out in the sea, and no amount of fishing could ever deplete the vast ocean of all its fish. Could it? The sad answer is yes.Fish are animals, and they have personalities and social lives and experience emotions just like us and any other animal. Balcombe makes the case in his fascinating book What a Fish Knows, and you may come away learning something new from reading this. Perhaps it's the fact that fish are in an entirely different environment separate from our own world that we don't think twice about the sport of fishing, aquaculture, or the delicious baked salmon on the dinner plate. But after reading this, I find myself just a little bit more attuned to the life of a fish.I'll never look at a fish in a tank the same way again. As we develop better technologies and ways to be sustainable, the fishing industry should certainly be on everyone's radar."
190,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2028832-kathleen,3,"I enjoyed the premise of this book, that fish are interesting, evolved animals just as much as many birds and mammals. We should consider as much when we discuss fishing and farming practices, which may involve a great degree of cruelty. Including many interesting facts, studies, and anecdotes, this is a good choice for the casual reader looking for a little natural science. It did not have quite as many photographs in the picture section as I might have liked, but I would look at pictures of fish all day, so that's fair. I suspect this author may be a secret vegan, and I certainly have no intention of not eating fish any time soon, but we can certainly all be more conscious consumers. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who does eat fish, or just wants to learn a little bit about the fascinating underwater world. "

Instead I got a book where the science is used to support the author's personal belief that we need to dramatically change our relationship with fish.And I am sympathetic to that worldview. I think the environmental and ethical issues are genuine and worth examining. But the preaching, which is undeniably the main point of this book, had the opposite effect on me. I questioned whether or not the science presented was genuine or misleading, because there was such an obvious agenda. It didn't help that there were many many places where the conclusions did not follow from the evidence presented. I wanted... a more intellectually honest book."

If they feel pain and if they are aware. Do they have fun? The author also discusses what a fish thinks and if they are intelligent and if they can use tools. The social contracts, co-operation and fish democracy involved in fishey lives, as well as the strange variety of breeding and parenting methods make for interesting reading. As the author says: ""fishes are individuals"", and he does a good job in showing why he thinks that. The book comes with a nice selection of colour photographs."

The parts towards the end about fishing were pretty horrifying to me, especially after all the indications that fish are individual creatures with individual lives and intelligence and personalities and that definitely feel pain, and it made me very thankful that I became a vegetarian years ago. If I hadn't, this book might have put me over the edge. "
194,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4152463-s,2,"To the good: I liked the description of many facets of fishes lives, behaviors, and putative experiences. To the bad: The language is sometimes a little clunky, and Balcombe doesn't disguise his agenda, which is to convince you to empathize more with fish.

I thought, now that was something you don't see every day. In the back of my head that fish was still in my head a few weeks later I walked into the library to return a book and saw What A Fish Knows on a highlight shelf. Jonathan Balcombe's volume on the lives of fish is a captivating read, specially considering that the subjects are well fish. Luckily this book is a great dive in the myriad lives of different fishes throughout the world. And it's really about fish, you won't get a lot of talk about mollusks, crustaceans, whales, or other non fish things. It's packed with interesting facts about those denizens of the deep, but it's not just a dry volume of fish facts. There are dozens of charming stories and surprises in What A Fish Knows that I wouldn't have expected, I mean they are fish! There are parts where it boils down to ""no one knows why fish X thing happens."" Which just highlights how little people know about water bound life. It's a fun read until the last chapter that highlights the hellish fishing industries, which really, really, really bummed me out. Not that I was unaware of such things, but it was even harder to read about after learning that fish aren't just biological swimming automatons. The whole thing makes me really think about my tuna sandwiches. But where does that stop? Where is my sympathy towards the tomato pickers? What about the tons of garbage generated by the plastic industry, keeping in mind that the mustard in the fridge is in a plastic container? What's the bread I have really made from? I'm not here to have a crisis of consciousness about my lunch when all I wanted to do is say: every chapter in What a Fish knows can be its own book and the book is worth your time to read. I really liked it and I don't even like going to the aquarium (not from guilt, it just makes me feel oddly claustrophobic) plus finding the ocean just fucking terrifying if I think about it. While it does have some pictures it's not illustrated all the way, so I spent some time looking up various types of fishes that are featured in the book and I can't wait to see what my targeted ads are going to look like soon."
199,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83179136-catherine-puma,3,"Published in 2016, ""What a Fish Knows"" is a popular science nonfiction book that has been on my To Read list for a few years now. Jonathan Balcombe uses anecdotes, interviews, and studies he finds interesting to mention some of what humans have observed about the lives of our underwater cousins. While aquariums, household pets, and decorative koi ponds are also mentioned, most of the tales in this book are about wild examples from African cichlids, to Hawaiian cleaner wrasses, Atlantic goliath grouper, deep-sea lantern fish, and even some touches upon sharks and rays (my personal favorites). I do appreciate the way this is structured. Different parts are about what a fish perceives, feels, thinks, who a fish knows, and how a fish breeds. These parts are then further broken up into chapters on various senses and stimulii, intelligence and problem-solving, social contracts and interactions, and sexual and parenting activities.This book does not have to be read in order, so although a conversation-driven chapter book with a few photos or charts/diagrams/maps, readers can skip to the topics they find most interesting. However, although there are parts of this I really enjoyed and I did learn some interesting facts about different fish species, overall there is something off about the content's presentation. What's being said about fishes is important, but ethologist Balcombe's tone is nearly unbearably pretentious, self-righteous, self-centered, and judgmental. He scoffs at experts and makes fun of the scientific process. He is anti-fisheries and vehemently vegan, but doesn't have anything bad to say about decorative privately-owned aquariums or entertainment facilities like SeaWorld. He's entitled to his own opinions, but he spends too much time JUST being opinionated in this book. This would have been significantly improved if it stressed more on the end of explaining fish-facts. While reading this, I kept thinking about the other popular science nonfiction books about fishes that are so much BETTER than this one. Top choices that come to mind include: - Mark Kurlansky's ""Salmon"", - Sy Montgomery's ""The Soul of an Octopus"", - Paul Greenberg's ""Four Fish"", and - Danna Staaf's ""Squid Empire"". Overall, am I glad I read this? Sure, I guess. But I will be recommending many other books to people before I ever think of recommending this one. "
200,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16959053-seinka,5,"Wonderful, amazing. The writing is at times a little bit dry, but luckily the objects of the author's book are more than making up for that. Did you know that fishes like to be caressed, that some of them have taste buds all over their bodies (650.000 taste buds in total) so they can taste their whole environment (imagine that). Some fishes can split their eyes in 4 so that they can see what's happening above and under water, others can roll over their eyes to one side of the body. Did you know that some fish can change their gender during their lifetimes (hence, the cartoon Finding Nemo is inaccurate in the sense that after Nemo's mom died the father should have taken the female gender and fill in the role as mother), and that length does play a role for fish (they prefer longer over shorter, yes). Fishes take care of their eggs and babies. Some fishes carry their babies in their mouth during the whole pregnancy period, not allowing to eat for months. Some fishes have their penises between their eyes. Culture also plays a role among fishes, or actually many other animals, and fishes have feelings (sense of happiness, joy, sadness). There are many examples of fishes who help each other (one fish swam under the other fish because the one above could not swim well). In this day and age, unfortunately animal knowledge is linked with animal extinction, and the same goes for fishes. Industrialization has created big crates that scrape the bottoms of the oceans to fill our needs for omega 3 and in doing so generating a lot of collateral damage. Factories where fishes are being harvested for our food chain are living in despicable conditions, where some don't get to have food for 8 months simply because it generates more eggs. I probably said too much here, but this is merely a brief summary. The book contains many more marvels and facts about fishes and animals in general. In the worst it will give you some new information. In the best case it will change your world view. We are surrounded by beautiful sentient beings, not just by humans. And that realization on itself is already worth the read."

The book is sorted into sections (such as What a Fish Perceives, What a Fish Feels, Who a Fish Knows), each with chapters exploring a different aspect of the section (the section on Who a Fish Knows, for example, has chapters on cooperative hunting, social contracts, and peacekeeping behavior in intra-species and inter-species pairs/groups). I found the formatting of the chapters and sections to be very helpful and I like the emphasis on evidence-based conclusions. Though there is a liberal sprinkling of anecdotes throughout the book, they are clearly there for illustrative purposes only. The emphasis of each conclusion undoubtedly rests on the weight of the evidence that is cited in every chapter. The last chapter, Fish Out of Water, and the Epilogue are the only parts of the book that are a bit different. Though human actions in relation to fish are referenced throughout the book (and mostly in a research context), Fish Out of Water discusses the actions of humans in the context of fishing practices and the human consumption of sea life. While Balcombe takes pains to point out the already belabored but still important point that current fishing practices are unsustainable, the emphasis of the chapter is on how unethical human actions are in relation to what the reader has just learned about the sentience of fish. Quite frankly, it makes for a nauseating read, but it is a wake-up call that people should have. The epilogue focuses on the people and groups that are currently taking action to include fish in the widely accepted circle of moral concern. It is a very moving chapter that ends on a note of hope for people and for our underwater cousins. Overall, What a Fish Knows is an excellent book, and I would gladly recommend it. "
202,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2790863-allison,5,"I loved this book - and I learned so much. I love all animals and have an appreciation of how they are each individuals, with their own personalities. And while I have believed that fishes are sentient beings, I was not aware of their complexity. I loved the behavioral trial that took a certain type of fish 40 tries to solve it, primates 100 tries and a human child who didn't get it after 100 tries. Unfortunately, though, while the evidence posed in this book should get people to think again about the pain and suffering imposed on these animals, those who believe that all animals are there for us to eat because we're at the top of the food chain won't really care. People see the horrible treatment, pain and suffering on factory farms -- what cows, pigs, chickens and other animals that are used for human consumption are subjected to -- and they don't care. So whether or not they believe that fishes are sentient beings and feel pain, joy, compassion... certainly won't change their behavior. It is a sad, sad fact. However, for those who do care enough about the animals, but might think that it's okay to do this to fishes, because they don't really suffer anyway, well, this book should be a real eye-opener. Just to share a brief story. The last animal I stopped eating (30 years ago) was fish, because I too thought that fish were just above plant life. But one defining moment changed that for me. I was snorkeling for the first time in my life, and a school of beautiful fishes were below me, so I floated above them, trying to swim quietly so I could watch them. They all looked at me as they were swimming below me. It was amazing. I hope you enjoy this book. Whether or not you eat animals, you'll learn a lot. And if you call yourself a vegetarian but you eat fish, please stop. "
203,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40961426-gwen-vandendriessche,4,"Before starting to read this book, I didn’t think much of fishes. I never met that many fishes on my walks except for those who had been caught by birds (Herons, Kingfishers, Gannets, etc.) as food and that didn’t disturb me as I was happy for the birds. However, the sight of a trout looking blindly from my neighbour’s plate was enough to prevent me from eating anything and I had already been attached to a goldfish when I was young, so that was a good start for wanting to know more about them and reading Jonathan Balcombe’s book. At the first page, you understand that the author is really attached to the fishes he is talking about. He isn’t only teaching you facts, but sharing his wonder. This wonder is totally understandable for the lives of many fishes are amazingly complex. Here are a the three facts I was most amazed to learn: fishes can smell fear, some fishes lay their eggs on leaves out of the water and fire water on them to keep them moist, Nemo’s dad should have become a female after the death of his partner! As for many scientific books, I regret that much knowledge about living beings is brought by experiments which often appear really cruel to me. I’d rather not know what it is to be a fish than to know that some of them might have suffered to give me that knowledge (e.g.: injecting stuff in their eyes to know whether they use their sight to navigate!?!). Fortunaltely, only part of the book talks about these experiments.At the end of the book, the author also reminds us of the negative impact of farmed fishes on wildlife and of the disastrous slaughter of sharks and many other species for the food industry. The major part of the book just wants to amaze us, but I think those last pages are also very important to highlighten that the oceans are not endless and that we are making huges damages to their populations."
204,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43848794-samuel,4,"”And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.”‭Of the countless ideas the Bible is responsible for, ”dominion” has arguably been the worst. Instead of understanding life as vast systems of interconnected organisms, of which man is just one, man has made himself arbiter of all other living things. This has allowed us to overlook and diminish the life and intelligence of all other species. Our ignorance has allowed us to remain complacent as we destroy the oceans. Reading ’What A Fish Knows’ by Jonathan Balcombe is eye-opening, though some of it reads like trivia. Did you know that goldfish can recognize individual humans they haven’t seen in months? That tuna is more closely related to humans than they are to sharks? That a lot of fishes enjoy being petted? That they have personal friends and enemies? That cleaner fish do a better job if there are customers waiting their turn (and evaluating the services)? That different species of fish can communicate with one another to help eachother hunt for dinner? Etc etc. Why haven’t we bothered to find out till now? It seems that it may have something to do with facial muscles. Since fish can’t raise eye-brows or smile happily we have simply assumed they’re incognizant. ”What A Fish Knows” is packed with remarkable discoveries about fish. So much so that the last chapter about what we’re doing to destroy the ocean ecology is deeply disturbing. Many species of fish are indeed living in the end days. There’s an ocean apocalypse going on, and man is the destroyer of worlds."
205,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7709596-g-na,5,"Every once in awhile I am lucky enough to read a book that feels like it was written just for me, and this is one of those books. Here Balcombe takes a good look at the cognition and senses of fishes, with chapters on their consciousness, social lives, tool use, and more. Fishes have individual personalities and are much smarter than people realize, and that's something I have seen myself in the many hours I've spent underwater with them.Too many people think of fishes as primitive and unfeeling, and I know many think that fish cannot feel pain - they absolutely can, and studies have proved it! Yes, they live in an environment that is foreign to us, and they have no limbs or eyelids (unnecessary when your surroundings keep your eyes permanently moist), but they are still advanced vertebrates with complex and fully-functioning nervous systems. Because fishes are so different from us people seem to have no qualms about killing them, and the author has devoted a chapter to this sad fact. Today, commercial fisheries pull millions of tons (billions and billions of fish) out of the sea every year, which has resulted in the collapse of various fisheries, and populations of these fishes are dropping to the point where many species are nearing extinction.What a Fish Knows is well-researched and has over 30 pages of references, many of which are peer-reviewed journals. Balcomb did a good job of translating the scientific articles into everyday language for the layperson. This is a fantastic book."
206,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,3,"Early in the book, the author asks why we tend to relegate fishes ""... beyond the outer orbit of our moral concern?"" This obvious object of this book is to raise awareness of the more complex aspects of fish life, hopefully increasing our concern.Part 2 of the book starts by examining fishes in some detail, revealing some surprising facts such as the vast number of eggs some species produce (300 million for an Ocean Sunfish), but also providing a good overview of their vision (they see UV and so some fish body markings are only visible in the UV range), hearing, smelling, touch and navigation senses.Part 3 examines evidence that fish care for each other and play. The author even suggests that when fish jump it may sometimes be for sheer joy.Fish intelligence is the subject of part 4, where the ability of fishes to map their environment and to solve problems suggests at least some species have unexpected abilities.Part 5 looks at relationships and evidence that fish recognize their neighbours, and the possibility that they recognize specific humans. Groupers have been seen to use a headstand signal to indicate to partner moray eels the location of hidden prey. This is interpreted as planning and one group of researchers ""... concluded that the collaborative capabilities of groupers compare favorably with those of chimpanzees.""The complexities of fish sex and parenting are discussed in part 6.The unsustainable practices of fishing are examined in part 7. The book ends with a plea for greater compassion for fishes."

That was mostly interesting, I really enjoyed learning about the different observations and anecdotes throughout the book. I'm fascinated by animals, so any peak into their behavior is a cool experience for me. Though, I do think the writing in certain places became a tad dry and the author's humor was like a bad dad joke (which is why I can't bring myself to give this 4 stars). Also, I saw some other reviews saying the book came off as preachy. I don't know if I fully feel that way. However, full-disclosure, I've been plant-based for a few years so maybe I'm used to the whole animal rights spiel. That being said, from an animal rights/humane side of things, this book didn't really bring anything new to the table. I feel like Balcombe just watched a few documentaries on animal activism and summarized their points in the book's epilogue. But, all of that aside, feel what you want to about fish. I think that the facts and studies about the fish are the more interesting point to pay attention to in the book anyway.If you like marine bio or are interested in animal behavior, this seems like a good introduction to that genre."
208,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32960023-judith,5,"This book has almost (98%) persuaded me to give up eating fish; well, it and what I have read about mercury levels in fish and bits of plastic as well. Given the pollution of our oceans, fish are not a healthy food source; given Balcombe's examination of the intelligence, awareness/consciousness of fish, and the inhumanity of how we capture and kill them, we need to rethink how we ""harvest"" them (and we all should rethink how many children we should have--the projected increase in human population by 2030 is not sustainable at the western world's way of living). Balcombe uses a number of sources, scientific as well as some personal/individual experiences, to argue that fish have intelligence, some at least have exhibited compassion, they can communicate intra- and extra-species (the grouper/moray eel cooperation is astounding), they do feel pain, they can learn from experience (and some kinds of situations they do better than our young children).Readers who are serious about ecology, living lives more sustainably and in amity with other species (rather than recklessly and thoughtlessly exploitatively) should read this book."
209,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65519162-cathy-church,5,"This would be a surprise to anyone who has never even thought that a fish might actually experience pain, fear, avoidance, and much, much more. but the best part is how entertaining Jonathan Balcombe's writing is. This is not a scientific tome, but a refreshing overview of a myriad experiments. As an active scuba diver, I have often wondered just how much a fish really does know. I felt that they remembered me after repeated visits with the same behavior. And sure enough, even a year later, they remember. And Jonathan describes experiments with fish proving that they can even recognize individual human faces when wearing the same red hat when one feeds them and the other doesn't. The red hatted non feeder gets no reaction. The face of the red-hatted feeder sends them scurrying to the surface for food. That may seem minor, but humans certainly can not discern just the facial differences among fish who all look the same to us. There are many more, and better examples, of how cunning they are, how they work to trick others, or cheat others, or show remorse. It will hopefully help you to stop thinking that catch and release is OK. "

213,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105791880-george-jacobs,5,"Jonathan Balcombe, the author of this New York Times best-selling book, has worked for many years as an ethologist (a scientist who studies animal behaviour). He is director of animal sentience at the Humane Society Institute for Science and Policy. His website is www.jonathanbalcombe.com. His other books are The Exultant Art: A Pictorial Tour of Animal Pleasure, Second Nature: The Iinner Livers of Animals, Pleasurable Kingdom: Animals and the Nature of Feeling Good, and The Use of Aanimals in Higher Education: Problems, Alternatives, and Recommendations. 	This review attempts to give readers an understanding of the structure of the book and a sample of some the book’s main points. The review ends with some comments by the reviewer. The book consists of seven parts, some of which are divided into chapters. Balcombe dedicates the book to the “anonymous trillions” of fishes, and he hopes that after reading this book (or a summary thereof) that humans will appreciate that fishes are not objects or grains of sand, but that each of the trillions of fishes is an individual who thinks and feels. Referring to his hopes for each of the approximately 7.4 billion humans’ attitudes towards fishes, Balcombe quotes an anonymous poet, “Nothing has changed except my attitude—so everything has changed” (p. 8). The reviewer believes this book provides valuable resources which ecolinguists can use to change people’s attitudes towards finishes. Prologue	That quote was from the book’s prologue, which includes basic information on fishes and their plight. Balcombe contends that although many, many books have been written about fishes, his is the first book written on behalf of fishes. Other works that seem to be concerned about fishes, talking about endangered species and overexploitation of fish “stocks”, actually focus on fishes as commodities for human use. The lives of fishes, Balcombe believes, have value not primarily for what they offer humans. Instead, all fishes’ lives have value to each of those fishes and those in their communities. 	One estimate puts the number of land animals killed annually for food for humans at about 70 billion. How many fishes are killed each year to feed humans? Balcombe uses an estimate, based on FAO data, that 1 trillion to 2.7 trillion fishes are killed by humans each year. (For other stats, please visit http://www.fishcount.org.uk.) These fishes die mostly from a combination of asphyxiation (when they are taken out of the water), decompression (due to pressure change as they are brought out of the water, being crushed under the weight of the fishes and other marine animals caught with them in the same net and being slaughtered.Part 1 – The Misunderstood Fish	Fishes are an extremely diverse collection of animals, accounting for 33,249 species, 60% of all the known vertebrates, with many more fish species likely yet to be discovered. The two main types of fishes are bony fishes (the largest group), including eels, salmons, basses, goldfishes and carps, and cartilaginous fishes, including sharks and rays. Fishes have been on the Earth much longer than humans: “[Fishes] had graced planet Earth fifty times longer than we have before they even left the water” (p. 13). As to the criticism that fishes’ small brains mean that they must not be able to think or feel, Balcombe counters with the point that miniaturisation allows small objects to function as well as larger ones.		Another misconception about fishes is that because fishes have been on Earth for so many geologic ages, fishes must be primitive creatures who stopped evolving, while other vertebrates, especially mammals, continued evolving. Balcombe (p. 21) explains:All of the fish species that were living at the dawn of legs and lungs are long gone. … The descents of early fishes have been evolving eons longer than their terrestrial counterparts, and on these terms fishes are the most highly evolved of all vertebrates. You might be surprised to know that fishes have the genetic machinery to make fingers—something that shows how similar fishes are to modern mammals. They just don’t develop fingers, but fins instead, since fins are better for swimming than fingers are. Part II – What a Fish Perceives	Part II consists of three chapters – What a Fish Sees, What a Fish Hears, Smells and Tastes, and Navigation, Touch and Beyond - focusing on the senses fishes use to perceive the world around them. All of these abilities are keenly affected by the fact that fishes live in water. For instance, sound travels much faster in water than in air. Given this and other differences in perception, humans may have difficulty understanding how fishes perceive their worlds. What a Fish Sees Fishes’ eyes are much like human eyes, with three pairs of muscles which enable the eyes to swivel. However, fishes’ vision does differ from that of humans, the main difference being that humans have eyelids, while fishes do not. However, other differences also exist. For instance, some fishes, such as adult flounders, have both their eyes on the same side of their bodies. Also, in regard to sight, just as humans use camouflage to fool hostiles, fishes also use visual cues to fool predators. For example, comet fishes lure predators to attack their rear ends, instead of their more sensitive heads. Comet fishes are able to do this because their rear side looks like the face of a parrot fish. What a Fish Hears, Smells and TastesBefore looking at how fishes hear, Balcombe clears up the misconception that fishes are silent creatures. Some of the mechanisms fishes use to make sounds include vibrating their swim bladders, grating and grinding their teeth, rubbing together their bones and pushing bubbles out of their anuses. Indeed, some fishes are named for the sounds they make, for example, grunters, croakers, drums and trumpeters. 	Believing fishes to be silent led to the belief that they were also deaf. This was an easy mistake for human-centric scientists, because fishes have no external hearing devices. Balcombe describes the study by Nobel Prize winning scientist, Karl van Frisch, which demonstrated fishes’ ability to hear, in much the same way that Pavlov demonstrated classical conditioning with dogs. The study’s sole participant was a blind catfish. van Frisch put food on a stick into the fish’s home. Upon smelling the food, the fish would swim towards it. Next, the researcher started whistling before lowering the food for the fish. After a while, all the fish needed was to hear whistling and he would swim towards the usual location of the food. 	Fishes can hear, and they can hear an amazing range of sounds. The fishes in one study demonstrated the ability to categorise human music (Chase, 2011). Chase’s study involved three carps. A speaker was placed in their home, an apparatus for operant conditioning was set up and the fishes learned to discriminate between blues music and classical music, and to categorise newly introduced music as either blues or classical. Another study found that listening to classical music enhanced the health of a group of fishes (Papoutsoglou, Karakatsouli, Papoutsoglou, & Vasilikos, 2010). 	Fishes use their sense of smell for such purposes as identifying their location, locating food and mates and recognising danger. Unlike human nostrils, which function for both smelling and breathing, fish nostrils have only an olfactory function. In some cases, fishes’ olfactory capabilities far exceed those of humans. Balcombe provides examples (p. 50):Salmon can detect the smell of a seal or sea lion diluted to one eighty billionth of water volume … . the American eel … can detect the equivalent of less than one ten millionth of a drop of their home water in [an] Olympic pool. Like salmons, eels make long migrations back to specific spawn sites, and they follow a subtle gradient of scent to get there. 	As to taste, one outstanding aspect of fish anatomy is the presence of taste buds in widely different parts of the body, not just in their mouths. These other locations can include the lips, snout and fins. Also, just as groups of humans tend to have similar tastes in food, e.g., spicy foods are favoured by some cultures, so too are particular foods favoured by given fish species. However, just as is the case with humans, individual fishes may have their idiosyncratic food preferences.Navigation, Touch, and Beyond Fishes, not surprisingly, have superb navigational skills. They navigate by such means as feeling water turbulence caused by the presence of objects, sun compassing, dead reckoning, a natural GPS system, smell, vision and electroreception. How do schools of fishes swim together in unison? Balcombe explains (p. 59):[Fishes have] a row of specialized scales running horizontally along their flanks, forming what is called the lateral line. ... [Each scale ] is populated by neuromasts, clusters of sensory cells each with a hair-like project encased in a tiny cup of gel. … The lateral line acts as a sonarlike system and is especially useful at night and in murky waters.Some fishes seem to enjoy touching and being touched. Touching appears to play a part in courting, in relationships between cleanerfishes and their clients, and even as a form of interaction between fishes and human divers. For example, while the evidence here is anecdotal, Balcombe reports stories of sunbathing fishes and fishes who enjoy the stimulation of the bubbles from divers’ regulators. Part III – What a Fish Feels	Part III consists of two chapters - Pain, Consciousness, and Awareness, and From Stress to Joy. Advocates on behalf of animals are fond of the following quote from the 18th century philosopher, Jeremy Bentham: “The question is not, ‘Can they reason?’ nor, ‘Can they talk?’ but ‘Can they suffer?’”. The two chapters of Part III start with this question and then proceed to happier topics. Pain, Consciousness, and AwarenessNot surprisingly, Balcombe believes that fishes do feel pain. In the book’s previous pages, he made the case for fishes having the same senses and other basic structures as other vertebrates. In this chapter, he notes that fishes have A-delta and C fibres in their nerves; mammals use these fibres to experience pain (Braithwaite, 2010; Sneddon, 2003). However, fishes and other nonmammal vertebrates do not have a neocortex, the body part posited to be the centre of consciousness. Balcombe counters that birds do not have a neocortex either, yet scientists agree that birds have consciousness and can feel pain. Furthermore, fishes’ brains have the pallium which carries out some of the same functions as the neocortex. In additional rebuttal, Balcombe makes the analogy that just as humans can swim despite lacking the fins that fishes employ for that purpose, so too are fishes conscious despite lacking a neocortex. 	While Balcombe cautions that opinion may never be unanimous on the issue of fishes and pain, he quotes a document of the American Veterinary Medical Association to argue that a general consensus has developed among scientists who study fishes (AVMA, 2013):Suggestions that finfish [fish that are not shellfish] responses to pain merely represent simple reflexes have been refuted by studies demonstrating forebrain and midbrain electrical activity in response to stimulation and different with type of nociceptor stimulation. Learning and memory consolidation in trials where finfish are taught to avoid noxious stimuli have moved the issue of finfish cognition and sentience forward to the point where the preponderance of accumulated evidence supports the position that finfish should be accorded the same considerations as terrestrial vertebrates in regard to relief from pain. Balcombe summarises the chapter by stating (pp. 84-85):Fishes show the hallmarks of pain both physiologically and behaviourally. They possess the specialized nerve fibers that mammals and birds use to detect noxious stimuli. They can learn to avoid electric shocks and anglers’ hooks. They are cognitively impaired when subjected to nasty insults to their bodies, and this impairment can be reversed if they are provided with pain relief.From Stress to JoyWhile the first chapter in Part III focused on fishes feeling pain, the second chapter focuses on emotions, beginning with fear and stress but then traveling to happier emotions. Balcombe notes that, “Emotions involve relatively old brain circuits conserved through evolution and shared by all vertebrates” (p. 88). Something similar seems to be the case for hormones that link to emotions. For instance, humans produce the hormone oxytocin, which promotes bonding, and fishes appear to have a similar hormone (Reddon et al., 2012). As to pleasurable emotions, scientists have been witnessing fishes play since 1898 (Groos, 1898). Much more recently, Burghardt, Dinets and Murphy (2014) studied three bfishes apparently playing with a thermometer which had been designed to float vertically. Each of the three fishes had their own way of playing with the thermometer. The first fish pushed down on the top of the thermometer, while the second swam round and round the thermometer occasionally touching and thereby moving it, and the third fish was the most aggressive, hitting the object at various points, thereby making it move around the tank. Part IV – What a Fish Thinks	Part IV consists of two chapters – Fins, Scales and Intelligence, and Tools, Plans and Monkey Minds. Balcombe frames these topics by recognising that the intelligences which different creatures develop are guided by those creatures’ life circumstances. Furthermore, he quotes Dinets to warn against underestimating the cognitive capabilities of nonhuman animals (p. 105), “Every other animal currently considered stupid and boring has its own amazing secrets. It’s just that nobody has been able to discover them yet”. At the same time, Balcombe cautions that just because one fish species or one individual fish demonstrates a particular ability does not mean that all species or all members of a particular species possess or can develop that ability.Fins, Scales and IntelligenceIn what may be the most amazing story in the book, Balcombe describes the cognitive mapping abilities of gobies (White & Brown, 2015). Gobies find their food in small tide pools. However, being in these pools exposes gobies to such predators as octopuses and herons. To escape predation, gobies jump to other pools. But how do they know where these other pools are? Their cognitive mapping abilities guide them.To read the entire review: https://www.academia.edu/30147532/Rev..."

215,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"The highlight, for me, occurred early in the book when the author pointed out that because fish can be fooled by optical illusions, some amount of consciousness must exist. It had occurred to me before that you can't have an illusion without consciousness - you can't make someone mis-perceive something if there's noone home to misperceive it (which is, incidentally, part of my problem with Daniel C. Dennett's claim we don't really have consciousness). So that was a wonderful bit of cleverness for me - trying to determine consciousness by fooling the fish.Anyway, fish can be fooled by some of the same stuff we are! They can see the smaller of two circles as larger if there are extra nearby circles making their relative sizes seem different. They also 'finish' shapes in their mind, 'seeing' a triangle that's only hinted at.They also can distinguish musical genres! And he provides convincing evidence that fish feel pain (which, of course, for most of us, is ""duh,"" but science requries agnosticism without good evidence, and some other people are just apologists who reject it out of hand because it's inconvenient).They can tell humans apart. They can cooperate. They make referential gestures across species! Before people noticed moray eels pointing out prey for groupers, the only species known to do that were humans (and tangentially, dogs understanding those gestures), some other apes, and ravens! Of course, the book ends with a section about how humans are evil and we're all doomed because we're killing the planet. I don't deny it - I get it and think it's a critical message, but it came out of left field for me in this book. Still, even that part was interesting, if only for some of the forehead-slappingness of it. For instance - ignoring the morality, farmed fish helps make the industry more sustainable, right? Well, no. Guess what they mostly feed farm fishes? Fish. What's the worst species in an ecosystem to hunt? The apex predator, right? Guess what tuna and marlin and sharks are. Oops.I'm going off on tangents, like the book did at the end. But there's a lot of great, well-explained stuff in here."

217,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4177416-heather,5,Excellent book. Well researched and interesting. Changed my perspective on the inner lives of fish. 
218,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/324370-lisa,4,"Jonathan Balcombe is an advocate for fish—or, as he prefers, fishes: “individuals with personalities and relationships”—and makes a strong case for piscine perception in What a Fish Knows: The Inner Lives of Our Underwater Cousins (Farrar, Straus). Weaving together decades of scientific studies of fish consciousness, cognition, and social structure, ethologist Balcombe (author of the lovely The Exultant Ark) offers a picture of fish(es) as complex and sentient beings. Not only do they have acute senses of sight, hearing, and smell, they have the capacity to feel pleasure as well as pain, and some form hierarchical grooming cooperatives, hunt in interspecies packs, help raise nonbiological offspring while waiting their turn to fertilize eggs, or recognize each other after months apart. At times the recitation of “believe it or not” knowledge bites can feel like overreaching to make a point; at others Balcombe edges toward a decidedly unscientific whimsy—he never met a fish pun he didn’t like. But altogether, What a Fish Knows is lively and surprising, making a good argument for sport and food fishing reform.VERDICT: This may ruin readers’ fish dinners forever, but will appeal to fans of odd science and animal rights advocates alike.—My Library Journal review"
219,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2290905-jimmy,5,"Fish are friends. Not food.Very well spoken by some sharks in the beloved movie Finding Nemo. But just how true are those words, especially to us humans? There's plenty of fish out in the sea, and no amount of fishing could ever deplete the vast ocean of all its fish. Could it? The sad answer is yes.Fish are animals, and they have personalities and social lives and experience emotions just like us and any other animal. Balcombe makes the case in his fascinating book What a Fish Knows, and you may come away learning something new from reading this. Perhaps it's the fact that fish are in an entirely different environment separate from our own world that we don't think twice about the sport of fishing, aquaculture, or the delicious baked salmon on the dinner plate. But after reading this, I find myself just a little bit more attuned to the life of a fish.I'll never look at a fish in a tank the same way again. As we develop better technologies and ways to be sustainable, the fishing industry should certainly be on everyone's radar."
220,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2028832-kathleen,3,"I enjoyed the premise of this book, that fish are interesting, evolved animals just as much as many birds and mammals. We should consider as much when we discuss fishing and farming practices, which may involve a great degree of cruelty. Including many interesting facts, studies, and anecdotes, this is a good choice for the casual reader looking for a little natural science. It did not have quite as many photographs in the picture section as I might have liked, but I would look at pictures of fish all day, so that's fair. I suspect this author may be a secret vegan, and I certainly have no intention of not eating fish any time soon, but we can certainly all be more conscious consumers. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who does eat fish, or just wants to learn a little bit about the fascinating underwater world. "
221,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1638985-daniel-kuo,2,"I was hoping for a book that used science to share the author's awe and wonder at the natural world. Instead I got a book where the science is used to support the author's personal belief that we need to dramatically change our relationship with fish.And I am sympathetic to that worldview. I think the environmental and ethical issues are genuine and worth examining. But the preaching, which is undeniably the main point of this book, had the opposite effect on me. I questioned whether or not the science presented was genuine or misleading, because there was such an obvious agenda. It didn't help that there were many many places where the conclusions did not follow from the evidence presented. I wanted... a more intellectually honest book."
222,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,4,"A beautifully written book that summarises the life of fishes - what they see, hear, small, taste, touch, navigate, feel. If they feel pain and if they are aware. Do they have fun? The author also discusses what a fish thinks and if they are intelligent and if they can use tools. The social contracts, co-operation and fish democracy involved in fishey lives, as well as the strange variety of breeding and parenting methods make for interesting reading. As the author says: ""fishes are individuals"", and he does a good job in showing why he thinks that. The book comes with a nice selection of colour photographs."
223,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309689-lara,4,"Very interesting look at how we tend to view fish and how maybe we should change our perspective. The parts towards the end about fishing were pretty horrifying to me, especially after all the indications that fish are individual creatures with individual lives and intelligence and personalities and that definitely feel pain, and it made me very thankful that I became a vegetarian years ago. If I hadn't, this book might have put me over the edge. "
224,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4152463-s,2,"To the good: I liked the description of many facets of fishes lives, behaviors, and putative experiences. To the bad: The language is sometimes a little clunky, and Balcombe doesn't disguise his agenda, which is to convince you to empathize more with fish. Despite being sympathetic, I found the tone was sometimes preachy and overly credulous."

228,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1945152-abraham-thunderwolf,4,"A few weeks ago I was watching Blue Planet, a documentary series on oceans by the same people who make Planet Earth, when I saw a fish doing something I didn't know fish do: it was using a rock to break open a mussel's shell to eat the inside, a fish using a tool. I thought, now that was something you don't see every day. In the back of my head that fish was still in my head a few weeks later I walked into the library to return a book and saw What A Fish Knows on a highlight shelf. Jonathan Balcombe's volume on the lives of fish is a captivating read, specially considering that the subjects are well fish. Luckily this book is a great dive in the myriad lives of different fishes throughout the world. And it's really about fish, you won't get a lot of talk about mollusks, crustaceans, whales, or other non fish things. It's packed with interesting facts about those denizens of the deep, but it's not just a dry volume of fish facts. There are dozens of charming stories and surprises in What A Fish Knows that I wouldn't have expected, I mean they are fish! There are parts where it boils down to ""no one knows why fish X thing happens."" Which just highlights how little people know about water bound life. It's a fun read until the last chapter that highlights the hellish fishing industries, which really, really, really bummed me out. Not that I was unaware of such things, but it was even harder to read about after learning that fish aren't just biological swimming automatons. The whole thing makes me really think about my tuna sandwiches. But where does that stop? Where is my sympathy towards the tomato pickers? What about the tons of garbage generated by the plastic industry, keeping in mind that the mustard in the fridge is in a plastic container? What's the bread I have really made from? I'm not here to have a crisis of consciousness about my lunch when all I wanted to do is say: every chapter in What a Fish knows can be its own book and the book is worth your time to read. I really liked it and I don't even like going to the aquarium (not from guilt, it just makes me feel oddly claustrophobic) plus finding the ocean just fucking terrifying if I think about it. While it does have some pictures it's not illustrated all the way, so I spent some time looking up various types of fishes that are featured in the book and I can't wait to see what my targeted ads are going to look like soon."
229,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83179136-catherine-puma,3,"Published in 2016, ""What a Fish Knows"" is a popular science nonfiction book that has been on my To Read list for a few years now. Jonathan Balcombe uses anecdotes, interviews, and studies he finds interesting to mention some of what humans have observed about the lives of our underwater cousins. While aquariums, household pets, and decorative koi ponds are also mentioned, most of the tales in this book are about wild examples from African cichlids, to Hawaiian cleaner wrasses, Atlantic goliath grouper, deep-sea lantern fish, and even some touches upon sharks and rays (my personal favorites). I do appreciate the way this is structured. Different parts are about what a fish perceives, feels, thinks, who a fish knows, and how a fish breeds. These parts are then further broken up into chapters on various senses and stimulii, intelligence and problem-solving, social contracts and interactions, and sexual and parenting activities.This book does not have to be read in order, so although a conversation-driven chapter book with a few photos or charts/diagrams/maps, readers can skip to the topics they find most interesting. However, although there are parts of this I really enjoyed and I did learn some interesting facts about different fish species, overall there is something off about the content's presentation. What's being said about fishes is important, but ethologist Balcombe's tone is nearly unbearably pretentious, self-righteous, self-centered, and judgmental. He scoffs at experts and makes fun of the scientific process. He is anti-fisheries and vehemently vegan, but doesn't have anything bad to say about decorative privately-owned aquariums or entertainment facilities like SeaWorld. He's entitled to his own opinions, but he spends too much time JUST being opinionated in this book. This would have been significantly improved if it stressed more on the end of explaining fish-facts. While reading this, I kept thinking about the other popular science nonfiction books about fishes that are so much BETTER than this one. Top choices that come to mind include: - Mark Kurlansky's ""Salmon"", - Sy Montgomery's ""The Soul of an Octopus"", - Paul Greenberg's ""Four Fish"", and - Danna Staaf's ""Squid Empire"". Overall, am I glad I read this? Sure, I guess. But I will be recommending many other books to people before I ever think of recommending this one. "
230,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16959053-seinka,5,"Wonderful, amazing. The writing is at times a little bit dry, but luckily the objects of the author's book are more than making up for that. Did you know that fishes like to be caressed, that some of them have taste buds all over their bodies (650.000 taste buds in total) so they can taste their whole environment (imagine that). Some fishes can split their eyes in 4 so that they can see what's happening above and under water, others can roll over their eyes to one side of the body. Did you know that some fish can change their gender during their lifetimes (hence, the cartoon Finding Nemo is inaccurate in the sense that after Nemo's mom died the father should have taken the female gender and fill in the role as mother), and that length does play a role for fish (they prefer longer over shorter, yes). Fishes take care of their eggs and babies. Some fishes carry their babies in their mouth during the whole pregnancy period, not allowing to eat for months. Some fishes have their penises between their eyes. Culture also plays a role among fishes, or actually many other animals, and fishes have feelings (sense of happiness, joy, sadness). There are many examples of fishes who help each other (one fish swam under the other fish because the one above could not swim well). In this day and age, unfortunately animal knowledge is linked with animal extinction, and the same goes for fishes. Industrialization has created big crates that scrape the bottoms of the oceans to fill our needs for omega 3 and in doing so generating a lot of collateral damage. Factories where fishes are being harvested for our food chain are living in despicable conditions, where some don't get to have food for 8 months simply because it generates more eggs. I probably said too much here, but this is merely a brief summary. The book contains many more marvels and facts about fishes and animals in general. In the worst it will give you some new information. In the best case it will change your world view. We are surrounded by beautiful sentient beings, not just by humans. And that realization on itself is already worth the read."
231,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61946844-amy,5,"What a Fish Knows is a systematic review of research supporting the hypothesis that fish - like our cousins, chimpanzees - are sentient. The book is sorted into sections (such as What a Fish Perceives, What a Fish Feels, Who a Fish Knows), each with chapters exploring a different aspect of the section (the section on Who a Fish Knows, for example, has chapters on cooperative hunting, social contracts, and peacekeeping behavior in intra-species and inter-species pairs/groups). I found the formatting of the chapters and sections to be very helpful and I like the emphasis on evidence-based conclusions. Though there is a liberal sprinkling of anecdotes throughout the book, they are clearly there for illustrative purposes only. The emphasis of each conclusion undoubtedly rests on the weight of the evidence that is cited in every chapter. The last chapter, Fish Out of Water, and the Epilogue are the only parts of the book that are a bit different. Though human actions in relation to fish are referenced throughout the book (and mostly in a research context), Fish Out of Water discusses the actions of humans in the context of fishing practices and the human consumption of sea life. While Balcombe takes pains to point out the already belabored but still important point that current fishing practices are unsustainable, the emphasis of the chapter is on how unethical human actions are in relation to what the reader has just learned about the sentience of fish. Quite frankly, it makes for a nauseating read, but it is a wake-up call that people should have. The epilogue focuses on the people and groups that are currently taking action to include fish in the widely accepted circle of moral concern. It is a very moving chapter that ends on a note of hope for people and for our underwater cousins. Overall, What a Fish Knows is an excellent book, and I would gladly recommend it. "
232,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2790863-allison,5,"I loved this book - and I learned so much. I love all animals and have an appreciation of how they are each individuals, with their own personalities. And while I have believed that fishes are sentient beings, I was not aware of their complexity. I loved the behavioral trial that took a certain type of fish 40 tries to solve it, primates 100 tries and a human child who didn't get it after 100 tries. Unfortunately, though, while the evidence posed in this book should get people to think again about the pain and suffering imposed on these animals, those who believe that all animals are there for us to eat because we're at the top of the food chain won't really care. People see the horrible treatment, pain and suffering on factory farms -- what cows, pigs, chickens and other animals that are used for human consumption are subjected to -- and they don't care. So whether or not they believe that fishes are sentient beings and feel pain, joy, compassion... certainly won't change their behavior. It is a sad, sad fact. However, for those who do care enough about the animals, but might think that it's okay to do this to fishes, because they don't really suffer anyway, well, this book should be a real eye-opener. Just to share a brief story. The last animal I stopped eating (30 years ago) was fish, because I too thought that fish were just above plant life. But one defining moment changed that for me. I was snorkeling for the first time in my life, and a school of beautiful fishes were below me, so I floated above them, trying to swim quietly so I could watch them. They all looked at me as they were swimming below me. It was amazing. I hope you enjoy this book. Whether or not you eat animals, you'll learn a lot. And if you call yourself a vegetarian but you eat fish, please stop. "
233,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40961426-gwen-vandendriessche,4,"Before starting to read this book, I didn’t think much of fishes. I never met that many fishes on my walks except for those who had been caught by birds (Herons, Kingfishers, Gannets, etc.) as food and that didn’t disturb me as I was happy for the birds. However, the sight of a trout looking blindly from my neighbour’s plate was enough to prevent me from eating anything and I had already been attached to a goldfish when I was young, so that was a good start for wanting to know more about them and reading Jonathan Balcombe’s book. At the first page, you understand that the author is really attached to the fishes he is talking about. He isn’t only teaching you facts, but sharing his wonder. This wonder is totally understandable for the lives of many fishes are amazingly complex. Here are a the three facts I was most amazed to learn: fishes can smell fear, some fishes lay their eggs on leaves out of the water and fire water on them to keep them moist, Nemo’s dad should have become a female after the death of his partner! As for many scientific books, I regret that much knowledge about living beings is brought by experiments which often appear really cruel to me. I’d rather not know what it is to be a fish than to know that some of them might have suffered to give me that knowledge (e.g.: injecting stuff in their eyes to know whether they use their sight to navigate!?!). Fortunaltely, only part of the book talks about these experiments.At the end of the book, the author also reminds us of the negative impact of farmed fishes on wildlife and of the disastrous slaughter of sharks and many other species for the food industry. The major part of the book just wants to amaze us, but I think those last pages are also very important to highlighten that the oceans are not endless and that we are making huges damages to their populations."
234,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43848794-samuel,4,"”And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.”‭Of the countless ideas the Bible is responsible for, ”dominion” has arguably been the worst. Instead of understanding life as vast systems of interconnected organisms, of which man is just one, man has made himself arbiter of all other living things. This has allowed us to overlook and diminish the life and intelligence of all other species. Our ignorance has allowed us to remain complacent as we destroy the oceans. Reading ’What A Fish Knows’ by Jonathan Balcombe is eye-opening, though some of it reads like trivia. Did you know that goldfish can recognize individual humans they haven’t seen in months? That tuna is more closely related to humans than they are to sharks? That a lot of fishes enjoy being petted? That they have personal friends and enemies? That cleaner fish do a better job if there are customers waiting their turn (and evaluating the services)? That different species of fish can communicate with one another to help eachother hunt for dinner? Etc etc. Why haven’t we bothered to find out till now? It seems that it may have something to do with facial muscles. Since fish can’t raise eye-brows or smile happily we have simply assumed they’re incognizant. ”What A Fish Knows” is packed with remarkable discoveries about fish. So much so that the last chapter about what we’re doing to destroy the ocean ecology is deeply disturbing. Many species of fish are indeed living in the end days. There’s an ocean apocalypse going on, and man is the destroyer of worlds."
235,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7709596-g-na,5,"Every once in awhile I am lucky enough to read a book that feels like it was written just for me, and this is one of those books. Here Balcombe takes a good look at the cognition and senses of fishes, with chapters on their consciousness, social lives, tool use, and more. Fishes have individual personalities and are much smarter than people realize, and that's something I have seen myself in the many hours I've spent underwater with them.Too many people think of fishes as primitive and unfeeling, and I know many think that fish cannot feel pain - they absolutely can, and studies have proved it! Yes, they live in an environment that is foreign to us, and they have no limbs or eyelids (unnecessary when your surroundings keep your eyes permanently moist), but they are still advanced vertebrates with complex and fully-functioning nervous systems. Because fishes are so different from us people seem to have no qualms about killing them, and the author has devoted a chapter to this sad fact. Today, commercial fisheries pull millions of tons (billions and billions of fish) out of the sea every year, which has resulted in the collapse of various fisheries, and populations of these fishes are dropping to the point where many species are nearing extinction.What a Fish Knows is well-researched and has over 30 pages of references, many of which are peer-reviewed journals. Balcomb did a good job of translating the scientific articles into everyday language for the layperson. This is a fantastic book."

This obvious object of this book is to raise awareness of the more complex aspects of fish life, hopefully increasing our concern.Part 2 of the book starts by examining fishes in some detail, revealing some surprising facts such as the vast number of eggs some species produce (300 million for an Ocean Sunfish), but also providing a good overview of their vision (they see UV and so some fish body markings are only visible in the UV range), hearing, smelling, touch and navigation senses.Part 3 examines evidence that fish care for each other and play. The author even suggests that when fish jump it may sometimes be for sheer joy.Fish intelligence is the subject of part 4, where the ability of fishes to map their environment and to solve problems suggests at least some species have unexpected abilities.Part 5 looks at relationships and evidence that fish recognize their neighbours, and the possibility that they recognize specific humans. Groupers have been seen to use a headstand signal to indicate to partner moray eels the location of hidden prey. This is interpreted as planning and one group of researchers ""... concluded that the collaborative capabilities of groupers compare favorably with those of chimpanzees.""The complexities of fish sex and parenting are discussed in part 6.The unsustainable practices of fishing are examined in part 7. The book ends with a plea for greater compassion for fishes."

That was mostly interesting, I really enjoyed learning about the different observations and anecdotes throughout the book. I'm fascinated by animals, so any peak into their behavior is a cool experience for me. Though, I do think the writing in certain places became a tad dry and the author's humor was like a bad dad joke (which is why I can't bring myself to give this 4 stars). Also, I saw some other reviews saying the book came off as preachy. I don't know if I fully feel that way. However, full-disclosure, I've been plant-based for a few years so maybe I'm used to the whole animal rights spiel. That being said, from an animal rights/humane side of things, this book didn't really bring anything new to the table. I feel like Balcombe just watched a few documentaries on animal activism and summarized their points in the book's epilogue. But, all of that aside, feel what you want to about fish. I think that the facts and studies about the fish are the more interesting point to pay attention to in the book anyway.If you like marine bio or are interested in animal behavior, this seems like a good introduction to that genre."

Given the pollution of our oceans, fish are not a healthy food source; given Balcombe's examination of the intelligence, awareness/consciousness of fish, and the inhumanity of how we capture and kill them, we need to rethink how we ""harvest"" them (and we all should rethink how many children we should have--the projected increase in human population by 2030 is not sustainable at the western world's way of living). Balcombe uses a number of sources, scientific as well as some personal/individual experiences, to argue that fish have intelligence, some at least have exhibited compassion, they can communicate intra- and extra-species (the grouper/moray eel cooperation is astounding), they do feel pain, they can learn from experience (and some kinds of situations they do better than our young children).Readers who are serious about ecology, living lives more sustainably and in amity with other species (rather than recklessly and thoughtlessly exploitatively) should read this book."

This is not a scientific tome, but a refreshing overview of a myriad experiments. As an active scuba diver, I have often wondered just how much a fish really does know. I felt that they remembered me after repeated visits with the same behavior. And sure enough, even a year later, they remember. And Jonathan describes experiments with fish proving that they can even recognize individual human faces when wearing the same red hat when one feeds them and the other doesn't. The red hatted non feeder gets no reaction. The face of the red-hatted feeder sends them scurrying to the surface for food. That may seem minor, but humans certainly can not discern just the facial differences among fish who all look the same to us. There are many more, and better examples, of how cunning they are, how they work to trick others, or cheat others, or show remorse. It will hopefully help you to stop thinking that catch and release is OK. "

243,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105791880-george-jacobs,5,"Jonathan Balcombe, the author of this New York Times best-selling book, has worked for many years as an ethologist (a scientist who studies animal behaviour). He is director of animal sentience at the Humane Society Institute for Science and Policy. His website is www.jonathanbalcombe.com. His other books are The Exultant Art: A Pictorial Tour of Animal Pleasure, Second Nature: The Iinner Livers of Animals, Pleasurable Kingdom: Animals and the Nature of Feeling Good, and The Use of Aanimals in Higher Education: Problems, Alternatives, and Recommendations. 	This review attempts to give readers an understanding of the structure of the book and a sample of some the book’s main points. The review ends with some comments by the reviewer. The book consists of seven parts, some of which are divided into chapters. Balcombe dedicates the book to the “anonymous trillions” of fishes, and he hopes that after reading this book (or a summary thereof) that humans will appreciate that fishes are not objects or grains of sand, but that each of the trillions of fishes is an individual who thinks and feels. Referring to his hopes for each of the approximately 7.4 billion humans’ attitudes towards fishes, Balcombe quotes an anonymous poet, “Nothing has changed except my attitude—so everything has changed” (p. 8). The reviewer believes this book provides valuable resources which ecolinguists can use to change people’s attitudes towards finishes. Prologue	That quote was from the book’s prologue, which includes basic information on fishes and their plight. Balcombe contends that although many, many books have been written about fishes, his is the first book written on behalf of fishes. Other works that seem to be concerned about fishes, talking about endangered species and overexploitation of fish “stocks”, actually focus on fishes as commodities for human use. The lives of fishes, Balcombe believes, have value not primarily for what they offer humans. Instead, all fishes’ lives have value to each of those fishes and those in their communities. 	One estimate puts the number of land animals killed annually for food for humans at about 70 billion. How many fishes are killed each year to feed humans? Balcombe uses an estimate, based on FAO data, that 1 trillion to 2.7 trillion fishes are killed by humans each year. (For other stats, please visit http://www.fishcount.org.uk.) These fishes die mostly from a combination of asphyxiation (when they are taken out of the water), decompression (due to pressure change as they are brought out of the water, being crushed under the weight of the fishes and other marine animals caught with them in the same net and being slaughtered.Part 1 – The Misunderstood Fish	Fishes are an extremely diverse collection of animals, accounting for 33,249 species, 60% of all the known vertebrates, with many more fish species likely yet to be discovered. The two main types of fishes are bony fishes (the largest group), including eels, salmons, basses, goldfishes and carps, and cartilaginous fishes, including sharks and rays. Fishes have been on the Earth much longer than humans: “[Fishes] had graced planet Earth fifty times longer than we have before they even left the water” (p. 13). As to the criticism that fishes’ small brains mean that they must not be able to think or feel, Balcombe counters with the point that miniaturisation allows small objects to function as well as larger ones.		Another misconception about fishes is that because fishes have been on Earth for so many geologic ages, fishes must be primitive creatures who stopped evolving, while other vertebrates, especially mammals, continued evolving. Balcombe (p. 21) explains:All of the fish species that were living at the dawn of legs and lungs are long gone. … The descents of early fishes have been evolving eons longer than their terrestrial counterparts, and on these terms fishes are the most highly evolved of all vertebrates. You might be surprised to know that fishes have the genetic machinery to make fingers—something that shows how similar fishes are to modern mammals. They just don’t develop fingers, but fins instead, since fins are better for swimming than fingers are. Part II – What a Fish Perceives	Part II consists of three chapters – What a Fish Sees, What a Fish Hears, Smells and Tastes, and Navigation, Touch and Beyond - focusing on the senses fishes use to perceive the world around them. All of these abilities are keenly affected by the fact that fishes live in water. For instance, sound travels much faster in water than in air. Given this and other differences in perception, humans may have difficulty understanding how fishes perceive their worlds. What a Fish Sees Fishes’ eyes are much like human eyes, with three pairs of muscles which enable the eyes to swivel. However, fishes’ vision does differ from that of humans, the main difference being that humans have eyelids, while fishes do not. However, other differences also exist. For instance, some fishes, such as adult flounders, have both their eyes on the same side of their bodies. Also, in regard to sight, just as humans use camouflage to fool hostiles, fishes also use visual cues to fool predators. For example, comet fishes lure predators to attack their rear ends, instead of their more sensitive heads. Comet fishes are able to do this because their rear side looks like the face of a parrot fish. What a Fish Hears, Smells and TastesBefore looking at how fishes hear, Balcombe clears up the misconception that fishes are silent creatures. Some of the mechanisms fishes use to make sounds include vibrating their swim bladders, grating and grinding their teeth, rubbing together their bones and pushing bubbles out of their anuses. Indeed, some fishes are named for the sounds they make, for example, grunters, croakers, drums and trumpeters. 	Believing fishes to be silent led to the belief that they were also deaf. This was an easy mistake for human-centric scientists, because fishes have no external hearing devices. Balcombe describes the study by Nobel Prize winning scientist, Karl van Frisch, which demonstrated fishes’ ability to hear, in much the same way that Pavlov demonstrated classical conditioning with dogs. The study’s sole participant was a blind catfish. van Frisch put food on a stick into the fish’s home. Upon smelling the food, the fish would swim towards it. Next, the researcher started whistling before lowering the food for the fish. After a while, all the fish needed was to hear whistling and he would swim towards the usual location of the food. 	Fishes can hear, and they can hear an amazing range of sounds. The fishes in one study demonstrated the ability to categorise human music (Chase, 2011). Chase’s study involved three carps. A speaker was placed in their home, an apparatus for operant conditioning was set up and the fishes learned to discriminate between blues music and classical music, and to categorise newly introduced music as either blues or classical. Another study found that listening to classical music enhanced the health of a group of fishes (Papoutsoglou, Karakatsouli, Papoutsoglou, & Vasilikos, 2010). 	Fishes use their sense of smell for such purposes as identifying their location, locating food and mates and recognising danger. Unlike human nostrils, which function for both smelling and breathing, fish nostrils have only an olfactory function. In some cases, fishes’ olfactory capabilities far exceed those of humans. Balcombe provides examples (p. 50):Salmon can detect the smell of a seal or sea lion diluted to one eighty billionth of water volume … . the American eel … can detect the equivalent of less than one ten millionth of a drop of their home water in [an] Olympic pool. Like salmons, eels make long migrations back to specific spawn sites, and they follow a subtle gradient of scent to get there. 	As to taste, one outstanding aspect of fish anatomy is the presence of taste buds in widely different parts of the body, not just in their mouths. These other locations can include the lips, snout and fins. Also, just as groups of humans tend to have similar tastes in food, e.g., spicy foods are favoured by some cultures, so too are particular foods favoured by given fish species. However, just as is the case with humans, individual fishes may have their idiosyncratic food preferences.Navigation, Touch, and Beyond Fishes, not surprisingly, have superb navigational skills. They navigate by such means as feeling water turbulence caused by the presence of objects, sun compassing, dead reckoning, a natural GPS system, smell, vision and electroreception. How do schools of fishes swim together in unison? Balcombe explains (p. 59):[Fishes have] a row of specialized scales running horizontally along their flanks, forming what is called the lateral line. ... [Each scale ] is populated by neuromasts, clusters of sensory cells each with a hair-like project encased in a tiny cup of gel. … The lateral line acts as a sonarlike system and is especially useful at night and in murky waters.Some fishes seem to enjoy touching and being touched. Touching appears to play a part in courting, in relationships between cleanerfishes and their clients, and even as a form of interaction between fishes and human divers. For example, while the evidence here is anecdotal, Balcombe reports stories of sunbathing fishes and fishes who enjoy the stimulation of the bubbles from divers’ regulators. Part III – What a Fish Feels	Part III consists of two chapters - Pain, Consciousness, and Awareness, and From Stress to Joy. Advocates on behalf of animals are fond of the following quote from the 18th century philosopher, Jeremy Bentham: “The question is not, ‘Can they reason?’ nor, ‘Can they talk?’ but ‘Can they suffer?’”. The two chapters of Part III start with this question and then proceed to happier topics. Pain, Consciousness, and AwarenessNot surprisingly, Balcombe believes that fishes do feel pain. In the book’s previous pages, he made the case for fishes having the same senses and other basic structures as other vertebrates. In this chapter, he notes that fishes have A-delta and C fibres in their nerves; mammals use these fibres to experience pain (Braithwaite, 2010; Sneddon, 2003). However, fishes and other nonmammal vertebrates do not have a neocortex, the body part posited to be the centre of consciousness. Balcombe counters that birds do not have a neocortex either, yet scientists agree that birds have consciousness and can feel pain. Furthermore, fishes’ brains have the pallium which carries out some of the same functions as the neocortex. In additional rebuttal, Balcombe makes the analogy that just as humans can swim despite lacking the fins that fishes employ for that purpose, so too are fishes conscious despite lacking a neocortex. 	While Balcombe cautions that opinion may never be unanimous on the issue of fishes and pain, he quotes a document of the American Veterinary Medical Association to argue that a general consensus has developed among scientists who study fishes (AVMA, 2013):Suggestions that finfish [fish that are not shellfish] responses to pain merely represent simple reflexes have been refuted by studies demonstrating forebrain and midbrain electrical activity in response to stimulation and different with type of nociceptor stimulation. Learning and memory consolidation in trials where finfish are taught to avoid noxious stimuli have moved the issue of finfish cognition and sentience forward to the point where the preponderance of accumulated evidence supports the position that finfish should be accorded the same considerations as terrestrial vertebrates in regard to relief from pain. Balcombe summarises the chapter by stating (pp. 84-85):Fishes show the hallmarks of pain both physiologically and behaviourally. They possess the specialized nerve fibers that mammals and birds use to detect noxious stimuli. They can learn to avoid electric shocks and anglers’ hooks. They are cognitively impaired when subjected to nasty insults to their bodies, and this impairment can be reversed if they are provided with pain relief.From Stress to JoyWhile the first chapter in Part III focused on fishes feeling pain, the second chapter focuses on emotions, beginning with fear and stress but then traveling to happier emotions. Balcombe notes that, “Emotions involve relatively old brain circuits conserved through evolution and shared by all vertebrates” (p. 88). Something similar seems to be the case for hormones that link to emotions. For instance, humans produce the hormone oxytocin, which promotes bonding, and fishes appear to have a similar hormone (Reddon et al., 2012). As to pleasurable emotions, scientists have been witnessing fishes play since 1898 (Groos, 1898). Much more recently, Burghardt, Dinets and Murphy (2014) studied three bfishes apparently playing with a thermometer which had been designed to float vertically. Each of the three fishes had their own way of playing with the thermometer. The first fish pushed down on the top of the thermometer, while the second swam round and round the thermometer occasionally touching and thereby moving it, and the third fish was the most aggressive, hitting the object at various points, thereby making it move around the tank. Part IV – What a Fish Thinks	Part IV consists of two chapters – Fins, Scales and Intelligence, and Tools, Plans and Monkey Minds. Balcombe frames these topics by recognising that the intelligences which different creatures develop are guided by those creatures’ life circumstances. Furthermore, he quotes Dinets to warn against underestimating the cognitive capabilities of nonhuman animals (p. 105), “Every other animal currently considered stupid and boring has its own amazing secrets. It’s just that nobody has been able to discover them yet”. At the same time, Balcombe cautions that just because one fish species or one individual fish demonstrates a particular ability does not mean that all species or all members of a particular species possess or can develop that ability.Fins, Scales and IntelligenceIn what may be the most amazing story in the book, Balcombe describes the cognitive mapping abilities of gobies (White & Brown, 2015). Gobies find their food in small tide pools. However, being in these pools exposes gobies to such predators as octopuses and herons. To escape predation, gobies jump to other pools. But how do they know where these other pools are? Their cognitive mapping abilities guide them.To read the entire review: https://www.academia.edu/30147532/Rev..."

245,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"The highlight, for me, occurred early in the book when the author pointed out that because fish can be fooled by optical illusions, some amount of consciousness must exist. It had occurred to me before that you can't have an illusion without consciousness - you can't make someone mis-perceive something if there's noone home to misperceive it (which is, incidentally, part of my problem with Daniel C. Dennett's claim we don't really have consciousness). So that was a wonderful bit of cleverness for me - trying to determine consciousness by fooling the fish.Anyway, fish can be fooled by some of the same stuff we are! They can see the smaller of two circles as larger if there are extra nearby circles making their relative sizes seem different. They also 'finish' shapes in their mind, 'seeing' a triangle that's only hinted at.They also can distinguish musical genres! And he provides convincing evidence that fish feel pain (which, of course, for most of us, is ""duh,"" but science requries agnosticism without good evidence, and some other people are just apologists who reject it out of hand because it's inconvenient).They can tell humans apart. They can cooperate. They make referential gestures across species! Before people noticed moray eels pointing out prey for groupers, the only species known to do that were humans (and tangentially, dogs understanding those gestures), some other apes, and ravens! Of course, the book ends with a section about how humans are evil and we're all doomed because we're killing the planet. I don't deny it - I get it and think it's a critical message, but it came out of left field for me in this book. Still, even that part was interesting, if only for some of the forehead-slappingness of it. For instance - ignoring the morality, farmed fish helps make the industry more sustainable, right? Well, no. Guess what they mostly feed farm fishes? Fish. What's the worst species in an ecosystem to hunt? The apex predator, right? Guess what tuna and marlin and sharks are. Oops.I'm going off on tangents, like the book did at the end. But there's a lot of great, well-explained stuff in here."

248,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/324370-lisa,4,"Jonathan Balcombe is an advocate for fish—or, as he prefers, fishes: “individuals with personalities and relationships”—and makes a strong case for piscine perception in What a Fish Knows: The Inner Lives of Our Underwater Cousins (Farrar, Straus). Weaving together decades of scientific studies of fish consciousness, cognition, and social structure, ethologist Balcombe (author of the lovely The Exultant Ark) offers a picture of fish(es) as complex and sentient beings. Not only do they have acute senses of sight, hearing, and smell, they have the capacity to feel pleasure as well as pain, and some form hierarchical grooming cooperatives, hunt in interspecies packs, help raise nonbiological offspring while waiting their turn to fertilize eggs, or recognize each other after months apart. At times the recitation of “believe it or not” knowledge bites can feel like overreaching to make a point; at others Balcombe edges toward a decidedly unscientific whimsy—he never met a fish pun he didn’t like. But altogether, What a Fish Knows is lively and surprising, making a good argument for sport and food fishing reform.VERDICT: This may ruin readers’ fish dinners forever, but will appeal to fans of odd science and animal rights advocates alike.—My Library Journal review"
249,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2290905-jimmy,5,"Fish are friends. Not food.Very well spoken by some sharks in the beloved movie Finding Nemo. But just how true are those words, especially to us humans? There's plenty of fish out in the sea, and no amount of fishing could ever deplete the vast ocean of all its fish. Could it? The sad answer is yes.Fish are animals, and they have personalities and social lives and experience emotions just like us and any other animal. Balcombe makes the case in his fascinating book What a Fish Knows, and you may come away learning something new from reading this. Perhaps it's the fact that fish are in an entirely different environment separate from our own world that we don't think twice about the sport of fishing, aquaculture, or the delicious baked salmon on the dinner plate. But after reading this, I find myself just a little bit more attuned to the life of a fish.I'll never look at a fish in a tank the same way again. As we develop better technologies and ways to be sustainable, the fishing industry should certainly be on everyone's radar."

We should consider as much when we discuss fishing and farming practices, which may involve a great degree of cruelty. Including many interesting facts, studies, and anecdotes, this is a good choice for the casual reader looking for a little natural science. It did not have quite as many photographs in the picture section as I might have liked, but I would look at pictures of fish all day, so that's fair. I suspect this author may be a secret vegan, and I certainly have no intention of not eating fish any time soon, but we can certainly all be more conscious consumers.

Instead I got a book where the science is used to support the author's personal belief that we need to dramatically change our relationship with fish.And I am sympathetic to that worldview. I think the environmental and ethical issues are genuine and worth examining. But the preaching, which is undeniably the main point of this book, had the opposite effect on me. I questioned whether or not the science presented was genuine or misleading, because there was such an obvious agenda. It didn't help that there were many many places where the conclusions did not follow from the evidence presented. I wanted... a more intellectually honest book."

The social contracts, co-operation and fish democracy involved in fishey lives, as well as the strange variety of breeding and parenting methods make for interesting reading. As the author says: ""fishes are individuals"", and he does a good job in showing why he thinks that. The book comes with a nice selection of colour photographs."

258,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1945152-abraham-thunderwolf,4,"A few weeks ago I was watching Blue Planet, a documentary series on oceans by the same people who make Planet Earth, when I saw a fish doing something I didn't know fish do: it was using a rock to break open a mussel's shell to eat the inside, a fish using a tool. I thought, now that was something you don't see every day. In the back of my head that fish was still in my head a few weeks later I walked into the library to return a book and saw What A Fish Knows on a highlight shelf. Jonathan Balcombe's volume on the lives of fish is a captivating read, specially considering that the subjects are well fish. Luckily this book is a great dive in the myriad lives of different fishes throughout the world. And it's really about fish, you won't get a lot of talk about mollusks, crustaceans, whales, or other non fish things. It's packed with interesting facts about those denizens of the deep, but it's not just a dry volume of fish facts. There are dozens of charming stories and surprises in What A Fish Knows that I wouldn't have expected, I mean they are fish! There are parts where it boils down to ""no one knows why fish X thing happens."" Which just highlights how little people know about water bound life. It's a fun read until the last chapter that highlights the hellish fishing industries, which really, really, really bummed me out. Not that I was unaware of such things, but it was even harder to read about after learning that fish aren't just biological swimming automatons. The whole thing makes me really think about my tuna sandwiches. But where does that stop? Where is my sympathy towards the tomato pickers? What about the tons of garbage generated by the plastic industry, keeping in mind that the mustard in the fridge is in a plastic container? What's the bread I have really made from? I'm not here to have a crisis of consciousness about my lunch when all I wanted to do is say: every chapter in What a Fish knows can be its own book and the book is worth your time to read. I really liked it and I don't even like going to the aquarium (not from guilt, it just makes me feel oddly claustrophobic) plus finding the ocean just fucking terrifying if I think about it. While it does have some pictures it's not illustrated all the way, so I spent some time looking up various types of fishes that are featured in the book and I can't wait to see what my targeted ads are going to look like soon."
259,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83179136-catherine-puma,3,"Published in 2016, ""What a Fish Knows"" is a popular science nonfiction book that has been on my To Read list for a few years now. Jonathan Balcombe uses anecdotes, interviews, and studies he finds interesting to mention some of what humans have observed about the lives of our underwater cousins. While aquariums, household pets, and decorative koi ponds are also mentioned, most of the tales in this book are about wild examples from African cichlids, to Hawaiian cleaner wrasses, Atlantic goliath grouper, deep-sea lantern fish, and even some touches upon sharks and rays (my personal favorites). I do appreciate the way this is structured. Different parts are about what a fish perceives, feels, thinks, who a fish knows, and how a fish breeds. These parts are then further broken up into chapters on various senses and stimulii, intelligence and problem-solving, social contracts and interactions, and sexual and parenting activities.This book does not have to be read in order, so although a conversation-driven chapter book with a few photos or charts/diagrams/maps, readers can skip to the topics they find most interesting. However, although there are parts of this I really enjoyed and I did learn some interesting facts about different fish species, overall there is something off about the content's presentation. What's being said about fishes is important, but ethologist Balcombe's tone is nearly unbearably pretentious, self-righteous, self-centered, and judgmental. He scoffs at experts and makes fun of the scientific process. He is anti-fisheries and vehemently vegan, but doesn't have anything bad to say about decorative privately-owned aquariums or entertainment facilities like SeaWorld. He's entitled to his own opinions, but he spends too much time JUST being opinionated in this book. This would have been significantly improved if it stressed more on the end of explaining fish-facts. While reading this, I kept thinking about the other popular science nonfiction books about fishes that are so much BETTER than this one. Top choices that come to mind include: - Mark Kurlansky's ""Salmon"", - Sy Montgomery's ""The Soul of an Octopus"", - Paul Greenberg's ""Four Fish"", and - Danna Staaf's ""Squid Empire"". Overall, am I glad I read this? Sure, I guess. But I will be recommending many other books to people before I ever think of recommending this one. "
260,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16959053-seinka,5,"Wonderful, amazing. The writing is at times a little bit dry, but luckily the objects of the author's book are more than making up for that. Did you know that fishes like to be caressed, that some of them have taste buds all over their bodies (650.000 taste buds in total) so they can taste their whole environment (imagine that). Some fishes can split their eyes in 4 so that they can see what's happening above and under water, others can roll over their eyes to one side of the body. Did you know that some fish can change their gender during their lifetimes (hence, the cartoon Finding Nemo is inaccurate in the sense that after Nemo's mom died the father should have taken the female gender and fill in the role as mother), and that length does play a role for fish (they prefer longer over shorter, yes). Fishes take care of their eggs and babies. Some fishes carry their babies in their mouth during the whole pregnancy period, not allowing to eat for months. Some fishes have their penises between their eyes. Culture also plays a role among fishes, or actually many other animals, and fishes have feelings (sense of happiness, joy, sadness). There are many examples of fishes who help each other (one fish swam under the other fish because the one above could not swim well). In this day and age, unfortunately animal knowledge is linked with animal extinction, and the same goes for fishes. Industrialization has created big crates that scrape the bottoms of the oceans to fill our needs for omega 3 and in doing so generating a lot of collateral damage. Factories where fishes are being harvested for our food chain are living in despicable conditions, where some don't get to have food for 8 months simply because it generates more eggs. I probably said too much here, but this is merely a brief summary. The book contains many more marvels and facts about fishes and animals in general. In the worst it will give you some new information. In the best case it will change your world view. We are surrounded by beautiful sentient beings, not just by humans. And that realization on itself is already worth the read."
261,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61946844-amy,5,"What a Fish Knows is a systematic review of research supporting the hypothesis that fish - like our cousins, chimpanzees - are sentient. The book is sorted into sections (such as What a Fish Perceives, What a Fish Feels, Who a Fish Knows), each with chapters exploring a different aspect of the section (the section on Who a Fish Knows, for example, has chapters on cooperative hunting, social contracts, and peacekeeping behavior in intra-species and inter-species pairs/groups). I found the formatting of the chapters and sections to be very helpful and I like the emphasis on evidence-based conclusions. Though there is a liberal sprinkling of anecdotes throughout the book, they are clearly there for illustrative purposes only. The emphasis of each conclusion undoubtedly rests on the weight of the evidence that is cited in every chapter. The last chapter, Fish Out of Water, and the Epilogue are the only parts of the book that are a bit different. Though human actions in relation to fish are referenced throughout the book (and mostly in a research context), Fish Out of Water discusses the actions of humans in the context of fishing practices and the human consumption of sea life. While Balcombe takes pains to point out the already belabored but still important point that current fishing practices are unsustainable, the emphasis of the chapter is on how unethical human actions are in relation to what the reader has just learned about the sentience of fish. Quite frankly, it makes for a nauseating read, but it is a wake-up call that people should have. The epilogue focuses on the people and groups that are currently taking action to include fish in the widely accepted circle of moral concern. It is a very moving chapter that ends on a note of hope for people and for our underwater cousins. Overall, What a Fish Knows is an excellent book, and I would gladly recommend it. "
262,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2790863-allison,5,"I loved this book - and I learned so much. I love all animals and have an appreciation of how they are each individuals, with their own personalities. And while I have believed that fishes are sentient beings, I was not aware of their complexity. I loved the behavioral trial that took a certain type of fish 40 tries to solve it, primates 100 tries and a human child who didn't get it after 100 tries. Unfortunately, though, while the evidence posed in this book should get people to think again about the pain and suffering imposed on these animals, those who believe that all animals are there for us to eat because we're at the top of the food chain won't really care. People see the horrible treatment, pain and suffering on factory farms -- what cows, pigs, chickens and other animals that are used for human consumption are subjected to -- and they don't care. So whether or not they believe that fishes are sentient beings and feel pain, joy, compassion... certainly won't change their behavior. It is a sad, sad fact. However, for those who do care enough about the animals, but might think that it's okay to do this to fishes, because they don't really suffer anyway, well, this book should be a real eye-opener. Just to share a brief story. The last animal I stopped eating (30 years ago) was fish, because I too thought that fish were just above plant life. But one defining moment changed that for me. I was snorkeling for the first time in my life, and a school of beautiful fishes were below me, so I floated above them, trying to swim quietly so I could watch them. They all looked at me as they were swimming below me. It was amazing. I hope you enjoy this book. Whether or not you eat animals, you'll learn a lot. And if you call yourself a vegetarian but you eat fish, please stop. "
263,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40961426-gwen-vandendriessche,4,"Before starting to read this book, I didn’t think much of fishes. I never met that many fishes on my walks except for those who had been caught by birds (Herons, Kingfishers, Gannets, etc.) as food and that didn’t disturb me as I was happy for the birds. However, the sight of a trout looking blindly from my neighbour’s plate was enough to prevent me from eating anything and I had already been attached to a goldfish when I was young, so that was a good start for wanting to know more about them and reading Jonathan Balcombe’s book. At the first page, you understand that the author is really attached to the fishes he is talking about. He isn’t only teaching you facts, but sharing his wonder. This wonder is totally understandable for the lives of many fishes are amazingly complex. Here are a the three facts I was most amazed to learn: fishes can smell fear, some fishes lay their eggs on leaves out of the water and fire water on them to keep them moist, Nemo’s dad should have become a female after the death of his partner! As for many scientific books, I regret that much knowledge about living beings is brought by experiments which often appear really cruel to me. I’d rather not know what it is to be a fish than to know that some of them might have suffered to give me that knowledge (e.g.: injecting stuff in their eyes to know whether they use their sight to navigate!?!). Fortunaltely, only part of the book talks about these experiments.At the end of the book, the author also reminds us of the negative impact of farmed fishes on wildlife and of the disastrous slaughter of sharks and many other species for the food industry. The major part of the book just wants to amaze us, but I think those last pages are also very important to highlighten that the oceans are not endless and that we are making huges damages to their populations."
264,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43848794-samuel,4,"”And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.”‭Of the countless ideas the Bible is responsible for, ”dominion” has arguably been the worst. Instead of understanding life as vast systems of interconnected organisms, of which man is just one, man has made himself arbiter of all other living things. This has allowed us to overlook and diminish the life and intelligence of all other species. Our ignorance has allowed us to remain complacent as we destroy the oceans. Reading ’What A Fish Knows’ by Jonathan Balcombe is eye-opening, though some of it reads like trivia. Did you know that goldfish can recognize individual humans they haven’t seen in months? That tuna is more closely related to humans than they are to sharks? That a lot of fishes enjoy being petted? That they have personal friends and enemies? That cleaner fish do a better job if there are customers waiting their turn (and evaluating the services)? That different species of fish can communicate with one another to help eachother hunt for dinner? Etc etc. Why haven’t we bothered to find out till now? It seems that it may have something to do with facial muscles. Since fish can’t raise eye-brows or smile happily we have simply assumed they’re incognizant. ”What A Fish Knows” is packed with remarkable discoveries about fish. So much so that the last chapter about what we’re doing to destroy the ocean ecology is deeply disturbing. Many species of fish are indeed living in the end days. There’s an ocean apocalypse going on, and man is the destroyer of worlds."
265,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7709596-g-na,5,"Every once in awhile I am lucky enough to read a book that feels like it was written just for me, and this is one of those books. Here Balcombe takes a good look at the cognition and senses of fishes, with chapters on their consciousness, social lives, tool use, and more. Fishes have individual personalities and are much smarter than people realize, and that's something I have seen myself in the many hours I've spent underwater with them.Too many people think of fishes as primitive and unfeeling, and I know many think that fish cannot feel pain - they absolutely can, and studies have proved it! Yes, they live in an environment that is foreign to us, and they have no limbs or eyelids (unnecessary when your surroundings keep your eyes permanently moist), but they are still advanced vertebrates with complex and fully-functioning nervous systems. Because fishes are so different from us people seem to have no qualms about killing them, and the author has devoted a chapter to this sad fact. Today, commercial fisheries pull millions of tons (billions and billions of fish) out of the sea every year, which has resulted in the collapse of various fisheries, and populations of these fishes are dropping to the point where many species are nearing extinction.What a Fish Knows is well-researched and has over 30 pages of references, many of which are peer-reviewed journals. Balcomb did a good job of translating the scientific articles into everyday language for the layperson. This is a fantastic book."
266,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,3,"Early in the book, the author asks why we tend to relegate fishes ""... beyond the outer orbit of our moral concern?"" This obvious object of this book is to raise awareness of the more complex aspects of fish life, hopefully increasing our concern.Part 2 of the book starts by examining fishes in some detail, revealing some surprising facts such as the vast number of eggs some species produce (300 million for an Ocean Sunfish), but also providing a good overview of their vision (they see UV and so some fish body markings are only visible in the UV range), hearing, smelling, touch and navigation senses.Part 3 examines evidence that fish care for each other and play. The author even suggests that when fish jump it may sometimes be for sheer joy.Fish intelligence is the subject of part 4, where the ability of fishes to map their environment and to solve problems suggests at least some species have unexpected abilities.Part 5 looks at relationships and evidence that fish recognize their neighbours, and the possibility that they recognize specific humans. Groupers have been seen to use a headstand signal to indicate to partner moray eels the location of hidden prey. This is interpreted as planning and one group of researchers ""... concluded that the collaborative capabilities of groupers compare favorably with those of chimpanzees.""The complexities of fish sex and parenting are discussed in part 6.The unsustainable practices of fishing are examined in part 7. The book ends with a plea for greater compassion for fishes."
267,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34895792-stacie,3,"3.75 starsWell, now I know some cool stuff about fish. That was mostly interesting, I really enjoyed learning about the different observations and anecdotes throughout the book. I'm fascinated by animals, so any peak into their behavior is a cool experience for me. Though, I do think the writing in certain places became a tad dry and the author's humor was like a bad dad joke (which is why I can't bring myself to give this 4 stars). Also, I saw some other reviews saying the book came off as preachy. I don't know if I fully feel that way. However, full-disclosure, I've been plant-based for a few years so maybe I'm used to the whole animal rights spiel. That being said, from an animal rights/humane side of things, this book didn't really bring anything new to the table. I feel like Balcombe just watched a few documentaries on animal activism and summarized their points in the book's epilogue. But, all of that aside, feel what you want to about fish. I think that the facts and studies about the fish are the more interesting point to pay attention to in the book anyway.If you like marine bio or are interested in animal behavior, this seems like a good introduction to that genre."
268,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32960023-judith,5,"This book has almost (98%) persuaded me to give up eating fish; well, it and what I have read about mercury levels in fish and bits of plastic as well. Given the pollution of our oceans, fish are not a healthy food source; given Balcombe's examination of the intelligence, awareness/consciousness of fish, and the inhumanity of how we capture and kill them, we need to rethink how we ""harvest"" them (and we all should rethink how many children we should have--the projected increase in human population by 2030 is not sustainable at the western world's way of living). Balcombe uses a number of sources, scientific as well as some personal/individual experiences, to argue that fish have intelligence, some at least have exhibited compassion, they can communicate intra- and extra-species (the grouper/moray eel cooperation is astounding), they do feel pain, they can learn from experience (and some kinds of situations they do better than our young children).Readers who are serious about ecology, living lives more sustainably and in amity with other species (rather than recklessly and thoughtlessly exploitatively) should read this book."
269,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65519162-cathy-church,5,"This would be a surprise to anyone who has never even thought that a fish might actually experience pain, fear, avoidance, and much, much more. but the best part is how entertaining Jonathan Balcombe's writing is. This is not a scientific tome, but a refreshing overview of a myriad experiments. As an active scuba diver, I have often wondered just how much a fish really does know. I felt that they remembered me after repeated visits with the same behavior. And sure enough, even a year later, they remember. And Jonathan describes experiments with fish proving that they can even recognize individual human faces when wearing the same red hat when one feeds them and the other doesn't. The red hatted non feeder gets no reaction. The face of the red-hatted feeder sends them scurrying to the surface for food. That may seem minor, but humans certainly can not discern just the facial differences among fish who all look the same to us. There are many more, and better examples, of how cunning they are, how they work to trick others, or cheat others, or show remorse. It will hopefully help you to stop thinking that catch and release is OK. "

273,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105791880-george-jacobs,5,"Jonathan Balcombe, the author of this New York Times best-selling book, has worked for many years as an ethologist (a scientist who studies animal behaviour). He is director of animal sentience at the Humane Society Institute for Science and Policy. His website is www.jonathanbalcombe.com. His other books are The Exultant Art: A Pictorial Tour of Animal Pleasure, Second Nature: The Iinner Livers of Animals, Pleasurable Kingdom: Animals and the Nature of Feeling Good, and The Use of Aanimals in Higher Education: Problems, Alternatives, and Recommendations. 	This review attempts to give readers an understanding of the structure of the book and a sample of some the book’s main points. The review ends with some comments by the reviewer. The book consists of seven parts, some of which are divided into chapters. Balcombe dedicates the book to the “anonymous trillions” of fishes, and he hopes that after reading this book (or a summary thereof) that humans will appreciate that fishes are not objects or grains of sand, but that each of the trillions of fishes is an individual who thinks and feels. Referring to his hopes for each of the approximately 7.4 billion humans’ attitudes towards fishes, Balcombe quotes an anonymous poet, “Nothing has changed except my attitude—so everything has changed” (p. 8). The reviewer believes this book provides valuable resources which ecolinguists can use to change people’s attitudes towards finishes. Prologue	That quote was from the book’s prologue, which includes basic information on fishes and their plight. Balcombe contends that although many, many books have been written about fishes, his is the first book written on behalf of fishes. Other works that seem to be concerned about fishes, talking about endangered species and overexploitation of fish “stocks”, actually focus on fishes as commodities for human use. The lives of fishes, Balcombe believes, have value not primarily for what they offer humans. Instead, all fishes’ lives have value to each of those fishes and those in their communities. 	One estimate puts the number of land animals killed annually for food for humans at about 70 billion. How many fishes are killed each year to feed humans? Balcombe uses an estimate, based on FAO data, that 1 trillion to 2.7 trillion fishes are killed by humans each year. (For other stats, please visit http://www.fishcount.org.uk.) These fishes die mostly from a combination of asphyxiation (when they are taken out of the water), decompression (due to pressure change as they are brought out of the water, being crushed under the weight of the fishes and other marine animals caught with them in the same net and being slaughtered.Part 1 – The Misunderstood Fish	Fishes are an extremely diverse collection of animals, accounting for 33,249 species, 60% of all the known vertebrates, with many more fish species likely yet to be discovered. The two main types of fishes are bony fishes (the largest group), including eels, salmons, basses, goldfishes and carps, and cartilaginous fishes, including sharks and rays. Fishes have been on the Earth much longer than humans: “[Fishes] had graced planet Earth fifty times longer than we have before they even left the water” (p. 13). As to the criticism that fishes’ small brains mean that they must not be able to think or feel, Balcombe counters with the point that miniaturisation allows small objects to function as well as larger ones.		Another misconception about fishes is that because fishes have been on Earth for so many geologic ages, fishes must be primitive creatures who stopped evolving, while other vertebrates, especially mammals, continued evolving. Balcombe (p. 21) explains:All of the fish species that were living at the dawn of legs and lungs are long gone. … The descents of early fishes have been evolving eons longer than their terrestrial counterparts, and on these terms fishes are the most highly evolved of all vertebrates. You might be surprised to know that fishes have the genetic machinery to make fingers—something that shows how similar fishes are to modern mammals. They just don’t develop fingers, but fins instead, since fins are better for swimming than fingers are. Part II – What a Fish Perceives	Part II consists of three chapters – What a Fish Sees, What a Fish Hears, Smells and Tastes, and Navigation, Touch and Beyond - focusing on the senses fishes use to perceive the world around them. All of these abilities are keenly affected by the fact that fishes live in water. For instance, sound travels much faster in water than in air. Given this and other differences in perception, humans may have difficulty understanding how fishes perceive their worlds. What a Fish Sees Fishes’ eyes are much like human eyes, with three pairs of muscles which enable the eyes to swivel. However, fishes’ vision does differ from that of humans, the main difference being that humans have eyelids, while fishes do not. However, other differences also exist. For instance, some fishes, such as adult flounders, have both their eyes on the same side of their bodies. Also, in regard to sight, just as humans use camouflage to fool hostiles, fishes also use visual cues to fool predators. For example, comet fishes lure predators to attack their rear ends, instead of their more sensitive heads. Comet fishes are able to do this because their rear side looks like the face of a parrot fish. What a Fish Hears, Smells and TastesBefore looking at how fishes hear, Balcombe clears up the misconception that fishes are silent creatures. Some of the mechanisms fishes use to make sounds include vibrating their swim bladders, grating and grinding their teeth, rubbing together their bones and pushing bubbles out of their anuses. Indeed, some fishes are named for the sounds they make, for example, grunters, croakers, drums and trumpeters. 	Believing fishes to be silent led to the belief that they were also deaf. This was an easy mistake for human-centric scientists, because fishes have no external hearing devices. Balcombe describes the study by Nobel Prize winning scientist, Karl van Frisch, which demonstrated fishes’ ability to hear, in much the same way that Pavlov demonstrated classical conditioning with dogs. The study’s sole participant was a blind catfish. van Frisch put food on a stick into the fish’s home. Upon smelling the food, the fish would swim towards it. Next, the researcher started whistling before lowering the food for the fish. After a while, all the fish needed was to hear whistling and he would swim towards the usual location of the food. 	Fishes can hear, and they can hear an amazing range of sounds. The fishes in one study demonstrated the ability to categorise human music (Chase, 2011). Chase’s study involved three carps. A speaker was placed in their home, an apparatus for operant conditioning was set up and the fishes learned to discriminate between blues music and classical music, and to categorise newly introduced music as either blues or classical. Another study found that listening to classical music enhanced the health of a group of fishes (Papoutsoglou, Karakatsouli, Papoutsoglou, & Vasilikos, 2010). 	Fishes use their sense of smell for such purposes as identifying their location, locating food and mates and recognising danger. Unlike human nostrils, which function for both smelling and breathing, fish nostrils have only an olfactory function. In some cases, fishes’ olfactory capabilities far exceed those of humans. Balcombe provides examples (p. 50):Salmon can detect the smell of a seal or sea lion diluted to one eighty billionth of water volume … . the American eel … can detect the equivalent of less than one ten millionth of a drop of their home water in [an] Olympic pool. Like salmons, eels make long migrations back to specific spawn sites, and they follow a subtle gradient of scent to get there. 	As to taste, one outstanding aspect of fish anatomy is the presence of taste buds in widely different parts of the body, not just in their mouths. These other locations can include the lips, snout and fins. Also, just as groups of humans tend to have similar tastes in food, e.g., spicy foods are favoured by some cultures, so too are particular foods favoured by given fish species. However, just as is the case with humans, individual fishes may have their idiosyncratic food preferences.Navigation, Touch, and Beyond Fishes, not surprisingly, have superb navigational skills. They navigate by such means as feeling water turbulence caused by the presence of objects, sun compassing, dead reckoning, a natural GPS system, smell, vision and electroreception. How do schools of fishes swim together in unison? Balcombe explains (p. 59):[Fishes have] a row of specialized scales running horizontally along their flanks, forming what is called the lateral line. ... [Each scale ] is populated by neuromasts, clusters of sensory cells each with a hair-like project encased in a tiny cup of gel. … The lateral line acts as a sonarlike system and is especially useful at night and in murky waters.Some fishes seem to enjoy touching and being touched. Touching appears to play a part in courting, in relationships between cleanerfishes and their clients, and even as a form of interaction between fishes and human divers. For example, while the evidence here is anecdotal, Balcombe reports stories of sunbathing fishes and fishes who enjoy the stimulation of the bubbles from divers’ regulators. Part III – What a Fish Feels	Part III consists of two chapters - Pain, Consciousness, and Awareness, and From Stress to Joy. Advocates on behalf of animals are fond of the following quote from the 18th century philosopher, Jeremy Bentham: “The question is not, ‘Can they reason?’ nor, ‘Can they talk?’ but ‘Can they suffer?’”. The two chapters of Part III start with this question and then proceed to happier topics. Pain, Consciousness, and AwarenessNot surprisingly, Balcombe believes that fishes do feel pain. In the book’s previous pages, he made the case for fishes having the same senses and other basic structures as other vertebrates. In this chapter, he notes that fishes have A-delta and C fibres in their nerves; mammals use these fibres to experience pain (Braithwaite, 2010; Sneddon, 2003). However, fishes and other nonmammal vertebrates do not have a neocortex, the body part posited to be the centre of consciousness. Balcombe counters that birds do not have a neocortex either, yet scientists agree that birds have consciousness and can feel pain. Furthermore, fishes’ brains have the pallium which carries out some of the same functions as the neocortex. In additional rebuttal, Balcombe makes the analogy that just as humans can swim despite lacking the fins that fishes employ for that purpose, so too are fishes conscious despite lacking a neocortex. 	While Balcombe cautions that opinion may never be unanimous on the issue of fishes and pain, he quotes a document of the American Veterinary Medical Association to argue that a general consensus has developed among scientists who study fishes (AVMA, 2013):Suggestions that finfish [fish that are not shellfish] responses to pain merely represent simple reflexes have been refuted by studies demonstrating forebrain and midbrain electrical activity in response to stimulation and different with type of nociceptor stimulation. Learning and memory consolidation in trials where finfish are taught to avoid noxious stimuli have moved the issue of finfish cognition and sentience forward to the point where the preponderance of accumulated evidence supports the position that finfish should be accorded the same considerations as terrestrial vertebrates in regard to relief from pain. Balcombe summarises the chapter by stating (pp. 84-85):Fishes show the hallmarks of pain both physiologically and behaviourally. They possess the specialized nerve fibers that mammals and birds use to detect noxious stimuli. They can learn to avoid electric shocks and anglers’ hooks. They are cognitively impaired when subjected to nasty insults to their bodies, and this impairment can be reversed if they are provided with pain relief.From Stress to JoyWhile the first chapter in Part III focused on fishes feeling pain, the second chapter focuses on emotions, beginning with fear and stress but then traveling to happier emotions. Balcombe notes that, “Emotions involve relatively old brain circuits conserved through evolution and shared by all vertebrates” (p. 88). Something similar seems to be the case for hormones that link to emotions. For instance, humans produce the hormone oxytocin, which promotes bonding, and fishes appear to have a similar hormone (Reddon et al., 2012). As to pleasurable emotions, scientists have been witnessing fishes play since 1898 (Groos, 1898). Much more recently, Burghardt, Dinets and Murphy (2014) studied three bfishes apparently playing with a thermometer which had been designed to float vertically. Each of the three fishes had their own way of playing with the thermometer. The first fish pushed down on the top of the thermometer, while the second swam round and round the thermometer occasionally touching and thereby moving it, and the third fish was the most aggressive, hitting the object at various points, thereby making it move around the tank. Part IV – What a Fish Thinks	Part IV consists of two chapters – Fins, Scales and Intelligence, and Tools, Plans and Monkey Minds. Balcombe frames these topics by recognising that the intelligences which different creatures develop are guided by those creatures’ life circumstances. Furthermore, he quotes Dinets to warn against underestimating the cognitive capabilities of nonhuman animals (p. 105), “Every other animal currently considered stupid and boring has its own amazing secrets. It’s just that nobody has been able to discover them yet”. At the same time, Balcombe cautions that just because one fish species or one individual fish demonstrates a particular ability does not mean that all species or all members of a particular species possess or can develop that ability.Fins, Scales and IntelligenceIn what may be the most amazing story in the book, Balcombe describes the cognitive mapping abilities of gobies (White & Brown, 2015). Gobies find their food in small tide pools. However, being in these pools exposes gobies to such predators as octopuses and herons. To escape predation, gobies jump to other pools. But how do they know where these other pools are? Their cognitive mapping abilities guide them.To read the entire review: https://www.academia.edu/30147532/Rev..."

275,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"The highlight, for me, occurred early in the book when the author pointed out that because fish can be fooled by optical illusions, some amount of consciousness must exist. It had occurred to me before that you can't have an illusion without consciousness - you can't make someone mis-perceive something if there's noone home to misperceive it (which is, incidentally, part of my problem with Daniel C. Dennett's claim we don't really have consciousness). So that was a wonderful bit of cleverness for me - trying to determine consciousness by fooling the fish.Anyway, fish can be fooled by some of the same stuff we are! They can see the smaller of two circles as larger if there are extra nearby circles making their relative sizes seem different. They also 'finish' shapes in their mind, 'seeing' a triangle that's only hinted at.They also can distinguish musical genres! And he provides convincing evidence that fish feel pain (which, of course, for most of us, is ""duh,"" but science requries agnosticism without good evidence, and some other people are just apologists who reject it out of hand because it's inconvenient).They can tell humans apart. They can cooperate. They make referential gestures across species! Before people noticed moray eels pointing out prey for groupers, the only species known to do that were humans (and tangentially, dogs understanding those gestures), some other apes, and ravens! Of course, the book ends with a section about how humans are evil and we're all doomed because we're killing the planet. I don't deny it - I get it and think it's a critical message, but it came out of left field for me in this book. Still, even that part was interesting, if only for some of the forehead-slappingness of it. For instance - ignoring the morality, farmed fish helps make the industry more sustainable, right? Well, no. Guess what they mostly feed farm fishes? Fish. What's the worst species in an ecosystem to hunt? The apex predator, right? Guess what tuna and marlin and sharks are. Oops.I'm going off on tangents, like the book did at the end. But there's a lot of great, well-explained stuff in here."

278,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/324370-lisa,4,"Jonathan Balcombe is an advocate for fish—or, as he prefers, fishes: “individuals with personalities and relationships”—and makes a strong case for piscine perception in What a Fish Knows: The Inner Lives of Our Underwater Cousins (Farrar, Straus). Weaving together decades of scientific studies of fish consciousness, cognition, and social structure, ethologist Balcombe (author of the lovely The Exultant Ark) offers a picture of fish(es) as complex and sentient beings. Not only do they have acute senses of sight, hearing, and smell, they have the capacity to feel pleasure as well as pain, and some form hierarchical grooming cooperatives, hunt in interspecies packs, help raise nonbiological offspring while waiting their turn to fertilize eggs, or recognize each other after months apart. At times the recitation of “believe it or not” knowledge bites can feel like overreaching to make a point; at others Balcombe edges toward a decidedly unscientific whimsy—he never met a fish pun he didn’t like. But altogether, What a Fish Knows is lively and surprising, making a good argument for sport and food fishing reform.VERDICT: This may ruin readers’ fish dinners forever, but will appeal to fans of odd science and animal rights advocates alike.—My Library Journal review"
279,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2290905-jimmy,5,"Fish are friends. Not food.Very well spoken by some sharks in the beloved movie Finding Nemo. But just how true are those words, especially to us humans? There's plenty of fish out in the sea, and no amount of fishing could ever deplete the vast ocean of all its fish. Could it? The sad answer is yes.Fish are animals, and they have personalities and social lives and experience emotions just like us and any other animal. Balcombe makes the case in his fascinating book What a Fish Knows, and you may come away learning something new from reading this. Perhaps it's the fact that fish are in an entirely different environment separate from our own world that we don't think twice about the sport of fishing, aquaculture, or the delicious baked salmon on the dinner plate. But after reading this, I find myself just a little bit more attuned to the life of a fish.I'll never look at a fish in a tank the same way again. As we develop better technologies and ways to be sustainable, the fishing industry should certainly be on everyone's radar."
280,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2028832-kathleen,3,"I enjoyed the premise of this book, that fish are interesting, evolved animals just as much as many birds and mammals. We should consider as much when we discuss fishing and farming practices, which may involve a great degree of cruelty. Including many interesting facts, studies, and anecdotes, this is a good choice for the casual reader looking for a little natural science. It did not have quite as many photographs in the picture section as I might have liked, but I would look at pictures of fish all day, so that's fair. I suspect this author may be a secret vegan, and I certainly have no intention of not eating fish any time soon, but we can certainly all be more conscious consumers. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who does eat fish, or just wants to learn a little bit about the fascinating underwater world. "

Instead I got a book where the science is used to support the author's personal belief that we need to dramatically change our relationship with fish.And I am sympathetic to that worldview. I think the environmental and ethical issues are genuine and worth examining. But the preaching, which is undeniably the main point of this book, had the opposite effect on me. I questioned whether or not the science presented was genuine or misleading, because there was such an obvious agenda. It didn't help that there were many many places where the conclusions did not follow from the evidence presented. I wanted... a more intellectually honest book."

The social contracts, co-operation and fish democracy involved in fishey lives, as well as the strange variety of breeding and parenting methods make for interesting reading. As the author says: ""fishes are individuals"", and he does a good job in showing why he thinks that. The book comes with a nice selection of colour photographs."

I thought, now that was something you don't see every day. In the back of my head that fish was still in my head a few weeks later I walked into the library to return a book and saw What A Fish Knows on a highlight shelf. Jonathan Balcombe's volume on the lives of fish is a captivating read, specially considering that the subjects are well fish. Luckily this book is a great dive in the myriad lives of different fishes throughout the world. And it's really about fish, you won't get a lot of talk about mollusks, crustaceans, whales, or other non fish things. It's packed with interesting facts about those denizens of the deep, but it's not just a dry volume of fish facts. There are dozens of charming stories and surprises in What A Fish Knows that I wouldn't have expected, I mean they are fish! There are parts where it boils down to ""no one knows why fish X thing happens."" Which just highlights how little people know about water bound life. It's a fun read until the last chapter that highlights the hellish fishing industries, which really, really, really bummed me out. Not that I was unaware of such things, but it was even harder to read about after learning that fish aren't just biological swimming automatons. The whole thing makes me really think about my tuna sandwiches. But where does that stop? Where is my sympathy towards the tomato pickers? What about the tons of garbage generated by the plastic industry, keeping in mind that the mustard in the fridge is in a plastic container? What's the bread I have really made from? I'm not here to have a crisis of consciousness about my lunch when all I wanted to do is say: every chapter in What a Fish knows can be its own book and the book is worth your time to read. I really liked it and I don't even like going to the aquarium (not from guilt, it just makes me feel oddly claustrophobic) plus finding the ocean just fucking terrifying if I think about it. While it does have some pictures it's not illustrated all the way, so I spent some time looking up various types of fishes that are featured in the book and I can't wait to see what my targeted ads are going to look like soon."
289,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83179136-catherine-puma,3,"Published in 2016, ""What a Fish Knows"" is a popular science nonfiction book that has been on my To Read list for a few years now. Jonathan Balcombe uses anecdotes, interviews, and studies he finds interesting to mention some of what humans have observed about the lives of our underwater cousins. While aquariums, household pets, and decorative koi ponds are also mentioned, most of the tales in this book are about wild examples from African cichlids, to Hawaiian cleaner wrasses, Atlantic goliath grouper, deep-sea lantern fish, and even some touches upon sharks and rays (my personal favorites). I do appreciate the way this is structured. Different parts are about what a fish perceives, feels, thinks, who a fish knows, and how a fish breeds. These parts are then further broken up into chapters on various senses and stimulii, intelligence and problem-solving, social contracts and interactions, and sexual and parenting activities.This book does not have to be read in order, so although a conversation-driven chapter book with a few photos or charts/diagrams/maps, readers can skip to the topics they find most interesting. However, although there are parts of this I really enjoyed and I did learn some interesting facts about different fish species, overall there is something off about the content's presentation. What's being said about fishes is important, but ethologist Balcombe's tone is nearly unbearably pretentious, self-righteous, self-centered, and judgmental. He scoffs at experts and makes fun of the scientific process. He is anti-fisheries and vehemently vegan, but doesn't have anything bad to say about decorative privately-owned aquariums or entertainment facilities like SeaWorld. He's entitled to his own opinions, but he spends too much time JUST being opinionated in this book. This would have been significantly improved if it stressed more on the end of explaining fish-facts. While reading this, I kept thinking about the other popular science nonfiction books about fishes that are so much BETTER than this one. Top choices that come to mind include: - Mark Kurlansky's ""Salmon"", - Sy Montgomery's ""The Soul of an Octopus"", - Paul Greenberg's ""Four Fish"", and - Danna Staaf's ""Squid Empire"". Overall, am I glad I read this? Sure, I guess. But I will be recommending many other books to people before I ever think of recommending this one. "
290,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16959053-seinka,5,"Wonderful, amazing. The writing is at times a little bit dry, but luckily the objects of the author's book are more than making up for that. Did you know that fishes like to be caressed, that some of them have taste buds all over their bodies (650.000 taste buds in total) so they can taste their whole environment (imagine that). Some fishes can split their eyes in 4 so that they can see what's happening above and under water, others can roll over their eyes to one side of the body. Did you know that some fish can change their gender during their lifetimes (hence, the cartoon Finding Nemo is inaccurate in the sense that after Nemo's mom died the father should have taken the female gender and fill in the role as mother), and that length does play a role for fish (they prefer longer over shorter, yes). Fishes take care of their eggs and babies. Some fishes carry their babies in their mouth during the whole pregnancy period, not allowing to eat for months. Some fishes have their penises between their eyes. Culture also plays a role among fishes, or actually many other animals, and fishes have feelings (sense of happiness, joy, sadness). There are many examples of fishes who help each other (one fish swam under the other fish because the one above could not swim well). In this day and age, unfortunately animal knowledge is linked with animal extinction, and the same goes for fishes. Industrialization has created big crates that scrape the bottoms of the oceans to fill our needs for omega 3 and in doing so generating a lot of collateral damage. Factories where fishes are being harvested for our food chain are living in despicable conditions, where some don't get to have food for 8 months simply because it generates more eggs. I probably said too much here, but this is merely a brief summary. The book contains many more marvels and facts about fishes and animals in general. In the worst it will give you some new information. In the best case it will change your world view. We are surrounded by beautiful sentient beings, not just by humans. And that realization on itself is already worth the read."
291,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61946844-amy,5,"What a Fish Knows is a systematic review of research supporting the hypothesis that fish - like our cousins, chimpanzees - are sentient. The book is sorted into sections (such as What a Fish Perceives, What a Fish Feels, Who a Fish Knows), each with chapters exploring a different aspect of the section (the section on Who a Fish Knows, for example, has chapters on cooperative hunting, social contracts, and peacekeeping behavior in intra-species and inter-species pairs/groups). I found the formatting of the chapters and sections to be very helpful and I like the emphasis on evidence-based conclusions. Though there is a liberal sprinkling of anecdotes throughout the book, they are clearly there for illustrative purposes only. The emphasis of each conclusion undoubtedly rests on the weight of the evidence that is cited in every chapter. The last chapter, Fish Out of Water, and the Epilogue are the only parts of the book that are a bit different. Though human actions in relation to fish are referenced throughout the book (and mostly in a research context), Fish Out of Water discusses the actions of humans in the context of fishing practices and the human consumption of sea life. While Balcombe takes pains to point out the already belabored but still important point that current fishing practices are unsustainable, the emphasis of the chapter is on how unethical human actions are in relation to what the reader has just learned about the sentience of fish. Quite frankly, it makes for a nauseating read, but it is a wake-up call that people should have. The epilogue focuses on the people and groups that are currently taking action to include fish in the widely accepted circle of moral concern. It is a very moving chapter that ends on a note of hope for people and for our underwater cousins. Overall, What a Fish Knows is an excellent book, and I would gladly recommend it. "
292,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2790863-allison,5,"I loved this book - and I learned so much. I love all animals and have an appreciation of how they are each individuals, with their own personalities. And while I have believed that fishes are sentient beings, I was not aware of their complexity. I loved the behavioral trial that took a certain type of fish 40 tries to solve it, primates 100 tries and a human child who didn't get it after 100 tries. Unfortunately, though, while the evidence posed in this book should get people to think again about the pain and suffering imposed on these animals, those who believe that all animals are there for us to eat because we're at the top of the food chain won't really care. People see the horrible treatment, pain and suffering on factory farms -- what cows, pigs, chickens and other animals that are used for human consumption are subjected to -- and they don't care. So whether or not they believe that fishes are sentient beings and feel pain, joy, compassion... certainly won't change their behavior. It is a sad, sad fact. However, for those who do care enough about the animals, but might think that it's okay to do this to fishes, because they don't really suffer anyway, well, this book should be a real eye-opener. Just to share a brief story. The last animal I stopped eating (30 years ago) was fish, because I too thought that fish were just above plant life. But one defining moment changed that for me. I was snorkeling for the first time in my life, and a school of beautiful fishes were below me, so I floated above them, trying to swim quietly so I could watch them. They all looked at me as they were swimming below me. It was amazing. I hope you enjoy this book. Whether or not you eat animals, you'll learn a lot. And if you call yourself a vegetarian but you eat fish, please stop. "
293,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40961426-gwen-vandendriessche,4,"Before starting to read this book, I didn’t think much of fishes. I never met that many fishes on my walks except for those who had been caught by birds (Herons, Kingfishers, Gannets, etc.) as food and that didn’t disturb me as I was happy for the birds. However, the sight of a trout looking blindly from my neighbour’s plate was enough to prevent me from eating anything and I had already been attached to a goldfish when I was young, so that was a good start for wanting to know more about them and reading Jonathan Balcombe’s book. At the first page, you understand that the author is really attached to the fishes he is talking about. He isn’t only teaching you facts, but sharing his wonder. This wonder is totally understandable for the lives of many fishes are amazingly complex. Here are a the three facts I was most amazed to learn: fishes can smell fear, some fishes lay their eggs on leaves out of the water and fire water on them to keep them moist, Nemo’s dad should have become a female after the death of his partner! As for many scientific books, I regret that much knowledge about living beings is brought by experiments which often appear really cruel to me. I’d rather not know what it is to be a fish than to know that some of them might have suffered to give me that knowledge (e.g.: injecting stuff in their eyes to know whether they use their sight to navigate!?!). Fortunaltely, only part of the book talks about these experiments.At the end of the book, the author also reminds us of the negative impact of farmed fishes on wildlife and of the disastrous slaughter of sharks and many other species for the food industry. The major part of the book just wants to amaze us, but I think those last pages are also very important to highlighten that the oceans are not endless and that we are making huges damages to their populations."
294,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43848794-samuel,4,"”And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.”‭Of the countless ideas the Bible is responsible for, ”dominion” has arguably been the worst. Instead of understanding life as vast systems of interconnected organisms, of which man is just one, man has made himself arbiter of all other living things. This has allowed us to overlook and diminish the life and intelligence of all other species. Our ignorance has allowed us to remain complacent as we destroy the oceans. Reading ’What A Fish Knows’ by Jonathan Balcombe is eye-opening, though some of it reads like trivia. Did you know that goldfish can recognize individual humans they haven’t seen in months? That tuna is more closely related to humans than they are to sharks? That a lot of fishes enjoy being petted? That they have personal friends and enemies? That cleaner fish do a better job if there are customers waiting their turn (and evaluating the services)? That different species of fish can communicate with one another to help eachother hunt for dinner? Etc etc. Why haven’t we bothered to find out till now? It seems that it may have something to do with facial muscles. Since fish can’t raise eye-brows or smile happily we have simply assumed they’re incognizant. ”What A Fish Knows” is packed with remarkable discoveries about fish. So much so that the last chapter about what we’re doing to destroy the ocean ecology is deeply disturbing. Many species of fish are indeed living in the end days. There’s an ocean apocalypse going on, and man is the destroyer of worlds."
295,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7709596-g-na,5,"Every once in awhile I am lucky enough to read a book that feels like it was written just for me, and this is one of those books. Here Balcombe takes a good look at the cognition and senses of fishes, with chapters on their consciousness, social lives, tool use, and more. Fishes have individual personalities and are much smarter than people realize, and that's something I have seen myself in the many hours I've spent underwater with them.Too many people think of fishes as primitive and unfeeling, and I know many think that fish cannot feel pain - they absolutely can, and studies have proved it! Yes, they live in an environment that is foreign to us, and they have no limbs or eyelids (unnecessary when your surroundings keep your eyes permanently moist), but they are still advanced vertebrates with complex and fully-functioning nervous systems. Because fishes are so different from us people seem to have no qualms about killing them, and the author has devoted a chapter to this sad fact. Today, commercial fisheries pull millions of tons (billions and billions of fish) out of the sea every year, which has resulted in the collapse of various fisheries, and populations of these fishes are dropping to the point where many species are nearing extinction.What a Fish Knows is well-researched and has over 30 pages of references, many of which are peer-reviewed journals. Balcomb did a good job of translating the scientific articles into everyday language for the layperson. This is a fantastic book."
296,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,3,"Early in the book, the author asks why we tend to relegate fishes ""... beyond the outer orbit of our moral concern?"" This obvious object of this book is to raise awareness of the more complex aspects of fish life, hopefully increasing our concern.Part 2 of the book starts by examining fishes in some detail, revealing some surprising facts such as the vast number of eggs some species produce (300 million for an Ocean Sunfish), but also providing a good overview of their vision (they see UV and so some fish body markings are only visible in the UV range), hearing, smelling, touch and navigation senses.Part 3 examines evidence that fish care for each other and play. The author even suggests that when fish jump it may sometimes be for sheer joy.Fish intelligence is the subject of part 4, where the ability of fishes to map their environment and to solve problems suggests at least some species have unexpected abilities.Part 5 looks at relationships and evidence that fish recognize their neighbours, and the possibility that they recognize specific humans. Groupers have been seen to use a headstand signal to indicate to partner moray eels the location of hidden prey. This is interpreted as planning and one group of researchers ""... concluded that the collaborative capabilities of groupers compare favorably with those of chimpanzees.""The complexities of fish sex and parenting are discussed in part 6.The unsustainable practices of fishing are examined in part 7. The book ends with a plea for greater compassion for fishes."
297,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34895792-stacie,3,"3.75 starsWell, now I know some cool stuff about fish. That was mostly interesting, I really enjoyed learning about the different observations and anecdotes throughout the book. I'm fascinated by animals, so any peak into their behavior is a cool experience for me. Though, I do think the writing in certain places became a tad dry and the author's humor was like a bad dad joke (which is why I can't bring myself to give this 4 stars). Also, I saw some other reviews saying the book came off as preachy. I don't know if I fully feel that way. However, full-disclosure, I've been plant-based for a few years so maybe I'm used to the whole animal rights spiel. That being said, from an animal rights/humane side of things, this book didn't really bring anything new to the table. I feel like Balcombe just watched a few documentaries on animal activism and summarized their points in the book's epilogue. But, all of that aside, feel what you want to about fish. I think that the facts and studies about the fish are the more interesting point to pay attention to in the book anyway.If you like marine bio or are interested in animal behavior, this seems like a good introduction to that genre."
298,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32960023-judith,5,"This book has almost (98%) persuaded me to give up eating fish; well, it and what I have read about mercury levels in fish and bits of plastic as well. Given the pollution of our oceans, fish are not a healthy food source; given Balcombe's examination of the intelligence, awareness/consciousness of fish, and the inhumanity of how we capture and kill them, we need to rethink how we ""harvest"" them (and we all should rethink how many children we should have--the projected increase in human population by 2030 is not sustainable at the western world's way of living). Balcombe uses a number of sources, scientific as well as some personal/individual experiences, to argue that fish have intelligence, some at least have exhibited compassion, they can communicate intra- and extra-species (the grouper/moray eel cooperation is astounding), they do feel pain, they can learn from experience (and some kinds of situations they do better than our young children).Readers who are serious about ecology, living lives more sustainably and in amity with other species (rather than recklessly and thoughtlessly exploitatively) should read this book."
299,0374288216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65519162-cathy-church,5,"This would be a surprise to anyone who has never even thought that a fish might actually experience pain, fear, avoidance, and much, much more. but the best part is how entertaining Jonathan Balcombe's writing is. This is not a scientific tome, but a refreshing overview of a myriad experiments. As an active scuba diver, I have often wondered just how much a fish really does know. I felt that they remembered me after repeated visits with the same behavior. And sure enough, even a year later, they remember. And Jonathan describes experiments with fish proving that they can even recognize individual human faces when wearing the same red hat when one feeds them and the other doesn't. The red hatted non feeder gets no reaction. The face of the red-hatted feeder sends them scurrying to the surface for food. That may seem minor, but humans certainly can not discern just the facial differences among fish who all look the same to us. There are many more, and better examples, of how cunning they are, how they work to trick others, or cheat others, or show remorse. It will hopefully help you to stop thinking that catch and release is OK. "
