0,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"[Original review, November 2008]This book blew me away... I hadn't been paying attention, and had missed a scientific revolution that had happened right under my nose! To cut to the chase: either someone created the Universe expressly to make it suitable for living beings, or there are lots of universes, and we just happen to be in one of the rare ones that support life. Right now, there don't seem to be many other serious alternatives. If you have trouble believing this, get Rees's excellent book. It will change the way you think about things._______________________________[Postscript, December 2008]I was just looking at Trevor's review, and thought I would update my own. Here are a couple more thoughts. First, much as I hate saying it, the creationists have a stronger position now than they've had for the last 300 years. There's something really odd about the way the physical constants are so finely tuned. Some of them need to be correct to multiple decimal places. Of course, when I say ""creationists"", I don't mean people who claim the world was made 10,000 years ago. I mean the faction who agree that most of science is correct, but want some Creator to have started the whole thing off.I don't see that it's a real counter-argument that God wouldn't have anything to do for the next 13 billion years. Maybe time passes very differently for Him. Maybe He isn't really at all interested in what we're up to, and is only omnipotent and omniscient in a narrow technical sense. Suppose, as an extreme example, that our whole universe was a simulation that some student had set up as a term project in the university's quantum computer. We see 13 billion years, but from His point of view He is running us over the weekend. He's an ordinary 19 year old, He's only doing it to pass Cosmology 101, and He even copied the critical parameter settings from a friend as some students do. I don't actually see why it's inconsistent with the observed data! There could be a short story in this. I'm sorry if religious people find the above horribly blasphemous. All I'm saying is: one explanation of the facts is that the universe was created, but we can deduce nothing at all from that about the nature of the Creator._______________________________[Postscript, August 2012]I have read a good deal more cosmology since I first came across Just Six Numbers in 2006, and thought I would re-read it to see what difference this had made. I'm pleased to say that the book still comes across a fine piece of work, and if you want to get a quick introduction to cosmology I strongly recommend it. The writing is excellent. It was published in 1999. Rees made some predictions about what might happen over the next ten years. I was interested to see how they had worked out:Prediction 1. Mainly thanks to the upcoming WMAP satellite, we would have much better values for Ω, Λ and 
Q
 (roughly, the extent to which space is curved, the strength of Dark Energy, and the graininess of the universe). Ω would probably turn out to be 1 (flat space), and 
Q
 would be about 10^-5.This definitely came out as he said it would. If anything, we understand the large-scale structure of the universe better than we expected.Prediction 2. We would know what ""dark matter"" is made of.Alas, we still don't. I am not even sure if we are significantly closer to finding out.Prediction 3. We would have a solid ""Theory of Everything"" which unified the four forces of nature, and which would probably be based on superstring theory.This has also failed to happen - though we have at least confirmed that the Higgs particle exists, which makes his scenarios for the very early universe a little less speculative._______________________________[Postscript, September 2018]And another update:Prediction 1. Mainly thanks to the upcoming WMAP satellite, we would have much better values for Ω, Λ and 
Q
 (roughly, the extent to which space is curved, the strength of Dark Energy, and the graininess of the universe). Ω would probably turn out to be 1 (flat space), and 
Q
 would be about 10^-5.This has all worked out 100%.Prediction 2. We would know what ""dark matter"" is made of.We still don't know. Experiments to try and detect hypothetical dark matter particles have not produced any conclusive results. There is a decent summary of the situation as of early 2014 in the second half of Freese's 
The Cosmic Cocktail
, but none of the optimistic predictions there have been fulfilled.One interesting new idea has turned up following the 2016 LIGO gravitational wave results: it's just about possible that the dark matter could consist of large primordial black holes, of the kind found by LIGO. But this idea isn't very popular.Prediction 3. We would have a solid ""Theory of Everything"" which unified the four forces of nature, and which would probably be based on superstring theory.Superstring theory is not doing well. The predicted supersymmetric partners have failed to show up at the LHC. While they haven't been completely excluded by experiment, most people are now assuming that they aren't there.Loop Quantum Gravity has however become considerably more respectable. There's a good summary of that in Rovelli's 
Reality is Not What It Seems

1,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"Rees is an interesting man - I went to a lecture by him years ago where he explained his theory of the six numbers. Essentially he says that if you were to change a few numbers - the force of gravity, say, or the electric charge - the universe would be completely different. It is interesting that the universe seems to be pretty nicely set up for life to evolve and even little changes in these fundamental numbers would make life as we know it impossible.I always have problems with this sort of argument. My main problem is that we are clearly here. My next problem is that the religious immediately take talk like this as some sort of confirmation that god was the setter of these constants. It never seems to strike them that if this is the only role their god has, god pity him. If his entire involvement with the universe is turning a few dials thirteen billion years ago and then waiting around - I can only hope he had a few good books to read as all this universe stuff played out.The point that Rees makes that is very interesting is that there are two answers to the question - why those numbers and not others? One is, ""Well, that's just the way it is."" Which is pretty unsatisfying. We want more than 'because' as an answer. Another answer to why those numbers and not others is that there must be some more fundamental necessity for these numbers to be the numbers in which the universe is 'constructed' - that these numbers 'need' to be these numbers for reasons we don't yet understand. I hope he is right here - that there is a deeper reason we are able to grasp and understand that is just out of reach of us at present. But we have no reason to believe this is the case and that all of these numbers just happened to be the way they are by chance."

A fine example of popular science book, encapsulating several interesting concepts in just a little over 170 pages, with little oversimplification. Had I come across this book 15 years ago, I would have appreciated it immensely more. Reading it now, unfortunately it did not give me much, to be honest - but this is no fault of the book per se.It must also be said that some parts are a little dated (unavoidably so, considering the significant progress since the book was published), but it is still a very pleasurable, light read with many interesting insights. Highly recommended as a easy, very readable introductory book, to anybody interested in the phenomenon of the apparent ""fine tuning"" of some of the major physical/cosmological ""constants"" that allowed for the development of complexity (and ultimately life) in the Universe.

5,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6816078-maru-kun,4,"After we've had a few drinks my fundamentalist friends will often bring the talk round to The Creation just to have some fun at my expense.They laugh at my belief in a ""big bang"", make ribald jokes about my ""sudden, enormous inflation"" and tell me I don't have much energy at all these days let alone any ""dark energy"". I've only myself to blame for not keeping up with the latest in cosmology. I tend to end up mumbling something about micro-wave background radiation before heading off quickly to the bar to order the next round.Well, rounds aren't cheap anymore, so I thought I should do something to remedy the situation. This book is a great help to anyone wanting to bring some modern cosmology into the metaphysical discussions that inevitably crop up on pub night and I've written this review to help me crib a few points.Thanks to the excellent explanation in this book I could get together a summary of key parameters underlying the whole of material existence which I can take a look at in the pub toilets on my iphone next time we're out drinking. My knowledge of the first few nano-seconds at the birth of the universe should be enough to blow their Ark out of the water. Drinks on the faithful for a change!N - the relative strength of the force of gravity compared to the electrostatic forces of attraction or repulsion, with the force of gravity being about ten to the thirty-sixth power weaker. If gravity was much stronger galaxies would form more quickly and be more dense resulting in greater difficulty forming stable planetary systems; stellar lifetimes would be shorter, potentially not allowing sufficient time to evolve complex biological molecules.e - nuclear efficiency - the percentage of mass of a helium atom compared to the mass of its separate parts (i.e. two protons and neutrons). e is a measure of the amount of the energy generated from fusion into helium given Einstein's well known formula. If e were too low, deuterium - an important intermediate in helium fusion - would not form. If e were too high then protons could join directly without neutrons and in such quantity that little hydrogen would be available to form stars and then through stellar evolution for the formation of other elements required for evolution of biological molecules. Omega - the ratio of actual matter in the universe to the critical amount of matter to balance expansion of the universe with contraction due to gravity. If omega is less than one the universe will continue expanding indefinitely and too rapidly to allow galaxy and star formation and hence development of life; more than one and the universe will ultimately begin to contract, again too fast for stellar evolution and hence life to develop.The rate of expansion suggests strongly that omega was either very close to one at the time of the big bang (i.e. differing from one by one part in ten to the fifteenth) or raises the question as to whether there is some theoretical reason that omega should have been one at the time of the big bang.Observable matter in the universe suggests omega is well below one, leading to the search for ""dark matter"". But what is ""dark matter""? Candidate matter includes ""brown dwarf"" stars, mini-black holes or some type of as yet unknown particle. As an aside anti-matter seems relatively unlikely to be a candidate for dark matter: an asymmetry was found in the rate of decay of the k particle which implies that if a similar asymmetry exists in the strong nuclear force there may have been a surplus of matter after quark vs anti-quark annihilation during the early stage of the big bang. In fact the ratio of photons to protons observed in the universe is not inconsistent with the magnitude of this asymmetry.Lambda - Einstein's famous cosmological constant reborn - the constant introduced into Einstein's equations at which ""cosmic repulsion"" exactly balanced gravity and would reflect the net effect of energy within empty space. There is strong but not overwhelming evidence for lambda being low but non zero. If lambda was too large repulsion would have overwhelmed gravity in early stages of the universe, again preventing galaxy and star evolution and the formation of life.Q - a measure of how tightly matter is bound in clusters of galaxies rather than being evenly spread, measured as the ratio of the energy required to disperse matter over the rest mass energy of the matter concerned (i.e. mass times the speed of light squared energy). Q is low (10e-5) implying a relatively homogeneous universe. However if Q was too low the gravitational force required to form aggregates of stars and galaxies would not be strong enough to overcome repulsive forces of radiation. Conversely if too high then matter would aggregate in forms that would not be able to sustain life - perhaps vast black holes that would emit gamma radiation as they grow larger.D - the number of dimensions, being four - three spatial dimensions and one time dimension. With three spatial dimensions forces of gravity and electro-magnetic forces will follow an inverse square law - as you double the distance the force will drop by a quarter. Mathematically speaking planetary orbits are stable under an inverse square law; a slight change in speed will bring about a correspondingly slight change in orbit. However under an inverse cube (or higher) law orbits would not be stable; if your orbit was slowed down or sped up from an asteroid collision the changes are you would spiral down into the sun or off to outer space. How fascinating."

Also, if one wants to be knowledgeable about this kind of thing, one has to read more than just the stuff that supports one's own ideas.In his attempt to be accessible to the public, the author does what I consider to be a lot of hand-waving and emphatic gestures rather than actually explaining anything. He also fails at what I think is a basic level of imagination: when he says stuff about how a fundamental number, if it had a different value, would preclude the emergence of life, he's assuming that no other kind of life could exist.There is some good basic information about cosmology in here, especially with regard to the fundamental forces, but readers would be better off with one of Stephen Hawking's books (A Brief History of Time or The Universe in a Nutshell) if they're looking to actually learn something."

11,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,4,"This book might be short, but it is full of information that are presented in an easy-to-understand style. Unlike many of popular science books, this one is to the point and there are very few diversions. The main thesis is one of the greatest discoveries in physics that was made in the 1970s and 1980s; it tells us that there are these six numbers, which are extremely fine-tuned and what would happen if any of them is only slightly modified.What makes this book more interesting is the fact that the author is an atheist, yet as a leading astronomer he is telling us about the scientific foundations of the fine-tuning case that is used by theists as evidence for the existence of god. Fine-tunning is according to prominent atheist (and anti-theist) Chritopher Hitchens the only serious argument for existence of God and Jerry Coyne called it the new Natural Theology. It should be noted that the author keeps good relations with the religious; he won The Templeton Prize in 2011 which is given to those that have ""made an exceptional contribution to affirming life's spiritual dimension"". Richard Dawkins called him a ""compliant quisling"" (i.e. a collaborator with the enemy) for accepting that prize.The author takes us through inspirational observations of the universe. How did life emerge and develop? Is there life elsewhere? How big can living things grow to? What are the four powers of nature and how are they fine tuned? What is gravity, neutrino stars and black holes? How did elements and galaxies form? Why are carbon and nitrogen abundant in Earth while gold and uranium rare? What are the nuclear forces and how are they fine tuned? Is the universe expanding? What is the evidence for the Big Bang? What is Dark Matter, Anti-matter and Neutrinos? What is Dark Energy? What is the story of Einstein's cosmological constant? What is time? What is the inflation theory and superstring theory?For fine-tunig, the author offers two options, chance or design. But then he adds that there is a third option which is the multiverse, which the author subscribes to despite calling it speculative and ""a hunch"". The author is optimistic that further advancements in science will strengthen our understanding of the multiverse. After reading Max Tegmarks Our Mathematical Universe, I can say that I'm half way convinced about the multiverse.A recurring point in many popular science physics book that I'm repeatedly seeing and is included in this book is the fact that since the universe is flat its total energy is zero. And since gravity is a negative energy, the total cost to create the universe is zero. This is tackled in more detail in Laurence Kruass's A Universe from Nothing.The book was published in 1999 and so some of the information in it is slightly outdated. This shows how science has progressed in the last 17 years. For example he says that the age of the universe is between 12 and 13 billion years and that we don't know the deceleration and acceleration of its expansion since its creation. We now know that the universe is 13.72 billion years old and that its expansion was decelerating in the first 7 billion years before changing to accelerating due to the increasing power of Dark Energy.So in overall in an amazing book that is thought provoking about one of the deepest questions. It might feel a bit dry for those not used to reading science books, but the journey is well worth it."

16,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23645420-alfaniel-aldavan,5,"Six numbers: if any was altered in a very small degree, the universe would not have permitted life to develop.For example, if gravity wasn't exactly this weak comparing to other forces in the atom, but not weaker, the universe either would have collapsed right after Big Bang, or would have expanded so fast that no stars, galaxies, planetary systems could've formed.Thus, no potential for life.Writing and readabilityRees makes his case of fine tuning with regard to life very convincing. The book is written for the lay reader, and it's decidedly a must-read for anyone interested in cosmology, astronomy, physics. It's rare that I find books for popularizing science that don't have the faults of being clumsy written or assuming a much higher level of knowledge that they're advertised for. To bring science down to earth is no easy enterprise, and Rees, reputable cosmologist, succeeds amazingly.The book makes many comparisons of the numbers and ratios it speaks of, with every day examples, or it creates elocvently frame by frame images, to convey just how precise (small or big) the numbers are. This is done so well that it leaves you feeling you now really - really - know more, understand the universe better, and estimate the extreme unlikeliness of our universe to turn out just right for life.The writing style does wonders to convey to the reader a powerful case for the fine tuning of each number.CritiqueHowever, the thesis doesn't stand up to basic philosophical/logical objections.Rees compares what would happen if each number varies, assuming everything else is equal. One at a time. And concludes from it, that they're extremely fine-tuned. However, what would happen if you vary two numbers at a time? How about three? How about varying relations between one of these numbers and the other elements, which Rees combines with it (according to laws of physics of our universe) to yield his results of dead universes?Varying one at a time is not a throughout investigation. I can't conclude from it *anything*.Example. Let us say we have six integer numbers, and their sum is 1000. Let us say that a ""life-permitting sum"" is in the range 999 and 1001.If I vary one of the numbers, with 1 (plus or minus 1), I still get about 1000. If I vary that number with 2 (plus or minus 2), I no longer get my goal sum. If I vary it more, the sum will never be in the goal range. I had only two permitted variations.But, if I vary 2 numbers at a time, I can obviously ""succeed"" with significantly more variations. If I vary 3 numbers at a time, ever more.If I also accept that the ""law"" can be changed (the function may be a sum, or a product, or an exponential function, etc), I can have way more winning combinations.I may have more failures than successes, true, but I have a bigger pool of wins, meaning the numbers themselves are not ""just about right"".Rees' fine-tuning thesis assumes varying one number at a time, which is only a slice of the research to get a whole range of (potentially) life-permitting universes. After it limits itself this way, it asks for an explanation for such an improbable event of each number being exactly right.I'll say it's not a defensible position, from a logical-philosophical perspective.Rees' possible answers to his question are the multiverse theory and the creationist hypothesis, with a nod in the direction of a possible unified theory that will eventually explain why these numbers had to be as they are. Since I don't think the question was entirely correct to begin with, I don't feel compelled to jump to his conclusions yet.Critique of the critiqueWhen I read the book, I was left with the question: is fine-tuning, in the current mainstream physics and cosmology, assuming variation of one number at a time, and drawing conclusions from only it?I don't know, I'm no physicist, and while I feel I learned from this book (and it's Cosmology 101!), I will say that the reasoning itself at the basis of the argument is flawed. However, it seems I received my answer, from another direction.This week, in the discussion on Manny's review of The Fallacy of Fine-Tuning, he quotes another cosmologist, Barnes, a supporter of fine-tuning theories. With this occasion (with this occasion I read Rees' book as well), I read more of Barnes' blog and articles, and I came upon this:http://letterstonature.wordpress.com/...This gives me my answer, in no uncertain terms:There is an objection to fine-tuning that goes like this: all the fine-tuning cases involve varying one variable only, keeping all other variables fixed at their value in our universe, and then calculating the life-permitting range on that one variable. But, if you let more than one variable vary at a time, there turns out to be a range of life-permitting universes. So the universe is not fine-tuned for life.This is a myth. The claim quoted by our questioner is totally wrong. The vast majority of fine-tuning/anthropic papers, from the very earliest papers in the 70′s until today, vary many parameters.Also, further down the page, Barnes refers to this book:This myth may have started because, when fine-tuning is presented to lay audiences, it is often illustrated using one-parameter limits. Martin Rees, for example, does this in his excellent book “Just Six Numbers“. Rees knows that the limits involve more than one parameter – he derived many of those limits. But equation (1) above would be far too intimidating in a popular level book.Indeed, I got my answer, spot on! The equation noted is above my (undergrad and forgotten) math level. However, the question I had while I was reading Rees' book had to do with internal logic of his thesis.The road aheadWhich raises another question: what is then, the actual thesis/question of fine-tuning literature today?According to Barnes, the only constraint in varying parameters to get possible universes, is for these universes to be logically possible. (non-contradictory)That's a bold claim, if I ever saw one. And I mean bold. Particularly surprising when Barnes explicitly states that an universe is defined by (initial conditions, constants, laws of physics), and, according to him, *all three* are fair game, for the variance experiment, including laws of physics. I should add though, the claim strikes me as methodologically correct, because what else is there to assume about the possible universes? We can't necessarily assume they obey the physical laws that may have been set from the initial conditions (which we vary!) of our Big Bang for our universe. But the magnitude of the task, even if there are mathematical tools to make it more reasonable, leaves me in a combination of awe and disbelief.Once she chose their universe(s) to examine, the fine-tuning-interested cosmologist then solves the equations for those possible universes. If the universe is not self-consistent, then it's trashed. Then estimate the probability for the universe under examination (actually class of universes) to be life-permitting.The purpose: estimate the probability of life-permitting universes in the set of possible universes.This is my current understanding of Barnes' paper and blog, and with them, a certain direction on fine-tuning today. I'd have more to say about those logically possible only universes (!), but I guess I'd better wrap up this review and read more.ConclusionRees doesn't claim for his book to have another purpose than it does: to make general readership understand better a slice of one of the problems of cosmology today. He succeeds very well, perhaps too well. Apparently, we, lay readers, might get easily from it a too limited but powerful impression about the sides of the controversy of fine-tuning. :)Luckily, the same is not the case on physics and cosmology. Controversies aside, I think this 101 in cosmology is one of the best written books popularizing science. Very recommended, and easy to read.

But this book is still useful in explaining, in clear and simple terms, why exactly people say the universe has been “fine-tuned”. It’s not the most in-depth treatment out there, but I think it’d be very good for getting to grips with the basics.In summary: there are several numbers underlying the universe which are constant, and they are very precisely definable down to multiple decimal places… and if you change them in any way, you make our existence as we know it impossible. There are problems with this, of course; life doesn’t have to look exactly like us to be viable, and of course we’re in a world that is perfectly tuned for us to exist. That doesn’t, in and of itself, prove anything. I know people often use it to support the idea of multiple universes, all varying slightly — but something can be made just once and be utterly unique and turn out to be perfect for something, even if you don’t make multiples.This is, honestly, why I find physics so frightening. It’s all so terribly unlikely, and we don’t understand it, and against all this it becomes very apparent, to my mind, how small and alone and temporary each human being is.It’s also fascinating, even for those who prefer biology as a science, like one you could probably name…Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."

19,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,3,"As its title suggests, this 1999 book by Martin Rees, the UK's Astronomer Royal, addresses six numbers that determine whether a universe can support life as we know it. The first number Rees calls N, which is the ratio of the gravitational force to the electromagnetic force and is about 10^36. He explains how, if this ratio were less, and therefore gravity was relatively stronger, stars would be much smaller and would burn much quicker. There would not be sufficient time for life to evolve.The second number, epsilon (ε), dictates the strength of the strong nuclear force. Rees refers to ε being equal to 0.007 and this denotes the proportion of energy that is released when hydrogen fuses into helium. If this force was weaker than it is (say, 0.006), then nuclear fusion wouldn't happen; we would have stars full of hydrogen but there would be no nuclear reactions. Conversely, a stronger force (say, 0.008) would have led to protons joining with other protons shortly after the Big Bang so that there would be no hydrogen left to fuel the stars. Either way, life as we know it would not have been possible.The third number is omega (Ω), which Rees defines as the ratio of the actual density of the universe to the critical density needed for gravity to bring cosmic expansion to a halt. If the ratio were too high, the universe would collapse in a big crunch; too low and expansion would be too fast to allow matter time to condense into stars and galaxies. Discussion of Ω led into a discourse on dark matter, which accounts for about 90% of the universe but which could be made up of entities with masses ranged from 10^–33 g (neutrinos) up to 10^39 g (heavy black holes), an uncertainty of more than seventy powers of ten. As Rees points out, our ignorance on this subject is somewhat embarrassing.Lambda (λ) is the fourth number, which concerns whether the expansion of the universe is increasing or decreasing. In fact, λ is almost, but not exactly, zero; it is a measure of dark energy although this phrase is not used by Rees. λ was first postulated by Einstein in his General Theory of Relativity as a form of anti-gravity to achieve a static universe but he later gave up this idea when it was shown by Hubble that the universe was actually expanding. Einstein later referred to his abandonment of this concept as his ""greatest blunder"".Q is the fifth number and this refers to the amplitude of the irregularities in the density of the universe shortly after the Big Bang. If the universe had been completely homogenous then there would have been no areas where gravity was slightly greater than other areas, such areas seeding the formation of stars and galaxies. Q has a value of about 10^-5 which reflects the fact that gravity within galaxies is exceedingly weak. This value is crucial; were it much smaller, or much bigger, the texture of the universe would be quite different, and less conducive to the emergence of life forms. A much smaller value of Q would stop galaxies forming, whilst if much larger it would result in super large galaxies but with black holes rather than stars.The last of the six numbers Rees calls D which is the number of spatial dimensions. In our universe D is equal to 3 and Rees argues that if D were not equal to 3 then life would not exist.I can't say that I really enjoyed this book and, as a consequence, it took me a long time to finish it. Undoubtedly, Rees is an expert in his field but the excitement that he must feel for his subject didn't come across to me. His account didn't grip me and it seemed to me to be rather disjointed. For example, whilst the book is concerned with six numbers, it has eleven chapters, with three of the extra five being interspersed with the six on the numbers; I found these interruptions disrupted the flow of the book. Notwithstanding these criticisms, some parts of the book were thought provoking and prompt me to read more accounts on cosmology. Essentially, it is a book about the Anthropic Principle although this is another term that the author never uses. Aside from the discussions on the six numbers, there were some interesting observations in places. For instance, I was surprised to read that it was as early as the late 14th century that it was postulated that planetary systems were probably commonplace around other stars and that some of these planets would undoubtedly hold intelligent life. This concept was the brain child of the far-sighted Giordano Bruno but, needless to say, his views were considered heretical by the Church and for this and other ""crimes"" he was burnt at the stake in 1600. It was also fascinating to learn that at the time Rees wrote his book there had only been one instance where the precursor star of a super nova was known. This was in 1987 and before it exploded the star in question had been a blue one of about twenty solar masses."
20,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2221534-brie,2,"Meh. That about sums up my feelings on this book.When I finally got my hands on this book I was so excited. I expected to be blown away by the 6 numbers and the perfection to which they were tuned to allow life to emerge in our universe. Instead I was bored at times, and definitely not blown away. There is a show on the History channel called 'The Universe', which at times is over the top, but in this case they have done a better job of getting the point across then Rees has. This book is basically the same as Rees' book Our Cosmic Habitat, just presented slightly differently. I wasn't all that impressed with that book either, so perhaps I am just not a Rees fan.Anyway, on to the facts. Here is an excerpt from the first chapter explaining the 6 numbers and their meanings:1. N=1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. It measures the strength of the electrical forces that hold atoms together, divided by the force of gravity between them. If N had a few less zeros, only a short-lived miniature universe could exist, thus not allowing enough time for evolution.2. Є=0.007. It defines how atomic nuclei bind together and how atoms are made. Its value controls the power from the Sun and, more sensitively, how stars transmute hydrogen into all the atoms of the periodic table. If Є were 0.006 or 0.008, we could not exist.3. Ω (omega) is the amount of material in our universe – galaxies, gas, and ‘dark matter’. If this were too high relative to a particular ‘critical’ value, the universe would have collapsed long ago; had it been too low, no galaxies of stars would have formed. 4. λ (lambda) controls the expansion of our universe, even though it has no discernible effect on scales less than a billion light-years. Fortunately for us λ is very small. Otherwise its effect would have stopped galaxies and stars from forming, and cosmic evolution would have been stifled before it could even begin.5. The fabric of our universe depends on one number, Q, which represents the ratio of two fundamental energies and is about 1/100,000 in value. If Q were smaller, the universe would be inert and structureless; if Q were larger, it would be a violent place, where no stars or solar systems could survive, dominated by vast black holes.6. The number of spatial dimensions in our world, D, equals three. Life couldn’t exist if D were two or four. Time is a fourth dimension, but distinctly different from the others in that it has a built-in arrow: we ‘move’ only towards the future.Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend this book. There was just no excitement or spark, and I really couldn't wait to be finished with it."
21,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4873736-keith,3,"If any of six numbers were slightly altered, the universe as we know it – including ourselves – would not exist. Small changes to any one of six numbers – the strength of electrical forces, the amount of matter in the universe, antigravity, etc – and everything would be different. So how did the universe become so finely tuned to support our existence and the existence of the stars? Was it Providence? A cosmic coincidence? Neither, says Martin Rees. He postulates that our universe is one of many in a multiverse – a universe of universes, some dark and dead, others fiery and combustible. Among these many universes, ours just happened to have all six of these numbers tuned to the “right” settings, creating our universe – and us. The idea of a mulitverse is growing in popularity. It was a key component of the book From Eternity to Here which I read earlier this year. For a book written in 1999, Just Six Numbers was ahead of its time. Of course, the idea of a multiverse is sobering. In our universe, we are less than a speck of dust in a space that is vast beyond our comprehension, so enormous we are swallowed up in scales of space and time we cannot understand, and rendered completely insignificant. Now, we have astronomers speculating that our universe, as vast as it is, is just one of many – and possibly just a speck of dust in an even larger universe. Just Six Numbers is a good, concise overview of astronomy, and though it is over ten years old, the book does not seem dated (at least from my amateur perception). It was interesting but not compelling."
22,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3320405-raj,4,"Subtitled The Deep Forces that Shape the Universe, this pop science book, written by the astronomer royal, discusses six cosmological constants that define the size, shape and structure of the universe.An interesting book, but one that didn't really teach me that much that I didn't already know. The most interesting thing was the stress on how if any of these numbers were very slightly different, they would have resulted in a universe that would be unsuitable for life. Rees deliberately avoids the question of why this 'fine tuning' exists until the final chapter and even then, he remains fairly neutral on the matter just outlining the possibilities, including that of a creator."
23,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4650824-mohammed-algarawi,5,A very good summary of pretty much everything about what happened after the Big Bang. I recommend reading this along with Neil deGrasse Tyson's Origins.
24,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/150648-tiffany,2,"Reading _Just Six Numbers_ from the library, about numbers that explain the universe/represent forces in the universe, and a previous reader seems to have a problem with evolution: everything to do with the Big Bang, changes to the universe, etc. is scratched out or has snarky comments or scare quotes written around it. For example, the sentence ""We know that there are planets orbiting other stars..."" has scare quotes around ""know."" Ditto to chemistry terms.At first it was funny, but now it's really taking away my enjoyment of the book.-----------------------------I had to give up on this book. It's not BAD, it's just repetitive and there are too many other books to be spending all of my time on this one. I feel like the entire book was summed up in the intro, and it hasn't been worth reading the following chapters. I feel like all of the big points Rees was going to make, I've heard elsewhere, and while some of them are interesting (in a certain ratio of numbers, if one were just a tiny bit different, the universe would expand too far/the planet would implode/the planet would explode/etc.), I've heard them elsewhere -- and usually done better -- so this is just rehashing other things I've heard. Plus, there are times when he implies (outright states?) that life is only possible because a certain number or ratio is the measure that it is. It's like people who say that there can't be life on other planets if there isn't water: Well, no. *Our* type of life may not be possible if there isn't water, or if the number or ratio of numbers is different, but why can't there be a different type of life that doesn't need *our* water or *our* ratios? So as much as I hate to do it -- it's a science book, it's a math book, it's a smartypants book, so I should enjoy it! -- I'm passing on this one. "
25,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36069918-ramon-van-dam,3,"Via a number of chapters revolving around specific properties of our universe, Martin Rees works up to his last chapter where he invokes his favourite theory of the multiverse. One can clearly see where he is going at several occasions, making it a bit disappointing for me to see that he never really goes deep into these subjects.Each of the numbers mentioned in the title are discussed by just scratching the surface, leaving the reader to simply assume that what he or she sees on the page is apparently correct. Several other popular books that cover these topics go more in-depth without having to describe page-long equations, which is more to my liking.This makes this a difficult book to rate. My personal rating is 3 stars: I enjoyed it, but have definitely read other works that are better suited to my tastes because they cover more ground. That is highly subjective though, and I can easily see others giving this 4 or even 5 stars. I don't think that anybody interested in the subject will really dislike it, so my 3 stars are the minimum. At the very least this is a good introduction to a fascinating field, maybe even the most important one of all."
26,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75627418-ryan-smith,5,"The contents of this book fascinated me. It was not a leisurely read, and took a dedicated concentration to grasp the concepts spanning the quantum and cosmic worlds. I enjoyed Rees’s speculative take on the theory of a multiverse, and the only disappointment is that the nearly 20 years since the book’s publication have failed to produce discoveries or theories that would merit edits and a reprint (such as an understanding of quantum gravity, or a grand unified theory)."
27,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53373701-shoti,4,"Rees explains the miracle of six universal parameters (the force of gravity, the strength of atomic nuclei bound, the strength of cosmic antigravity, etc.) being set just at the right level so that our universe could form and life could emerge therein. If we wanted to start to tinker with any of these parameters, we would quickly arrive at an alternative universe which, unlike ours, does not have the required chemistry, cannot support formation of galaxies, stars and planets - in short, could not have induced emergence of life. Now, if we assume that there is only one universe, the one we are living in, then the statistical chances of having all these numbers rightly calibrated by chance is tiny. In fact, adjectives like ‘tiny’ or ‘infinitesimal’ cannot even truly describe the extremely low statistical probability of getting to this set of parameters randomly. In If the Universe Is Teeming with Aliens ... Where Is Everybody?: Fifty Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life, Stephen Webb gives an impressive and vivid explanation of the statistical unlikelihood (impossibility) of this lucky calibration ever happening randomly. So, how can it then be that our universe exists as it is, including Earth and life on Earth. One explanation might be the existence of God or any equivalent super-creator who did this fine-tuning for us on purpose. Alternatively, one may defer to the notion of multiverse which is being taken increasingly seriously by physicists. Under this notion, our universe is not the only one but there must be a huge number of alternative / parallel universes out there, most of them are completely sterile and unfriendly spaces. There are lots of speculation about the formation of such alternative universes, e.g. in the middle of black holes, but science still has a long way to go to get some hard facts about them, if that is possible at all. Nevertheless, as per the notion of multiverse, each of the universes would have different values for the various fundamental parameters and we are living in our current universe, being only one out of a vast number of universes, where these parameters were set in a way that life could emerge."
28,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13369978-jana-light,4,"In _Just Six Numbers_, Martin Rees examines six numbers describing our universe, six numbers that are unique in that they cannot be derived from any theory. He uses those numbers to show both that our universe seems to be ""finely-tuned"" for diversity and life, and that we can use the fine-tuning aspect to think about why or how the universe as we know it began and is situated in the whole of reality.I vascillated between 3 and 4 stars for this book. It is a fantastic look into some of the forces and numbers shaping our universe, and his chapters explaining the context for the numbers are great refreshers or new explanations of the way the universe works. However, sometimes Rees's explanations were a little murky, and sometimes I even wasn't quite sure what the numbers he was talking about meant. He would explain one number in different and seemingly divergent ways. Of course, this is in large part due to me being a layperson in the field of physics, but coming off of reading two books by Hawking, I was disappointed by Rees's explanatory style. Speaking of Hawking, though, _Just Six Numbers_ is a great book to read as a complement to other popular books about the universe. Rees does have moments where he clearly explains phenomena and the passages I understood helped me put some pieces together of concepts that I haven't previously been able to grasp. In addition, I really liked Rees's view on cosmology and philosophy, and how cosmologists tend to try to ""take over"" the field of philosophy when some questions of philosophy are not answerable in scientific terms (such as the questions ""Why is there something rather than Nothing?""). He has a clearer separation of the two fields than I have seen in other popular science books, and that is important to me. At the end while he does suggest how the fine-tuning could be a reason to adhere to the theory that our universe is one in an infinite series of birthing universes (the multiverse theory), he is nonetheless clear that it is a theory that cannot be tested nor proven and should be understood as such. This is a very good book on cosmology. I am curious as to how well it holds up 16 years after publication, with whatever subsequent discoveries and conclusions the field of physics has made."
29,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,4,"This is a very cute little book discussing a lot of facts about the universe as well as ways of relating them to make you wonder about why's and what-if's. Here is one example (there are so many). Gravity is a very weak force. How weak? The gravitational attraction between protons is 36 orders of magnitude weaker than the electrical forces. That's how it is and nobody knows why the ratio is exactly that. But if you start to put together a ball, the volume of the ball (and hence roughly the amount of matter) grows at the cubic of radius while gravitation falls off at the square of distance. So eventually, a large enough ball as in celestial bodies demonstrate significant gravity. And it is this gravity that make stars go through fusion. So what if the force of gravity is a few orders of magnitude stronger than it is now. Then it takes a lot less to make a star. Consequently, a typical star will last a lot shorter. Then there is probably not enough time for evolution to give rise to, say, human beings. So the question is why the universe appears ""fine-tuned"" in these physical parameters.This line of thinking quickly gives rise to claims that this proves the existence of God as a designer/creator of the universe. (Never mind loads of arguments keep pointing out God would not be a good scientific hypothesis to explain *anything*.) The more interesting conjecture (that the author is leaning on) is that multiverse might be a reality. Maybe many different universes (multiverse) have been formed, some with physical parameters hostile for life. We just happen to be in a welcoming one. There is no immediate way of testing any of that. But if it's true, it really shouldn't be a surprise, should it? Just like in the movie Matrix, Neo was told that he is not really the first one. "
30,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019021-dolly,3,"This is a very readable, but still fairly complicated look at our universe and the six different factors that allow it to be a hospitable place in which we may live. I enjoyed reading the book, but I must admit that much of the science went waaaaay over my head. In fact, I was very glad that the book was so short or else I might've been too intimidated to read it. interesting quotes: ""If one had to summarize, in just one sentence, 'What's been happening since the Big Bang?', the best answer might be to take a deep breath and say: 'Ever since the beginning, gravity has been moulding cosmic structures and enhancing temperature contrasts, a prerequisite for the emergence of the complexity that lies around us ten billion years later, and of which we are part.'"" (p. 113)""In the somewhat harsh view of his most distinguished biographer, the physicist Abraham Pais, Einstein 'might as well have gone fishing' for the last thirty years of his life.""

And even they may be wiser to respond, with Ludwig Wittgenstein, that 'whereof one cannot speak, one must be silent.'"" (p. 131)"
31,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10449878-naomi,3,"The book centres around six crucial numbers, without which our universe would not exist.I found this book intriguing and it really made me aware of how extraordinary out planet is; the author reiterated the importance of these six vital numbers by pointing out that if the numbers were slightly higher or lower than their current value, then the universe as we know it would be completely different. It emphasised how special life is and how wonderful the universe is with all its diversity. Rees explained many physical phenomena well, but at times I found it somewhat confusing and difficult to follow. One major criticism is that the book reiterated obvious facts, such as how our universe began, which was explained at the beginning of the book. Also, I felt that at times it was a bit repetitive and that I was not learning anything new, but at other times within the book, I felt the explanation was rushed and unclear.Overall, I quite liked this book, and I would definitely read it again to enhance my understanding. This book highlighted and promoted the fantasically special place that is our universe."

I think a combination of the author and the reader (me) led me to give this book only an ""ok"" rating. Rees writes in an easy open style, but occasionally throws in some big words or theories, but doesn't go into explaining them in the depth I'd like to see. Perhaps that's because it would exceed the intended mass audience of his book. But, to be fair, if he went into massive detail, I'd be blown out of the water. I know enough to be dangerous, but not enough to thoroughly understand the physics. I remember, vaguely, reading The First Three Minutes and though that that author was able to easily bridge the gap between a lay reader and an amateur scientist. This book will give you enough to sound impressive on the cocktail circuit, but if you get questioned, this won't be material that will help you fill in the blanks."
33,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5996748-alison,4,"I've only read half of it but I have the basic concepts and will probably not finish it. The ""numbers"" themselves are not that crucial (despite the title) - the main concept is that our universe is shaped by a particular balance between forces- such as the force that holds subatomic particles apart versus the force of gravity. In that a case, a different ratio than the one we experience would result in longer or shorter lives of stars and therefore longer or shorter evolutionary opportunities on the bit of material orbiting the stars. Interesting material for musing on the forces that shape the cosmos. "

Cosmology is generally an enthralling subject to read, if written properly. Unfortunately, this books some what fails in doing that. There are frequent gaps in continuity, repetitions and a boring writing style. The fabled book, A Brief History of Time handled the same subject and presented it in the much reader friendly way. I couldn't help but compare this book with that one while reading. Additionally, the author devotes 90% of the text to discuss 4 numbers, N, omega, epsilon and lambda; the remaining two are given side roles. In fact in the end the reader is left asking himself - what were the remaining two numbers? This book was written in 1999 and since then there have been many new inventions, discoveries and experiments which both contradict and support the book's text. Frequently, sections seems to have no relationship with preceding and successive sections, such that the reader is lost. It gives the impression that it a collections of sections compiled together as chapters. I started this book with a high expectations and I have been considerably disappointed. Yet, the book deserves two stars for covering a wide range of theories, developments and an effort to present them in simple English. I really like the choice of the figures used in the book.

The author holds that the big-bang model of the creation of the universe is now well supported by evidence. There are still a lot of questions to be answered - the principal one of which is why the Universe is fine-tuned to create a solar system and a planet that is capable of supporting life? The author discusses six numbers and shows how any variation in them could have led to a universe incapable of supporting life as we know it.So, how did this fine tuning happen? Was it because of a benign creator who wanted life to evolve? As a scientist the author won't want to go for that answer, but he is honest enough to admit there is no clear-cut answer. One possibility is the multiverse theory - our universe is one of infinitely many. These numbers are different in most of the others. Given, however, the enormous number of universes a few purely by chance happened to have the right combination and ours is one of them.I repeat the caveat I have made in reviewing similar books - I have been a student of physics, and it is difficult for me to know how this book would appeal to one who doesn't have a background in physics and mathematics."

And while the author looked forward to great strides by 2020, in new very expensive scientific instruments and leaps in testing and theory, I'm not sure much has happened. (I could be very wrong, being merely a scientific flaneur.)Cost has been a factor--space-based telescopes are not cheap, nor are particle accelerators. And pardon my ignorance, but physics still seems to be trying to define string theory, the multiverse and other theories that were hot when the book was written. At least gravity waves have been detected.Still, the book was quite valuable, to me, for greater understanding of how the world we inhabit, from the sub-atomic level to the expanding universe, depends on or can be analyzed on the basis of, a few ratios and pure numbers. If any of the 6 numbers were even slightly different we and the elements and the stars might not be here at all."
42,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10346669-eric-sullenberger,4,"This book is not about overview of cosmology, as long as you're willing to consider when it was written. This book is old enough that some of the ideas in it are gated. It is worth noting its value as a historical perspective on the development of science. It's interesting to see what theories were knew what evidence was just beginning to come to light what predictions more correct and what predictions were off or have yet to be verified. The author is certainly very optimistic about the pace of new discoveries which I seem to recall a lot of in the early 2000s even though the actual progress made on some of those theories is significantly less than he would have predicted. Unfortunately for those who are in love with the constants of nature, these constants are some of the more abstract ones. nonetheless taken with a grain of salt that the book is almost 20 years old it's not bad, and I'm glad I was finally able to find a audiobook copy to read after letting my print copy sit on the shelf for way too long."
43,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75310921-kirk-moodey,1,"Unfortunately I find this book very misleading, as it over-states how fine tuned the universe is and most people do not have the education to research that there could be arguments not in the book about this subject. You could easily alter any of the forces by an order of magnitude, especially if you did it /in combination/, say scaling up and down several of the forces at the same time. You could also entirely get rid of the weak force and get a universe incredibly similar to our own, except that it would have stars that operate using deuterium fusion via the strong force. Our own star in a weakless universe would be much smaller than our current star in order to support life, roughly 5% of our size, which goes to show you can actually vary the sizes of things and the forces A LOT and still get life to work!See https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.06081.pdf the original paper if weakless universes interest you."
44,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59397668-madie-boufford,2,"I read this book for my Biology book report, and Just Six Numbers by Martin Rees is all about the forces that shape the Universe. It's also about how scientists are trying to learn more about these forces. The forces have to be very exact or else we wouldn't be alive right now. It also talked a lot about how we wouldn't be alive without atoms. But, I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in Cosmology because that's mainly what the book is about.I thought this book was ok, but I didn't exactly love it because some parts were hard to understand so it got boring pretty quickly. The beginning was pretty interesting though because I could understand it better than I understood most parts of the book. But, that was just my opinion of it, so you might think differently about the book."
45,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114596460-maurice-sylvester,3,"Whilst I enjoyed reading this, its content was certainly above my paygrade of understanding. A quote on the back cover claims 'If you haven't read a single cosmology book, this is a good place to start', and I opened this book with confidence. However I couldn't agree less.I'm by no means an expert on physics, but I have an A-Level in the subject (albeit not a high grade by any means) which would place me marginally more qualified than many to read this book. However I still found myself not understanding a huge amount of what was being discussed, but I should put this down to my lack of knowledge more than anything else.It is a very well written book, of a good length and certainly one I'll return to once i've read 'Cosmology for Dummies' or something similar.Actual rating: 3.3 "
46,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5454069-thequaminator,4,"Main point:. Our universe appears ""tuned"" to a precision that seemingly leads us to some extreme conclusions. Not written by a creationist, the theories will go to any length to try and show natural causes, which is all you have left if you won't acknowledge God. Yet the book is filled with words, phrases, paragraphs such as surprising, precision, tuned, puzzling, mystery, etc.One of the other main points is that the more we have learned about the universe, the more we find that we don't know. It's filled with a lot of good info, scientific measurements, theories, observations, predictions that you did not even realize were going on in our world. While many discoveries are soundly backed up, just as many seem to be based on the presupposition that the beginning was with a big bang, that everything had to come about naturally. It is impossible in this line of thought to come up with any explanation of where matter or the governing laws came from in the first place. The only ""solution"" is an innumerable number of multiverses such that eventually the lottery is ""won"" and a fine tuned universe appears. Personally, this takes more faith and is less probable than a Creator who put all things into their right place at a specific point in time."
47,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68621721-karol-ujueta-rojas,5,"We are extremely lucky to exist in this universe, yet it is not by chance that this universe happens to have the right conditions for our existence. Evidence of this is that we are here, talking about it. For example, we happen to live in a universe with 3 space dimensions and 1 time dimension, were this number different gravity perhaps would not exist, nuclear fusion would perhaps not exist, structure of atoms as we know it would perhaps not exist, elements would be out of the question. There are 5 more numbers like that one that could not have been different than they are now, it is as if these numbers were precisely tuned right before the big bang to allow a universe to be created. Why is that? well, read the book and have fun."
48,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7503634-kat-cavins,3,"This book was certainly an interesting one. Personally, I felt that it got too repetitious at points. You get reminded of the value of certain symbols at a rate of what feels like every other page. It also used some words that even I had to look up. Context clues made some of them easier, but this book was made to be an accessible introduction to astrophysics and parts of it felt condescending. Not purposefully, obviously, but it just gave that vibe.All that being said, I absolutely love books about the impossibility of our existence. I'm a pretty big existentialist and so in its own way, it's a bit calming seeing other people have such similar views. I definitely think it's worth a read if you are into math and/or physics. "
49,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51738672-tatao-burduli,4,"Definitely needs to be read more than once or even twice. At times the author uses the simplest language and comparisons in order to explain the most complicated things, while at other times he complicates the simplest things. Often he mixes the approaches and the structure of the book and arguments and points become blurry. Also, If you don't have a good substantial knowledge of basic chemistry, you're in trouble, just like me. A fascinating read in any case. Good introduction to how complicated and sophisticated the universe is."
50,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41992921-mike-day,4,"The universe is fined tuned. Supremely fined tuned, to the extreme, like 10 to the 29th power. From where we stand, we have two options: either there is a designer, a God, some kind of tuner that tuned this universe, or - there are an infinite number of universes that are incorrectly tuned, they either are too small to allow for life, they collapse upon themselves, or expand too quickly and never develop - something called multiverse theory. Since we cannot see God and we cannot see infinite universes, both atheists and theists are backed against the wall of faith."
51,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63889718-mhamed-limam,4,"This fine-tuning in our universe is really mind boggling . Sir Martin Rees has evoked just 6 numbers ( N , Ɛ , Ω , λ , Q , D ) that are responsible of this finely tuned universe as we see it . I'm sure there are a lot of other constants embedded in the early formation , waiting to be discovered. For me , there are two explanations for this not three : A wise Designer or a Multiverse with an infinite number of universes .... you choose what is more convincing for you and let us wait for Science to unveil the rest of the mystery ... if that is even possible of course ... we may never know ..."
52,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/559251-terry,3,"I appreciated the format, arranging the explanations of the cosmology that was current in 1999 around six crucial numbers. I will keep my brief synopses of each number in my updates, since I will not remember them very long. I will retain the general thrust of Rees' contention about the sensitivity of cosmological evolution to these six values. I will watching for an accessible book that covers the 20 years of cosmological theory after Rees' book. "
53,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11723162-b,5,"Another great science-for-the-general-reader book. It covered a lot of the same material that other books like this cover, but in a slightly different way by focusing on the numbers that are ""fine-tuned"" for our existence. "
54,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76739886-anmar,4,"So easy it's hard.I read this book twice, the vagueness makes it somewhat confusing to follow, adding some mathematics even if in the appendix would have made it a much easier read.Highly recommended though and I am very content to have made the effort."
55,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63063616-josh-volkman,5,"Mind-bender, totally agenda-free, just wonderful and awesome in the old sense of those words. Rees's astrophysicist's numeracy is kept complementary and rarely overwhelming, with a popular audience always in mind. A brilliant scientist tries to share his appreciation for the cosmos."
56,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6356229-fernando-escobar,4,"Great read. I think I understood most of it ;), still great, even if you background in physics is null. I would recommend reading this book before his others. It's one those books you want to read again: mind blowing."
57,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95235457-kate,4,"Pros:- Despite an arbitrary choice of six numbers, those numbers interesting, because they fit in a story- Good coverage for a reader with general knowledgeCons:- Could contain more details, but it isn’t a big problem since the book was intended to be short and readable "
58,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26626055-ayegou-aissam,5,"Rees is a very knowledgable on his field, and what made his book interesting is his modesty. He takes into consideration all the assumptions. His vue of a finetuned universe brings lots of questions that can be summarised into : Is it coincidence, multiverse or providence ? "
59,0465036732,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37606149-panz,4,Its interesting to look back at the state of astronomy in the early 2000s and realize how far we have come (or not). Martin Rees is very much the authority figure in the field and it shows from his writing what the prevailing opinions of his times were.
