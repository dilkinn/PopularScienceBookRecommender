0,0465000924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15306434-howard,5,"Medawar is one of a handful of classics on my science communication book shelf. It is eloquently written and delves into many of the challenges of producing scientific knowledge for the public. Anyone with a science degree from university embarking on a career in research would benefit from Medawar's advice. If you are involved in science and you have not read it, I recommend it. Each time you open it and reread, some new insights are sparked off. Lately it provoked me to ponder the relationship between the old testament scriptures of the bible and utopias of scientific progress that scientists aspire to create. In societies in religious decline, the morality of scientists practicing science needs ethical oversight, to ensure that science is not used politically by members of society for dystopic ends."
1,0465000924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1145513-ashwin,5,"Advice To A Young Scientist is a book by P. B. Medawar for folks keen on entering research. Medawar won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1960 for his research on why immune systems reject organ transplants. Medawar's writing is meticulous and a joy to read. Though the former half of the book deals with practical information for the newbie, the latter turns into a treatise on science and the scientific method. Not bad reading at all."
2,0465000924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30926456-goh-jiayin,5,"""The belief of Comenius that the pursuit of universal learning ""to be acquired and applied to the benefit of all men for the common good"" is truly via lucis, the way of light."" MedawarThis book really gives great encouragement and enlightens his readers on the perks of being a scientist. Honestly, Medawar brings back the interest I have for science where creativity and imagination is one of the few essential things needed. Although it is a little hard to read in terms of the vocabulary used, it really feels as if he is talking and advising to you rather than giving a lecture or just reading."
3,0465000924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6156909-ian,4,"Accessible and down-to-Earth. All the more so when you consider that it is written by a Noble Prize Laureate. As his background is fundamental research, scientific researchers may get more out of this book. Though it is definitely worth the read for any branch of science. Based on a career spanning several decades Peter Medawar amicably shares insights into areas from the choice of research topics and careers, showing respect to older colleagues and collaborators, to the limits of the scientific method. "
4,0465000924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64484002-william-smith,3,"Medawar advocates a young scientist to inspirit the role of scientific meliorism: the world can and should be improved through their insights and skills. Throughout, Medawar bestows the distilled wisdom that research neophytes accept the candid challenge of scientific inquisition with unbreakable enthusiasm, humility instead of egotistical prowess, and embosom the role of opportunity and chance in success as remarked by Fontenelle:  ‘Ces hasards ne sont que pour ceux quijouent bien!’ 	(‘These strokes of good fortune are only for those who play well!’)In short, this work acts as a series of transient transitions between snapshots of the scientific landscape, bureaucracy to the symphony, including Medawar’s estimations of the racial and sexual panorama amongst scientists, the distinctions between public and private perceptions of a research’s life, and, most importantly, the undercurrents of the researcher’s mind. Coy caution of the limits of rationalism is brought to the foreground casting dust on more prominent scientists (Dawkins) who argue of the baleful bemusing being of ‘why’ prompted questions. With such a contrarian idea, this Nobel prize winner attentively arrows admonitions towards those who may claim the supreme omniscience of science to cleanse doubt, particularly insofar as it relates to the meaning of being. In his own words: ‘Young scientists must however never be tempted into mistaking the necessity of reason for the sufficiency of reason. Rationalism falls short of answering the many simple and childlike questions people like to ask: questions about origins and purposes such as are often contemptuously dismissed as nonquestions or pseudoquestions, although people understand them clearly enough and long to have the answers.’  "
5,0465000924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7473056-chelsi,2,"Our lab decided to read this book together during the pandemic. It was informative in the sense that it described in writing much of the ""unwritten rules"" of science (don't go to graduate school where you went to undergrad, never use the word ""prove,"" etc.). There were portions of the book I liked and other times where I thought Medawar went a little off the beaten path into his random opinions. He definitely wrote as if he did not take himself too seriously. In all, for someone who did science in the mid 1900s, he seems like a pretty forward-thinking person and I imagine he was a kind person."
6,0465000924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56212685-lakmus,3,"(A witty collection of mostly useful) advice to a young scientist (that may or may not still be relevant).I don't personally know if many people starting out research careers today have quite the ambitions of young scientists addressed by Medawar, I feel people these days might be a little less naive and arrogant, but I still had a few of my own questions answered. Plus, Medawar's writing is worth reading in and of itself, and the occasional roast and burn are quite on point."
7,0465000924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43005204-satheesh-kumar,5,"Wonderful short read. And by the great Sir Peter Medawar, who is as good a science writer as he is a scientist. You are not alone in your fears of inadequacy starting out as a scientist. It's a learning process, filled with mistakes and embarrassments. That's how scientists get so good at what they do. Loved it that I came across this book at a time when I am starting out as a full-time researcher as well. "
8,0465000924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6164554-nabila,4,"I don't read self-help books, but I guess in a way, this book counts as one. However, the advice in this book isn't the type of advice that's meant to be inspirational but unhelpful. It's very practical (and occasionally funny) and it covers various topics (each in short chapters). I've decided to write down some of the things that I found particularly interesting:- If you try your hand at research and find yourself indifferent to or bored by it, you should leave science without any sense of self-reproach or misdirection.- After you've taken your Ph.D., you must on no account continue with your Ph.D. work for the remainder of your life, easy and tempting though it is to tie up loose ends and wander down attractive byways.- The great incentive to learning a new skill or supporting discipline is an urgent need to use it. The process of ""equipping oneself"" has no predeterminable limits and is bad psychological policy.- The beginner must read, but intently and choosily and not too much. The best way to become proficient in research is to get on with it. Endless poring over the research of others is sometimes psychologically a research substitute, much as reading romantic fiction may be a substitute for real-life romance.- There will always be gaps and shortcomings in your knowledge and to be any good, you'll have to go on learning all your lives.- Equality of treatment of men and women should come from equality of merit, not that which represents an enforced and perhaps reluctant acquiescence in the newly devised statutory obligations that now require employers to treat women as if they were human beings.- Increasing the number of women in science is important because the world is now such a complicated and rapidly changing place that it cannot even be kept going (let alone improved) without using the intelligence and skill of approximately 50 percent of the human race.- Future husband, take note: Anyone who goes to the extreme length of marrying a scientist should be aware beforehand that their spouse is in the grip of a powerful obsession that is likely to take the first place in their life outside the home, and probably inside too.- There is no quicker way for a scientist to bring discredit upon himself and on his profession than roundly to declare that science knows or soon will know the answers to all questions worth asking, and that the questions that do not admit a scientific answer are in some way nonquestions or ""pseudoquestions"" that only simpletons ask and only the gullible profess to be able to answer. A ""scientific"" attack upon religious belief is usually no less faulty than a defense of it.- If in spite of the most anxious precautions a scientist makes a mistake about a matter of fact then the mistake must be admitted with the least possible delay. The scientist may even gain credit from such a declaration and will not lose face--except perhaps in the bathroom mirror.- The intensity of the conviction that a hypothesis is true has no bearing on whether it is true or not.- To be creative, scientists need libraries and laboratories and the company of other scientists. The stereotype that represents ""the scientist"" as someone coldly engaged in the collection of facts and in calculations based upon them is no less a caricature than that which makes a poet poor, dirty, disheveled, tubercular maybe, and periodically in the grip of a poetic frenzy.- One of the most comically endearing traits of a young research worker is the illusion that everyone else is eager to hurry off to do his research before he can. In reality, his colleagues want to do their own research, not his.- Excess of confidence in the rightness of their own views is a sort of senile hubris, as offensive in older scientists as excess of hubris in the young. The old-fashioned remedy for hubris was a smart blow on the head with an inflated pig's bladder.- People with anything to say can usually say it briefly; only a speaker with nothing to say goes on and on as if he were laying down a smoke screen.- In Great Britain, the Institution of Electrical Engineers issues an admirable Speaker's Handbook in which a speaker is recommended to stand with his feet 400 millimeters apart, as ""this stops trembling."" The instruction is amusing not because electrical engineers are especially tremulous but because of its high degree of quantitative refinement--it is as if experiments had shown that feet 350 or 450 millimeters apart could be relied upon to precipitate a bout of convulsions.- Good writing upon a subject is almost always shorter than bad writing on the same subject--and more memorable, too.- Criticism is the most powerful weapon in any methodology of science; it is the scientist's only assurance that he need not persist in error.- Every time the mayor of an American municipality finds against fluoridation or someone in England pronounces it inefficacious or even downright harmful, there is a clamor of rejoicing in the corner of Mount Olympus presided over by Gaptooth, the God of Dental Decay.- In science there is always more beyond. Science will dry up only if scientists lose or fail to exercise the power or incentive to imagine what the truth might be."

14,0465000924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43352445-rodrigo-pereira,5,An exquisite and essential book to demystify a scientist's career. Many great advice that should have followed.
15,0465000924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7453251-rohit-suratekar,2,"In this scientific era, good guidance for the researchers is essential. Author P.B. Medawar recognized this need long back and being researcher by himself, he has compiled few guidelines for the researchers starting their career in this field as title suggests. Author has tried to be as concise as possible. Book touches most of the important aspects like how you will think about research, how to present oneself into world. This book is more about the setting correct philosophy for the young researchers which I think is more important than just a mere tips. On other hand, book language is more complex than other related books. Author fails to attract as well as hold the readers throughout his arguments. Finishing of argument could have been better. Overall good book for the undergrads students. "
16,0465000924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2786320-aditi,3,"If I were to ask a scientist to distill the essential aspects of being a scientist, the result would be this book. Concise yet thorough, this book is written by a cellular immunologist and does a good job highlighting some of personal challenges scientists may face. Though Medawar doesn't dwell much on too many anecdotes, he conveys his point reasonably well. The book is incredibly organized, in ways only a scientist could have, which each aspect neatly classified and aptly acknowledged and discussed.The only problem this books faces is the writing style, which though popular in Britain at the time the book was written, can be confusing. "
17,0465000924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24716402-joe-callingham,2,"I thought I had better read ""Adivce to a Young Scientist"" before I finished my PhD! The text does offer sound advice in some areas, such as writing a manuscript, but is severly dated when it attempts to give advice about how to build a relationship with your PhD supervisor or how to give a talk at a conference. The last few chapters on the scientific method should be required reading for all young scientists, however, I feel that a more modern text on a similar topic will provide actual better advice to a young scientist."
18,0465000924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57473547-katie,4,"It is a little dated, but it's easy to see why it's a classic. This book is inspiring (as one might expect from such a distinguished scientist) but it lacks any trace of ego and is purposely written to be accessible (I'm looking at you, Richard Feynman). I also love that he is encouraging to those who are minorities in STEM. "

Advice have little use but these are at least entertaining. Not to mention that listen to such practical mind is always refreshing.
