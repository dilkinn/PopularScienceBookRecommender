Sorry.It's obvious that the field of science and its new findings are replacing the previously interpreted roles of our former gods.""Non-overlapping""Yeah, right."

I would really rate this book 2.5 stars or even 3 on a good day (which after a second thought is what today seems to be, hence the change from 2 to 3 stars). It was an interesting read especially when you consider the low expectations I had when I started reading it. In atheistic circles, this book is nearly seen as a betrayal of everything good and beautiful about science and I assure you it is nothing as such, at least not how it is often described to be. I would however, really criticize Gould for not being so consistent throughout his analysis. Like for example, he seriously thinks that Thomas shouldn't have questioned about Jesus being resurrected. I mean, really? Is there a real scientist (let alone someone like Gould who is clearly passionate and caring about science) who cannot applaud Thomas for his disinterest? Anyway, one gets the feeling that Gould has changed his mind a little between the beginning and end of writing the book, especially when he finishes by showing his derision of those who really think the Big Bang is consistent with Genesis or the notorious Templeton foundation that year after year violates his much beloved NOMA by awarding bigger-than-the-nobel-prize sums to scientists who show that science and religion are actually two things of explaining the same thing, whatever that is supposed to mean.To come to NOMA, it is really not as bad as it is pictured to be. It is, in fact, a much more limiting factor for religion than science. Like the idea that if Science finds a fact about nature which contradicts religion, then religion must be wrong and science right. How can you disagree with such a thing? It is also an important limitation on science, which guarantees that scientific discoveries will conform more to the basic principles of science.However, there are signs of the usual cowardice when he tries to define what religion actually is. He seems (like many of those who like to be nice to religious folks) to see all religions as more or less the same phenomenon which is something I really disagree with. We really need to acknowledged that some religions are more harmful than the others. Also, he views religion as something as broad as to include the whole of morality in it. So basically when a scientist tries to talk about morality, he is actually violating NOMA which is something I am not so sure about. Anyway, much more interesting were the bits about how those opposed to religion have their own myths when it comes to the Dark Ages or Galileo and the like. The stories which are often told about the clergy believing that the earth was flat or of Galileo being more or less a martyr in the ""holy"" war between science and religion, are questioned and sometimes exposed to be frauds, just like many religious traditions are filled with them. So one can't help but feel the irony here, of all the places. One last idea to end my rambling with, which is about agnosticism. Agnostics really think that they are more honest intellectually and not as ""fundamentalist"" as atheists or religious people are, but I'm afraid their case cannot be sustained. When Gould (who is an agnostic) talks about how Darwin's idea of Evolution by Natural Selection cannot refute God's existence, I cannot avoid disagreeing with that. For one thing, God's existence (at least before the near relativism of the 20th century religions) was a response to the fascination of humans with nature (including stars, planets, fear, dreams...etc. etc.), so when science explains it, it is really cowardly to say that it doesn't mean anything about God's existence. It makes it, at least, less likely for a God to exist and which is why I consider agnosticism a lame and not more than a politically correct idea and skeptical atheism a much more sustainable position.

2,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29791454-domhnall,5,"This book sets out a case for the notion of ""non overlapping magisteria"" or NOMA, to insist that religion should stay out of science, science stay out of religion, but both engage in constructive interactions. There is no reason not to give full respect to both, each in their proper domain or ""magisterium."" He emphasises the folly of religion getting trapped into making factual claims that can be disproved by science. He also makes an interesting case that scientists get into trouble when they think they are competent to make claims about matters in the domain of religion. NOMA is not an easy option, he argues, but a discipline which both religious and scientific thinkers would do well to observe. In support of this proposition, Gould supplies some interesting observations about the history of conflicts between science and religion. These remarks have the reasonable effect of challenging not only some of the stories used to disparage religion, but also some of the claims made by scientists and some of the political claims made in the name of science. I always enjoy revisionist history and the puncturing of well established myths. For example, he argues that Christians and the Catholic Church have never insisted that the world is flat. His most interesting material (presumably because it is close to home) concerns the Creationist controversies in the USA. He gives helpful detail about the American court actions over teaching evolution and creationism in state schools. He stoutly defends Charles Darwin against uninformed and unfounded attacks. He helpfully clarifies the specific errors made by Creationists. However, he also performs a useful service by clarifying the thinking that motivated much of the hostility to teaching evolution in state schools early in the 20th Century, pointing out quite firmly some of the intolerable assertions included in American texts about race and heredity based on a perverse misreading of Darwin. Early 20th Century America was a deeply racist nation, strongly committed also to ideas of eugenics, and the ""science"" textbooks in question were poisoned by racist ideology; it was by no means illiberal to protest, even if the specific arguments used proved erroneous. This is not a defence of creationism (quite the opposite - it attacks it) but it is a defence of the people involved and their motives at the time. The teaching of ""evolution"" was open to serious moral objections unless its presentation was radically changed. [It would have helped had Gould pointed out the huge influence of Herbert Spencer's writing about evolution, which were very much at odds with Darwin's thinking despite the label of ""Social Darwinism"" which Wiki describes as ""a politically motivated metaphysic very different in both form and motivation from Darwinist science""; frequently, the ideas attacked by Americans when debating evolution are Spencer's and not Darwin's. The distinction is of major importance.]Gould writes very well and has a big audience. What he has to say is interesting and thought provoking but I would suggest this book fails for the reason so much writing by scientists about religion fails, and that is the lack of philosophical training and the belief that common sense is an adequate substitute. Gould is a scientist breaking his own rule by trying to enter debate outside the ""magisterium"" of science without sufficient preparation. If we are to debate the conflict of science and religion then we need some clarity about our definitions. He defines religion as follows: ""I will .. construe as fundamentally religious (literally binding us together) all moral discourse on principles that might activate the ideal of universal fellowship among people."" (p62). Conversely, he argues that fundamentalists, and notably Creationists in the USA, are not motivated by religion but engaged in politics and should be confronted politically without that affecting our view of religion itself. This is a concept of religion that may appeal to many people but it is not a valid account of what religion is. In general terms, he argues that all concern with ethics, the meaning of life, our purpose and motivation for living, belongs to the realm of religion primarily on the grounds that humans have historically always embraced such topics within a religious framework. I certainly agree that we must respect the history of ideas for what it is and not discard or disparage the thinking of our predecessors because they were primarily religious. Nor should we allow religious differences, including atheism, to permit a slide into advocating hatred and hostility on the grounds of religious belief. There is much for an atheist to admire and respect in most religions and in any case, it will be a cold day in hell before religion vanishes from our social world. So hostility to religion is not helpful. My problem is that, historically, humans have overwhelmingly considered matters of science in religious terms too, so this is not a coherent basis to separate what Gould calls religion and what Gould calls science. Probably everything has at some time been considered ""religious"". Science, on the other hand, he seems to regard as the realm of ""facts"" or facticity, the state of affairs, the way things really are. Matters of fact must be determined through the methods of science and disputes adjudicated on scientific criteria. It is not acceptable that religion is used to evade the factual evidence of science. When this does happen, the use of religious argument is typically spurious and conceals a political agenda unrelated to religion. Conversely, it is not possible to make moral or ethical or existential claims based on the facts exposed by science. This is of course the age old gap between what is and what ought to be. However, it is also a false dichotomy. In order to divide the universe of ideas into two camps, religion and science, arbitrary and unconvincing definitions have to be accepted. I do not accept the Positivist notion that science is restricted to making factual statements about the natural world and at a minimum I want recognition of the methods and findings of the social sciences. But however science is defined (and Gould does not define it as far as I can see) that does not entitle religion to claim the residue of rational (or even just human) thought, since there are so many other categories that can be deployed, including philosophy, politics and the humanities. I just cannot go along with the idea that ethics or aesthetics are religious and, for example, can cite Bishop Holloway arguing for ""Godless Morality: Keeping Religion Out of Ethics"", or Viktor Frankl's ""Man's Search for Meaning"" as a serious and effective discussion that does not require an appeal to religion; neither book is anti religion. I am happy to conclude that Gould has written an interesting book and provided some very constructive historical information that may correct a number of myths. I disagree with his main argument for many reasons but that is not a reason to ignore the contribution this book still does make to the wider debate. We need to hear from scientists and Gould writes better than most; we just don't have to suspend our critical faculties when they speak. "
3,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,1,"The book's theme is Science and Religion have non overlapping domains, Science can't give ethical and moral truths and that religion should be respected when it stays within it's own domain. I'm glad this book is not influential today. When it was written (in 1998 according to the book itself) marriage equality was completely being shot down by the imprimatur of religion. Science actually refuted each of the arguments used by religion (""it's not natural"", ""people aren't born that way"", ""it's Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve who were in the Garden of Eden"", and other statements which Religions defined as moral truths), and Science showed their statements to be false thus changing the dialog. Science didn't need to go into the ethical or moral sphere directly, but rather provided arguments to refute statements based on authority only. This book would have allowed the science but seems like it would have suggested it remain silent instead of challenging the religious dogma which was based on authority alone. Another example, a current senator from Oklahoma has written a book on how climate change is impossible because his revealed religion tells him so based on his moral beliefs and his interpretation of his bible. That argument by itself deserves no respect. The science is speaking loud and clear and global warming is real and is man made. Once again, on strict reading of Gould's book he would have allowed the science to proceed, but he would have required respect in challenging the assertions. I would suggest the arguments put forth in that book should be attacked and shown no respect whatsoever. He did say a couple things in the book that highlight its anachronistic nature. He says, what happened before the big bang is best left to religion since nobody can say what happened before. The overwhelming majority of today's physicist ignore that statement and give reasonable theories and speculate what happened before the big bang. Also, he thinks ID (intelligence design) is not significant (as he was writing in 1998). It is very relevant today. We even had a president since that time who thought Russia was Gog (or Magog) and is part of the 'end times' as prophesied in Daniel and Revelations. Morality and ethics are complex. Reason, rational thought, experience and our empathy and concepts of reciprocity are good starting points. People who pretend to know things they don't know and thus have no doubt do not make for good starting points and are best ignored if possible, but unfortunately anti-Marriage Equality, Climate Denialism, Intelligence Design, and other such items have real world consequences and must be considered for what they are: absurd positions not worthy of respect.Overall, the book is silly and is best ignored."

5,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1016626-tim-pendry,3,"This is not one of Stephen Jay Gould's best books and should be seen as a polemic about the relationship between science and religion peculiar to its time and place - the struggle against creationism in the US in the last years of the last century.To most Europeans, the core proposition is self-evident - science is a description of the world, 'religion' is the ascription by humans of value or meaning to the world. The two exist in separate spheres of understanding, each is an independent 'magisterium'.From this point of view, the book might be interesting to Americans but less so to the rest of the world. His account of science is, as one would expect from him, unimpeachable. His account of religion less so. His desire to accord respect to religion equalises it and concedes too much ground.In fact religion is simply a matter of power relations, the imposition of value by some on others, and value and meaning exist as much outside religion as within it. Gould's defensive posture, designed to win a local cultural debate, lets down those struggling for freedom elsewhere.As a result, I am not sure anyone on the materialist side of the debate is going to get very much from it except concessionary arguments in debate with a room full of holy types. The book seems to buttress the religious establishment in order to shore up its support for science. However, the old Stephen Jay Gould, a rational and incisive historian of science shines through with the best and most humane account of the Scopes trial and William Jennings Bryan that I have read to date. He is also good on his pet subject, the malignity and bad science of social Darwinism.The passages on Jennings show how liberal East Coast readings of the Scopes trial have utterly misread the situation and that Bryan's critique at the time was more complex and nuanced than they allow themselves to admit - and the 'Darwinist' side more self-serving and less honest.Gould is right that, in the context of the use of Darwinism in the interwar period ('bad science'), Bryan was trying to reinculcate some sense of value. He also accepted 'bad science' but his 'good value' was still superior in many ways to the misuse of science by his opponents. Gould's conclusion is a sound one - science should be value-free in its exercise and presentation to the world but that means having strong values in deciding what must be done with the knowledge. Social Darwinism is the type-case of bad social policies arising from an over-reading of science. If there is a take home message of this book that I would want to emphasise, it is that value is entirely separate from science (though not to be assumed to be a matter of religion alone) and that religious language is often a means of establishing value against complete absence of value.But the use of religion to establish value is always second best because value and meaning stand outside not only science but also outside religion itself. 'Religio' is simply the inculcation of chosen value in society, ritual, dogma, custom and text. It is not value in and of itself.If a person needs religion to bring value to the world shown to us by science, then he or she has not mastered the independence of value from the world. Value and meaning are intrinsic to the human condition, found from within not imposed from without.The book is, overall, a distraction. The defence of science here is excellent and certainly it needs saying over and over again, especially against those fluff merchants trying to merge science and 'spirituality' (whatever that is), that science can tell us nothing about value.However, the transfer of value to religion is conservative and anti-progressive and far too much of a compromise by a writer known to have been at the leading edge of progressive thinking in the scientific community, unravelling conservative mythologies embedded in past scientific ideologies.In short, he defends religion at the expense of philosophy to shore up a political position. Not impressed!"
6,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1590850-aaron,4,"A very interesting book. For those who don't know (which appears to include most of the reviewers), Gould is the world's foremost evolutionist. He is the one responsible for the theory of punctuated equilibrium -- required reading in any anthropology or biology 101 course worth its salt.Gould suggests that things would go smoother if everyone realized that religion looks toward the moral sphere, and science towards the factual sphere, and each simply stayed off of the other one's turf. I have to wonder if some of the reviewers have actually read the book, which accurately claims that this was never the historical case.For my part, I think he's exactly right, and I think this book ought to be required reading for all those religionists who create ""biblically accurate"" museums and for all the scientists who criticize religion in general. However, I don't think it would work, since it seems that most have already made up their minds and won't be persuaded otherwise no matter how impressive the credentials of the person who suggests otherwise."

8,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147229-ci,3,"Stephen Jay Gould was an iconic figure in the evolutionary biology, as well as being a prolific popular science writer. He died in 2002 but his scientific writing in the area of evolution is still much admired. He was evidently an avid reader in addition to a highly successful scientific career. However this slim book, with both a heart-felt sincerity and astonishing naiveté, demonstrated the author’s tenuous grasp of both science and religion as something can be safely compartmentalized. His main idea is a peaceful co-existence with no cognitive contamination. Specifically, he proposed a “non-overlapping magisteria (NOMA) principle therefore divides the magisterium of science to cover the empirical realm: what the Universe is made of (fact) and why does it work in this way (theory). The magisterium of religion extends over questions of ultimate meaning and moral value. These two magisteria do not overlap, nor do they encompass all inquiry."" At the first glance, this idea is wonderfully simple and clean. However, just like anything with such neat simplicity, it does not meet the messy reality of human reality. Science does not have its intrinsic ability to question its moral boundary, and religion of any use must be relevant to the “factual world” we live. In addition, religion is not just about ethics or morality, but something beyond (see Kierkegaard’s theology). Yet even in Gould’s own definition of religion as ethics and world-views are problematic. Taking stem cell research, cryonics, or legalization of cannabis, the demarcating boundary of science and religion is often illusionary. If religion is about “what we ought or ought not to do” and science “what we can or can not do”, then the pitting of the battles are more likely to be presence than a polite acquiesce from either sides. The moving of time and history changes these boundaries like the tide washing away lines in the sand. "
9,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1570985-judy,3,"Stephen Jay Gould is an elegant writer who loved science and didn't understand the fuss between science and religion. In simple words, he saw science as a study of facts and religion the study of meaning and purpose. In other words, don't mix them up together. He died in the early 2000's suspecting that the fanatics/extremists on both sides would rise to the surface again. And they have. Oh well."

11,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71386308-galen-kenney,4,"First I want to preface by saying, based upon some of the reviews I glanced over, that if you're looking for another religion-bash fest by yet another scientist, this book may not be up your alley. This book was published in 1999. While the topic of the book was largely fueled by the looming debate of whether creationism had a place to be taught in science curricula within the United States, it does not pander to the anti-theistic rhetoric that has been popularized by a handful of scientists and philosophers within the last two decades (Interestingly, the books by said philosophers and scientists expressing such fervent anti-theism gained a lot of popularity after the World Trade Center attacks on September 11th, 2001). So, with that said, I'd like to lay out some of the main points that caught my attention.1) Gould argues that science and religion fall under the definition of NOMA (Non-Overlapping Magisteria). He claims that science and religion occupy separate schools of thought and that these schools of thought have different philosophical objectives. I think most academics in both disciplines would generally agree with this. He argues that science focuses on the physical nature of our world while religion attempts to explore the meaning and morals that we give our own lives (I'm reluctant to mention morals because I feel like a lot of people have gotten unnecessarily hung up on this). He argues that much of these supposed conflicts stem from one party or another violating NOMA. 2) Gould makes the argument that much of the supposed conflict we observe between science and religion, or even religion against religion, are often about the clash of two or more political powers vying for influence by utilizing the tools that they have at their disposal. He uses the examples of Pio Nono (Pope Pius the IX) to illustrate the use of church doctrine in opposition to fellow members of his own wing who held more liberal leanings. 3) He traces the popularization of rhetoric that conflated science and religion as being at odds to the mid-late 19th century. During this time there was an large influx of Catholic immigrants and a growing fear that American values would soon deteriorate. Writers such as Draper and White spun the narrative that Christopher Columbus was a champion of science and reason against the dogmatic and superstitious Catholic Church. And Catholic immigrants would bring backwards superstitions and dogma that would bring our nation down.4) Gould also points out scientists have often been guilty of of using their area of discipline to push their own political and social cause. e.g. the use of intelligence testing to institutionalize, sterilize, or otherwise segregate certain members of our society.5) While Gould encourages the critique of dogma and superstition, he cautions against defining religion as nothing more than these features.So, while I felt that the book as a whole was very well written, I feel that the way in which Gould defined the role of religion may be a bit of an oversimplification. I have to admit, I do not have a background in religious studies, so I can't provide a sufficient critique here. The last quarter of his book explains what these two disciplines must do in order to not violate NOMA. I think as an academic exercise, this makes a lot of sense. but in practice, I feel that this is often much easier said than done, particularly if your religion already has an anthropocentric view of the universe deeply ingrained in it's identity (Again, not my field. So, I could be completely wrong).While I feel that his analysis of religion might be slightly lacking at times, I would definitely recommend this book as a useful way of examining and critiquing different schools of thought and their applications in the world. There is also great history about both Church leaders and scientists. I also thought that this book was a very interesting look into Gould's own agnosticism, his personal values, and how he saw his social responsibility as a scientist. Gould was someone who was always for good healthy discourse. but, he always emphasized the need to understanding where different positions were coming from and what fundamental, nuanced tools were being used to construct their logic."
12,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1769655-mike,3,"I understand the wide acclaim for Professor Gould. I can't speak to his scientific achievements, but he is a fabulous writer--a kind of Carl Sagan for biology, a man whose breadth of interests is matched by the felicty of his pen. So I enjoy reading his stuff, and this book was great. My complaint with the New Atheists (decidedly not Gould's team) is that they define religion as the Fundamentalists do because they need the Fundamentalists' wacky literalism as a straw man to then destroy religion. We attack religion because religion IS fundamentalism and fundamentalism is ignorant and stupid. You consider yourself both religious and a non-fundamentalist? That's because, say the New Atheists, you're actually an intellectual wuss--you want the benefits of religion without actually committing to it. You're a sell out. Come back to us when you're a fundamentalist so we can attack you properly. Atheism may be more attractive than fundamentalism (perhaps....even probably), but it's got a more difficult opponent in liberal religion. The solution? Deny that liberal religion is religion. Gould wants to save the liberal religious folks. Ostensibly he's not against the fundamentalists, either, insofar they keep their fundamentalism to themselves. His principle of NOMA suggests that religion and science each have their own subject respective subject matter and competencies. And were this true, his philosophy would solve us from all the messiness of real life. But here's the thing. Gould defines science in a way most people would recognize, but he defines religion so narrowly that defenders of religion are left to wonder why there's remaining worth defending. Gould claims that religion, and religion alone (or, presumably, philosophy) can tell us about meaning and values. But as soon as it begins to involve itself in the world of factuality (not his word; his word was cooler, though I can't remember it. Maybe something like factuity) religion ceases to speak in its proper domain; it has entered the world of science. Which would be just fine if that's how religious folks understood the claims of their religions. But they don't. Of the world religions, I know Christianity best so that's all I can speak about. But Christianity turns on a historical event, the resurrection of a person. And it purports to describe all manner of past events, some involving humans and others involving God and nature. So it's a little like this. Gould says that nation A and nation B are not at war because he says to nation A (science) behave yourself and don't be so arrogant! And to nation B (religion) he takes away their weapons and declarations of war and says ""isn't peace grand?"" Come over here you guys, time for a big group hug!!!His world is a beautiful world in some respects, but it's effectually an atheistic world, a world in which there may or may not be a god, but that god is not allowed to intervene in the world or inspire His or Her followers to better understand factual reality. "
13,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/296942-lisa-kelsey,5,"This excellent book outlines how and why science and religion should coexist without any violation to either body. This has been my intuition for a long time and reading this book has helped clarify it in my mind.In addition to speaking to the invalidity of attempting to answer questions of factual nature from within the realm of religion, I appreciate Gould's acknowledgement that scientists have also overreached their domain both historically and currently. Scientists must also be held accountable--not to succumb to using science as pretense to put forward their own prejudices or politics. And I have always found the militant atheists railing against religion as particularly distasteful. Here, Gould puts my exact feelings into words:""I do get discouraged when some of my colleagues tout their private atheism as a panacea for human progress…. If these colleagues wish to fight superstition, irrationalism, philistinism, ignorance, dogma, and a host of other insults to the human intellect…then God bless them--but don't call this enemy 'religion.'"" The answers to all questions are not to be found in any one ""magesteria"" (the word Gould uses to describe a domain where one form of teaching holds the appropriate tools for discourse). For a ""full life"" we must have a dialogue between them."
14,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/120169-ancient-weaver,3,"An intelligent book full of much common sense. In Rocks of Ages the author seeks a better understanding of religion, science, their limits, and their interplay. Gould writes as somebody displaying a well-rounded education and more than a little wisdom as opposed to what you most often find in the narrow, shallow, fanatical tirades of the more current New Atheists. Please read this book instead of Dawkin's The God Delusion. And if you read and/or liked The God Delusion, please try giving this book a read as a better alternative starting point to approaching the science/religion conflict."
15,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13222064-eric-wurm,2,"Gould puts forward his idea of non-overlapping magisteria, where science deals with facts and religion with values. What a positively terrible idea! Suggesting that science and religion can mind their boundaries and occupy separate fields of expertise is laughable. Facts inform values, and the fact is that no religion has demonstrated its tenets to have any form of veracity or even an air of verisimilitude. Why would we leave the domain of ethics and morality to people who believe that such things are delivered by a voice in whirlwind? Gould makes an excellent biologist, paleontologist, advocate for science, and author. He makes a terrible apologist for religion. Then again, is there any other kind? "
16,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37348163-omar-essawi,3,"Although this was a great read in which Gould takes a very liberal position in his consideration of a very sensitive issue, I can't agree with the best part of it. In fact, I don't agree with the underlying premises. However, much respect to Gould and his attempt to reconcile this matter. Id have rather given it 5 stars for enjoyability, and 1 star for validity. "
17,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4771466-john-martindale,3,"Gould seems to relegate religion to issues of morality, and argues they need to accept scientific claims that miracles don't and cannot happen and that they violate NOMA (non overlapping magisteria) by seeking to get creationism taught in schools. But NOMA cuts both ways though, scientist (which deals with all facts and reality) have no right to use Darwinism as a means to establish moral truth, Gould gave an example of such misapplications of Darwinism finding their way into science textbooks. Gould wrote how Darwinism was used by social-Darwinist in their eugenics programs, by the Nazis to justify “Might makes right” and by many scientist who sought to use science to give weight to their racist prejudices. Later generations saw all of these things to be morally repugnant and also based upon bad science—as Gould argued in “The Mismeasure of Man.” Morality is the domain of religion (It seems on could as well say philosophy), and science, though it indeed informs us on what IS, can never show us what we morally ought or ought not to do. Towards the beginning of the book, Gould, while creating the setting for his case of NOMA, shared the biblical story about doubting Thomas and Jesus' response to him, and yes, I must agree that on the face of it, it seems like Jesus was telling the more scientific-minded Thomas “Blessed are the credulous who believe I rose from the dead, though they have not seen me, for those who have blind faith are better than you who demanded proof. Yes, I say that the more blind, baseless and contrary to the evidence faith is, the more virtuous it is” and thus Jesus shows us how religion is about obstinately believing in pure speculations, despite or contrary to the evidence, and how science alone can inform us on fact and reality. It seems Gould's concept of the nature of faith is similar Richard Dawkins caricature of it, but I think they both misunderstand what it is. Faith ultimately is trust, and it is unreasonable to place our trust in someone or something which we do not have reasons to believe is reliable. If we are justified in believing the gospel accounts (some scholars and historians have given us many good reasons to do so) then we know that Thomas saw the miracles of Jesus, he heard his teachings, he heard Jesus tell him he would be crucified and be raised from the dead three days later, and yet still after Jesus was killed and after the other disciples told him they saw the risen Lord, Thomas refused believe the other disciples nor did he trust Jesus (though he had GOOD REASONS to do so), it was not that Thomas was reluctant to take a leap of faith, but instead he doubted three years of profound evidence of a Divine Man sent from God. He experienced Jesus to be trust-worthy and he didn't trust him, this was insulting. It is within a relationship that giving someone the benefit of the doubt and trusting someones character, in uncertain times, becomes virtuous. No one treats a relationship with a woman in a highly critical, skeptical and scientific way and remains in that relationship for long! In a good relationship, we form reasoned conclusions about the other people, though we lack scientific certainty. Indeed our experience of the other, our observations of their character and actions inform us and gives us reason to trust them, even when mysterious and dark circumstances later on makes us look like the fool for doing so. Now I do have one more bone to pick with Gould, who doesn't think the religious are justified in their belief in miracles for science has shown us they cannot happen. Gould is perfectly comfortable with Deist and liberal theologians and seems to think science has made this the only intellectual and reasonable position those of faith can take. I think Gould's understanding of a miracle is that it's a violation of the law of nature and since science has shown the reliability of natural laws, NOMA doesn't permit the religious person to think God actually does or could do anything in our world. I think Gould has a complete misunderstanding of the actual nature of a miracle if they do indeed occur. It is obvious that man manipulates nature and her laws and uses them to his own advantage, but in doing this he is not breaking the laws of nature! If we could go back several 100 years, much of our current technology would all seem miraculous, it would even seem as if we were violating the laws of nature. Now we merely need to suppose that if there is a God, just as man can act in the natural world—molding it to his own advantage, so God can likewise act, and just as man doesn't violate the laws of nature by doing so, God acting in the world doesn't violate the laws either, it's just that what he does seems like it to us, just like our technology and medicine would seem like magic to people in the past. Just because we can't see God doesn't rule out his activity, there are plenty of things in the natural world that are invisible to us that effect and alter the normal way of things. We can't see the wind, but we can feel the effects of the wind... wind can cause a feather to be swept up into air, is wind causing the feather to violate the law of gravity? Heck, we can reach down and pick up the feather ourselves, are we violating the laws of nature? I don't see why the idea of God raising up a feather is anathema and for God to do so would be for him to “break the laws of nature” in the mind of scientist and liberal Christians.  If I was in a Texas hotel and I left five 20 dollar bills in the dresser and left for the day, only to come back that evening and pulling open the drawer, to find only three 20 dollar bills in the drawer, I wouldn't proclaim “THE LAWS OF ARITHMETIC HAVE BEEN BROKEN!!!” But instead that “the laws of Texas have been broken!!!” If there is a God, I think it absolutely absurd, that people think God can't do what humans do. Doctors work hard so not to allow nature to take it's course, are they violating the laws of nature in doing so? What if God acted like a doctor and brought healing in ways we've yet to figure out? Well, these cases would seem miraculous (there are countless cases of such mysterious healings and not all are easily explained-away by placebos) of course science cannot prove God did it, and thus NOMA does come into play here, but also science CANNOT say God didn't have part in it, which Gould is suggesting—and thus I think Gould is actually violating the vary principle of NOMA when making this ridiculous claim that it's a scientific fact that miracles don't and cannot happen. Over all, I did enjoy this book, so I will go ahead and end on a good note, I am really thankful for Gould setting the records straight about the very popular myth that the ancients and the church during the middle ages believed in a flat-earth. It's amusing how so many of the atheist “Brights” are so credulous when it comes to embracing anti-religious propaganda, misinformation and memes that confirm their bias, and though calling themselves skeptics are so little discernment. It is refreshing that someone who atheist would consider their own, took some time to dispel some of the nonsense that spreads like a virus among secularist. I liked how Gould gave a more reasoned coverage of Galileo, the Catholic church and the Scopes trial, among other things, and that he can acknowledge the reality that religion isn't pure evil and that it doesn't poison everything.

He does not have credentials in a hard science like physics or math, nor requisite fields of religious studies or moral philosophy. He ends up an elephant treading in things in which he has no knowledge. Worse still, his own experience with creationists shows there *is* a war of science and religion, but he calls this and others that he mentions in his book ""politics"" instead even though if you asked the parties involved why they would say ""SCIENCE!"" or ""RELIGION!"" in whatever context that would be at that point in history. Galileo would say ""natural philosophy"", Pope Urban would say ""authority of Rome"". The words change, the meaning doesn't.So the whole book is an essay by a celebrity popular science writer perturbed by recent *war of science and religion* involving creationism and evolution. He comes to grips with it by saying there is no war of science and religion and it's all a misunderstanding. If a philosophy that only a very small minority can train their brains to do were held by everyone that would solve everything. It's all our fault for acting like average human beings.The reality is much different. The more religious you are the more you're likely to believe in creationism or that global warming isn't real. The more science education you have the more likely you are not to believe in God. That's reality. That's the war of science and religion."
19,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54969985-reese-walling,3,"Gould's attempt at reconciling science and religion (or should I say placing them in their rightful, distinct realms) was admirable and thought-provoking. He proposes an irenic that undoubtably frustrates scientists and religionists alike who try to dance in the other's field of expertise. As an intrusive religionist myself, I couldn't help cringing at Gould's assertions that directly contradict my beliefs in regard to the meaning of the universe (being anthropocentric). However, I admire his work as an agnostic scientist who was able to remain fairly objective. He attempts to expose the historical fallacy of a science vs. religion debate and examine the psychological reasons for such a conflict, i.e. why do we by nature impose moral significance to phenomena that are amoral. I believe the premise of the book can be summed up by a quote heavily utilized to enforce his NOMA (Non-Overlapping Magisteria) solution by Charles Darwin: ""I am inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details, whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance.""

He's probably done as good a job as anyone could do. On the other hand, this reviewer felt unsatisfied by the author's explanation and justification. It's worth reading, but critically at the least.

Significantly, he tracks the development of the faith at war with science to the late 1800s and knocks down several of the straw men developed to foment this.

I also agree with him that an objective/scientific understanding of reality should compliment (or perhaps ""overlap"" with [not using his words here]) our understanding and interpretations of spiritual/religious teachings.

29,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51063190-caden-howlett,4,"I had been meaning to get around to reading this for many years. As a geoscience student, the scientific lens through which Dr. Gould views the world (as a paleontologist) resonates with me strongly. His knowledge of the natural world is incredible and his deep understanding and ability to articulate ancient philosophical doctrines is admirable. I would argue that Gould is one of the greatest scientific communicators of all time.All that being said, I have a very hard time buying into the idea of non-overlapping magisteria (NOMA). The argument that science and religion can co-exist peacefully, and that each attacks entirely different problems of the universe is simply false. Gould boldly claims at the very beginning of the book that science cannot answer questions of morality and human value. I think that the best counter argument to this is to be found in Sam Harris' many discussions on the topic as well as in his book ""The Moral Landscape"", which eviscerates the idea that science can't answer such questions.Additionally, I think Gould fails to mention very important examples of biblical claims that completely overlap with scientific ones. For example, the virgin birth. The virgin birth is a religious claim--one that Christian's rely upon to be true for their very religion to exist. But it is also a biological claim--importantly, it is a biological claim that has not a scrap of supporting evidence. On the contrary, the idea of a virgin birth contradicts everything we have ever observed in the naturalistic universe. This is just one of dozens of examples where biblical ""truths"" contradict scientific fact, and there is a clear breaking down of the idea of NOMA.Although I disagree with the general premise of NOMA, I still respect Dr. Gould as a scientific communicator and thinker. It is rare that individuals come along who are able to think equally as brilliantly in the domains of hard science and philosophy. I highly recommend this book and even more so, Dr. Goulds many interviews that are available on YouTube."
30,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4785618-luke,2,"A very well written, engaging book with a horribly mistaken premise. The concept of Non-Overlapping Magisteria (NOMA) is flawed in two ways: it rules out of bounds religious claims that are susceptible to empirical test and it hands over to religion categories of human inquiry over which it is not qualified to hold exclusive dominion, such as ethics. Traditional religion, as it is understood by the majority of the Earth's inhabitants, makes claims that are in theory testable. We can at least in theory decide the question of the efficacy of prayer by scientific experiment. The historicity of certain events such as the resurrection of Jesus or the fall of the ancient civilizations described in the Qur'an are also open to objective investigation via accepted historical methods. While playing coy about these specific historical claims (he is mum about the historicity of the resurrection), he does acknowledge that NOMA requires that religion give up its belief in the efficacy of intercessory prayer and in a designed universe unfolding according to a plan discernible from nature itself. A religion that lacks any appeal to the supernatural is simply not going to be meaningful to majority of the Earth's inhabitants at this stage of our cultural evolution and it will take a lot of work to change that. The proponents of traditional religion are not stupid, regardless of the stereotypes that secularists have of them. They see through the bargain that NOMA is offering them: it deprives them of much of their persuasive force by denying them their appeal to the importance of humanity in the grand scheme of things and denying their belief in a personal God who protects his followers.On the flip side, there is no compelling reason to assign to religion the entire domain of culture, as Gould does here. Secular ethical philosophy is more capable of providing moral guidance to modern human beings than is traditional revealed religion because it does not have to appeal to dubious historical claims to establish its authority nor does it have to appeal to divine authority to justify its at times hideous commandments (female circumcision, anyone?). There is absolutely no need to for ministers, priests, rabbis, and Imams to sit on scientific advisory panels or to give them a unique prestige when it comes to legislative deliberations regarding novel scientific developments. A priest is no more qualified to pontificate on the morality of stem cell research than the average person on the street. The best qualified panels are those whose members have either studied the scientific issues in depth, are trained ethicists, legal professionals, or a combination of the three. It may be advisable to have lay members to represent the views of the average citizen, but there is no reason to give clergyman any kind of privileged position. Even as a historical position, this side of NOMA lacks credibility- the morality of society is shaped by many more factors than religion. Literature, the arts, the law, and politics also shape the ethics that become the guide for a civilization. Uncle Tom's Cabin did more for the abolition than a thousand sermons from the pulpit.I am willing to give this book two stars for its style and for the historical sources that Gould delves into which are quite interesting. But a flawed central premise prohibits me from rating it higher, which is a shame because I respect the man's work in combating Creationism and his scientific achievements."
31,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/738817-adam,2,"""Each domain of inquiry frames its own rules and admissible questions, and sets its own criteria for judgment and resolution. These accepted standards, and the procedures developed for debating and resolving legitimate issues, define the magisterium--or teaching authority--of any given realm.""This widely-acclaimed work is well written; Stephen Jay Gould has a gift for storytelling and for crafting analogies. But the book's reasoning and argumentation are not nearly as satisfying. In ""Rocks of Ages,"" Gould presents his model for reconciling science and religion: NOMA, or ""non-overlapping magisteria,"" summed up in the quote above. The idea is that science does its thing, and religion does its thing, and they leave each other alone.But Gould quickly steers NOMA away from its simple formulation, insisting on ""intense dialogue between the two distinct subjects"" (science and religion). Consider Gould's words: (1) ""facts of nature cannot determine the moral basis of utility""; (2) ""science teaches us many wonderful and disturbing things--facts that need weighing when we try to develop standards for conduct, and when we ponder the great questions of morals and aesthetics""; (3) ""nature remains neutral (while bursting with relevant information to spice our moral debates)"". In these and other examples, Gould seems to waffle between independence and interdependence, though science never seems to be dependent on religion (surprise, surprise).What's more, Gould doesn't really argue for NOMA; he presents historical anecdotes of people practicing it. Ironically, this tactic is one that Gould criticizes in his opponents (which he likes to do, sometimes resorting to strawman versions of other models). With NOMA, Gould advocates interaction without overlap, but this seems incoherent to me. The ""interaction"" that Gould advocates is simply the intrusion of one magisterium into another, which is what NOMA is supposed to disallow. Maybe I'm missing something, but for my part, I can't see how any fields of study can interact unless they are addressing the same issues at least some of the time.And this gets to the heart of my contention with Gould: He radically oversimplifies the idea of religion, essentially reducing it to ethics. While ethical concerns are certainly important to religion, most religions do in fact concern themselves with the nature of reality (to say nothing of rituals, aesthetics, and history); to pretend otherwise is simply a mischaracterization. It may well be that science provides a better way to explore the world, but such an issue requires more than bald assertions like Gould's. (And at any rate, many ethicists would insist that morals must be grounded in reality, so Gould still isn't off the hook.)For what it's worth, I think there's some merit behind NOMA; different academic fields do indeed use different methods to examine different subjects. But the boundaries are far from clear (being largely the result of human distinctions), and the overlap is always possible."
32,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51838782-lucas,4,"Earnest. I do think Gould is too insistent on separation in fields that are less easily established on empirical grounds. In particular, Christianity is the the truth of man, so anthropology and sociology are impoverished by its exclusion. I would not be surprised if many valuable insights into psychology are overlooked or unexplored as well."
33,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13503780-a-bowdoin-van-riper,3,"Stephen Jay Gould’s central theme in Rocks of Ages is that – far from being in eternal, irreconcilable conflict – science and religion are non-overlapping realms of human endeavor that proceed from different premises, ask different questions, and use different methods to seek answers. Not only are the two realms (he calls them “non-overlapping magisteria”), not in conflict, they cannot be in conflict. Episodes like the trial of Galileo in 1632 and the Scopes Trial of 1925 – routinely cited as major battles religion’s in eternal “war” with science – have their real roots, Gould argues, in the cultural anxieties of specific places and times. So, for that matter, does the idea of the “war” itself.Gould has a track record of writing well -- sometimes brilliantly – both about broad, abstract concepts and about small, telling details. He writes well -- though not brilliantly – about both here. His explanation of the “separate spheres” argument is clear and careful, and his analysis of the Galileo and Scopes affairs vivid and compelling. Neither will surprise professional historians or philosophers, both neither is meant to. Both, however, will come as revelations to much of the general public that is his intended audience.Both book and author, however, get into trouble in the broad middle ground between abstract philosophical arguments and concrete historical details. Gould offers up his two-spheres model as a solution to the real-world conflict over science and religion in late-twentieth-century America. If only both sides would see the truth of it, he argues, the conflict would evaporate, and “intelligent design” advocates like Michael Behe would be free to lie down (metaphorically, anyway) with militant atheists like Richard Dawkins.Alas, it’s not that easy, particularly in large swaths of the American South and Midwest. Gould – culturally Jewish and religiously agnostic; New Yorker by birth and Bostonian by choice; grad student at Columbia and professor at Harvard – fatally underestimates the commitment of culturally conservative evangelical Protestants to the idea that science and religion do overlap, pronouncing on the same questions of fact. For the substantial number of Americans who see Biblical texts as literally true, the core ideas of a half-dozen scientific disciplines – which flatly contradict them – must then be false. The encounter between science and religion thus becomes, for such believers, precisely the zero-sum game that Gould wishes it were not. Rocks of Ages, eloquent thought it often is, stands little chance of reversing that position. "
34,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3216716-kelley,1,"I found Gould's entire argument to be conflicting and frustrating to read. This book states that religion and science are separate,(the exact metaphor used was yin and yang), but equal schools of ideas (NOMA). So of course it makes sense that Gould then uses a word he says has catholic origins (magisteria) to define both the worlds of science and religion...? He is letting them overlap already, before we even make it past the titles and into the content! Gould soils the book with personal beliefs over intelligent design and evolution and further complicates his argument. He advertises himself as a major force in the campaign against intelligent design being taught in schools, yet seems to praise teachers who skip over the entire evolution chapter in their textbooks. So it's good to keep faith from reaching into science's domain, but even better to keep the two from having to bicker at all! By all means, please let our youth grow up without ever once hearing about the theory of evolution, because it might offend the faithful. Which brings up my favorite metaphor from the text... that of Russian villagers chipping away ice to relieve the pressure behind a giant river in order to save their town from flooding. Gould recommends that scientists be just as gentle when challenging biblical beliefs with scientific proof. Right. So scientists should restrict their findings to a gradual trickle into the minds of the general populous because it's more polite. Society isn't going to have some giant upheaval just because we've suddenly found the secret to the universe isn't some romantic notion about omnipresent omnipotent beings. It's okay to be rough. Gould did bring up a nice point about how humanity used to attribute the sky's blueness to nonsensical things, but now we know the scientific facts behind our atmosphere. Unfortunately this tramps all over the book's original premise that the magisteria of science and religion are completely separate. Gould is arguing that one day science will be able to explain everything, (or almost everything, at least), but until then it is okay for science and religion to hold equal importance in our society. He realizes that our world cannot operate under the NOMA idea because eventually facts will outweigh faith, but for the sake of cultural peace he is willing to turn a blind eye. There is really nothing worse than an author who doesn't actually believe in what he's writing. "
35,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/383577-charlotte,3,"In this book, Gould argues that Religion (by which he means ethics, not necessarily a belief in the divine) and Science occupy two discrete areas of knowledge -- Non-Overlapping Magisteria or NOMA, as he calls it. Let me say first that Gould is my favorite science writer. He has clean writing style, explains concepts clearly, and takes an obvious delight and interest in just about everything. He also writes about past scientists and theologians with a respect and understanding that is practically unprecedented in my reading.In this book, though, he is frankly out of his depth. As a general rule of thumb of how to conduct ones life, I agree that NOMA stands strong. Science and religion generally do not ask the same questions or address the same issues and I, at least, consider them both extremely important. Politics, school, and life in general would be much easier if people would not try to mix the two. Where he runs into trouble is in stating that this is necessarily always the case. As he puts it ""What is is different from what ought to be."" This runs into problems, though, when we start asking questions along the lines of ""are religious experiences 'real'?"" ""what does it mean for God to create physical laws of the Universe?"" and ""what is the basis of morality?"" His view of NOMA-allowed religion appears to be limited to an entirely deist view which, despite, his claims is not the majority view, even in the most liberal of churches. Even more than this, though, his understanding of religion only encompasses a very small portion of what most religious people I've talked to understand it to be. In effect, he adopts the moral code without the motivation behind it or the world view that causes it. So, while, I appreciate the olive branch and agree with the practical applications of NOMA, I found the philosophical basis for it to be unsound. The strength of his writing followed this pattern as well. When talking about the historical and practical side of NOMA, his arguments were clear and his anecdotes powerful. In the latter half of the book, though, as he moved into the intellectual underpinnings of NOMA, his writing became more muddied and arguments confused. That said, if most of us had half the tolerance, respect, and intellect of Gould, the world would be a significantly better place."
36,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13620950-mike,2,"Short, agenda-driven, feels like a manifesto. Gould co-opts the concept of ""non-overlapping magesteria"" (NOMA) from Catholicism, and pitches it as the solution to the ""non-problem"" of the perceived conflict between science and religion. Science and religion are fundamentally different pursuits and it's nonsense to cast them as being ""at war"" with each other. (I'm going to leave aside the ""interdigitation"" thing for now, except to say that even if the magesteria of science and religion do happen to interlock perfectly, Gould provides no argument as to why this should be the case.)When Gould gets around to defining ""religion,"" he does it fuzzily and fails to distinguish it from moral/ethical philosophy. He devotes many pages to creationism, as though this were the only truth claim ever made by a religion. Most Christians (he says) have long since given up any claim that the book of Genesis is literally true. This subject, one the main historical sources of the perceived conflict between science and religion, is not a live issue for most Christians.Gould manages to pretty much avoid any discussion of beliefs that religions do hold, so his dismissal of creationism as outdated nonsense reads as a tacit dismissal of every truth claim ever made by any religion. Although creationism is mostly a dead issue by now, I think you'll find Christians somewhat more attached to the doctrine of the incarnation -- the central fact of Christian orthodoxy, and an unequivocal truth claim about an event that either did or did not happen some 2000 years ago.Gould is not a believer (neither am I, if it matters), and he seems to think that ""religion"" is some homogenous mass of moral wisdom that we all draw from, rather than a patchwork of mutually exclusive belief systems, each of which encompasses a highly specific, often very complex set of truth claims.Basically, sure, there is no conflict between science and religion -- as long as you define a religion in a way that precludes it making any truth claims about the nature of reality. Gould does, I don't, you probably don't either.I like Gould's writing style, despite my issues with this book. I probably started with the wrong book (this was my first Gould) -- I'm curious now to read something where he's more on his own turf. "
37,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1469789-oldpoltroon,4,"This is worth a read, but frustrating for me becuase it makes no effort to resolve, inform, or guide an increasing number of disputes between vocal, fringe minorities and science that seeks to improve the human condition. In fairness, religion is often (usually) not the source of robust and vocal opposition to improving lives, but like any social institution, it has its moments.And since Gould picked the battle between science and religion for his book - let's consider instances of such disputes between science and a minority of faithful who oppose federal funding (or private outreach for that matter) for condom distribution, cervical cancer vaccines, stem cell research, or sex education in public schools. Can we (how do we?) resolve such disputes and can we bring these lost souls back from the margins? Gould merely offers the following - ""facts of nature cannot determine the moral basis of utility, [and a:] scientist has no more right to seek such power than his fundamentalist neighbor can muster in trying to become dictator of the age of the earth.""Gosh, that's helpful. Let me ask this - if science can't advance a moral judgment about its own developments, shouldn't we be developing institutions that can think seriously about such questions and make those moral judgments reliably? In the absence of such institutions - aren't decisions about technology left entirely to those who scream the loudest? Let me say that it's not Gould's intent to guide us in times where ethical and moral judgments conflict with the science of our time - I just wish that it was. The future of so many advancements we currently face (in biotechnology, genetics, nuclear energy, etc.) may always be subject to the histerics of fringe agendas or the bottom line morality of the board room - but I hope for a third way. Although Gould prescribes a strict dilineation between the magesterium of science and technology, I'll offer a special prayer - that we might develop a deliberative capability (a thoughtful gatekeeper) within society to assess new science with moral courage, wisdom, reason, and a commitment to improving the human condition."
38,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1964234-paul-m,4,"This book, with it's concept of ""Non-Overlapping Magisteria,"" or ""NOMA,"" expresses something that I feel I have lived in my own life for quite a while. Gould expresses the idea that science and religion explore different aspects of the world in different ways, and that the two should respect each other, especially in those areas that cause friction. He is not advocating that the two ignore each other, but rather that each area respect the boundaries of the other, and that in those areas of ""interdigitation"" there be constructive debate. Personally, as someone with a B.S. in Biology and an M.A. in Spanish lit, as well as an active religious life, I have tried to find a kind of three-headed version of this idea, with the humanities being another NOMA, and it's tricky because there are times when the magisteria seem to overlap, and because some outspoken members of each group spend a lot of time attacking the others.Of course, this concept is easy when we talk about, say, researching a cure for cancer, as all but a few religious groups would say that is a scientific concern. Gould spends a good portion of the book talking about the creationism-evolution ""debate,"" which he actively participated in, testifying in the McLean vs. Arkansas court case. He sees creationist attempts teach ""creation science"" as an example of a group infringing on the NOMA of another. This whole example, of course, shows how hard NOMA is in practice, as there will always be the fundamentalists on one side, and those like the New Atheists on the other (with each of these two groups feeling spurred to action by the other). Gould's book does, however, provide an articulate explanation of the way many of us live our lives, with no big battle between science and religion going on in our minds like others expect there to be."

Plus he generally modifies nouns and verbs with adverbs and adjectives leading to confusing constructions; one often has to re-read sentences to get the gist.This is an interesting (because so abject) experiment in renaming accepted terms and drawing conclusions about the world from these new names.His starting point is the old ‘is/ought’ dichotomy- the presumed difference between on the one hand facts- states of affairs in the world- and values on the other. Whether or not we should accept this split is glossed over in a confused footnote.Then he simply equates religion (without defining this term) with the ought side of the dichotomy which enables him to claim that religion is necessary for understanding the world (because we need to talk about morals)Of course no one (not even SJG)really thinks religion is co-extensive with moral reasoning. The absurdity is readilly brought home by considering an Atheist doing some moral reasoning. According to SJG this person is engaging in a religious activity; which (Presto!) makes the atheist a theist. At one point Gould says ‘let’s not quibble about words’; I wonder if the slandered atheist would agree. On the other side someone who is praying or taking communion or blessing someone is not doing anything religious according to Gould.If the absurdity of the NOMA project is so easilly exposed how does Gould get away with pontificating for a few hundred pages? By equivocating. One minute he’ll talk blithely about the dichotomy between values and science and the next he’ll switch to talking about a supposed dichotomy between religion and of science. The one can be plausibly argued the other cannot because morals and religion are not co-extensive.
40,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7636269-rogue,4,"The one problem with the book appears to be an essential main point for Stephen Jay Gould. The idea that the moral relativism of religion is somehow superior to any other attempt at morality cannot be justified. The Ku Klux Klan appear to be sincere Christians, basing their morality on the Bible. Should we refuse to criticize them because the absence of a good reason to treat people differently because of the color of their skin is demonstrated by science?Some members of some religions claim that we should treat homosexuals as less equal than heterosexuals. Should we refuse to criticize them because the absence of a good reason to treat people differently because of sexual orientation is demonstrated by science?Equally sincere Christians can take opposite positions on any moral question, but only the religious are seen as having authority on morality? Sincere Christians disagree on capital punishment, corporal punishment, abortion, contraception, vaccination and other use of medicine, divorce, whether women are permitted the same ministerial authority as men, public prayer, treatment of those born with mixed genders, military service, idol worship, ad nauseam. They do not even agree on whether the Christ they worship is/was a god or a human (or some sort of combination). Why should anyone see this as anything other than using their religion to justify their morality, rather than using religion to determine morality?The book is an important discussion of the topic, but this flaw detracts from the rest of the book. ."
41,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43434111-nick-cincotta,5," Sadly Gould was taken from us too soon. He makes you think as you read this book about your own beliefs and what your beliefs stand. I primarily saw myself as someone interested in science. In reading this book I found a kindred spirit, but also spice my own emotional curiosity with religion. I often thought being someone who was prone to understanding paleontology and reading about evolution that these ideas do not go hand-in-hand with Religion. I myself do see myself as a Christian, however, I struggled with finding where science and religion are balanced for me. After reading Lead For God's Sake, I found myself back to an ideal I struggled with earlier, how do science and religion align and mix. This book I felt provide an answer, it's not about having strong beliefs in either science or religion, it's about finding that balance, let science show us the factual information and religion guide our morals and ethics. It is about balance not choosing one or the other, one can choose both, we just have to find a balance that works for us. Gould showed this through the examples of Huxley and Darwin, but also showed how far we have strayed from making this work with the Scopes Monkey trial and other laws that attempted to ban the teaching of evolution. Science and religion are able to do-exist "
42,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5890630-james,2,"Ultimately unpersuasive. Gould's argument requires him to reconceptualize religion so as to make it unrecognizable to the great majority of actual religious practitioners, and essentially synonymous with moral philosophy. He fares a bit better in his argument that the factual content of science cannot be directly applied in a purely objective manner toward the resolution of moral questions, but the difficulties inherent in deriving ""ought"" from ""is"" have been discussed at least since Hume, so there's nothing really new or insightful there. Gould fails to address the real problem: by casually denying religion the right to make empirical or historical claims (claiming the realm of empirical reality for the magisterium of science), he sidesteps the crux of the debate by simply assuming that religion can be reconceptualized as abstract moral philosophy with no essential empirical content. Most practicing theists I know would disagree-- and while Gould might respond (though he seems to want to deny this) that the majority of practicing theists are violating NOMA, I don't see how his irenic project can get off the ground if he insists on defining the basic terms of the debate in a manner at odds with the definitions of its principal participants."
43,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9811549-jim,4,"Stephen Jay Gould (SJG) promotes the idea of non overlapping magisteria (NOMA),a kind of compromise between the 'warring' philosophies of science and religion. While I certainly like the author's prose and his systematic use of history and anecdotes to make his point(s), I certainly cannot agree with his conclusions. In a scientific world based on careful examination of facts (in nature) there can be no agreement with a religious philosophy based on the supernatural and magic. SJG clearly states that the world of science is amoral...and, as scientists, we cannot afford to examine nature on the basis of whether it is good or evil...moral or immoral. If there is to be NOMA then let it be between the magesteria of science and morality, keeping the entire religious aspect out of the picture. Or, better still, establish separate magisteria between religion and morality, recognizing that religiosity is not confined to just Christianity and its peculiar brand of morality, but includes all the world's religions with significantly different views of morality. Science can stand alone, thank you very much. And thank you very much Dr Gould, for writing such a fine book with which to disagree.Highly recommended! "
44,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61848948-temnospondyli,2,"I don’t know where to start. How to review such a foolish, misguided, and illogical book by someone who should have been intelligent enough to know better. Wishful thinking is all this notion of NOMA could have ever been. Perhaps had Gould been raised outside the liberal, educated east coast bubble he might have seen first hand that a disturbingly large number of religionists DO in fact read their bibles as literal, contradictions and all. Yes, for many urban liberal educated people who only go to church for weddings, and maybe Xmas or Easter and when pushed tend to say wishy-washy things about being “spiritual”, NOMA is, despite its clear cognitive dissonance, the default method of daily life. That’s not true for damn near everyone else who clearly, proudly, and loudly declare their religion to be the only true religion and science, along with every other religion, to be wrong. And that’s just the western Christians. Notice he leaves out the literalist Muslim world where attempts at metaphorical islamic interpretations gets you killed! No, this NOMA is nothing more than a silly pipe dream philosophy, a “have your communion wafer and eat it too” bit of nonsense that only works if one lives a life unexamined, and if that’s the case, why bother with science anyway?"
45,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/306992-gina,3,"what i liked about this book is the same thing i like about his other books: he's a scholar and when he writes about a subject, he weaves history and science and many other disciplines all together in a very playful but scholarly way.also, the subject is one i love so much that i basically majored in it. but this book reads like patchwork; mr. gould's friends noticed he was passionate about the subject of the overlapping domains of science and religion, and they told him to write a book about it, and he picked an essay from this previously published collection and an essay from that previously published collection and wrote a few paragraphs to tie them together. i liked the historical bits (about how the papacy accepted the scientific validity of evolution in writing decades ago, about how isabelle and ferdinand already knew that the earth was round, about darwin and his champions/detractors, and about william jennings bryan and the scopes trial and mr gould's participation in and research of later court trials involving scientific theory). i wouldn't read the book again. "
46,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6000426-gordon,3,"I came across this shortish book by chance and because the subject - the relationship between science and religion - is one that has given me pause from time to time, I thought I would check it out. As I made my way through the first few chapters it seemed to me that Gould's argument was fairly trivial: on some level it is hard to argue with what he calls NOMA (""non-overlapping magisteria"") or the principle that neither scientists nor religious thinkers should presume to make authoritative statements about the other field. As a call to civilized dialogue (rather than nasty polemics that only demean their authors) it can only be welcomed, but it struck me as hardly new. Some of the truths that, in Gould's view, flow from NOMA were at first glance somewhat surprising and prompted me to do some reflecting; in the end, though, they added little to the mix of ideas I have previously encountered, neither helping to resolve my questions nor opening up serious new ones. In sum, Rock of Ages gets 4 stars for good will and its many flashes of humour, but only 2 for original thought, 3 overall. Not bad, but I had hoped for more."
47,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/613016-maggie,5,"excellent. Stephen Jay Gould thinks clearly, writes clearly, and as a scientist brings his whole weight of knowledge to bear on the fact: there is no conflict between science and religion (except of course for the man-made battles some folks insist upon but which are nonetheless based on naught).there is an interesting quirk to this book that lands in favor of SJG. the book Flat Earth by Christine Garwood was published in 2007. Rocks of Ages by Stephen Jay Gould covers precisely the same information about the ""flat earth"" misconception taught to school children as Ms. Garwood's book covers ONLY SJG's book was published in 1999. ahem. Ms. Garwood's book's index does NOT include Gould's name. a sad indication of modern life's permissive plagiarist mentality? my my. crediting one's source is an age old tradition for a very good reason. we should stick with that method. shame on Ms. Garwood."
48,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/406700-rachel,3,"I think this book has a very important concept that should be more widely discussed about the relationship that Science and Religion share. His concept is call NOMA or non-overlapping magisterial areas. Religion does not dictate the outcome of science and in return science is not to dictate the outcome for religion. I would adhere to his ""NOMA"" principle. I would that more religious people would explore the reality of their belief in relationship to science truths.However, that being said, Mr. Gould seemed to violate the NOMA principle that he was advocating in the same book. He heavily advocated that religion is not to determine the nature of science (e.g. creationism) but on the other hand he seemed to enjoy dictating what the nature of God could not be. Thus violating the principle the book is about. I would have given this one a four stars if he hadn't decided to create a concept only to violate it to justify his own belief (agnostism.)"
49,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93677-patrick,2,"Rock of Ages is an interesting book. Could has a dizzying intellect and an extremely vast knowledge of many scientific topics. The book was actually fine, just not very interesting and very repetitive. He makes his case early on for the clear separation of Religion and Science, and how they each can answer questions within their own discipline, but not in the other. It's actually a relatively obvious point, but he irons out the details and reminds people that even though each resides in its own sphere, they do tend to lie next too each other on several debatable subjects, such as the origin or life. The problem is that extremists tend to want to cross the line and use science to explain religious matters like morality and religion to explain scientific ideas like evolution. The truth is that a person can be both scientific and religious. "
50,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4612919-danika,5,"If only Stephen Jay Gould had outlived Richard Dawkins! In Rocks of Ages, he presents his argument for non-overlapping magisterial, a mode of thought by which science and religion can both be understood to perform vital, related but distinct roles in human life. Non-overlapping magisterial allows science to function fully in discovering the realities of the natural world, while still allowing for religious belief and religion’s role in the formulation of morality and ethics. He also demonstrates, from his own agnostic position, the ability to still be respectful of those who are religious—allowing for a dialogue which Richard Dawkins’ more inflammatory brand of agnosticism precludes. An excellent, intelligent book, far more worth our time than listening to yet another unproductive, polarizing debate between a scientist and representative of fundamentalist Christianity. "
51,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14066150-g-p-plascencia,3,"I read this one in spanish (""Ciencia Vs Religión; un falso conflicto""). Stephen Jay Gould is a good writter. He presented his ideas with good clarity, but he utterly failed to convince me. I can not see how religion could have a ""domain of teaching"" ('magisterium'); teach what, exactly? What could religion possibly assert that other human enterprises (such as philosophy) could not deliver? And all without magical authorities. I think that Gould would like for everybody to get along (don't get me wrong, I do too) but, since when religion gets along with ANYBODY else? Gould tries and fails in placing religion and science as 2 different sides of a same coin of knowledge ('non-overlapping magisteria' he called them), he did not provide any evidence why religion could claim it has anything that other areas of secular human knowledge could not provide."

I agreed with almost everything in it, and recommend the book to anyone interested in a saner take on the issue than we sometimes get."
53,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/682589-james,2,"Gould makes a well constructed argument in favor of the peaceful coexistence of religion and science through mutual mindfulness of the limits of either domain. This book, drawn from his own experience and research (consequently reprising more than a few arguments made in his other works), is a fairly dry read, and very much in a scientist's voice. He does make interesting points, however, especially in the last chapter of the book. Also of interest was his analysis of the Scope's trial and the battle to ban evolution from public school curricula, as well as the dispelling of certain myths involving Columbus and a flat earth.A little repetitive, a little convoluted, a little oversimplified; but worth reading nonetheless.

54,034545040X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6831815-alan,3,"A good try to accept that science and religion can both be true because they are about ""nonoverlapping magisteria"". This would let science and religion coexist since religion will deal with morality and science would deal with the physical world.The idea will always fail with an overwhelming majority of people because some will insist that the stories in religion must be taken as the literal truth. Conversely, many believers in science believe that people should be fair, honest, ethical, etc. but most would not be willing to accept the evil acts that have been justified by religion so they will not be able to embrace those beliefs. Since they choose what to accept and what to reject they aren't really following religious beliefs."

Loved the section on William Jennings Bryan, which was insightful and fair minded, BUT revealed something that I think is inherent in his writing, which is that he is primarily an essay writer. The section on Bryan, it turns out, is adapted from an essay he had written previously (as were other sections in the book). So, even though the book is cogent and argues a single (reasonable though-I-would-have-loved-to-discuss-its-implications-with-him-if-he-were-still-living-because-I-didn't-entirely-agree-with-his-conclusions) thesis, the individual chapters don't necessarily feel like chapters in a book but essays in a collection.

I have nothing but respect for Stephen Jay Gould however this book doesn't fully do the man justice. It is highly repetitive and could be cut in half. The best portion of the book is the section on the history of creationism vs. evolution in the U.S., but the rest is summed up in the forward and simply repeated from there on.

I am a huge fan of this author's writing on science (and other matters such as baseball) and I feel that he makes solid philosophical and sociological points in this book. But overall, I find the book tedious in the manner of all preaching to the choir. Perhaps Gould wrote this book for those who need convincing and they would find it more enlightening. But I suspect that the audience of this book is overwhelmingly comprised by those, like me, who were hoping for something more."

His view: the ""war"" between religion and science is mostly on the fringes. Most of science and religion accept and respect each other. (or at least tolerate) He carefully highlights Pope John Paul II's and the Catholic Church's acceptance of evolution. And tells fascinating personal stories about testifying at the 1981 ""Scopes Trial Two"" that challenged the Arkansas law that evolution and creationism must be taught side by side. He died in 2002, I wonder what he'd think of the political climate in 2012 United States. "

I wonder if those that need to understand the concept of Non-overlapping Magisteria would ever read the book. I think he cited great examples, and explained himself well. I did learn that 1) the flat Earth idea wasn't how we viewed the world in the Middle Ages, we only started to say we did in the 1870's. and 2) that the idea of the conflict of science and religion was a made up idea. Those were both good to know. Seemed like a lot of work for a simple idea. I liked it. I like Stephen Jay Gould. Wouldn't call this his best book, but still interesting. It was worth reading.

Religion will continue make claims about reality that trespass on the turf of science, even if it must frequently amend them. Likewise, I believe science will continue to stretch it's borders, even into the domain of morality & ethics. I'm not saying either side should seek to completely eradicate the other, nor could they hope to. There is a real battle going on, but I don't see an end in sight. No one wants to give up ground, if anything, they want to take more. On that note, go science!"

One wishes this were possible, but science and religion do overlap on certain topics and they cannot both be correct at the same time, unless one embraces cognitive dissonance. I appreciate the moderate philosophical position Gould is trying to take here, but I kind of wish he had stuck to writing about biology and evolution where he is on stronger footing."

I believe that he believes that there is nothing wrong with that, but its certainly not an across the board solution. That said, the sections on creationism were actually pretty fun, and he's a super entertaining writer.
