0,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62787798-bill-gates,5,"For years, I’ve been saying Steven Pinker’s The Better Angels of Our Nature was the best book I’d read in a decade. If I could recommend just one book for anyone to pick up, that was it. Pinker uses meticulous research to argue that we are living in the most peaceful time in human history. I’d never seen such a clear explanation of progress.I’m going to stop talking up Better Angels so much, because Pinker has managed to top himself. His new book, Enlightenment Now, is even better.Enlightenment Now takes the approach he uses in Better Angels to track violence throughout history and applies it to 15 different measures of progress (like quality of life, knowledge, and safety). The result is a holistic picture of how and why the world is getting better. It’s like Better Angels on steroids.I read the book slowly since I loved it so much, but I think most people will find it a quick and accessible read. He manages to share a ton of information in a way that’s compelling, memorable, and easy to digest.It opens with an argument in favor of returning to the ideals of the Enlightenment—an era when reason, science, and humanism were touted as the highest virtues.I’m all for more reason, science, and humanism, but what I found most interesting were the 15 chapters exploring each measure of progress. Pinker is at his best when he analyzes historic trends and uses data to put the past into context. I was already familiar with a lot of the information he shares—especially about health and energy—but he understands each subject so deeply that he’s able to articulate his case in a way that feels fresh and new.I love how he’s willing to dive deep into primary data sources and pull out unexpected signs of progress. I tend to point to things like dramatic reductions in poverty and childhood deaths, because I think they’re such a good measure of how we’re doing as a society. Pinker covers those areas, but he also looks at more obscure topics.Here are five of my favorite facts from the book that show how the world is improving:1. You’re 37 times less likely to be killed by a bolt of lightning than you were at the turn of the century—and that’s not because there are fewer thunderstorms today. It’s because we have better weather prediction capabilities, improved safety education, and more people living in cities.2. Time spent doing laundry fell from 11.5 hours a week in 1920 to an hour and a half in 2014. This might sound trivial in the grand scheme of progress. But the rise of the washing machine has improved quality of life by freeing up time for people—mostly women—to enjoy other pursuits. That time represents nearly half a day every week that could be used for everything from binge-watching Ozark or reading a book to starting a new business.3. You’re way less likely to die on the job. Every year, 5,000 people die from occupational accidents in the U.S. But in 1929—when our population was less than two-fifths the size it is today—20,000 people died on the job. People back then viewed deadly workplace accidents as part of the cost of doing business. Today, we know better, and we’ve engineered ways to build things without putting nearly as many lives at risk.4. The global average IQ score is rising by about 3 IQ points every decade. Kids’ brains are developing more fully thanks to improved nutrition and a cleaner environment. Pinker also credits more analytical thinking in and out of the classroom. Think about how many symbols you interpret every time you check your phone’s home screen or look at a subway map. Our world today encourages abstract thought from a young age, and it’s making us smarter.5. War is illegal. This idea seems obvious. But before the creation of the United Nations in 1945, no institution had the power to stop countries from going to war with each other. Although there have been some exceptions, the threat of international sanctions and intervention has proven to be an effective deterrent to wars between nations.Pinker also tackles the disconnect between actual progress and the perception of progress—something I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about. People all over the world are living longer, healthier, and happier lives, so why do so many think things are getting worse? Why do we gloss over positive news stories and fixate on the negative ones? He does a good job explaining why we’re drawn to pessimism and how that instinct influences our approach to the world, although I wish he went more in depth about the psychology (especially since he’s a psychologist by training). The late Hans Rosling explains this more fully in his excellent new book 
 Factfulness
.I agree with Pinker on most areas, but I think he’s a bit too optimistic about artificial intelligence. He’s quick to dismiss the idea of robots overthrowing their human creators. While I don’t think we’re in danger of a Terminator-style scenario, the question underlying that fear—who exactly controls the robots?—is a valid one. We’re not there yet, but at some point, who has AI and who controls it will be an important issue for global institutions to address.The big questions surrounding automation are proof that progress can be a messy, sticky thing—but that doesn’t mean we’re headed in the wrong direction. At the end of Enlightenment Now, Pinker argues that “we will never have a perfect world, and it would be dangerous to seek one. But there is no limit to the betterments we can attain if we continue to apply knowledge to enhance human flourishing.""The world is getting better, even if it doesn’t always feel that way. I’m glad we have brilliant thinkers like Steven Pinker to help us see the big picture. Enlightenment Now is not only the best book Pinker’s ever written. It’s my new favorite book of all time."
1,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31506695-david-wineberg,3,"You’ve never had it so good, and Steven Pinker has the stats and charts (over 70!) to prove it. Wars are fewer and less severe, homicides are down, racism is in decline, terrorism is a fading fad, democracy rules, communicable diseases and poverty are on their way out. Life expectancy is up, and police are killing fewer people, both black and white. Even the poor have refrigerators. Inequality is a requisite sign of success. So appreciate the wonderful state of affairs you find yourself in. This is the message of Enlightenment Now, with a title that sounds like a protest placard, but which is actually a survey of the world by the statistics that states collect.We’re so “progressive”, we’re beating back entropy itself. Steven Pinker takes 500 pages to create a world where everything is so fabulously much better than it ever has been, that anyone who says different is perpetuating an intellectual lie. This is why it is your enlightenment. The book is an endless, uplifting editorial. If you’re buying.He’s at his best criticizing politics and science. He shows precisely how our biases prejudice our most thoughtful conclusions, and bemoans the lack of respect for science and the humanities. He says science is presented in some schools as “just another narrative, or myth”. Humanities are in danger of extinction, and they are critical to progress.Pinker has a nice tendency to support his arguments with examples and charts. Unfortunately, he balances this with a tendency to ignore states or countries that don’t conform to his claims, and he swings numbers around to make them look better. He claims when he measures what people consume as opposed to what they earn, the poverty rate in the USA is 3%. So really, everyone is thriving. Even if they’re visibly not. I fully realize Pinker is untouchable and slated for sainthood, but many things he says don’t add up, and a lot of it is just outrageous on its face. Let him speak for himself:-On war: “Virtually every acre of land that was conquered after 1928 has been returned to the state that lost it.” (Something must have happened in 1927 for him to pick 1928, but he doesn’t say). Where do you even begin to refute this? Kaliningrad? Mauritania? The South China Sea? Crimea? Donbass? Palestine?-He defends the demolition of the middle classes in the West. Yes, a hundred million Americans are worse off. But a billion Chinese are better off. “The tradeoff is worth it,” he says. That the extremely rich got fabulously more rich is fine with him, too. -On terrorism’s “decline”, Pinker points to recently low numbers of victim deaths to show how safe we really are. He doesn’t mention all the freedom of movement, assembly and privacy we have lost to the terrorists. He’s satisfied they don’t kill that much, and that they will eventually fade away. -On the mellowing of war: “Weapons don’t come into existence just because they are conceivable or physically possible.” Yes, they do. And worse, everything can be weaponized, from food to mouseclicks. Pinker goes even further, claiming “most historians” don’t think the atomic bombings caused Japan to surrender in three days, but rather it was the potential of Russia turning its attention from west to east.-There is a great deal of nonsense about how much cheaper life is today. The provision of a light indoors would have cost the equivalent of £40,000 in the middle ages (if anyone could read), while today, lights cost fractions of pennies. And 100 years ago it took 1800 hours’ work to afford a refrigerator (among too many more such examples). But Pinker never bothers with the other side of the coin. That today, everyone must spend $150 a month on cable, $125 on phone (after purchasing a phone every two years, with each costing more than the fridge), a $20,000 car, a mortgage, and $50,000 in school debt (none of which were factors in the cost of living in the middle ages ) or be unable to function in society. His endless comparisons are pointless.-He keeps repeating that because even the poor have flush toilets and refrigerators, they are much better off today than ever. He says even the fabulously wealthy Rothschilds didn’t have a washing machine like nearly everyone (80%) now supposedly has. Pinker dismisses ecology as a pastime of the affluent. The more educated and wealthy we become, the more eco-conscious we become, so everything works out. He completely ignores the fact we have crossed the red line. That the oceans are toxic, that there is trash and plastic everywhere, that the carbon levels are at unseemly record levels. That the Paris Accord has not dented the damage one bit. But, he says, the air over London is no longer purple every day. The book ends with an interminable bashing of religion, which Pinker considers “intellectually bankrupt”. He cites all the usual contradictions and hypocrisy, narrow-mindedness and longing for a cleaner era that never existed. Basically, religion and enlightenment are oil and water.So you can look at Enlightenment Now in two ways, according to your own various biases. Either the greater message of positivism is too important (and correct) to criticize Pinker’s maddening claims, or the maddening claims make the whole exercise suspect.David Wineberg"
2,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,1,"When this book was not boring me it was irritating me. All of the author’s anecdotes I had read elsewhere. Science is good. I don’t need convincing. Vaccines work. Poverty is bad and is getting better throughout the world. Everyone who wants to know this stuff already knows it.Why equate Al Gore with Theodore Kaczynski (The Unabomber) as the author seems to do regarding the environment? Is Fox News really right when they said the poor can’t be poor because they have cell phones and air conditioning today? The author defended that absurdity though he doesn’t mention that Fox used to argue that when Obama was president. And why did the author make a false equivalence between Bernie Sanders and Trump? Sanders didn’t believe ‘climate change is a Chinese Hoax’, or pick someone in his cabinet who thinks vaccines cause autism, or wanted to build a wall and claim Mexico will pay for it, or feed our hate against Muslims, Browns, Asians or anyone who strikes his fancy for the day even kneeling football players. This author always seemed to have some pie in the sky anti-humanist post-modernist Strawman he was easily demolishing for some reason I couldn’t figure out. He mentioned the in-gratitude were in the 9th circle of hell and implied Dante had a point and people most of us have never heard of such as Heidegger, Adorno, and Neitzsche, and I think he also mentioned Marcuse belonged there for their in-gratitude. (I’m going to venture a guess, since I didn’t read all of the book: the author doesn’t like ‘identity politics’ and gets bothered by ‘political correctness’ and thinks ‘both sides’ are to blame. I don’t know if that’s where he was going, but I wasn’t going to find out by wading thru a familiar story I’ve read better told in other books).The author is completely out of his depth on economics and inequality. I suggest you read Piketty’s book instead of this author’s poorly constructed deconstruction of Piketty’s wonderful book, and then tell me again why inequality is not real or not a big deal! His Enlightenment and Romanticism knowledge seemed superficial. Of the 8 or so Voltaire quips he provided, I had heard them all elsewhere. I stopped this book after 5 hours. I got my credit back from Audible. I seldom do that. This author was teaching me nothing I didn’t already know, and worse than that seemed to have a disregard for the truth by trying to defend his own thesis beyond what the facts would take a reasonable person."
3,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,1,"This concoction and Roslings´ similar „Go on, everything is super.“ Factfulness were the reasons for me to leave the soft space of some humanities that are nothing more than appeasement, belittlement, and deception. A mix of different quotes from the book and thoughts and impressions I had while consuming this fairytale. Some points might be redundant, sorry for that, but this is what happens when taking notes about a book that is nonsense: 1.	He´s attacking the ones who aren´t grateful, says everything is fine, takes the premise that because some things became better everything is great, based on unbearable pseudoscience. 2.	Hey, what about talking just about the positive things and avoiding anything negative or controversial?3.	Of course, there is only the great Western way of living, capitalism ineluctably always leads to the best society in the world.4.	If some things have become better thanks to technology in the last hundred years, there is of course everything great and no more problems with anything. 5.	Wait a moment, what exactly is Pinkers´ legitimation to talk about those topics, he must be an expert, maybe a unique ingenious polymath, in many different fields to make serious prognosis, not just assumptions, no even certainties about the whole society and the future? Oh yes, he is a linguist and cognitive psychologist that wrote some good works in his field and thought after that: „Hm, why not write some happy go lucky books based on nothing except what media, government, and the economy want me to highlight to boost my sales.“6.	One of the funniest things about such books is that they are close to impossible to suss if one has not read some progressive, alternative literature in contrast to what is permanently repeated in mainstream media and science.7.	Sweatshops aren´t that bad.8.	Capitalism already solved and will solve the few, little problems it created. Sure, a problem repairs the problems it creates instead of creating greater problems.9.	He finds the fact that people call humans under the current economic system a malady to the planet evil, discriminating, hateful, and wrong, although it´s the truth.10.	He is biased, does the ultimate replication crisis demonstration.11.	Philosophical, out of context, bla yada drivel that isn´t even close to the real philosophers, but fine tuned and modified to fit to the agenda and dogma of this book.12.	„Peak car“. Why, show me the extrapolations.13.	He ignores so much hard based science that doesn´t fit to the conclusions he wants that it´s hard to endure.14.	He states that richer states have less environmental pollutions and get cleaner. So let´s go jogging in an industrial center and go swimming in the local lake afterward. Who survives can pick some berries and vegetables grown outdoors and will be gone soon too. 15.	He compares the environmental protection movement with extremists, calling it „misanthropic environmentalism“. He does as if the wide consense about habitat destruction and the sixth extinction doesn´t exist and compares it to pessimistic people who spread viral fake news ideas.16.	He loves to use those techniques:17.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaga...18.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychol...19.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_m...20.	He praises science, knowledge, wisdom, creativity, intelligence as wordy as possible while being an ignorant apologist for the perfect, current system, ignoring and attacking any other opinion than his own.21.	His arrogance, joviality, condescension, and belittlement in his writing and in interviews are disgusting.22.	There is no problem with distributive justice, everything is fine because so many people aren´t extremely poor anymore, but now just poor or close to poverty.23.	He talks about ideas, concepts, humanities, avoiding anything substantial, profound, and hard science-based.24.	He and Rosling have the same concept: „Look, stupid people of the world, here is the manipulated data you are too dumb to understand in the way I want you to understand it, so let me explain it you while warmongering and hate trolling against anything that doesn´t confirm my opinion.“25.	He keeps repeating general knowledge about many things that have improved, stating that it will continue to get better. 26.	He picks any person, anecdote, or fact out of context to mostly demonstrate a pro capitalistic world-view. 27.	He knows everything about the climate, he is a weather God. Nobody else, thousands of scientists aren´t sure what will happen with climate change, global warming, how earths´ systems and the sun really function, and how bad it will become, but Pinker knows that everything will be fine now, in 100 years, always and forever. The sun always tells him how it will shine. 28.	„Combat poverty instead of reducing inequality.“ Of course, give a man a fish a day instead of showing him how to angle or allowing him at least to fish, but the lake and the sea are privatized, sorry. Give tiny parts of wealth to the poor instead of changing a dysfunctional system.29.	Overconsumption and consumerism are absolutely no problems, we should just reduce the environmental damage it does by…magic and positive thinking and not listening to the lies those pesky pessimists are telling.30.	In this so called age of new enlightenment anything progressive, alternative, or different of the dogmas is deemed a conspiracy theory. He got me, I also never quote or show the hard facts, links, I am inventing any review because the secret reptilian overlords are telling me to do it, I am completely bonkers because I am a dirty leftist inventing conspiracy theories about military industrial complexes and post democracy and you don´t want to know what else, it´s terrible for the kids.31.	The compulsion to have a positive mentality of being mindful, calm, meditating, and not negative and pessimistic. Forced happiness without reason and logic.32.	Much talk about the sock puppets of politics he doesn´t like, no meta analysis or mentioning of the puppetmasters or politicians he likes.33.	Extremism is caused by a power vacuum of disinterest in politics and the ideals that made democracy so great and it´s the peoples´ fault who are used to this and don´t appreciate it and has nothing to do with the system.34.	He calls marxism a pseudo fringe science. Oh wait, and of course, because of this socialism is pseudo too and capitalism is based on hard science or what? 35.	He doesn´t understand that faith and dictatorships that were criticized by the thinkers of the true enlightenment have been turned in our economic system that does exactly the same, but more perfidious and mendacious. And that he´s actively attacking and denying the thesis of the ones who work for a new enlightenment.36.	Truth can´t be constructed. Wait, why do you do it yourself Mr Pinker, if it´s impossible?37.	He uses data, sources, graphs, statistics out of context or out of unscientific sources, sometimes relating to just one article, book, study, that is highly controversial.38.	He bashes anything left or progressive in science, education, and universities, but doesn´t mention the overwhelming right-conservative majority in politics, governments, and economics with a single word.39.	Black people are not more likely to be shot by police than white people in the US.40.	He is great at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular....41.	The evil news media are always hyping about crises and problems that don´t really exist.42.	He says that there is far less violence (for privileged people in rich states and rich people in poor countries), but he should ask a prison inmate, the impoverished population of Western countries or the poor majority of the worlds´ population in Afrika, Asia, and Latin Amerika. I am sure that they are enthusiastic about the fact that there are fewer wars driven by political and economic interests of wealthy nations and they now just have to deal with crime, starvation, illness, extreme poverty and violence, and very low life expectancy. Oh, and of course with the regular financial crisis, land grabbing, and trade wars fought on and for their territory.43.	„The rate of extinctions has been reduced by 75 %.“ What, I thought the contrary was the case and that we don´t even know how many species we exterminate on a daily basis because we don´t know how many exist.44.	Osama bin Laden owned a copy of a Chomsky book. So left, socialist, ecosocial is the devil, don´t you understand?45.	Progressivism, activism, scientific results he doesn´t like, are described as useless. 46.	He is switching his opinions, saying that something is bad if it´s a point he doesn´t like, changing to great about the same thing, institution, philosophical concept, science, if it´s something he likes, mixing it with psychobabble and worst bad pseudo fringe science lying with statistics stuff. And he doesn´t even seem to recognize that he is contradicting himself because the book is a collection of such inconsistencies, it´s not even logical drivel.47.	He is not even mentioning that some of his crude theories could be wrong, as any good scientist I´ve read does in humility and self- criticism, instead, he deems himself all knowing and is vilifying any opposition, using subtle hate speech.It´s so bizarre because of the combination of points I´ve already mentioned: He is no specialist in any of the fields the talks about and it would need a few of them to draw a realistic and objective picture. Or at least an author who does his research and combines all points to an objective overview. Instead, he believes to reach god mode by combining cherrypicking, mentioned replication crisis, wrong attacks against anyone saying he is wrong, integrating anectotism instead of long-time data, and mixing it up to a numbing phantasmagoria of an idyllic world that is, in reality, breaking in pieces. What shocks me the most and what is the worst thing a scientist can do, is that he integrates this hallucinations in the minds of intelligent, literate, educated people who infect others with this viral garbage, so that they stop activism and avoid progressive, alternative thinking and real, productive contentions about the topic, instead telling each other how great Pinker is and which of his amazing, brilliant ideas they find most astonishing. Possibly they should combine it with Roslings´ pseudo Factfulness for the full dosage of brainwashing and leave reality forever.It´s sad that Pinker started as a real scientist with his first books and switched to writing disinformation nonsense with „The better angels of our nature“, that seems so follow the same pattern of empty yada bla gossip. He quickly got richer, but lost his reputation forever.Alternative economists and political scientists with ideas that could really change the world aren´t read because of stuff like this. Continued in the comments, because there is no space left here."

5,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may,3,"Steven Pinker makes a strong argument for enlightenment principles and, essentially, not giving up on the world because Donald Trump is president. We are not, contrary to popular belief, going backwards, and have in fact made astounding progress in all measurable areas, such as wealth, health, safety, education and equality.Faced with the numbers, it's hard to disagree, though I went into this fairly convinced already. We do not, by any measure, live in a great world, but we do live in a better world than we did fifty, one hundred, one thousand years ago. Pinker presents this information, using charts and tables, in this extensively-researched book.However, some of his claims are not really backed up by the evidence, either because he uses limited sources or engages in some avoiding the issue fallacies. The lengthy breakdown of how much things cost compared to how much they cost in, say, the Middle Ages, is irrelevant to the discussion of wealth because Pinker doesn't consider new kinds of expenses - mortgages, insurance, electric, gas and phone bills (etc.). I also looked up a couple of the references he uses and now I'm skeptical about the others. One example I checked on was his source for the claim that black people are no more likely to be shot by police than white people in America. Obviously, this is a hot topic and a controversial claim to make. His single source for such a bold claim - here - actually found that black people were more likely to be shot by police than white people, but offered an opinion as to why this might be. Other pieces disagree.He arrives at a number of these grand conclusions based on a single article, which is often an opinion piece. He cherry-picks information to suit his argument and relies on the unlikelihood that anyone will go check his sources. It's a shame, to be honest, because I think the central argument is a strong one: that we are indeed making progress. There's a whole lot to suggest that the world isn't going to hell in a handbasket. But Pinker actually risks fuelling a bleak opposite of societal pessimism. While I don't disagree that we are faced with a lot of doom-foreshadowing news stories, there is also an ever-growing misconception that inequality is over. That our society is colourblind and that women are now treated no different to men. Pinker's distortion of facts often supports this theory and it is incorrect.Things are, overall, getting better, but over-exaggerating the extent to which improvements have been made does not help anyone. Well, other than making rich white men feel better about the state of the world they rule over.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"
6,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"A few months ago, I heard Steven Pinker give a talk about this book. I must say that his speaking skill did not impress me. However, his writing skill is brilliant. This is a very important book--epic in scope, comprehensive, well thought-out and structured, incredibly well researched, and full of some very important messages.The book begins with a student's question ""Why should I live?"" To which Pinker answers with a profound interpretation of the ""meaning of life"". I won't repeat his complete answer, but he writes,  [You have] the ability to like, love, respect, help and show kindness--and you can enjoy the gift of mutual benevolence with friends, family, and colleagues ... You can foster the welfare of other sentient beings by enhancing life, health, knowledge, freedom, abundance, safety, beauty, and peace. Pinker writes that the Enlightenment helped us escape from superstition and ignorance. It increased our understanding of ourselves through science. Also, Humanism is a secular foundation for morality. And, it is individuals who are sentient, not the tribe. The Enlightenment helped to abolish cruel punishments and slavery. Also, Humanism helped bring about an increase in peace.The Enlightenment has helped to eradicate some terrible diseases. Science is the most unambiguous achievement by mankind. Science helped to eradicate smallpox, a painful and disfiguring disease that killed 300 million people in the 20th century. And, we have forgotten that on April 12, 1955, ""people observed moments of silence, rang bells, honked horns, ... took the day off, closed schools, ... and forgave enemies."" That was the day that Jonas Salk's polio vaccine was declared to be safe. Pinker extols the virtues of genetic engineering, that can accomplish in days what farmers accomplished over millennia, and what Norman Borlaug took years of ""mind-warping tedium"" to accomplish. Hundreds of studies, every major health and science organization, and over a hundred Nobel laureates have testified to the safety of transgenic crops. Nevertheless, some traditional environment groups persist in denying them to the world.I just loved this quote from the book: In 1976, Mao single-handedly and dramatically changed the direction of global poverty with one simple act: he died.Pinker devotes chapters to improvements in the environment, and the problem of climate change. He shows that there is virtually no dissension among scientists that climate change, and specifically global warming, is a significant problem. However, he is optimistic that these issues can, in principle be solved by courageous governmental action.The book describes the growth of democracy around the world--not steadily, but in waves. Democratic countries have higher rates of economic growth, fewer wars and genocides, better-educated citizens, and almost no famines. The best reason for democracy, stated by Karl Popper, is that it is a solution to the problem of how to dismiss bad leadership without bloodshed. And, it gives people the freedom to complain.Pinker shows how disbelief in human-caused climate change is not correlated with scientific illiteracy, but is due to allegiance to values held by one's social circle. Political tribalism is decried as the most insidious form of irrationality today. And this tribalism exists on the left and the right sides of the political spectrum. Pinker writes, American conservative politics has become steadily more know-nothing, from Ronald Reagan to Dan Quayle to George W. Bush to Sarah Palin to Donald Trump. Pinker lists all of the ways in which President Trump has resisted progress, and backtracks to a less advanced way of life: Reversal of health care, reversal of globalism, reversal in the growth of wealth, reversal of the environment, safety, law and order, international trade, equal rights, tolerance, and the judicial system. The president has all the hallmarks of a dictator; he is impulsive and vindictive. The last chapter of the book is about humanism; the chapter starts out well, but then briefly becomes too philosophical and abstract for my taste. Then the chapter returns to a more accessible, concrete structure. It becomes obvious that Pinker is an atheist. He writes that the ""existence of the God of scripture is a perfectly testable scientific hypothesis."" And, he list some experiments that could be performed to test the hypothesis. He also shows how the religiosity of nations, and even from region-to-region within the United States, is inversely related to happiness and well being. The United States, being more religious on the whole than West European countries, has higher homicide rates, abortion, STD's, child mortality, obesity, educational mediocrity, and premature deaths. And, Pinker points out that non-religious people in the U.S. tend not to vote--that helps explain why we have Trump in office today.This is such a fascinating book; it takes up arguments where his earlier book The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined leaves off. This is the seventh book that I have read by Steven Pinker--and this one is just as wonderful as his previous books."
7,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,5,"Everyone should read Enlightenment Now. It seems odd to require a defense of reason, science, humanism and progress, but we suffer if we do not understand how far humanity has come by application of these principles. Steven Pinker has done us the favor of chronicling that progress, with data, in a compellingly written volume that challenges common assumptions. The news cycle and many prominent intellectuals would have us think that the world is becoming a darker, scarier place; yet the opposite is true. While pessimism makes for good news coverage and stokes political fires, denying progress causes us to mistrust the systems we've put in place. Combine that mistrust with a lack of understanding of WHY we put those systems in place, and you get setbacks like a Trump presidency, a burgeoning flat earther movement, and anti-vaccine advocacy. Acknowledging humanity's successes is not foolishly optimistic or defeatist; rather, it should inspire us to work toward an even better future, because we know our efforts will not be in vain. This is not a Panglossian ""best of all possible worlds""; rather, it is ackowledgement that we live in the best world... SO FAR. A quote from Barack Obama summarizes this view: ""If you had to choose a moment in history to be born, and you did not know ahead of time who you would be - you didn't know whether you were going to be born into a wealthy family or a poor family, what country you'd be born in, whether you were going to be a man or a woman - if you had to choose blindly what moment you'd want to be born, you'd choose now.""This account of progress plays out on a variety of quantifiable measures, and it's not just good news for denizens of first world countries. Pinker is careful to tease apart the trends that typically begin in developed countries and then spread globally. Average life expectancy worldwide was stalled at 30 years until the late 1800s, but has now skyrocketed to 71. Child mortality has plummeted. ""For an American woman, being pregnant a century ago was almost as dangerous as having breast cancer today."" Infectious diseases are being driven to extinction (and many already have). Caloric intake has increased across the world, even as population continues to grow, to the point that in many countries the poorest people are over-fed rather than under-fed. Undernourishment is fast becoming a thing of the past, and famines are now incredibly rare and lack the destructive potential of their predecessors even a century ago. All people are becoming, on average, wealthier (wealth inequality is a separate topic that is also addressed, but the trend is still positive across the world), and have more disposable income and opportunities to learn and travel. Literacy has grown, and with it IQ. Work hours have decreased, and child labor is in steep decline. Violence and death are down across almost every single measure (as Pinker detailed in another book, The Better Angels of Our Nature, and expands on here). Representative government has spread to a majority of the world's countries and individuals. These improvements, surprisingly, also play out in sustainability (a chapter in particular that challenged many of my assumptions), energy use, pollution, and population growth. Pinker is no Pollyana: he does carefully address some of our most pressing problems, namely climate change and the threat of nuclear war. Even for these serious quandaries, he provides cause for optimism and some potential answers.All these charts and trends have ragged trajectories that dip and rise along their paths. None of these improvements come all-at-once or unceasingly. As Pinker says, that would be magic... and science isn't magic. There are reasons for these improvements - and those reasons can be applied to solving new problems. Pinker also unpacks the importance of appealing to reason, the power of scientific thinking, and a basis for secular morality that transcends religious identity. He identifies and argues against the worldviews that oppose the ideals of the Enlightenment. This is a long book, but it is important, timely, and a delight to read."

This book will no doubt earn the author a lanyard to every corporate boardroom and conservative think tank in the country.His thesis is that Enlightenment principles must be defended – but not against mindless consumerism, not against the growing disparities of wealth, not against the disruption of earth systems. No, the Enlightenment must be defended against The Strawman. The author lets the cat out early in the book: “Intellectuals hate progress” [p.39]. Later, Pinker says: “An axiom of progressive opinion, especially in universities, is that we continue to live in a deeply racist, sexist, and homophobic society – which would imply that progressivism is a waste of time, having accomplished nothing at decades of struggle” (p.215). Did your jaw just drop, too? This is a recurring theme in the book – binary positions. If you feel that we have a ways to go regarding bigotry, then you are just not appreciative enough of the gains: intellectuals and progressives are anti-Enlightenment. Just five pages later, he says that “heightened concern … is not futile moralizing but has brought measurable progress – which means that continuing this concern can lead to greater progress still” (p.220). Yes, the idea of progressive thinking is that maintaining a heightened level of concern can motivate greater gains towards Enlightenment ideals – unless, that is, you are an 'intellectual' who, when maintaining a heightened level of concern, is just being unappreciative of the meaty bone the status quo has already thrown you.Pinker says “police shoot too many people, but it’s not primarily a racial issue”. I wonder if the number of people who are shot with their empty hands in the air is a racial issue - maybe a nice chart on that one would be interesting. Maybe he should interview groups of people who live in fear of the police – of being carded while walking, of being stopped on the road because of their appearance.In his effort to make all of his graphs show diminishing bads over time, he has to fudge GHG emissions to show GHG emissions / GDP. This is a favourite trick of those who wish to delay any meaningful efforts to face climate change – the atmosphere doesn't care how many goods and services an economy creates. Emissions are continuing to increase as our economy expands. Diluting this value with a GDP measure of ‘dematerialized’ services is more of an indicator of what public and personal work has been devoured by The Market than anything to do with emissions. In plain words, it is disingenuous.Probably the most distressing aspect of this book is Pinker’s unwillingness to engage in a meaningful critique of left intellectuals who he seems to despise. His references to them involve either gross, dog-whistle caricatures, the butt of a Russian peasant joke, or a cheap pot shot – Osama Bin Laden owned a copy of a book by Noam Chomsky … really?! Who cares? And then he misrepresents Deconstruction and post-modernism as the heartbeat of anti-Enlightenment thought, heirs of the anti-rational Romantic thinkers of the past. Any ‘intellectual’ who explores truth-making (like the Continental philosophers) or challenges the big, empty narratives around freedom, truth, right, etc. becomes anti-rational. Then Pinker unloads the big cliché that you can’t make a rational statement about ‘truth’ being socially constructed, which to Pinker means that what is meant is that there is no truth (binary thinking again), and therefore anti-rational – for a page or two he dances around the logical impossibility of making a rational statement about an anti-rationalist position … as if anyone really holds this position. But when it comes to his tribe, he says in italics: “no Enlightenment thinker ever claimed that humans were consistently rational”. It’s surprising that author could not see that this sentiment cuts both ways? Eg. ‘no postmodernist thinker ever claimed that humans were consistently irrational’ … “The left, too, has missed the boat in its contempt for the market and its romance with Marxism.” What does this even mean? What ‘Marxism’ – the critique of capital? I think this is most revealing, as Pinker dodges any reference to capitalism, or more accurately, a critique of capitalism. The ‘romance with Marxism’ is a sign of Enlightenment principles at work, as opposed to a dogmatic adherence to Capitalism as the best system in the past, and by extrapolation the best system forever. In addition to this bias, Pinker is quick to point out what he considers bad about ‘communist or leftist’ governments, without evaluating their successes and failures on the same principled measures as he applies throughout the book: for example, rather than a chauvinistic dismissal of Venezuela under Chavez, measure his gains or failures in child mortality, longevity, homicides, poverty, literacy and so on. He critiques the numbers of ‘left-intellectuals’ in the academy – a place where ambiguity, honest analysis, and critique is fostered – but doesn’t conduct a similar survey of the ratio of left-to-right thinkers in positions of power - in public office or corporate boardrooms, not to mention the academy. Later, during his analysis of Islam, he quotes ‘ex-Muslim activist Sarah Haider’ who says: “'Religions are just ideas and don’t have rights.' Criticizing the ideas of Islam is no more bigoted than criticizing the ideas of neoliberalism or the Republican Party Platform” (p.442). I wonder if he feels this way about other, non-Muslim, faith-based states in the region – replace ‘Islam’ with another faith and I wonder what sort of reception his book would have received.I could go on and on, as every page packs a groaner. Overall, Pinker loses the gist of his thesis in a stew of gross generalizations and what I would consider a contempt for the Enlightenment project as it relates to preserving open discussion of ideals and efforts against the reification of power-structures and narratives that hinder progress. Has humanity come a long way? Sure – who really doubts that? Do we have more work to do? Yes we do – but you wouldn’t feel any urgency to do so from this book.Pinker says: “Instead, their reputations hinge on their ability to entertain, titillate, or shock; on their ability to instill confidence or fear (in the hopes that a prophecy might be self-fulfilling or self-defeating); and on their skill in galvanizing a coalition and celebrating its virtue.” I would say this is a good description of the author of Enlightenment Now.Just to be clear: I didn't like this book."
9,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5856054-alex-macmillan,2,"In his newest book, (Neoliberalism) Now: The Case for (Positivism), Scien(tism), (Atheism), and (Globalization), Steven Pinker seeks to cash in on the Trump election by rushing out what is mostly a rehash of material from his previous book, The Better Angels of Our Nature. His method of reasoning and tone of argument seeks to preach to the choir rather than persuade the unaffiliated. Unlike his classic works, The Blank Slate and The Sense of Style, this book will not be something we return to decades from now, except as a time capsule into the conventional wisdom of Economist-reading Davos attendees during the early 21st century. The book is divided into three parts: Part I: This would make a great TedTalk. Part II: Where it doesn't lift entire sections from Better Angels, this is Pinker's longwinded literature review of the work of economic historians. If you are interested in learning about humanity's recent exponential growth in material wellbeing, there are much better books on the subject that I highly recommend to you instead, such as Bourgeois Dignity, The Rational Optimist, The Ultimate Resource, or The Skeptical Environmentalist.Part III: Pinker uses pop psychology to pathologize anyone who disagrees with him politically. (He strangely criticizes social science departments for lacking ideological diversity only a few pages after having relied on the studies produced by these same departments to smugly dismiss opposing viewpoints.) Pinker's key syllogism appears to be that ""If you're not a global citizen who completely prioritizes humanity's material wellbeing over the interests of your community or country, then you're a benighted bigot, as whatever maximizes global utility is progress.""Pinker's strawman of what constitutes ""progress"" (who isn't in favor of progress?) allows him to avoid having to seriously contend with the core anxieties about the pace of globalization that underlie populist movements on the left and right. For example, his chapter about rising economic inequality has an elephant-shaped graph showing how globalization has occurred at the expense of people in developed nations who lack college degrees. This fact suggests a rational basis for Sanders and Trump supporters to intuit that the idea of ""a common market, with open markets and open borders"" may have reached the point of diminishing returns. Pinker does not have a rejoinder to the arguments of cultural pessimists like Charles Murray other than that governments should further expand the welfare state to compensate the losers from free trade. Pinker's hoped-for future where the majority of Americans are living on the dole, mollified by painkillers and online entertainment, is not ""progress,"" no matter what Pinker and other technophiles may think."

13,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9628169-charles-j,3,"As with Steven Pinker’s earlier ""The Better Angels of Our Nature,"" of which this is really an expansion and elucidation, I was frustrated by this book. On the one hand, Pinker is an able thinker and clear writer, free of much of the ideological cant and distortions of vision that today accompany most writing about society (for society is what this book is about), and he is mostly not afraid to follow his reasoning to its conclusions. His data on human progress is voluminous, persuasive, and extremely interesting. On the other hand, Pinker regularly makes gross errors about history, some of little import, but some that undermine the entire thesis of his book—which is that that the Enlightenment is the sole cause of the human progress he illustrates.I like Pinker for his clarity of mind. And since I have been reading a steady diet of books whose central claim is that the Enlightenment was a mistake, and moreover I am personally enamored of Reaction, the idea of creating a new thing by reference to the old, it is only fair that I consider the opposite ideas presented as well as possible. Moreover, this book claims to answer exactly a current question of mine—is the material marvel that is the modern world the child of the Enlightenment? I was not disappointed; this book is just what the doctor ordered, at least to clarify my own thoughts, though probably not with the result Pinker intended. He wants to prove the Enlightenment is responsible for everything that is good in the modern world, and every good thing that will be in the future, but he ends up, for the most part, refuting himself on all his key claims. Still, the ride is interesting enough and that alone makes his book worth reading.On the second page of his book, Pinker enunciates the core of his argument, by referring to “the Enlightenment principle that we can apply reason and sympathy to enhance human flourishing.” The next sentence, by implication, defines the Enlightenment further as “the ideals of reason, science, humanism, and progress.” The following paragraph says the Enlightenment is “also called humanism, the open society, and cosmopolitan or classical liberalism.” All this creates a somewhat confused definition, but once you read the whole book, it’s evident that to Pinker, the middle sentence is the key—the Enlightenment consists in the primacy to human societies of “reason, science, humanism, and progress.” His book revolves around these four concepts, and we will return to each of these concepts in turn.Pinker divides his book into three parts. The first, shortest, part expands on what Pinker means by “the Enlightenment.” Here, Pinker begins by turning to the driver of all the progress that he details at great length later in the book, namely, the Scientific Revolution. “The Enlightenment is conventionally placed in the last two-thirds of the 18th century, though it flowed out of the Scientific Revolution and the Age of Reason in the 17th century.” Given that the term “Age of Reason” is only used in one other place in this book, at the very end in a similar context, while the terms “Enlightenment” and “Scientific Revolution” are used continuously, it seems fair to conclude that Pinker believes that the Scientific Revolution (actually beginning in the 1500s, and possibly earlier, not “in the 17th century”) was the necessary first step that combined with the Enlightenment to produce the benefits of the modern world. Pinker reinforces this conclusion by summarizing the modern understanding of scientific progress to include entropy, evolution, and information. Grasping these three underlying drivers of scientific progress, Pinker tells us, allows a more complete approach to scientific understanding, and thus of the Enlightenment.All this is true. The problem with this definition of the Enlightenment, though, is that it is all about the Scientific Revolution, from its inception to today, and when you look closely at it, has nothing to do with the Enlightenment. The Scientific Revolution led to technology, which ultimately (with some other drivers that are endlessly debated) led to the Industrial Revolution, which created nearly all the progress Pinker spends the second part of his book documenting. But this eliding of the Enlightenment with the Scientific Revolution is the fatal error of Pinker’s entire book—every chapter, and practically every page, is shot through with it. Pinker claims for the Enlightenment, a system of political and philosophical principles with a nearly exclusive focus on increasing liberty, the advantages of created by the Scientific Revolution, a pre-Enlightenment happening whose success, and whose single-handed creation of the modern world, had essentially nothing to do with the Enlightenment. Pinker does this because he wishes to advocate for Enlightenment principles (in particular, emancipation and atheism), but justify those principles almost wholly by reference to the achievements of the Scientific Revolution. This is a neat parlor trick, but intellectually dishonest. I cannot tell whether Pinker realizes the dishonesty, or merely has wandered so far into the weeds he cannot think clearly. In either case, the effect is to make some parts of the book fascinating, and others risible.There are many, many claimed reasons for why the Industrial Revolution occurred, and why it only occurred in the West. But no serious historian claims that it was the Enlightenment that caused the Industrial Revolution, which is no doubt why Pinker glosses over the supposed linkage and offers no citations tying the Enlightenment to the Industrial Revolution (or, for that matter, to the Scientific Revolution). For a man dedicated to carefully parsing the evidence and linking causal chains through reasoning, this is a glaring omission. Fortunately for the reader, though, these first philosophical musings, or ramblings, only take up the first thirty-five pages of the book. The next 300 are an endless, and endlessly fascinating, series of statistical analyses about various forms of (mostly material) progress. In the final sixty pages, the last third of the book, Pinker returns to philosophy, attempting to synthesize the progress he has demonstrated with his other claimed keystones of the modern world, reason, science, and humanism.Pinker’s basic point about progress is a broadening of his claims about peace in ""The Better Angels of Our Nature""—that those who think the world is getting worse are wrong, not (mostly) from malice, but from various forms of psychological bias, such as the “Optimism Gap” (people see their own lives as better than other people’s); “Availability Bias” (we make decisions based on data easily available to us, which is often weighted toward the negative); and “Negativity Bias” (it’s easier to imagine how things could be dramatically worse than how they could be dramatically better). To prove this, Pinker offers fourteen separate chapters, each covering a totally different area of progress, demonstrating that since the Scientific Revolution human conditions have gotten better.Pinker starts with Life—he shows how life expectancy, both at birth and at later periods of life, has dramatically increased over time—or, rather, since the Industrial Revolution in the West, and since the early twentieth century in much of the rest of the world. Next is Health, to much the same effect. In both chapters, Pinker relies heavily on Nobel Prize-winner Angus Deaton’s ""The Great Escape,"" a fascinating book. But Pinker’s philosophical confusion shows up every time he makes other than statistical claims—for example, he tells us that “Deaton notes that even the idea that lies at the core of the Enlightenment—knowledge can make us better off—may come as a revelation” to some (i.e., the non-Western) parts of the world. There are two problems with this. First, that is not the “idea that lies at the core of the Enlightenment,” it is in an idea that, in the West, far pre-dated the Enlightenment, as I discuss further below. More to the immediate point, that’s not what Deaton says (since I have a copy of his book, I checked). What Deaton actually says is that people in poor countries are often satisfied with their health, not knowing it can be better. He saying nothing about the Enlightenment, or knowledge in general. Unfortunately, such appeals to authority are common in Pinker’s book (surprising, since appeal to authority has been identified as a basic logical fallacy for millennia), and when the authority is mis-cited, it makes matters worse. (The reader’s suspicion is further exacerbated by Pinker’s frequent habit of not offering page cites, just footnotes to books as a whole, though he does give a page cite to Deaton’s book.)Anyway, Pinker next turns to food (Sustenance), where he again talks about the Scientific Revolution (including its modern continuation in Norman Borlaug’s Green Revolution) feeding the world, and then tries to claim that it was an accomplishment of the Enlightenment, and failure to feed people as shown by Stalin’s terror famines was because (supposed) Enlightenment values weren’t honored. That’s a stretch. Next is wealth, where Pinker focuses on GDP per capita, showing the takeoff since the Industrial Revolution in the West and more recently in some Asian countries, and the reductions in extreme poverty in other countries that have not experienced the same kind of takeoff.Following is Inequality, which Pinker acutely and subtly analyzes (channeling Thomas Sowell in some cases—you can tell that Pinker is, in many areas, broad-minded by the several times he cites Sowell for different propositions, since Sowell is anathema to doctrinaire leftists). Then Environment, noting that other than global warming, the environment is doing just fine and shows every sign of doing better in the future, on every metric. In particular, he notes how resource apocalypses, from Peak Oil to supposed shortages of rare earth elements, are invariably falsified, by technology in general and by hard work enabling us to produce better things with less material. He also covers Peace, updating his earlier book Better Angels, and Safety, noting the declines in homicides and accidents. He quickly dismisses Terrorism as a tempest in a teapot.It’s not just material progress that Pinker covers, although that’s the focus. It’s also moral progress—we are, among other things, nicer to people. Less torture, fewer executions, more value assigned to human life and happiness. True enough, but a necessary leg of Pinker’s entire argument is that there was no significant moral progress prior to the Enlightenment, since prior progress would disprove the causation he claims. But prior progress in the West was very great, as anyone with any grasp of history knows. Christianity immediately obviated many of the worst moral behaviors of the Ancient World (variants of which are still common in non-Christian cultures), from infanticide to the Roman practice of starving children to death in sight of a banquet, to distill their organs into love potions that would enhance desire. Christianity further led to the rule of law and was instrumental in the creation of the institutions that made possible the Scientific Revolution. All these moves forward, as Pinker documents while glossing over their cause, led to further moral gains. To hide his embarrassment at these pre-Enlightenment advances, Pinker chants, over and over again, the same trite phrases about “endless religious wars” and repeats boring anecdotes about witchcraft and bearbaiting.After these convincing chapters (convincing for their substance, at least), Pinker covers some softer topics, somewhat less successfully. Generally, the less harder-edged and susceptible to statistical analysis the topic, the worse Pinker does in showing that actual progress is being made. In fairness, though, it is true these softer topics, to the extent one agrees they constitute actual progress comparable to that covered in the earlier chapters, are more tied to actual Enlightenment ideas.First up is Democracy, which he claims is increasing, but Pinker helps himself over the finish line by defining democracy as basically any good government, one which “threads the needle, exerting just enough force to prevent people from preying on each other without preying on the people itself.” That, along with other definitional broadening from Karl Popper and John Mueller, means that democracy is redefined as any government with the rule of law and some responsiveness to public opinion. But in any case, there’s more democracy, however defined, and that’s Progress. Next is Equal Rights, where Pinker goes full Left, trumpeting all emancipation as good for what ails a society, and all failure to emancipate as evil incarnate (although he seems confused, since what is evil, anyway, to someone who denies the reality of moral abstractions other than utilitarian ones?) He does try to give a scientific gloss to his philosophical attachment to emancipation, ascribing it to more wealth means more people seek self-actualization, and want the same for others. This he then extrapolates to a claim that liberal values are spreading everywhere, with a lot of graphs (though we’re never told what “liberal values” are being measured, but by implication they overlap with “emancipative values”).Then Knowledge (we know more, and we’re getting smarter); Quality of Life (we work less and both the necessities and luxuries of life are cheaper); and Happiness (we are happier, largely because we’re richer, though Deaton covers this much better and more subtly). Along with Daniel T. Rodgers, Pinker huffily rejects Robert Putnam and others who point to the atomization of American lives as a problem, with the flip response that “Users of the Internet and social media have more contact with friends” and they “remain as satisfied with the number and quality of their friendships as in the decade of Gerald Ford and Happy Days.” But this is obtuse. Putnam’s claim wasn’t that people didn’t have friends anymore, it was that the intermediary institutions that were the entire basis of the success of any successful, and in particular, the successful American, society had been completely destroyed, resulting in the cascading baleful effects that Tocqueville and Robert Nisbet had earlier identified and feared. Pinker totally fails to make this connection, or more likely deliberately obfuscates it (which is probably why he refers to fears of social atomization as a “hysterical misconception”—that’s protesting too much). Not to mention that Putnam would have told him, too, that the problem was well under way by the time of Gerald Ford, so the 1970s are probably not the best comparison decade to today.Finally, Pinker points out that Existential Threats, from Y2K to bioterror, are grossly exaggerated. Sure, we can’t know the future, but on balance, we’re not all likely to wink out of existence next week, or next millennium. Of the supposed threat from artificial intelligence, he says “the scenario makes about as much sense as the worry that since jet planes have surpassed the flying ability of eagles, someday they will swoop out of the sky and seize our cattle.” Ha ha. He’s also heinously sexist. “There is no law of complex systems that says that intelligent agents must turn into ruthless conquistadors. Indeed, we know of one highly advanced form of intelligence that evolved without this defect. They’re called women.”I like all this, and agree with much of it (although I could do without the constant references to Mama Cass and the Beatles, reminding me Pinker is stuck, in many ways, in the 1960s). I am mostly a techno-optimist myself. However, Pinker’s greatest technical error, as opposed to failure of vision, is to believe (like Joseph Tainter) that if it can’t be quantified, it doesn’t exist. I’m a quantitative guy, personally—I have an MBA with finance and accounting concentrations from the Booth School of Business, and my wife correctly says I view the world as Neo does in the last scenes of ""The Matrix""—as cascading columns of numbers underlying the perceived, but merely surface, reality of things. Certainly, non-quantifiable views of human flourishing are subject to errors of perception, which is probably why Pinker repeatedly excoriates the Romantics. But Pinker is too quick to reject that humans seek transcendence, and all the new flavors of Doritos and life extension in the world isn’t going to change that. “Man shall not live by bread alone.” Pinker is fond of quoting Jesus, always with a sneer, but he does not offer us that truth, because it scares him, since it cannot be quantified.But the unquantifiable aspects of progress are a topic too long to get into in this review. Pinker wraps up Progress by talking about its future. He does this by making totally unsupported claims about the origin of Progress. “Since the Enlightenment unfolded in the late 18th century, life expectancy across the world has risen from 30 to 71, and in the more fortunate countries to 81.” “The Enlightenment is working: for two and a half centuries, people have used knowledge to enhance human flourishing.” Therefore, it’s going to continue, don’t you know? No logic is offered, just repetition of the mantra of “knowledge” and trying to tie the Enlightenment to the Scientific Revolution by repeatedly mentioning them in the same breath. It’s not convincing; in fact, it comes across as desperate.Embedded within all this proof of progress (for proof is what it is—we can quibble, or call it incomplete, but only a fool would say that material progress since the Scientific Revolution and the Industrial Revolution has not been immense), is the truth, difficult for some to accept, that all this progress was caused purely by, and until recently only affected, the West. It is the Western world has gotten better—and finally, after 400 years, some of those benefits have been adopted by others. That’s it. This is not a global phenomenon in cause, and it may not be a global phenomenon in effect, if the inferior cultures of the world, for whatever reason, refuse to accept the gifts offered by the Western Scientific Revolution. Pinker doesn’t make this point, either, though I can see why—it’s inflammatory and distracts from his argument. (He does admit that his first love, the Enlightenment, was a wholly Western phenomenon, a topic he shuffles away from quickly, mumbling about how ideas have no home, which may be true, but they do have a birthplace.)[Review continues as first comment.]"

Humans (on average) have never had it so good. And he’s got 500(+) pages and 75(+) graphs and charts that illustrate exactly that. And quite convincingly so. My favorite part is. He’s an equal opportunity hate hater. Pinker takes aim at both the far left and alt right in an all out data rich blitz attack on the histrionic, anti-intellectual fear-mongering both sides of the American political divide reliably trade in. Pinker argues that DJT’s populist uprising was a direct result of these exact misinformation wars. According Pinker’s diverse compilation of world health data, beginning in the mid nineties and continuing to the present and foreseeable future, global life spans, individual purchasing power, heath and wellbeing (by a multitude of measures) are all hella on the rise, while violent crime, poverty and disease are on the yard dart (see footnote at end of review) like trajectory nose dive decline. That being said, the average ideologue of either flavor very reliably believes that things are going to heck in a hatbox (to put it nicely).WTF?Pinker posits that precisely this ‘armageddon is upon us’ style sentiment enabled Donald Twitler’s P. T. Barnum style ascent, lending support to the O.G.’s (difficult at this particular historical juncture to deny) assertion that there’s ‘a sucker born ever minute’.Pinker invites us all to simply stop watching cable news (the overwhelmingly ‘uge’ beneficiaries of the Trumpster fire none of us can easily take our eyes off of) and have a look at some Good Organized Data (GOD). His point is not to inspire pollyannish optimism, but rather to stimulate (i) critical thinking and (ii) a commitment to solving the problems we face rather than trying to scare the undecideds into action, with the unintended, but predictable effect of scarring people into paralysis. People of the world: ideology is mental illness. Cable news is for retards. Our best (no only) hope is to figure out what kind of life we all want, and adopt a data driven, rational, naturalistic, pragmatic, realistic approach to getin’ er done. In a nutshell, Pinker urges us to recommit to enlightenment ideals e.g. science and humanism, and ditch the bleeding and leading hokum drizzled in snake-oil sauce pumped at us by the 24/7 alternative fact machines on both sides of the ideological sinkhole. I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!FOOT NOTE: for those of you too young to remember yard darts. It was this insanely dangerous lawn game that was comprised of two hula hoops laying on the grass at about 10 yards apart, and these approximately 5-7 pound mettle darts with a heavy sharp end, that you chucked underhanded up in the air and attempted to land in the other persons hoop. The SHUNK sound they made when they pierced the lawn was SO satisfying it defies words. And they were hugely popular in the 70’s. But they were eventually banned because of the (retrospectively obvious but at the time not so much) danger that you could hit your pal in the top of the dome with one of those bad boys and, well, if they didn’t die on impact, it’s all but certain they would be severely brain damaged. It is entirely plausible that the increase in lifespan indicated in Pinker’s research was significantly positively effected by the entirely rational ban of this ridiculously lethal toy."

I picked this up because I saw the authors TED talk, and then Bill Gates called it the best book he's read in a decade (his review is worth reading)The book starts with a premise that many people generally have an impression that the world is full of of serious crises. ""Magazine covers warn us of coming anarchies, plagues, epidemics, collapses, and so many “crises” (farm, health, retirement, welfare, energy, deficit) that copywriters have had to escalate to the redundant “serious crisis.” Whether or not the world really is getting worse, the nature of news will interact with the nature of cognition to make us think that it is. News is about things that happen, not things that don’t happen.""Basically, we worry a lot. A LOT. We live in dark times (with a scary president), etc. Pinker points out why we worry so much: the news. The news cycle is designed to play on our fears, and thus it is largely negative, focusing on all the bad things that are happening in the world. And we are consuming more news than ever in human history! And if the news focused on all the good things, the ratings would plummet, after all. But one of my favorite lines in the book points out that we would be hard pressed to find negative news if we were covering the last 100 years, instead of the last day.""Bad things can happen quickly, but good things aren’t built in a day, and as they unfold, they will be out of sync with the news cycle. The peace researcher John Galtung pointed out that if a newspaper came out once every fifty years, it would not report half a century of celebrity gossip and political scandals. It would report momentous global changes such as the increase in life expectancy.""And that was the eye opening thing about the book - if you take a long term view, every metric you can find has gotten better. Life expectancy, health, extreme poverty, prosperity, peace, freedom, safety, literacy, leisure, and even happiness - he has chapters and graphs for each of them, showing them vastly improving over the past centuries and usually with most gains in the past century. An interesting point is that most graphs show third world countries only being ~20-30 years behind first world countries, but the shape of the graphs looks the same in terms of the rate of progress. I won't recap all the graphs and numbers, but here is a small example of how life has gotten better.""In the mid-19th century it took twenty-five men a full day to harvest and thresh a ton of grain; today one person operating a combine harvester can do it in six minutes.""This is not to say that there aren't still large problems in all of those areas left to solve. Nor that we haven't created other problems - the book has chapters on some of those, notably climate change and nuclear war - but again there we have actually made progress. For some reason I haven't quite fully fathomed, Pinker and this book have gotten a lot of criticism. I think some of this is from people who object to him saying ""the world is great"" because there is so much progress left to be made - yet Pinker often admits that in the book. Or from people who think he is measuring progress along the wrong metrics, and we are all headed for an apocalypse. Certainly, there are lots of books about apocalypse, but it's much more pleasant to be an optimist, and believe that as long as we keep applying reason and science and making progress, the world will keep getting better."

He clearly points out the effect of distorted/exaggerated news, the negative bias of people, dirty politics and the lack of reason behind all the sky-is -falling attitude that seems to dominate communities.I have learned so many good facts from this book that helped me view things differently such as the global Cosmopolitanism, 8x increase in number of countries ruled by democracy within the last 50 years, the increased life quality and expectancy.He believes in our ability to create solutions and adapt. He pinpoints the evidence that we are evolving to a better vision of ourselves despite the fluctuations that may seem like a step-back at times. Lets hope the carbon emission will be under control soon..AND that the people will trust in science more than their own beliefs and superstitions. (and act accordingly)Great book, I am so glad I read it."
18,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"Steven Pinker argues, things are good—in fact, the best they’ve ever been. People today lead longer, safer, healthier, wealthier, and indeed happier lives than at any point in recorded history, and they do so thanks to the new enlightenment. He berates those who focus on what is wrong with the world’s current condition and criticize politics as pessimists ""Progressophobia"" who only help to incite regressive reactionaries. Instead, he glorifies the dominant neoliberal, technocratic and capitalistic approach to solving the world’s problems as only way possible.His book has provoked strong reactions, the positive mostly from the wealthy world elite like Bill Gates and I do agree with much of what Pinker has to say. His book is stocked with charts and graphs that provide incontrovertible evidence for centuries of progress on many fronts that should matter to all of us: a decline in violence of all sorts along with increases in health, longevity, education, and human rights. It’s precisely because of the validity of much of Pinker’s narrative that the flaws in his argument are so dangerous. He exaggerates at every opportunity and practices one sided and oversimplyfied argumentations that are characterized by cherry-picking data selection.Pinker's new Enlightenment is a love declaration on science and rationality. Early on he writes: “To take something on faith means to believe it without good reason, so by definition a faith in the existence of supernatural entities clashes with reason.” Sounds persuasive, so you don‘t need to trouble yourself with the arguments of historians, anthropologists and evolutionary biologists, who treat imagination, such as religion and ethical believes as a highly complex phenomenons, serving a variety of human needs, like geographical movement and the formation of alliances that lead to our survival and the agriculture movement. Instead all you need do is consult a dictionary to learn, that religion is by definition irrational and therefore unable to promote economical and political progress.Similarly he doesn‘t bother with the actual philosophical Enlightenment, the new Enlightenment being something he never really defines. By any standards, Immanuel Kant and David Hume were the greatest Enlightenment thinkers. Pinker quotes Kant, but barely mentions Hume, with purpose. He tell us that the Enlightenment is defined by a “non-negotiable” commitment to reason. Yet in ""A Treatise of Human Nature"" Hume wrote: “Reason is, and ought only to be, the slave of the passions and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.” Hume believed being reasonable meant accepting the limits of reason, and so too, in quite different ways, did later Enlightenment rationalists such as Keynes and Freud. Pinker’s Enlightenment has little in common with the much more interesting and world changing intellectual movement that emancipated the masses and provoked one of the most rewarding political changes in the history.Because of his unhistorical approach he repeats exposed fallacies like a mantra. He preaches an ideology of scientism, which along with reason, humanism and progress features as one of the core Enlightenment values that Pinker lists at the start of the book. For him science provides the basis of ethics and politics. For Pinker, the second law of thermodynamics doesn’t simply identify a universal regularity in the natural world, “it defines the fate of the universe and the ultimate purpose of life, mind, and human striving: to deploy energy and knowledge to fight back the tide of entropy and carve out refuges of beneficial order” .Therefore his book is a promotion and justification of free-market capitalism, according to him the main reason for advances in living standards. He seems to be ready to accept some provision, but nothing is said about human kindness, political and historical responsibilities or fairness. In fact the logic of his dictum points the other way - a theory of entropy provides no reason for limiting the powers of government any more than for helping the weak. Science cannot underwrite any political project, classical liberal or otherwise, because science cannot dictate human values.In the past scientism has been used to promote socialism, Marxism-Leninism, Nazism and more interventionist varieties of liberalism. The authority of science was used by representatives to legitimize the values of their time and Pinker does the same with his formula. For him there are no bad Enlightenment ideas, they are innocent of all evil. Accordingly, when despots such as Lenin argued that they engaged in mass killing in order to realize an Enlightenment project - in Lenins case to educate society by the methodical use of terror among other things – they must have been deluded or lying. Modern tyrannies must be products of counter-Enlightenment ideologies – Romanticism, nationalism and similar. Like the faithful who claim that Christianity is “a religion of love” that had nothing to do with the Inquisition, Pinker stipulates that the Enlightenment, by definition, is intrinsically liberal. The link between the Enlightenment and liberal values, which Pinker and many others today assert as a universal truth, is actually quite fragile. The most influential Enlightenment thinkers were monotheists, such as Locke and indeed Kant. The more hostile the Enlightenment has been to monotheism, the more illiberal it has been. The message of Pinker’s book is that the Enlightenment produced all of the progress of the modern era and none of its crimes, completely ignoring that it caused wars and global dependencies. Less than a decade ago, liberals were confident that progress was ongoing. They recognized that there would be periods of regression, yet there could be no doubt that the forces of reason would continue to advance long term. Today, that faith is in danger, due to political reversals and the raise of authoritarianism. What they need more than anything else, is some kind of intellectual anodyne that can soothe their nerves, still their doubts and stave off panic in a very persuasive writing style. That‘s what this book is actually about.Thought provocative without a doubt and a major recommendation to reflect upon"
19,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,"I really enjoy Pinker's books. I think I have read all of them. I enjoyed this one as well despite some of my political differences with Pinker. I laud his hailing of the enlightenment. I am with him this maligned movement should get more respect than it does. I am a big believer in modernity. I agree science and reason even when done by flawed bipeds like ourselves is the best guide in our mental toolbox. Pinker recognizes that our modern politics is tribal and this clouds our judgment turning partisans into rah rah cheerleaders ignoring valid points by the opposition. And I would love if everyone fact-checked and powerful people and interests bowed to reasoned argument and were willing to eat their profits, put up with regulation, and sacrificed shareholder value for the long term benefit of all based on calm rational inquiry and argument but that isn't how the all too human political arena works. Reason and enlightenment values like the philosopher-king of Plato should rule the roost but it never seems to get voted in. Reason for citizens is important and should be taught and preached but it doesn't move the powerful. Popular pressure can and has throughout the enlightenment era. I like Pinker's book I would want it to be on a philosopher-kings shelf but reason by itself can't move entrenched power. Pinker seems to think inequality isn't really a problem because everyone is materially better off than in the past the problem is even if everyone is comfortable high levels of inequality are corrosive to democracy and like a bad positive feedback loop concentrates political power undoing much of the benefits of democracy and undoing republics. I don't care if the Koch brothers have billions, I do care if they want to buy every politician in Congress and force their kooky libertarian ideas on the rest of us (ideas which seem to benefit the Kochs' bottom line, funny how that works). That is why inequality matters. And you don't stop people like the Kochs without popular pressure."
20,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,2,"Pinker’s latest is getting a lot of press, of course.Here are a few links:His own synopsis at the Wall Street Journal: 
The Enlightenment Is Working
 (paywall; try Googling wsj The Enlightenment Is Working and clicking through from Google, maybe into “private browsing mode”. Works sometimes.)Ezra Klein of Vox is a pretty good interviewer, and he hooked up with Pinker at his podcast. I 
really
 liked that they both name-dropped Dan Kahan's work at his Cultural Cognition Project at Yale Law School. Even though Kahan's research has a slightly skewed focus on risk, that he points to ""identity-protective cognition"" is central how I perceive the tribal partisanship our country is in. The compound adjective is key; many folks now believe that motivated reasoning can create an intrinsic cogntive bias, but far fewer realize how it is typically used: subconsciously, in protection of part of a person's social identity.It's also kinda cool that this is now officially Bill Gate's ""new favorite book of all time"". I'm ambivalent about Gates. On the negative side, I still despise how Microsoft, under his control, violated so many norms of fair play in pursuit of monopoly. And I know he's just doing that thing that plutocrats always do once making more money seems fruitless: build libraries. Oh, sorry that was the similarly amoral robber baron Andrew Carnegie. Same difference, right? But then I recall that Gates seems to be doing good things (as did Carnegie), while some others use their wealth in ways I mostly dislike. So: ambivalence.Will I read it? Dunno. I really liked his Better Angels, but my gut reaction is that his argument is facile: technically correct, but overlooks too much. For example, there's this, which is scary even before that whole identity-protective motivated reasoning thing is added in. Maybe Pinker addresses that, though.And frankly, there’s just so much more to read out there. I know I'll be reading How Democracies Die: What History Reveals About Our Future before Pinker.Update 19-Apr-2018—Pinker’s short interview with the Economist was well done, and made me think some about what I think his argument is, and why I think it’s flawed. The crux is this: Pinker is mostly dealing with materialist goals and the progress we are making in meeting them. To that extent, he’s undoubtedly correct. What we learned due to the Enlightenment has done marvels in gradually pulling us into a better future than Pangloss could have imagined (he refers Pangloss in his interview response).The problem is that he doesn’t perceive a deeper problem: that the Enlightenment did not provide us with a sense of meaning, purpose, or any hints about how to find them elsewhere (other than “hey, just make up your own!”). I ended my slam of Matt Ridley’s similar (but much more amateurish effort), The Rational Optimist. Here’s the text from that review — if you yank out Ridley and insert Pinker, I strongly suspect my critique of Enlightenment Now would be congruent:MaterialismRidley points out that humans have evolved into incredibly efficient organisms at solving the problems our paleolithic ancestors faced. Most humans alive today have access to food, health and a length of life that would astonish even our great-grandparents.And given how important those things are in our life, I’m also optimistic that we’re going to keep getting better at them. Given the staggering amount of research that’s going on, it would be very surprising if the coming decades don’t provide continuing delights at keeping people healthier and living longer.But here’s the problem: when I look around me, most of the people I see are already pretty satisfied on those counts. Sure, it’ll be really sweet when we finally cure cancer, and when we can reliably prevent Alzheimer’s, etc., etc. But the existential threats that drove paleolithic existence aren’t reflected on most folks’ day-to-day anxiety list, are they?The upshot of this is a little tricky: if the existential threats present during evolutionary time aren’t what drives us today… what does? Something I think is important to realize is that no matter what the answer is to that question, it isn’t embedded in our nature, at least certainly not in the same way as the old threats. Which means it is a very flexible thing, informed by culture, preference, and contingency. And that means individual and societal choices will vary widely, and might often contradict each other. I can easily imagine some of those drives being cause for pessimism — whether they be growth-for-growth’s sake of the capitalist, or the holy wars of various religious extremists. Those mimetic constructs could, in turn, put a damper on the pollyannaish future presented here.Since Ridley merely examines how good we are at meeting the materialistic goals of cavemen, he really never gets it. The pessimism of the post-modern isn’t about Malthusian crises, but about the lack of focused direction for our post-materialist civilization to take.Ridley doesn’t see that problem, and his book is fundamentally flawed.My complaint has broadened in the eight years since I reviewed that book, because it has been informed by the social crises we face today, especially regarding how social identity in the modern world has become a more salient dividing point between populations, despite the astonishing fact that it is often quite arbitrary. Modernity has a whole host of problems which are becoming ever more germane.So now I’m a bit more curious, and might have to read this to see if Pinker even notices that a whole host of new problems face humanity."

But Pinker makes matters worse by compounding ideological bias with historical ignorance.” ~Modernity & Cultural Decline."
22,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2592514-mark,5,"As in The Better Angels of our Nature, Steven Pinker shows us why we have to look beyond the news cycle and our own biases to examine the forces that have continuously improved conditions for the bulk of humanity. And Pinker provides the data to back his arguments up. There's no doubt that Pinker will be accused of being a Pollyanna, but he acknowledges that mankind has hard work ahead - including dealing with global climate change. His argument is simply that if we stand a chance at confronting these challenges, we must stick with the enlightenment values of Reason, Science and Humanism that have achieved progress in the past.Agree or disagree (everyone will have quibbles, and many will accuse Pinker of outright sophistry), this is an essential read that will be talked about (Bill Gates just named it his ""new favorite book of all time""). As for myself, my puzzlement is over why Pinker's arguments seem so contrarian when they should be part of the mainstream.I had the privilege of reading an Advance Release Copy. This book is worth picking up on the publication date, so you can be part of the media conversation that will follow. There is currently an intense interest among readers in books that describe our current political moment. Enlightenment Now should provoke great interest among these readers because it is both an important analysis of our times and a big-picture complement to the recent bestsellers that will soon be last years news."

24,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72492979-edward-sudall,2,"There are more slaves than there ever has been therefore the world is worse than it ever has been. That is my parodic example of oversimple and overgeneral Pinker-logic.Wasn't it Albert Einstein that once said ""not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.""Actually, it was the Sociologist William Bruce Cameron. (But Einstein's celebrity authority, is like Pinker's: if he says it, it becomes more believed). The full quote is:""It would be nice if all of the data which sociologists require could be enumerated because then we could run them through IBM machines and draw charts as the economists do. However, not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted."" This is very much the spirit of this book with too little acknowledgement of the wisdom of the final sentence.'Enlightenment Now' is an important book for putting an awful lot of data in one location and I agree for the most part, but I don't agree because it's objectively proven by data removed from consensus value-judgements. Overstating the quantitative instead of the qualitative for, say, happiness really is too on the nose and ""vulgar American can-do-sim"" to me. The assumption of progress is loaded too much with all-gain naivety and blinkered-thinking, for a gain of, say, computers will mean a loss in other ways: attention deficit, pornography addiction, cyberwars, diffused communication (not to mention automated killer robots, yay!). That having a computer or smartphone is the better choice overall (if it is really a 'choice' if your peers, education and employment decide for you) does not mean we can self-righteously declare progress and superiority to nonindustrial societies or our ancestors who having never experienced our progress never knew how bad they had it - so did they have it bad to them really? Whose progress is it, says who? There is no comparison except looking from the biased present with the modernist or chronology snobbery decried by Einstein in Ideas and Opinions. For declaring progression overall means allowing for regressions among progressions. And the metaphorical climb, line or ladder of either/or progress or regress doesn't exist in a chart but chaotically varies across contingent vocabularies, communities and history in a much less neat and less comfy way than this very righteous book tries to make me believe. Lacking rigour is effective marketing; Bill Gates certainly liked it enough to say it's his favourite book ever. Maybe something to do with validating his effect computerising and homogenising the world. But who is he to say? An American billionaire that does philanthropy American-style; giving away without sacrificing anything personally. Getting applause too, and to buy (take) esteemed art from public galleries. Taking an oscillative trend like violence going down is different from ethical claims about the world getting better, 'progressing', as a totality, for it gets better in some ways but worse in others in exchange. The reduction in conflict is in liberal humanist judgement wonderful, but if only Pinker had spared enough time for a liberal education darling like Hegel it would come across less dogmatic and zero-sum. At one point Pinker does gesture toward that in chapter 4, as he learned from Malcolm Gladwell who argued against him in 'Do Humankind's Best Days Lie Ahead?': for every problem we solve, new problems are generated. Therefore, we can only conclude that humankind's days will be different, but we cannot qualify abstract ""better"". But Pinker says ""progress can resume when the new problems are solved"" - an obscene volume of nuclear war hazards have been created by scientists doing 'neutral' science - and it cannot be solved by science. Assuming that everything -it seems - can be solved. The mantle of progress is assumed without its polar, regress; accepting a nonbinary of regression and progression is more reasonable. To put in the quantified terms Pinker likes, it's an exchange: with our bounded rationality on the scale of all of the humans in all the world and all our histories, there's no + without some -. I acknowledge the, to a liberal humanist, great pluses but there are minuses as well. To ignore the minuses makes me doubt the pluses more than if they had more weighting in Enlightenment Now.To cite my original point,we live in an information age, but with more slaves than all of history. ""According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) more than 40 million people worldwide are victims of modern slavery"" Sourced from the United Nations website http://www.un.org/en/events/slaveryab... We have the internet but that means unstoppable cybercrime, and some unstoppable terrorism. Millions coming out of poverty in China but a gender imbalance and higher suicide rate, and work-stress. And they are coming out of poverty because of a communist party running a capitalist economy (with disregard for human rights) in ways overlooked by Pinker for free-trade American-style that has 8 men (including Bill Gates) owning more than half the world's population! To apply oversimple and overgeneral Pinker-logic that there are more slaves than there ever has been means one can conclude the world is worse than it ever has been. No, we have progressed in agreeable ways because slaves are illegal, say, but also regressed because with nations and transport set up as they are human trafficking is rampant, profitable, and still immorally done statistically more than ever.To know the rationale for what Pinker seems to believe, read up on Anglophone John Stuart Mill, Jeremy Bentham, and the now axiomatic idea of the greatest happiness for the greatest number. Enlightenment Now uses their 157-year-old assumptions and value judgements (like an absence of measurable physical pain being happiness, happiness being apparent pleasure) with his own metrics from state statistics. Whose definition of Reason? Remember David Hume, ""Tis not contrary to reason to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger. `Tis not contrary to reason for me to chuse my total ruin, to prevent the least uneasiness of an Indian or person wholly unknown to me. `Tis as little contrary to reason to prefer even my own acknowledge'd lesser good to my greater, and have a more ardent affection for the former than the latter."" The book overlooks David Hume's Is-Ought problem: lots of this-is facts do not give an outside judge authority (Reason in lieu of deist or pantheist God) for why it ought to be one way or another. The particular dominant, often implicit or unaware, consensus does that. In academia, it goes by the name ideology. But Pinker uses the word ideology, in the North American sense, to mean the bad ideas I disagree with. Pinker euphemises the consensus of contingent American liberal-humanists as Reason. I agree with the consensus (except for colonising all peoples in a western image, giving them fridges and burgers), but don't want it to be dogma. There are observable factors for morality, namely moral intuitionism, as espoused by the more knowledgeable Robert Sapolsky, and for emotions by Jaak Panseep. But that is still more a very variable 'how' than a metaphysical 'why'.Liberal humanism is still more a created artificial consensus than a natural discovery.To hear the other side read The Divide: A Brief Guide to Global Inequality and its Solutions, ""Since 1960, the income gap between the North and South has roughly tripled in size. Today 4.3 billion people, 60 per cent of the world's population, live on less than $5 per day. Some 1 billion live on less than $1 a day. The richest eight people now control the same amount of wealth as the poorest half of the world combined."" Or Bad Samaritans: The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of CapitalismConsider too that the planet's ecology regresses while we're alive because our ancestors caused two Mass Extinctions and we are causing the third right now. Or for information about the metaphorical forward march causing the very real endangerment of native cultures ask those peoples, Native American or Aboriginals for example. Or read Levi-Strauss's Tristes Tropiqus or about the 'happier' and more sexually 'liberal' tribes in Margaret Mead's work.For more balanced relevance to the Enlightenment appeals consider the older now-updated The Age of American Unreason in a Culture of Lies by Susan Jacoby. For example, the seven hours the TV is on everyday and that most surveyed Americans can't find Iraq (that American and ally war-torn country) on a map. And the anti-intellectualism that Pinker seems to fall into casting objections he has come up with (are those objections then, if the objectors are hypothetical?) instead of asking for valid objections from just as, some more, qualified academics. Or about the tangible possibility of eugenics dystopia in The Future of Human Nature by Jürgen Habermas. Or how suicide spikes in newly industrial capitalist societies read On Suicide: A Study in Sociology by Emilie Durkheim.Or anti-Enlightenment Rousseau for how bringing abundant capitalism to the native Americans caused depravity.Or consider the statistical increase in self-harm and low-self worth among adolescents with social media. https://theconversation.com/more-teen...For insight into the lack of nuance and the all-gain mentality fashionable in North America, which Pinker is a long-term symptom of, read Democracy in America. For a wonderful critique of Pinker overreaching himself try, Cambridge realist philosopher, Simon Blackburn's review of his Blank Slate http://www2.phil.cam.ac.uk/~swb24/rev... I eagerly await his review of this book (though, like me, for the most part, he will probably agree with the celebrated)."
25,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24035606-ryan-boissonneault,5,"Francis Bacon once said that “some books should be tasted, some devoured, but only a few should be chewed and digested thoroughly.” This is one of the few.The main thesis of the book is that the enlightenment values of reason, science, and humanism have led to scientific and moral progress and that the embrace of these values will continue the trend. This, as opposed to counter-enlightenment values (religious faith, nationalism, tribalism, relativism, declinism), is the recipe for the maximization of human flourishing and the minimization of human suffering. Pinker defends this thesis with massive amounts of data demonstrating that just about every meaningful dimension of human well-being has improved since the Age of Enlightenment. He also describes the drivers of progress and provides highly rational and sometimes unexpected conclusions about a variety of issues including climate change, artificial intelligence, and income inequality. The data, ideas, and philosophy in this book are extremely important, but unfortunately, people’s natural aversion to the concept of progress leads to some common objections that I’d like to address. Common ObjectionsObjection #1: I already know all of thisNo, you don’t, and you almost certainly haven’t read the book if you say this. This massive undertaking examines the progress of human welfare in almost all aspects of life, and covers the most pressing questions about health, income, inequality, violence, safety, democracy, freedom, human rights, knowledge, happiness, climate change, artificial intelligence, and more. To claim that you know all of this is the epitome of hubris by suggesting that you already have figured out the best ways to think about and handle the world’s toughest challenges. IF you read the book, you will learn something. Not to mention Pinker is a skilled writer, the content is interesting, and the history of progress is history we should be proud of. Objection #2: Bad things still happen so isn’t progress an illusion?Pinker never makes the claim that violence, death, disease, suffering, or poverty has or ever will reach zero instances. This is not a book about achieving some kind of utopia. But pointing out specific examples of bad things that still happen does nothing to refute the overall thesis that astronomical progress has been made over the last few centuries since the Enlightenment.You can’t measure progress by citing specific examples or anecdotes. For example, the worldwide poverty rate has fallen from 43 percent just in 1990 to 21 percent in 2011. That’s a lot of people that have escaped poverty, and pointing out the people that are still poor says nothing about the trend. Pinker uses 70+ graphs and an overwhelming amount of statistics to make his case, so I’m sure if you wanted to you could find something to nitpick at. But you’ll also probably lose sight of the big picture and the more important numbers, trends, and points. Also keep in mind that the most troubled parts of the world prove Pinker’s point rather than refute it, as the most violent parts are also the least secular, democratic, literate, educated, and wealthy and embody counter-enlightenment ideals.Objection #3: Ok, so material well-being has increased, but the world is in no better shape spiritually. Pinker’s view of the world is materialist and reductionist. This objection usually comes from the religiously-inclined. It results from the false assumption that if you’re not religious you’re a reductionist or that you practice “scientism.”Science may not be able to determine our values, but philosophy, particularly Enlightenment philosophy, can. With its emphasis on human well-being and flourishing, Enlightenment philosophy sets the agenda to make us healthier, wealthier, wiser, freer, and happier.And once we all agree that life is better than death, wealth is better than poverty, and well-being is better than suffering, science can help us get there, which it already has and which is painstakingly documented in this book.The conditions for happiness are available to most of the world’s population. And as for higher purpose, plenty of people find great satisfaction in charity work, championing worthwhile social causes, pursuing meaningful work, spending time with friends and family, enjoying culture, traveling, and taking advantage of unprecedented amounts of leisure time. We’re responsible for creating our own meaning and we now have a plethora of choices in how to achieve this.Inexplicably, this still leaves some people cold. In the words of Pinker:“The idea that the ultimate good is to use knowledge to enhance human welfare leaves people cold. Deep explanations of the universe, the planet, life, the brain? Unless they use magic, we don’t want to believe them! Saving the lives of billions, eradicating disease, feeding the hungry? Bo-ring. People extending their compassion to all of humankind? Not good enough—we want the laws of physics to care about us! Longevity, health, understanding, beauty, freedom, love? There’s got to be more to life than that!”Objection #4: It’s naive to think progress will continue. Pinker distinguishes between two kinds of optimism. The first is complacency optimism, whereby you expect a positive outcome without extending any effort to influence the outcome. The second is conditional optimism, whereby you directly influence an outcome by identifying problems and proposing solutions. Pinker is of the second variety. He admits that progress is by no means guaranteed, but at the same time human history has been defined by its ability to identify and solve problems. This is productive optimism and makes you wonder what the benefit of pessimism is, exactly."
26,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31384949-ian,5,"Prof. Pinker points out early in this book that people have a tendency to marshal evidence that confirms their convictions whilst dismissing evidence that contradicts them. I’m as guilty of that as most people, and on the evidence of this book, my own convictions are similar to the author’s. Prof. Pinker’s book largely provides me with reinforcement for my pre-existing opinions and on that basis it’s not surprising I rate it highly. A large part of the book is taken up with the author arguing that the ideals of the Enlightenment have led to levels of health, wealth, human rights, peace and security, and all-round happiness that were unimaginable to people in the pre-Enlightenment age. Also part of his argument is an attack on the surprisingly common belief that the world was a better place in the past than it is today. I’ve always felt that rose-tinted views of the past fly in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, and overwhelming evidence is what Prof. Pinker provides, with a barrage of statistics and graphs about how the world has changed since the Enlightenment era. I had a few minor quibbles about some of his arguments, but nothing that affected the overall merits of his case.Of course, saying that things are far better than they were is not to say that we live in Utopia. Prof. Pinker would be the first to say that the world still faces many problems, and he addresses those that could reverse the gains of modernity. The hoary old chestnuts of resource depletion and “the Population Bomb” are despatched without much ado. He’s completely dismissive of the Elon Musk/Stephen Hawking arguments about the threat of AGI, (which made me feel rather foolish, since on this website I’ve previously written a favourable review of a book which articulates those fears). He does rate climate change and nuclear war as potentially serious threats (though again, if you had asked political commentators in the 1950s or 1960s about the chances of getting to 2018 without nuclear weapons ever being used, most would have rated the chances as close to zero).I’m a little less sanguine than Prof. Pinker when it comes to the threats to progress posed by nationalism, populism, political extremism (of the left and right) and religious fanaticism, all of which seem to be on a world-wide upswing at the moment. Prof. Pinker seems to be think that we’re just going through a bit of a bad patch and that it’ll all turn out right in the end. I hope he’s right. I had to take my time reading this book, as I had to consider the arguments carefully, and also because I kept stopping to read the references. They’ve given me a few ideas for future reading material. Overall for me this was a 4.5 star rating, but objectively it deserves 5 stars."
27,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31302406-lori,1,"Complete and utter embarrassment to enlightenment thought. I will follow up with an in-depth review some time in the future. But never have I seen a book that managed to get almost everything wrong in the way it interprets the data they present, not to mention that the data is cherry-picked to hell and back. Not only is the data cherry-picked, but also Steven Pinker's definition of ""enlightenment thought"" is cherry-picked. And alas the various authors and philosophies Pinker quotes to justify his world view are cherry-picked into incoherence; I cannot understand how someone can quote both Ludwig von Mises and James C. Scott on roughly the same topic with a straight face — as if their analyses can ever lead to similar conclusions.This book is nothing but sheer spectacle, nothing of substance, only the cheapest appeal to the legitimacy that ""hard facts and data"" confer to a work regardless of whether they are used wisely or not.Later edit: a yes, how could I forget. You know a book is just propaganda if it bends over backwards to defend the worldview that upholds and creates billionaires like Bill Gates. Billionaired for whom, obviously, this is an all time favorite book. Of course he likes it, because regardless of all the vile shit he has done to his employees, the software ""industry"" in general, to open source software, etc. he still gets to claim that his existence, ultimately, led to ""the best possible outcome"". Absolutely grotesque. "
28,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5780038-jonathan-yu,5,I see a lot of hostile commentary on this book. My opinion is that they didn’t read it as they hash the same issues that the author addresses. This book is flawed. It’s sorta long and it lags at the end but I still say it’s 5 stars because of the mindset it instills in you. They want you to sit down and solve problems - not wait for things on faith and not always be wanting to tear the structure down. The structure is working and the doomsday doomers (which I find myself gravitating too at times) are wrong. I think this book is worth reading. It’s the best book I’ve read so far this year. 
29,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69551184-michael-sebastian,1,"Steven Pinker's book, Enlightment Now, has a pretty basic premise. Things have gotten better as a whole for humanity in the past century, especially compared to the conditions in which most people lived not that long ago. For some reason though, Pinker not only needs to make the case that life has gotten better, but, because most things are better, everything must be great. A good chunk of this book is spent chastising people that are trying to make the world better for not being ""grateful"" enough, and downplaying things that are real problems. One of the examples that stood out to me the most was his defense of sweatshop labor, saying: ""while working on the factory floor is often referred to as sweatshop labor, it is often better than the grandaddy of all sweatshops working in the field as an agricultural day worker.""This seemed like an extreme claim to me, so I did a little digging and found this article in the New York Times that talks about this same subject. From the article:People who worked in agriculture or market selling earned about as much money as they could have at the factory, often with fewer hours and better conditions. We were amazed: By the end of a year only a third of the people who had landed an industrial job were still employed in the industrial sector at all. It would be easy to see this as the normal trial-and-error of young people starting out careers, but actually the factory jobs carried dangerous risks. Serious injuries and disabilities were nearly double among those who took the factory jobs, rising to 7 percent from about 4 percent. This risk rose with every month they stayed. The people we interviewed told us about exposure to chemical fumes and repetitive stress injuries.Quite a different picture than the one given by Pinker in his book. There are definitely positives to a country becoming more industrialized, and I think there is a valid argument to have on the sacrifices that need to be made to get to a point where the society can benefit from that industrialization. But Pinker completely glosses over the real suffering of people in these sweatshops so that he can pretend that the entire process is amazing. This is disingenuous and doesn't help anyone, but when it comes to other issues, like race, he misleads in even more blatant ways:""The data suggest that the number of police shootings has decreased, not increased in recent decades, and three independent analyses have found that a black suspect is no more likely than a white suspect to be killed by the police""On face value that claim seems absurd, but even the article he cites for this information confirms that what he's saying is wildly misleading: ""According to the F.B.I.’s Supplementary Homicide Report, 31.8 percent of people shot by the police were African-American, a proportion more than two and a half times the 13.2 percent of African-Americans in the general population.""The article goes on to say that this is the case because black people have more encounters with the police. Pinker never mentions that blacks are over represented in police homicide by two and a half times, he only cherry picks what he wants from the article, and discards the part that's inconvenient to the story that he's trying to tell. It's hard for me to imagine that he read that article, and what jumped out to him was ""a black suspect is no more likely than a white suspect to be killed by the police"" instead of ""31.8 percent of people shot by the police were African-American, a proportion more than two and a half times the 13.2 percent of African-Americans in the general population."" It's pretty blatant misrepresentation and really made me question all of the other ""facts"" he put into the book. Another argument made in this book is that economic inequality isn't really a problem: ""The confusion of inequality with poverty comes straight out of the lump fallacy--the mindset in which wealth is a finite resource... As we just saw, wealth is not like that: since the Industrial Revolution, it has expanded exponentially. That means that when the rich get richer, the poor can get richer, too.""But the United Nations report on Extreme Poverty in the United States seems to tell a different story. From the report: ""But its immense wealth and expertise stand in shocking contrast with the conditions in which vast numbers of its citizens live. About 40 million live in poverty, 18.5 million in extreme poverty, and 5.3 million live in Third World conditions of absolute poverty. It has the highest youth poverty rate in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the highest infant mortality rates among comparable OECD States.""It seems to directly contradict Pinker's assessment that the richest country in the world has the highest youth poverty rate in the OECD. If ""when the rich get richer, the poor can get richer, too"" then this wouldn't be the case. Aside from the dubiousness of the claim that a rising tide lifts all boats, Pinker doesn't seem to understand the full extent of how inequality damages a society. He thinks that people raising issues about economic inequality see wealth as a finite resource, but he doesn't take the next step and address the fact that power is a finite resource. From the UN report again: ""What extreme inequality actually signifies is the transfer of economic and political power to a handful of elites who inevitably use it to further their own self-interest, as demonstrated by the situation in various countries around the world."" There is never any serious conversation in this book about the power the ultra rich have gained over our society. Not only in the private sector, but their ability to influence the democratic sector as well. Pinker has a chapter about democracy as a liberating force in modern society, but ignores some of the fundamental ways it's undermined by the concentration of power in the hands of a few.I have more issues with this book, but it would require a lot more text than this to rebut every single claim. There's a pretty good response to his critique of environmentalists here. In terms of ""facts"", it's hard to trust a lot of the claims that this book makes, and I think someone would be better off doing the research on their own or just reading another book. Some of the stuff in here is blatant misinformation, but a lot of it is just manipulated to match the author's own personal biases. I don't even disagree that the world has gotten better for most people in the past century, but sugar coating it's current problems isn't helping anyone. Not only is it actively standing in the way of people making a better world, but it could push the world into even worse situations if some of these festering problems aren't addressed."
30,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"In many ways, reading this book was similar to reading Pinker's book ""Better Angels of our Nature."" The theory of the book was straight-forward, the evidence was well-organized, and the insights from the data were presented clearly. The first drawback to reading this book is that it covers a lot of the same ground as ""Better Angels of our Nature."" The second drawback to this book is that...well, even if the conclusions of this book aren't common sense, to people who are roughly familiar with enlightenment ideals and are fairly well-read on current affairs, it sort of is common sense. That's a nice way of saying that there are few ideas in this book that will leave you awe-struck. That's not to see that Pinker isn't capable of writing such a book. I found ""The Blank Slate"" to be just such a book. That book remains one of my favorite books to this day. That is also the book I point to when I want to convince people what a great thinker Pinker is. Pinker's argument is straightforward and comes in the preface: ""I will present a different understanding of the world, grounded in fact and inspired by the ideals of the Enlightenment: reason, science, humanism, and progress. Enlightenment ideals, I hope to show, are timeless, but they have never been more relevant than they are right now."" (page 12). If Enlightenment ideas are timeless, then why do they need a defense? Pinker's answer: ""The ideals of the Enlightenment are products of human reason, but they always struggle with other strands of human nature: loyalty to tribe, deference to authority, magical thinking, the blaming of misfortune on evildoers"" (page 18). In many ways, ""Enlightenment Now"" is similar to ""Factfullness"" in its use of quantitative data to make the case that life is indeed getting better. Pinker's earlier book ""Better Angels of our Nature"" was also a book that relied heavily on quantitative data. However, by my recollection, that book did a better job of reflecting on how the numbers were arrived at. I think numeracy is an important skill, and too often it is easy to be wowed by numbers without realizing how they are produced and the difficulty of getting reliable numbers in certain contexts -- for example, the distant past and developing countries. My recollection of ""Better Angels"" is a few years removed, but I seem to remember Pinker doing a better job with educating readers on how numbers were arrived at. Having said that, I do think the graphs are presented in a useful and simple way. Often, the data comes in the form of time series line charts. I think the repeated use of these kinds of statistics is great for more casual readers who need to be convinced. Another drawback to this book is that it tends to ignore and short-change the possibility of cataclysmic blowups. The discussion of the disruptive power of AI is discussed briefly, but pales in seriousness to Yuval Harari's analysis in ""21 Lessons for the 21st Century."" The benefits of enlightenment are discussed abundantly, but Frankenstein monsters like mortgage-backed securities are barely mentioned. In addition, one of the most important trends of the 21st century, the explosion of debt is barely discussed. The looming debt crisis (or, I should say crises since we are talking about various kinds of debts, government, municipal, shadow banking, and private) as well as other potential crises with systemic implications -- climate change, the growing use of social media, the introduction of disruptive technologies -- are under-discussed in this book. And because these systemic crises are under-discussed, Pinker fails to deal with the mother of all questions about modernity. Does modernity increase the risk of catastrophic blow-ups? Since nuclear war, climate change, and contagious financial panics are the product in one way or another of modernity, science, and globalization, is there a likelihood that more potentially catastrophic phenomena could be birthed from them? And, if so, what can we do to prevent potential catastrophic blow-ups from occurring? Another way to think about the question is this way: In what ways is modern progress like a financial bubble? For me, a high point of the book was its discussion of tribal epistemology. I have read short articles on tribal thinking, but the review of the literature here was excellent. And for those who are searching for literature that discusses this topic, the book can make for an effective gateway. This was written in the Guardian about this book: ""More pertinently, the failed 2016 campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Remain demonstrated that, in the eyes of many people, “progress” simply meant more of the same. When people feel trapped and patronised by progress, then any alternative – even regress – will feel like freedom. Informing them that the policies of the past 40 years are still the best available starts to sound hopeless."" (Full review here: https://www.theguardian.com/books/201...)Perhaps that's another way of saying that technocratic modernity (complete with its wonky charts) can feel emotionally ungratifying. Instead of gradual improvements and progress by a thousand nudges, there is a part of the soul that yearns for liberation, heroism, and love. People like stories with heroes and villains. Enlightenment often sees the world in terms of mechanical and quasi-mechanical cause and effect relationships. Heroism seems less like heroism when it requires design and system-thinking rather than great sacrifices. Nassim Taleb, another writer whose work I admire, steeps his writing in decidedly non-modern ideas and sentiments -- his thinking perhaps is best described as classical and romantic. I believe anyone who reads this book ought to put it in conversation with some of Taleb's writing (one or two books is enough). I'm sure each of the authors would hate to hear it, but I'll say it anyway -- they are better read together than separately. The unabashed modernist/enlightenment thinker is better with a classical/romantic counterpart and vice versa. I will repeat this: People who are only familiar with Pinker for ""Better Angels"" and ""Enlightenment Now"" ought to read his earlier work ""Blank Slate."" That book, more than his more recent works, demonstrates that he is a true thinker and not simply a chart-jockey or dataphile. Overall, even if you do not need to be convinced of the merit of enlightenment ideas and ideals, this is a wonderful book to read. "
31,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,4,"If you're looking for a cure for the common pessimism, you might do much, much worse than to pick up this book. I've read or seen many other examples of the facts portrayed here, but Steven Pinker does a very admirable job of showing us, exactly, how much better the world is now compared to the one we had even a hundred years ago. It's not just time-saving devices or some outright reversals of ecological damage, but how lifespans, general IQ, overall poverty level, and even WAR has improved for the better for all. Not that war is ever really all that great, mind you, but few nations jump into it with quite as little reason or abandon as they used to.Pinker isn't saying that everything is peachy, of course, but the trend toward real positive progress is undeniable. This is, despite setbacks. And yes, we have many. But for every problem that exists, he makes a very good point that we have it in us to FIX our problems. It's not out of the question.Global Warming, for example, not only has possible temporary and minor fixes available, such as applying a metaphorical sunscreen to the atmosphere, but we have the means to do much more than cut our carbon footprint down to the bone. We have a history of moving on to different methods whenever resources of one type or another run out, too. Health and education are at an all-time high. What we don't have is our optimism. In fact, we have a very solid outlook that things are worse than ever. Terrorists are few in number and never accomplish their stated goals. They merely rouse the combined might of all the powers to quash them. Most of the first world countries have made a point of living by equality in the sexes and the trend is more of the same across the world. LGBT is already accepted on the same scale. Pinker attributes all our actual progress to the Enlightenment. The old standard of 19th-century thinking, where humanism reigns supreme. Look. I freely admit to being a humanist, myself. I LOVE the idea that we all should get along. That every life is valuable. That we should have a high fundamental basis for living for every man, woman, and child alive. It's so pervasive an idea that practically everyone shares it. It's like... OBVIOUS, right? And as far as I know, Steven Pinker is right. But he also makes a very cogent point about the need to be rational, to use science for what it is intended. Inquiry, truth-seeking. No matter what the result, the truth is much more important than any ideology. He uses this to encourage each and every one of us to see past the doomsayers and the demagogs. Again, I totally agree. Skepticism is not the same thing as pessimism. Almost everyone I know is a fundamentally decent person and we all want the same fundamental things.So why didn't I give this book a full five stars?Because he gives all the credit to humanism. Wishing does not make it so. He might be right, but let's face it: this might be what he, himself warned us about. Selection Bias.Even so, I love thinking about it and I totally recommend this book for anyone who is sick and tired of the news and wants someone with a lot of facts and good reasoning to pick them up off the ground, dust their shoulders, and tell them that we are, on the whole, doing pretty damn well for ourselves. You know, despite the actual problems. But then, we DO have it in ourselves to FIX THEM. :)"
32,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51602586-dominika,2,"I did not like this book.I would say that this book was middling for the majority of it. The idea of the book is that progress has already happened, and we shouldn't be as doom and gloom as we are. But for a man who emphasizes the use of data and critical thinking, he doesn't really read said data that well and some of his arguments are riddled with gaping holes. This was a book that was read at our book club (but I was the only person at that book club who read the book in its entirety) and one of the points was that you need to show that progress has been made in order to do more progress. I have mixed feelings: I feel as though that erases the issues that people are actually facing by trying to point out that ""oh but you won't die in the woods from an infection"". While it is nice that countries that were in extreme poverty 50 years ago are being lifted to the middle class, it won't matter to the person who is working 3 jobs at minimum wage so that they can support a family. We have a lot of great innovations in healthcare, but it doesn't matter when a person cannot take an ambulance because it will cost them $600. Some of the progress sections have rather weak arguments as well. The environment one was basically him saying that the system will fix itself (in terms of a capitalist system supporting renewable energy) and that we'll totally invent carbon capture technology. The happiness one also bugged me, because the data is just not consistent. But the section that really got my blood boiling was Science. First off, he tries putting his deregulation mindset against IRBs and says a really fucking insensitive thing about the Tuskegee Syphilis study (But black people worked on it and it's not like they were INFECTING people with Syphilis). And then the rest of it was a STEM circlejerk (Wah, why are these SOCIAL SCIENCES invading my medical research). I work in medical research and am working towards a masters in Epidemiology. We cannot live in our own bubbles, we must learn from different disciplines. Hard sciences bring data-driven analysis to every subject, but social sciences bring the ability to look at the whole picture. Humanities bring the ability to make these things appealing and also to think creatively, to gain inspiration. We need them all, and it's a shame that Pinker doesn't realize that.Oh boy, and I'm not even going to start on the Humanism section and his comments on Islam. Not only does he not see how Western Imperialism could have POSSIBLY encouraged a more patriarchal regime as opposed to just reading religious texts (Look at the south), he also is just full of double standards. Oh, and his arguement against Nietsche is that dictators read him. He doesn't seem to get the Nietsche is all about skepticism. I do really like the chapter on Ideas. While it isn't something that I haven't heard before, I liked the comment on how a lot of politics now isn't even about core fundamental beliefs, but about who's team is winning. The truth is, Pinker and I differ on some core ideologies. Pinker refutes Postmodern philosophy while I am very postmodern. We have some differing opinions on the amount of regulations things should get and whether systems will correct themselves. I understand that. I read Ayn Rand, and I felt as though more of the arguments were at least compelling (if not occassionally bat-shit crazy). I didn't feel the same way about Pinker.All of this isn't helped by how reading this book felt equivelent to eating raw almonds. It was bland, it was dense, Pinker repeated himself and would attempt some flowery tangent while utterly failing. My friend said he tried reading the book during his night shift job and then fell asleep, and then got the audiobook and fell asleep again. I know he's not trying to say that we shouldn't work hard to improve the world, but I don't particularly feel any inspiration from this book, particularly when the vast majority does try to read as a pat on the back in spite of his introduction. I felt like a majority of his arguments were flaccid with the occasionally toxic take, and this book in general was overbloated. "
33,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"In Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, Steven Pinker spends 550+ pages attempting to disavow you of any notion of ""the good ol' days"".And he IS pretty convincing. He's got stats and graphs and lots of evidence to bolster his case that we live in amazing times - that progress and Enlightenment-era ideals have lead to better conditions in almost every measurable sphere. And he's right. He spends some ink and time on why we feel the opposite so often - the world is a hell hole! - pointing towards psychological phenomena like the optimism gap, the availability heuristic, (leaning heavily on Kahneman and Tvorsky's work) and the tendency we all have to remember negative over positive.I didn't read his earlier book about the decline of violence, The Better Angels of our Nature, but this book looks like a more robust version of that one, with a broad focus to include public health, economics, climate change, nuclear weapons, and the timely discussion of authoritarian populism.It's not all roses and puppies, but there are many great things and amazing research that lead to more great things. That's a good thing to remember, and a clarion call to keep going with research and evidence-based activism. All in the name of progress and making things more equal."
34,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11654681-paul,3,"I'm a big fan of Pinker, but I can't say I really enjoyed this book. Impeccably written, as always, but I feel like some of the conclusions he draws from the data he cites are somewhat spurious. "
35,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47417894-laura-noggle,4,"This was an encouraging, uplifting look at many of the successes and bright spots that often get overlooked. However, it's clear things need to be taken with a large grain of salt. I admit, my initial five star rating was more out of the hopefulness associated with the book. Hopefulness that the world isn't really going to hell in a handbasket, and hopeful that the mass generalizations and questionable analysis of facts/statistics had a firm foundation. After reading Nassim Nicholas Taleb's multiple epic burns on Pinker in his book  Skin in the Game: The Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life, I had to reassess my star rating after I stopped laughing. Basically,  Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are, and  But What If We're Wrong? Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past. You can't trust anything or anyone! Fake news! Still, this book provides a sweeping view that is very much appreciated, if not 100% infallible. "

Let us rid ourselves of scientific illiteracy, shed our primitive intuitions, and abolish our hopeful apocalyptic superstitions. Let this book be the spotlight that removes the shadows of ignorance from our echo-chamber brains. Crime, war, and famine rates are lower than they’ve ever been. GMOs, fertilizers, and vaccines have and continue to save billions of lives. The global standard of living has never been higher. In virtually every measurable way, life is better for us than it has ever been for any generation of humanity before us. True, Donald Trump is the president of the United States and average global temperatures are increasing. But those problems have solutions. Reason, science, and humanism.

37,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35-michael-siliski,4,"Recommended for anyone interested in a wake-up call about the progress made over the past few centuries.Enlightenment Now makes the case that the ideals of reason, science, and humanism have driven the greatest advances in the history of human civilization over the past few centuries. The book is divided into three parts: the history of the enlightenment, the progress we’ve made, and the enlightenment ideals that must be defended going forward. However, the meat of the book, and Pinker’s passion, is clearly the middle section, which is a thorough and data-based walk through fifteen areas where human lives are almost indistinguishably improved from just 10 generations ago, including health, peace, freedom, inequality, the environment, and happiness. Pinker’s enemies are “progressophobes” on both the right (the anti-science forces, the Trumpian politics of grievance) and left (New York Times-style liberal handwringing and catastrophizing). Both sides are prone to populism and a desire to return to an imagined utopian past. Pinker is successful in his main goal of thoroughly debunking that such a past ever existed.Enlightenment Now has a lot in common with Hans Rosling’s Factfulness, which I wrote about recently. Pinker is quite a bit longer and goes much deeper, so if you’re the type to ask for the data backing each claim, this might be the better book for you. I also thought Pinker was much more successful in grounding his celebration of human progress in a memorable framework.Both books suffer from a relentless optimism that can feel a bit strident at times. For Pinker, I thought this was most evident in his discussions of inequality and happiness, both of which felt a bit blithe to me. I think there is good reason to reject the most pessimistic takes on these: that more wealth doesn’t make people any happier or even that people are less happy these days, that inequality within a society is far more important than absolute means. Pinker does a good job making the case that inequality is not equivalent to poverty, and that “in some ways the world has become less equal, but in more ways the world’s people have become better off.” He makes a compelling argument that happiness is directly related to wealth, in particular using Stevenson & Wolfers studies. But these are not the same as proving “the irrelevance of inequality to happiness” or demonstrating that individual happiness is primarily driven by wealth. I thought these sections would be stronger if they didn’t reach quite so far.I agree with Pinker that reason, science, and humanism are critically important to human well-being globally, and these days it does feel a defense of them is needed. While I doubt that many who disagree with the thesis would even pick this book up, Pinker does make a similar point to Rosling that many of the most well-educated, including academics, are unaware of how much progress actually has been made through Enlightenment ideals. So perhaps there is hope that books like this could have a positive influence.From: https://medium.com/@msiliski/enlighte..."
38,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13941368-bakunin,4,"I usually wait a while to write a review of a book in order to digest all the important aspects of the work and this is certainly true in this case as well. Being somewhat of a libertarian with conservative leanings I found this book to be both illuminating as well as challenging. This book is Pinkers best attempt to defend the enlightenment; that is to say humanism, science and reason. He goes through many aspects quantitatively to prove his point - health, inequality, evironment, peace, safety, equal rights, quality of life etc - and all these things seem to be going in the right direction. Countries which are more democratic and more liberal are happier. This is essentially a more scientific defense of what Popper called ""the open society"". Although I find it refreshing to read a somewhat optimistic book in the midst of all the usual gloom one encounters in the daily press, I find myself in disagreement with Pinker. I agree with Pinker in that we are living the best possible time but what bothers me is the fact that I believe that the welfare state won't be able to sustain this growth (or progress if you will). Although Pinker has a certain classical liberal leaning, he is not very worried about the implications of an ever expanding welfare state: the destruction of the family, mass immigration, and the infantilization of citizens in the west. His liberal predilection is also shown by his apparent scorn of Trump and 'populism'. I suppose that this is where the rubber meets the road - I believe that communities are necessary and that the individual is not a tabula rasa. I also strongly reject the notion of an enlightened elite telling people how to better live their lives. While my values often may coincide with Pinkers, I believe in a slow and organic change in society, rather than a forced political one. Pinker by contrast scorns tribalist behavior and finds this to be reactionary; a force to be fought with a scientific mind. Although I have a certain buddhist leaning myself, I am slowly becoming more convinced of the need to be a person in modern society and the need therefore to retain certain elements of tribalism. Where to draw this line is however unclear. "

It's not every day that you hear someone like Gates recommend their favorite book of all time. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed. The premise of the book is that, as humanity, we are much better off nowadays than ever before in history. Pinker draws on many statistics, graphs, and facts to show that is indeed the reality. While I love that premise and couldn't agree more (we need more of those reminders in the age of 24h media) I found the language and general style a bit hard to read and unpleasant to a reader - it read a bit too much like a textbook and too often felt like going through well researched and academic in nature Powerpoint slides. The book could have easily been three times shorter and would drive the points home more effectively. Nonetheless, the points are important and if you've never read anything about how far we have come as humanity I do recommend the book. I recently saw ""The Final Year"" - a documentary about Barafh Obama's last year in office and how his foreign policy team operated during the time of a divisive, and later shocking, election. At one point Obama says that history does not follow a straight line, rather it zigs and zags, there's ups and downs, but it's our job to make sure the trend continues upward. And that trend is what the ""Enlightenment Now"" is all about."

Pinker was named one of Time Magazine’s 100 most influential people in the world in 2004 and his books are regularly featured in the best-selling lists. While the purpose of this book is commendable – to show with extensive use of data that we are living in the best of times – two reasons made me cringe while reading it. Firstly, the author completely misses the mark on the topic I have dedicated part of my professional life for the past 10+ years: climate change. Second, it doesn’t address the plastic pollution that is cursing our oceans.To read the rest of the review, please check out my blog post: http://www.edouardstenger.com/2018/03..."

42,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"I listened to this as an audiobook & it was good, but he has a lot of graphs so quick reference to the PDF is a big plus. There are also sections where it's nice to reread his thoughts, although most are straightforward enough that it's not necessary. His writing is clean & uncluttered. It follows a logical progression.There are 3 sections:1) Enlightenment2) Progress3) Reason, Science, & HumanismThe first two sections are great. I've read about the Age of Ignorance, its history, & its benefits before, but his is one of the best as he proves the benefit of the scientific method to mankind through some very telling statistics. I loved the section on how much wealth we now have comparatively. I've read comparisons about the cost of an hour of light, but it always impresses me. He shows how much less violence, starvation, & disease there is. So why do we think the world is in such danger? He thinks it's due mostly to brain bugs & loud extremists both on the left & right.The last section ""Reason, Science, & Humanism"" was preaching to the choir. It was long & boring at times. There was a lot of good information in it & while I agreed with him in general, he went over the top or underplayed several things. For instance, he seems to consider an existential threat as serious only if they'll kill off most people. He fails to mention how horrific a tragedy which abruptly killed 1% of our population would be (1% of 7 billion is 700 million!) or what the loss of an entire city could do to our society. IIRC, some have said it could take as little as losing 10% of the population to bring down our civilization since it is incredibly interconnected. Something like a nationwide outage of electric could be catastrophic even if it lasted a fairly short time. Cities only have a few days worth of food & places like LA rely on a lot of infrastructure. Millions are living in a desert, an area where the first settlement didn't make it.His thoughts on nuclear bombs were very simplistic & incomplete. Hindsight of what the Kremlin would have actually done during the Cold War based on records we're now reading is armchair quarterbacking at its worst. He also didn't get into the options of nuclear bombs like tactical nukes. I remember some talking heads discussing how great the tactical nuke option was going to be at one point. It was insane! Apparently he doesn't believe how close we were to annihilation.Worse, he dismissed the effect of the atomic bombs we did drop saying that the Japanese surrendered because the Russians were entering their area of the war. That's ridiculously simplistic, just one of many factors & I don't believe it was the deciding one. The Japanese were out of everything & the Allies were pushing them back in force. Kamikazes weren't their first choice as weapons, but born of desperation. In March, Tokyo was bombed by something like 300 planes - nothing like Dolittle's desperate raid of a few years before. It was a huge force with horrific results, but it was also understandable & they knew we couldn't afford it too often. In August, one plane dropped one bomb that was about as bad. A few days later, we repeated the trick. They didn't know the cost or how many more we had. How can anyone dismiss that?It's crazy hard to get fissionable materials, but they aren't the only nuclear threat. It's a lot easier to get radioactive waste & spread it around with conventional explosives. It doesn't take a genius & if it or a biological/chemical agent is put in the right place, someplace upwind. It could be devastating. Not an end of the world catastrophe, but up there with the Twin Towers. I don't think it's particularly likely, but everyone thought Clancy's novel, Debt of Honor (1994) was just unlikely fiction, too. If you haven't read it, a guy crashes a jet into Congress & pretty much wipes them all out. This was 7 years before 9/11, but airline security didn't change so his dismissive attitude towards terrorists seems a bit over done. Still, I generally agreed with him. We can be too anxious. Current airline security is a good example, but there are a lot of smart people trying to keep us safe. We're walking a tightrope between safety & losing our freedoms. Our anxiety only makes the latter more likely, so I'm glad of his perspective.Overall, it's a good book. If you're super religious or a big Trump supporter, you'll probably dislike the last section especially. Pinker beats on both sides of the aisle, but the anti-humanist & anti-science of the current administration is in front of us now, so he gives a lot of good reasons for his negative opinions.Highly recommended in any format, but do get the PDF with the audiobook. Very well narrated."

What is progress? You might think that the question is so subjective and culturally relative as to be forever unanswerable. In fact, it’s one of the easier questions to answer. Most people agree that life is better than death. Health is better than sickness. Sustenance is better than hunger. Abundance is better than poverty. Peace is better than war. Safety is better than danger. Freedom is better than tyranny. Equal rights are better than bigotry and discrimination. Literacy is better than illiteracy. Knowledge is better than ignorance. Intelligence is better than dull-wittedness. Happiness is better than misery. Opportunities to enjoy family, friends, culture, and nature are better than drudgery and monotony. All these things can be measured. If they have increased over time, that is progress. 
The subtitle of Enlightenment Now is: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, and as someone who has benefitted from all of these – in all of the ways enumerated in the opening quote – I don't know to what extent I needed the “case to be made” for these values. The difficulty I had is that while author Steven Pinker does define and defend each of these principles throughout the book, he is actually attempting to make the case for optimism – as though the entire world today has progressed in the direction of betterment (to greater or lesser degrees), as a direct result of Enlightenment thinkers, and as there isn't any problem facing us that can't be solved by doubling down on Enlightenment thinking and the advancement of science and technology, anyone who tends to pessimism (whether over the environment, existential angst, or the rise of populism and despotism) simply needs a long history lesson about all the ways in which things have gotten better and better. Pinker includes more than seventy graphs with pleasing curves (trending up or down over time, depending on whether they're tracking positive or negative metrics), he provides double, or even triple, digit footnotes for each chapter (assuring me that every statement he makes is backed by published sources), and with thirty fine-print pages of references at the end, I couldn't possibly track them all down in order to reach my own conclusions about the state of the world. The reader is repeatedly asked to take Dr. Pinker's word for it that everything is progressing well (towards a place of measurable betterment for humanity), and as I found myself often squirming with the uneasiness of not just wanting to take his word for it, and as I also found myself without the informational/philosophical background from which to dispute his arguments, I couldn't always follow where Pinker wanted to lead me; often as impatient with myself as with him. I'm glad I read this book – at least in an effort to understand what the big debates of our time might be – but I just don't have the knowledge base to properly respond to Pinker's arguments; three stars reflects my not taking a stand on this one.So, I'll make an aesthetic judgment: Pinker stretched my concentration with his frequent philosophical references to hermeneutics, dialectics, ontological this and that, but when he would descend to informal/hippie references to presumably lighten things up (many retirees are happy “seeing the national parks in a Winnebago, or dandling Vera, Chuck, and Dave in a cottage on the Isle of Wight”; drivers safely enjoy the pleasures of “seeing the USA in their Chevrolet, or just cruising down the streets, feeling out of sight, spending all their money on a Saturday night”), I found the writing forced, or worse, anachronistic. And I grew impatient with Pinker's smugly rhetorical strawman-punchline gags:
There is no law of complex systems that says that intelligent agents must turn into ruthless conquistadors. Indeed, we know of one highly advanced form of intelligence that evolved without this defect. They’re called women.
Or:
Of course, one can always imagine a Doomsday Computer that is malevolent, universally empowered, always on, and tamperproof. The way to deal with this threat is straightforward: don't build one.
Other ideas that made me squirm: Pinker stresses the need for rational thinking and the belief that the scientific method is the only way of measuring the world (using that, at a stroke, to dismiss human consciousness as a mere byproduct of evolution and the nonexistence of gods as an accepted fact). History progresses in one direction, and so long as we continue to embrace Enlightenment thinking and turn to science to solve our problems, there will be no environmental doomsday, no nuclear wars, no real terrorist threat to democracy, no Singularity (no “foom”). Pinker insists that science is politically bipartisan and he takes swipes at the anti-progressivism of the left (those who are reflexively anti-GMO, anti-vaccine, anti-nuclear) and the anti-intellectualism of the right (those who are creationists, anti-immigration, protectionist), and while that might make him seem a neutral party, Pinker never misses an opportunity to name President Trump as the anti-Enlightenment bogeyman who could reverse centuries of human progress. And since, as I pointed out, I don't feel qualified to confront Pinker on his facts, here is some of the professional response to Enlightenment Now (note: I chose to share reviews from left-slanting sources in order to prevent partisan fakenewsmanship):From the (officially bipartisan but purportedly leftwing) Australian public broadcaster, ABC –Pinker never seems to see the force of the question: How do we know that all this did not take place in spite of, rather than because of, the Enlightenment? In fact, he doesn't even pretend to go to the trouble of establishing a causal connection between his contentious version of the Enlightenment and the various improvements that he imagines follow in its wake. Post hoc, ergo propter hoc seems to be the operative principle. From New Statesman, a British newsmagazine that self-describes as having a “liberal, sceptical political position” –Judged as a contribution to thought, Enlightenment Now is embarrassingly feeble. With its primitive scientism and manga-style history of ideas, the book is a parody of Enlightenment thinking at its crudest. A more intellectually inquiring author would have conveyed something of the Enlightenment’s richness and diversity. Yet even if Pinker was capable of providing it, intellectual inquiry is not what his anxious flock demands. Only an anodyne, mythical Enlightenment can give them what they crave, which is relief from painful doubt.From The Globe & Mail, a decidedly progressive Canadian daily newspaper –
Pinker's gripe is largely aesthetic. A prominent egghead who writes and composes himself with Spock-like coldness and clarity, he seems annoyed at the frenzy (and so, irrationality) of ""editorialists,"" ""climate justice warriors,"" ""relativists,"" and the ""politically correct"" left. What Pinker never substantially considers is that such frenzy – whether deployed as a deliberate political tactic, or manifesting as the sputtering incoherence of the true believer – may help mobilize the spirit of change and progress; dams and ditches of passion that channel the turbulent tides of Enlightenment. 
And from one such “frenzied climate justice warrior” at The Guardian, the British daily that famously tilts left –
Pinker insults the Enlightenment principles he claims to defend. Could he have succumbed to the motivated reasoning these principles are supposed to suppress? If the environmental crisis cannot be so easily dismissed, it threatens his argument that life is steadily improving. What looks like a relentless enhancement in human welfare could emerge instead as an interlude between one form of deprivation and the next.
The bottom line: I slogged through this long read, encouraged by its optimism, but unconvinced by its argument. I was further annoyed by my own inability to articulate my increasingly negative response to Pinker's thesis, and recognise that as my own failing; I remain uncertain that I've adequately outlined my objections even with the addition of other reviewers' voices. Even so, I'm glad to have read this book and would recommend it to anyone interested in what “the eggheads” are talking about."
44,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5979619-boudewijn,3,"In this book, Steven Pinker wants to provide insight in the fruits of the Enlightenment and that the norms and values are still as important as everContrary to what you might believe, the world is in a much better shape than ever. Whether it is life expectancy, welfare, peace, democracy, knowledge or prosperity, there is not better moment to live than now.Most of the pages are dedicated with scores of statistics, all showing that things are going well. World life expectancy has doubled from 30 years (1800) to 71,4 years (2015). The world’s GDP has increased a 100 times and - despite the growing population - the number of people living in abject poverty is decreasing.But what about the challenges we’re facing today? The deplorable state of nature, extinctions and climate change? Yes, Steven Pinker acknowledges that these challenges exist, but where other relapse in doom scenario’s. Pinker advocates for a continuation of an optimal relation between (economic) progress and pollution. If humanity wants to survive, it needs to invest in progress itself: only after achieving a certain amount of welfare, people are willing to invest in (and sacrifice themselves for) a better environment. In other words, keep investing in the core values of the Enlightenment: rationalism, science and humanism. And yes, this includes nuclear energy, as a clean way of energy.In the last part of the book, Pinker delves into the current problems of the left and the right. The left thinks that the world is being plagued by inequality and the environment being endangered, the right think that his ‘culture’ is being destroyed by immigrations and minorities. Fact and figures that show that this is not the case, are being falsified or simply denied.The problem that I had with this book was its lack of nuance. He knows, or thinks he knows all, and does not refrain from his mantra that all is well, and will be well. There is no room for any considerations for those who - even today - might not be living their lives to their full capacity. Not because they don’t want to, but because they are simply kept from achieving it.

45,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48909861-dan-ust,4,"Overall a good book, though I believe Pinker overstates his case and is too narrowly focused on the Enlightenment itself — as if all progress were waiting for the 18th century to really start. This is strange given his earlier book, _The Better Angels of Our Nature_, where he documents the reduction in violence from the Stone Age on.He minimizes things like improved capabilities, while fine in themselves, can also breed greater risks. He does recognize this in the case of nuclear weapons. (One can argue that both ways: maybe nuclear deterrence has reduced or ended wars between major powers. But the devastation of one such weapon is certainly progress of a type many would question.)Also, he has what might best be called stylistic ticks. These wouldn’t be as bad in a brief talk, but became more vexing to me as I read the near 500 pages of the main text. (There are extensive footnotes worth mining too. I’ve read or skimmed a number of the works he cites.) By these I mean he seems to have to reword adages or quote songs and the like for somewhat comic effect. This works sometimes, but when it feels like every section must have one or two, it feels like padding in an already long work.I winced a little at his oversimplification of intellectual history, too, though I believe his trashing of Nietzsche is spot on. I winced further at his seeming to think the ruling class simply wants the best for everyone rather than it’s often resistant to progress and benefits from “gloom and doom” attitudes. (Politicians don’t run on the slogan that things are okay and getting better. Instead, election campaigns are morality plays where good is battling evil, where one side will redeem us and move is forward from the collapsing state we find ourselves in while the other wishes to push society over a cliff.)In many ways, too, Pinker’s work is an update of that of economist Julian Simon. One can argue that Pinker will have a greater impact because he’s not an economist and, despite my reservations above, is a much more accessible and wittier writer. (To be fair, it’s been a while since I’ve read Simon.)Ian Goldin also wrote a balanced review for Nature:https://www.nature.com/articles/d4158..."
46,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"This book was simply amazing. I've read the whole thing in less than two weeks. The material was very captivating, and the chapters in the book are well organized, allowing for natural breaks. Steven Pinker, the author, provides a rational and balanced view of the current state of humankind, how we got here, and where we're headed. He dives into vital topics directly and doesn't hold back or avoid anything. The book covers topics such as wealth, health, quality of life, society as a whole, climate change, education, and a lot more.The information shared is also backed up by real data which is quite refreshing. We're all surrounded with so much negativity from the mainstream news which can make the world seem like a terrible place to live in. And with this book, what I enjoyed was the more balanced presentation of the data without resorting to fear-mongering, which is so common these days with clickbait media.If you have any doubts, this book will open your eyes to the fact that we're all living in the best time for humankind since the beginning of our existence and things are getting better.As much as I enjoyed the optimistic viewpoint on certain topics in this book, I also like the fact that the author didn't exclude critical areas we as humans need to work on — one of those being climate change.There's very little doubt about the current situation with climate change and the urgency at which we need to operate to avoid a global disaster. The truth is, we all have to step up and do our part as this presents one of the biggest challenges for humankind yet.Overall, this book is a great read, and I highly recommend it. It covers so many important areas, and I'm glad I decided to read it. I have no doubts you'll enjoy it as much as I did."
47,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5196256-mindy,1,"I read this because Bill Gates highly recommended it, and because I felt I needed a more optimistic view of the progress of humanity. Why did I think Bill Gates’ reading list would hold any interest for me? This book is simply further evidence that all data can be manipulated to achieve a purpose. If you include yourself among the world’s wealthiest “citizens”, this is a great read to assuage any hint of privilege-related guilt you may feel. The extremely poor are in decline, and if the bulk of humanity is now simply poor, they should be content with their plight and thank their overlords from lifting them out of the squalor. I kept reading hoping for a redeeming moment. It never happened."
48,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"In 2011 Steven Pinker wrote a magnificent book, The Better Angels of our Nature, in which he showed – by using historical analysis, statistical methods and informed estimates – how the world has gotten safer (hence the subtitle of the book: The Decline of Violence). The gist of the book was that there have been continuous social reforms that have led to an environment in which our inner demons have fewer opportunities to surface and in which zero-sum games have been turned into positive-sum games. In 2017, Pinker followed up his 2011 work by extending his scientific method to the whole scale of human progress. In Enlightenment Now he wants to show us how the world not only got safer, but also became a much more pleasant place to live in – for almost all human beings that are born. Pinker wants to show us that this progress wasn’t inevitable: it was a conscious effort of human beings to start – for the first time in history – to apply reason to the goal of making the world a better place to live. This is important, since it shows us to not be complacent and to take all the gains for granted. Pinker tries to convince us readers that the Enlightenment values that drove this progress have to be remembered by and re-stated to each new generation.The book itself is divided into three parts; I will briefly summarize each part in the rest of this review.In part 1, Pinker describes how in the Enlightenment era people started to use reason to understand the world (science) and to distinguish right from wrong (ethics). No more witch hunts; no more mythologies; no more harsh punishments; etc. According to Pinker, mankind has to fight continuously against three natural entities: (1) entropy (the increasing of disorder), (2) evolution (the competition of all against all; zero-sum games), and (3) information (increasing our knowledge). In this fight, reason is the most important, and only, tool that we have to – temporarily – create a good place to live for ourselves. Pinker sees two contemporary threats to this ideal though: religion and populism (left- and rightwing). His goal of the rest of the book is hence; first to show that real progress has taken place; and next, to convince us that this progress was driven by Enlightenment values that have to be defended. So, in part 2 of the book Pinker applies the scientific method to analyze the different domains of human progress. He uses lots of graphs and he meticulously describes all the relevant scientific findings – just like he did in his 2011 book on the decline of violence. In short, people live longer; are healthier; are economically better off, even though inequality increases; the environment is (slowly) better off and the climate change fatalism is misguided (especially in light of all the technological advances); the world is more peaceful and safer than ever, while terrorism is a minor (insignificant) blip; democracy and equal rights are strongly instituted; and knowledge is readily accessible for masses of people and ever-progressing. In the closing chapters of part 2, Pinker also states that the newer generations are much happier, healthier and experience a much higher quality of life than earlier generations. Within generations this progress is also visible. The hailed existential threats to progress – technological enslavement and nuclear war – are serious issues but there really is no reason to be scared shitless: human beings, according to Pinker, are better and better equipped to turn zero-sum games into positive-sum games (i.e. turning existential threats into cooperated effort to ward off disaster). Pinker finishes part 2 by claiming that progress, even though contingent (i.e. depending on human choices), is a self-enhancing cycle: as the world is better off each year, countries will tend to cooperate more and more and living conditions of all human beings will tend to increase. Minor setbacks, such as the Trump presidency and the Brexit referendum, cannot stop the long-term trend of ever-increasing progress.After showing us how much the world has progressed, Pinker turns his book into an essay. In part 3 he makes a case for three Enlightenment values that are, according to him, essential to actively promote and continue the progress we have already made. The first of these values is reason, which is under increasing attack by generations of postmodernists (“objective reality doesn’t exist”, “all cultures are equal”, etc.) and populists (“the will of the people should be followed”, “we need a strong leader”, etc.). Next to these two ideologies, human beings suffer from biases and hence the media portray a picture of a world that is almost continuously on the brink of World War III. Pinker, essentially, advocates a more rational public discourse, in which fact checking and statistical reasoning trump Trumpism (pun intended).The second value Pinker advocates is science. In other words: trial and error. Not just to gain more knowledge and hence receive more control over our lives (by fighting diseases, natural disasters, etc.), but also to base our policies on. Politics, according to Pinker, should be more evidence-based and less ideology-driven. This is the old argument of piecemeal social engineering promoted by Karl Popper: changing policy in small steps; measuring and evaluating the results of each step; and adjusting where necessary.Pinker notices a trend in literary and cultural circles, especially due to scientifically illiterate self-proclaimed intellectuals, to blackball science and act like science is the root of all evil. The truth is that science is a-moral – in the sense that it doesn’t say whether we should build a-bombs, nuclear reactors for energy, or both, and in which situation – and that science offers us the possibility to better our lives. It is due to science that we live longer, healthier and wealthier.The third and last value that Pinker advocates is humanism. Humanism is the answer to the problem of the a-morality of science: it tells us what to do with all the knowledge, wealth and technological possibilities. Pinker uses the ethics of one of the founders of the Enlightenment, Spinoza. According to Spinoza, any human being that is governed by reason will wish for any other human the same things as they wish for themselves. This is a strong ethical imperative, and Pinker uses the rest of the chapter to state it more fully (in short: consequentialism) and to refute the two counter-narratives: religious morals (which are, according to Pinker, humanized by humanism – with the exception of Islam) and populism/nationalism (which are inspired by the ethics of Nietzsche’s Übermensch and heroism).All of the above is my try to summarize Pinker’s thoughts as honest and representative as possible. Of course this is practically impossible: the book is huge and Pinker is much nuanced on all of the themes mentioned. But: what to think of it all?First, I applaud Pinker for stating clearly how far we have come since the 16th century: how much better off human beings are in the 21st century world. As Pinker himself repeats, it is trendy to be a cultural pessimist. All this liberalism and progress has led to atomized societies and hedonistic, empty lives. It is also very fancy to be a fatalist, especially regarding the environment and climate. Pinker's book is a healthy antidote to all this doom-thinking and the masses of studies and graphs he uses to back up his arguments make cultural pessimism and climate fatalism hard to sustain.Second, I think Pinker is right in seeing humanism, reason and science as the driving forces behind the world we live in nowadays. It is only when reason is set aside – consciously or unconsciously – that progress halts and that we fall back on our primitive nature and zero-sum value systems. I think he is also right in describing the two major threats to the world as we know it: religious morality and populism (again, left- as well as rightwing). So in all this, Enlightenment Now is a terribly accurate and timely book.But I do disagree with some of Pinker’s observations, especially the ones on happiness and quality of life. I cannot help but reflect that Enlightenment Now is written by a Harvard professor whose life is spent on creative thinking and intellectual effort to understand the world. I don’t think many of us can share this luxury, and that for many of us leading ‘normal lives’ life isn’t as fulfilling or free as we wish. Pinker’s line of argument is (albeit simplified): younger generations suffer less from addictions; commit fewer suicides; suffer less from depression; etc.; hence, they are happier than earlier generations and have a higher quality of life. I don’t know if the amount of suicides and depressions says anything (or much) about the happiness of people. And another problem with this line of thinking – which really surfaces throughout the whole book – is that it generalizes over everyone. It is entirely possible that certain parts of the population are worse off, but that this negative effect is swamped by an exponential increase of happiness by the rest of the population. For example, due to globalization, the world is better off, and the poorest people and the poorest countries are the real gainers in health and wealth; yet the (lower) middle classes and lower classes in richer countries are really worse off than earlier generations – combined with an ever-increasing decline of social mobility. The same thing goes with people in vulnerable professions or in vulnerable life situations: handicapped people, sick people, old people, etc. In all developed countries we see an ever-increasing jungle of rules and regulations, to guarantee an equal treatment for all people in like situations. This sounds beautiful and noble, but it results in health care workers clocking five minutes for washing elderly people; treating schoolchildren as revenue and future tax payers; making people who depend on social welfare end up in mazes of bureaucracy; etc. Is this truly progress? (Of course, Pinker would counter: would they be better off in the nineteenth century?)My point is that statistics are useful to describe general trends and to understand what causes play a role. When we understand what factors make the world a better place to live in, we can apply more of the same potion. Understanding is fundamental. But scientific studies of subjects like happiness - even apart from all the methodological issues involved - are rather empty when we're dealing with our own personal lives and our loved ones around us. Stating, for example, that more people are better off and that poverty declines, is a rather meaningless statement when talking to someone who just lost his or her job because his or her employer moved to a developing country. Personally, I think the diffusion of liberalism, the results of equal rights movements (including feminism), and decades of migration have led to a diminishing social cohesion in Western societies – and between countries worldwide. This is, for example, illustrated by contemporary elections: a huge assembly of small political factions and an increasingly polarized climate. It is also illustrated by the popularity of identity politics, in which individuals base their personal identity on biological and cultural traits. Western societies have degraded into collections of individuals without much common ground. Hence, all the rules and regulations to enforce equality: people don’t trust each other anymore – or at least less than before. I cannot help but remark that in Sweden there are plans to make laws to make two adults consent to have sexual intercourse - as if the intricate and complex dealings in real life can be translated and enforced by abstract laws. The same applies to the laws against islamophobia that the Canadian parliament put into practice in 2017. This is symptomatic of societies lacking social cohesion and reciprocal trust and commitment.I think Pinker is over-optimistic when it comes to a better world. He does notice an increase in global and national inequality and declining social mobility, but he doesn’t see it as serious arguments against progress. Of course, from a macro-perspective, the world is better off and this is a good thing. But people don’t like grim futures and this can become very problematic in countries in which large swathes of the population have to give up health and wealth to transfer it to developing countries – something which is inevitable if the world economy continues the way it does now. I think the safe thing to say is that Enlightenment Now is a reliably optimistic book on how the world as a whole is much better off in 2018 than in 1618. The causes of this progress are humanism, reason and science. On a grand scale, Pinker’s book is an important reminder of the possibilities of human progress – if/when we set our minds to it we can do a lot to better our lives. Yet by zooming out, Pinker steers around the (equally important) question of a declining standard of life for individuals and particular social groups and a feeling of loss of social cohesion. Yet, these last points weren’t the goal of his book, so I shouldn’t end this review on such a sour note. It’s a very interesting and readable book: read it!"
49,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1139239-michael-austin,4,"Steven Pinker is a rare creature in the academic world: a liberal who is not a leftist. As a liberal he supports things like free speech, civil rights, democratic ideals, and a strong government that ensures safety, protects the environment, and redistributes some portion of income to support education, health care, infrastructure, and the reduction of poverty. As a non-leftist, he supports things like a democratic government and a capitalist economy that, while subject to government regulation and income redistribution, still functions as a free market. Like most of Pinker’s books, Enlightenment Now is big and filled with lots of data, but actually very tightly argued. The sequence of his argument goes something like this:1.	In the eighteenth century, European intellectuals produced a movement that we call “the Enlightenment” that was built on four interrelated principles: reason, science, humanism, and progress. They set in motion revolutions in government, science, and culture that has shaped the world ever since. 2.	The Enlightenment worked. Over the last two and a half centuries, nearly every measure of human flourishing has increased dramatically across the world. People alive today are better educated, healthier, richer, and safer than they have ever been at any time in history. Major diseases have been wiped out by vaccination, extreme poverty has been substantially reduced by global markets, and war and violence have decreased to their lowest levels in world history.3.	Since its beginning, the Enlightenment has had to contend with “counter-Enlightenment” narratives from both the left and the right. Counter-Enlightenment narratives are those that portray the world as getting worse, either because people are falling away from religious belief and values (the conservative counter-narrative), or because capitalism has enervated the world for its own profit and turned 99% of people into labor machines that feed its insatiable greed (the leftist counter-narrative). 4.	The work of the Enlightenment is not finished. There is still poverty, war, and injustice. There are still threats to safety and to the environment. We still have many, many problems to solve. But these problems are best solved by using the tools of the Enlightenment (reason, science, and humanism) rather than by reverting to counter-Enlightenment narratives such as religious fundamentalism or Marxism to address them. As one who is, like Pinker, a liberal but not a leftist, I find myself agreeing with almost everything in this over-arching argument. Sure I have specific quibbles with all kinds of stuff. Pinker is not content to show that most things are a little bit better. He wants to be more comprehensive than that and show that everything is a lot better. And in the process, he often stretches his argument beyond what can be reasonably proved. But even adjusting for some hyperbole, the data he presents is overwhelmingly persuasive—not just that life has gotten better in the world since the 18th century, but that it has improved dramatically in just the last 30 years. During this time, extreme poverty has fallen from 50% of the world to 10%, the number of people killed in wars has fallen by 200%, criminal violence has decreased dramatically, cars are safer, more countries are democratic, and income inequality has decreased in all but the most developed nations. It seems to me that there is no reasonable way to refute the proposition that the world today is more amenable to human flourishing than it has ever been.But there are a whole lot of unreasonable ways to refute this, and this, really, is the most important part of the book. Pinker identifies two key cognitive biases that causes many people to reject the Enlightenment narrative that the world is getting better and embrace one of several counter-Enlightenment narratives that insist that the world is getting worse.The first of these biases is the “availability heuristic.” We have a lot more access to information than we have ever had before, so we see more of the bad stuff than anybody ever has. Our Internet and social media feeds immediately show us acts of racism, police brutality, mass violence, civil strife, and even genocide. We see these with much greater frequency, and when we do, our minds tell us that they are happening with greater frequency, which is generally not the case. But don’t try to tell us that, because we probably won’t believe it.The more troubling factor in our tendency to see a world in decline is the confirmation bias, which simply means that we tend to see what confirms our beliefs and ignore what does not. And we are attracted to narratives of decline because they fit with so many ready-made world views. They are, in fact, an indispensable part of contemporary politics.“We are doing well, but we need to do better” is not a good political message. “We are in decline and need to make America great again” is. And herein lies the fundamental attraction to narratives that cannot be supported by reason or data. We want to believe that things are getting worse, because this is the best way to accomplish political and religious goals. These narratives create fear, and fear motivates us to vote, to donate to politicians, to attend Church, to donate to Churches, and to agitate for change. We can do this through reason and science, of course, but it doesn’t work as well. And this is probably Pinker’s most important point: we are in danger of losing much of the progress that we have made as a nation, and as a world, by rejecting the principles responsible for that progress and embracing narratives that emphasize tribalism, magical thinking, resentment, and unwarranted fear. In the United States, we are rolling back the government regulations that have kept us safe and improved our environment, and we currently have an administration that insists that global relations are a zero-sum game. Globally, people are rejecting the vaccines that wiped out diseases and attacking the advances in food technology that have dramatically reduced hunger and poverty. Countries that once embraced secularism and democracy are starting to turn to religious fundamentalism. We are abandoning things that work in favor of things that won’t. And this is very dangerous. It is possible to argue with almost everything that Pinker says in Enlightenment Now. But those arguments must also adopt Enlightenment principles: showing where his reason fails, providing better evidence, rejecting conclusions that he makes because they are not adequately supported. This kind of debate is necessary and proper.Unfortunately, this is not the debate that we are having. Across the political spectrum, the Enlightenment ideals that Pinker champions are being refuted from fundamentally illiberal and unenlightened positions with a strong interest in making the world seem like a fetid hell hole that is only a moment away from the apocalypse. These arguments are dangerous because they appeal to the kind of thinking that caused most of our problems in the first place."
50,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,5,"There is no one alive who writes with the mind-sweeping clarity and breadth of knowledge that Steven Pinker possesses. Though there are other works of his that are perhaps more revolutionary (The Blank Slate) or ambitious in their singular explanatory power (How the Mind Works), it is this latest volume of his that is his most timely and all-encompassing cerebral broom.If the idea of needing to defend Enlightenment values is mysterious to you at this point then I can only pity you your global-scale ignorance or apathy. In Pinker, that cause of defense has found its most able champion. Offering an incredible array of 75 statistical graphs that are properly contextualized and interpreted, he has produced such an incredibly coherent and well-argued line of thinking that has enough independent and objective fact to annoy partisans of both sides of the political/philosophical spectrum. Much of the work seems to follow-up on several of the arguments brought forth in his previous volume, ""The Better Angels of Our Nature."" Following a deft summary as to what Enlightenment ideals and practices are, Pinker proceeds to show just how they have benefited society and the world as a whole ever since, where they have come up short, and recommends several new usages of these ideas for future mutual benefit. Along the way he casts off so many misconceptions and anecdotal ""arguments"" against the Enlightenment, something long overdue in writings by contemporary intellectuals who - alarmingly and genuinely stupidly - have distanced themselves from these values. This is not done with flippant casuistry or mere rhetorical prolepsis but with relentless data and cogent, in-depth examination. Some telling and amusing samples from the work include:""If you extol reason, then what matters is the integrity of the thoughts, not the personalities of the thinkers.""""While a vision of world peace may have given John and Yoko some good songs, it is hopelessly naïve in the real world.""""However long it takes, we must not let the existence of cognitive and emotional biases or the spasms of irrationality in the political arena discourage us from the Enlightenment ideal of relentlessly pursuing reason and truth.""This is the book of the year, no question. No one has this diverse array of knowledge, no one marshals their facts better, and no one does so with the ease of language that Dr. Pinker presents across a work of 500+ pages. In closing I will let him sum up one of the major points of this monumental achievement: ""Remember your math: an anecdote is not a trend. Remember your history: the fact that something is bad today doesn't mean it was better in the past. Remember your philosophy: one cannot reason that there's no such thing as reason, or that something is true or good because God said it is. And remember your psychology: much of what we know isn't so, especially when our comrades know it too."""
51,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58890815-andrii-zakharov,5,"There are a lot of bad reviews of Steven Pinker's new book out there, mostly arguing against some of his particular points taken out of context, putting words in his mouth, falsely attributing some agenda to him, or simply twisting his words. But reading the book attentively, one can't help but notice how much thought went into Pinker's formulations, and how careful he is with what he is saying and showing. The one detailed review I can recommend which appreciates the precision and is not politically loaded is Scott Aaronson's: https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p....Here, I will only give my brief impression. First, I must admit that I found some chapters in the book stronger than others. This is to be expected of a work that attempts to cover the whole span of the human condition across history, and do so in an exclusively data-driven, empirical way. For some developments, there is just not enough good data available, and so some of the conjectures and estimates will necessarily be better supported than others. That said, taken as a whole, Enlightenment Now is an exceptional piece of popular scholarship, providing a most enjoyable review of all the relevant aspects of human life. Page after page, figure after figure, relentlessly hammering home the crucial point way too many of us are unaware of: the world and our lives in it are continually getting better, along almost every conceivable dimension. One could argue at length about the data in each and every chapter. One could rightly point out that some of it is one-sided, that his historical accounts are incomplete and some of the conclusions premature. But the sheer weight of evidence makes it impossible to deny the central points:* life has been, and is, getting better for ever more people in ever more places* it is happening as we create new knowledge and use it to gradually solve problems* problems are inevitable, new ones will always arise, but problems are also solvable, given the right knowledge* the best system we have to create new knowledge is science* continuing to gradually improve our institutions will continue to bring incremental progress* we are facing many dangers, some of them existential, which call for unprecedented global cooperation and knowledge production to overcome* the ideas outlined above are, sadly, time and again attacked by hostile ideologies from all sides of the political spectrum, and have to be defended if we are to continue our progress.These points were made very persuasively in the course of the book, and appear to me of paramount importance. Reading Enlightenment Now significantly shifted my worldview towards conditional future optimism, motivating to work very hard to sustain our amazing progress so far."
52,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"Pinker builds on his previous book The Better Angels of Our Nature to make a strong case for enlightenment values.His writing is excellent and always an absolute joy to read.He puts apparent contemporary reversals of progress in perspective. He defends humanism. He pulls no punches discussing religion. He weighs in on economics as key to those Better Angels. He wipes the floor with Friedrich Nietzsche and his intellectual heritage in fascism, Nazism, etc. He backs up everything with scientific evidence. Even if sometimes the interpretation comes off a bit forced, he's still working on solid ground throughout the book."
53,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,5,"Steven Pinker was one of the first writers to kindle my passion for scientific thinking. When I read 
The Blank Slate
 in 2011, it exposed me to a host of intellectual disciplines that my undergraduate training in philosophy had neglected––most notably evolutionary psychology, skepticism, and the empirical foundations of human nature. Nearly a decade later, I am thrilled not only to have another opportunity to journey through Pinker’s impressive mind, but also that his chosen message is rooted in data-driven, responsible optimism. Given the psychological and political difficulties of 2017, I was on the verge of thinking that such optimism was nothing more than shrugging in the face of inevitable doom. But Enlightenment Now turned my frown upside down, made me feel good about being human again, and restored much of my belief that humanity still has a bright future (or many possible bright futures) ahead.If I could rename this book without worrying about marketing, my chosen title would be: Everybody Calm the Fuck Down: The Case for Sanity, by Steven Pinker. At a moment in global and American history when many citizens feel like the sky is continually falling, Enlightenment Now provides a hard-nosed critique of our tendency to indulge our inner Chicken Littles. Instead of taking the in vogue route of mining for new reasons why human civilization is inherently dishonorable and teetering on the brink of destruction, Pinker argues the exact opposite. To make his case, Pinker demonstrates that the Enlightenment, the great intellectual movement that precipitated the rise of modernity, has been a rollicking success:""This book is my attempt to restate the ideals of the Enlightenment in the language and concepts of the 21st century. I will first lay out a framework for understanding the human condition informed by modern science––who we are, where we came from, what our challenges are, and how we can meet them. The bulk of the book is devoted to defending those ideals in a distinctively 21st-century way: with data. This evidence-based take on the Enlightenment project reveals that it was not a naïve hope. The Enlightenment has worked––perhaps the greatest story seldom told. And because this triumph is so unsung, the underlying ideals of reason, science, and humanism are unappreciated as well. Far from being an insipid consensus, these ideals are treated by today’s intellectuals with indifference, skepticism, and sometimes contempt. When properly appreciated, I will suggest, the ideals of the Enlightenment are in fact stirring, inspiring, noble––a reason to live."" (5-6, emphasis his)This passage reveals both the considerable strengths and non-negligible weaknesses of Pinker’s position. Since I agree with Pinker’s outlook and think this book represents a hugely valuable contribution to the modern moment, I’ll deal with the chinks in his armor first and follow with praise. First, Pinker’s characterization of the Enlightenment’s success as “the greatest story seldom told” is an overstatement. I’d like to say it’s an overstatement that isn’t repeated in the rest of the text, but that wouldn’t be an honest appraisal. It’s my feeling that the Enlightenment-rejecting “intellectuals” in Pinker’s crosshairs––frustrating and myopic as they may be––do not represent a majority opinion in America or anywhere else. In fact, as Pinker points out, they do not even represent a majority of intellectuals:""During the 20th century, the landscape of human knowledge was carved into professionalized duchies, and the growth of science (particularly the sciences of human nature) is often seen as an encroachment on territories that had been staked and enclosed by the academic humanities. It’s not that practitioners of the humanities themselves have this zero-sum mindset. Most artists show no signs of it…Nor is the anxiety expressed by the scholars who delve into the historical epochs, genres of art, systems of ideas, and other subject matter in the humanities, since a true scholar is receptive to ideas regardless of their origin. The defensive pugnacity belongs to a culture: Snow’s Second Culture of literary intellectuals, cultural critics, and erudite essayists."" (389-90, emphasis his)This Second Culture is Pinker’s true enemy, and while he does a good job of calling them out directly in the latter chapters, some of his earlier assertions belie the genuine nuances that bolster the rest of the text. For example, the opening sentences of a chapter called “Progressophobia” read thus: “Intellectuals hate progress. Intellectuals who call themselves progressive really hate progress” (39, emphasis his). Such sweeping statements needlessly open a path for critics to characterize Pinker as nothing more than a Panglossian apologist for modernity; sadly, this path will be well-trodden given how Pinker has been villainized by the Second Culture and its acolytes (this review  is a good example). Here we find the downside of Pinker’s iconoclastic nature, which is not only the source of his intellectual vitality and undeniable wit, but also his most significant vulnerability.My other worry about this book is that, despite Pinker’s repeated claims that the Enlightenment’s success is not a justification for complacency in the face of extant problems, it may nevertheless end up playing that role in cultural and political discussions, as well as in the hearts and minds of readers. Over and over, Enlightenment Now caused me to take a deep breath and remind myself that things aren’t so bad, which is terrific for my personal health and state of mind, but probably not the best way to get me into the proverbial trenches solving humanity’s most difficult challenges. Of course, one of Pinker’s central claims is that the best way to fight those battles is to eschew unnecessary excitation in favor of calm calculation and reasoned negotiation. But I still worry that readers like myself––privileged first-worlders for whom modernity is working just fine––may utilize this perspective to thicken our own socioeconomic and ideological bubbles instead of heeding Pinker’s call to action. The lesson here is that Enlightenment Now represents just one important perspective amongst others, and should not be treated as a comprehensive guide to the world’s present state. In other words, it’s like any other intellectual endeavor.Okay, now for the fun stuff! As ever, Pinker has crafted a book that is engaging, cleanly written, and packed with dense and fascinating thoughts. Since this is a book about progress, we should start with Pinker’s chosen definition:""What is progress? You might think that the question is so subjective and culturally relative as to be forever unanswerable. In fact, it’s one of the easier questions to answer. Most people agree that life is better than death. Abundance is better than poverty. Peace is better than war. Safety is better than danger. Freedom is better than tyranny. Equal rights are better than bigotry and discrimination. Literacy is better than illiteracy. Knowledge is better than ignorance. Intelligence is better than dull-wittedness. Happiness is better than misery. Opportunities to enjoy family, friends, culture, and nature are better than drudgery and monotony. All these things can be measured. If they have increased over time, that is progress."" (51)Pinker is not posturing when he claims that these indicators of progress can be measured. His commitment to empiricism runs much deeper than that of most public intellectuals, as evidenced by the 70+ graphs/charts and 100 pages of notes/references that accompany his superb argumentation. While he is well aware that data generation is a flawed human process (404), the raw power of evidentiary convergence becomes increasingly undeniable as Pinker’s explication of progress unfolds over about 300 pages.In my view, Pinker’s most important insight about progress is this: “It’s in the nature of progress that it erases its tracks, and its champions fixate on the remaining injustices and forget how far we have come” (215). This dynamic can make progress very difficult to identify and acknowledge, since even a world that is improving will always create new obstacles during the process of rendering old ones obsolete: “Progress cannot be monotonic because solutions to problems always create new problems. But progress can resume when the new problems are solved in their turn” (44). While it may seem simplistic to some readers, I think Pinker’s characterization of the world’s difficulties as mere problems to be solved is a critical and often-elided truth that we need to rediscover. In a cultural milieu where doubling down on embattled ideological positions and demonizing one’s opponents is routine, it becomes heroic to refocus one’s attention and energy on discovering the empirical nature of a problem and following the road to solutions wherever it may lead.Of the seventeen topics Pinker addresses in his discussion of progress, the one that most pleased me was his chapter on the environment. This is a topic that many big thinkers still neglect, even though climate change is perhaps the most ominous long-term threat to the continuance of human progress. Pinker takes up the climate problem with distinctive poise, showing how sentimental, anti-industrial positions on the political left and denialist positions on the right have both failed to provide a viable platform for global climate action. He advocates for “Ecomodernism,” a nascent field of study founded on three tenets: (1) some degree of pollution is unavoidable due to the entropic nature of the universe, (2) industrialization has generally been good for humanity, and (3) technology is the primary tool we should use to mitigate environmental damage without relinquishing the myriad benefits of modern life (123-4).While Second Culturists will surely write Pinker off as an obsequious technocrat beguiled by the corrupt comforts of elite capitalist culture, a sober assessment of Ecomodernism reveals it as the most reasonable and realizable approach for dealing with climate change. Pinker advocates for a combination of solutions, including decarbonization, alternative energies, dematerialization, and nuclear power––no silver bullets here. His recommendations, especially on the nuclear issue, pay no heed to the entrenched ideological positions of climate warriors or denialists, but rather follow the evidence wherever it leads. Climate change is serious and daunting, but panicking and using it as an excuse to upend the economic and institutional foundations of progress is foolish. This message is starkest in Pinker’s takedown of Naomi Klein’s position that the only way to address climate change is to raze contemporary capitalism and rebuild it with a much heavier emphasis on centrally-planned economies. His critique was especially salutary for me, given that I was completely seduced by Klein’s point of view when I read This Changes Everything back in 2014. I love an opportunity to update my opinions and reflect on the informational and perspectival limitations of my past selves.Instead of succumbing to the idea that humanity must repent for the great sin of modernity, Pinker instead demonstrates that we can approach this daunting challenge with a rational maturity:""It’s time to retire the morality play in which modern humans are a vile race of despoilers and plunderers who will hasten the apocalypse unless they undo the Industrial Revolution, renounce technology, and return to an ascetic harmony with nature. Instead, we can treat environmental protection as a problem to be solved: how can people live safe, comfortable, and stimulating lives with the least possible pollution and loss of natural habitats?"" (134)As it has always been, the solution is to press forward using the human wellsprings of creativity and innovation; it does no good to nostalgically pine for previous eras when life for average folks and even most elites was much worse than today.Also laudable is Pinker’s defense of rationality, which is endangered by political partisanship and religious/magical thinking. Pinker’s rejection of political partisanship, which he likens to sports fandom, is particularly valuable (359-60). He lays out a battery of research showing how ideologues bend over backwards to deny their opponents the benefit of the doubt, then ties it off with a much-needed reminder that progress is not owned by any individual or group, but is rather the collective result of countless actions and shifts over time that can come from even the most unlikely places:""It should not be surprising that the facts of human progress confound the major -isms. The ideologies are more than two centuries old and are based on mile-high visions such as whether humans are tragically flawed or infinitely malleable, and whether society is an organic whole or a collection of individuals. A real society comprises hundreds of millions of social beings, each with a trillion-synapse brain, who pursue their well-being while affecting the well-being of others in complex networks with massive positive and negative externalities, many of them historically unprecedented. It is bound to defy any simple narrative of what will happen under a given set of rules. A more rational approach is to treat societies as ongoing experiments and open-mindedly learn the best practices, whichever part of the spectrum they come from."" (365)All of us are inescapably embedded in Pinker’s “real society,” and our ability to intelligently acknowledge and navigate this messy reality can stave off madness and keep progress coming.Enlightenment Now closes with Pinker’s celebration of humanism––a strong message that rehabilitated my humanist loyalties, which took a hit when I read Yuval Noah Harari’s 
Homo Deus
 last year. I still wonder how humanism will stay relevant as we evolve into new transhuman and posthuman forms, but I’ve no doubt that Pinker’s perspective is the right one for the here and now:""The first step toward wisdom is the realization that the laws of the universe don’t care about you. The next is the realization that this does not imply that life is meaningless, because people care about you, and vice versa. You care about yourself, and you have a responsibility to respect the laws of the universe that keep you alive, so don’t squander your existence. Your loved ones care about you, and you have a responsibility not to orphan your children, widow your spouse, and shatter your parents. And anyone with a humanistic sensibility cares about you, not in the sense of feeling your pain––human empathy is too feeble to spread itself across billions of strangers––but in the sense of realizing that your existence is cosmically no less important than theirs, and that we all have a responsibility to use the laws of the universe to enhance the conditions in which we all can flourish.""

56,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3055905-nils,1,"Dr Pangloss lives! I’m unconvinced that the various Enlightenments (there actually were several distinct Enlightenments, though Pinker seems unaware of this), much as I love them, can really be credited for the huge increase in human material well-being that has taken place over the last couple of centuries. This turns out not to be a trivial critique, since Pinker’s argument that the Enlightenment is what “caused” the material improvement drives his conclusion that the main threat to sustaining that improvement comes from those who he alleges are undermining the Enlightenment, e.g. the so-called postmodernists. This in turn leads to Pinker’s bizarre suggestion that the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche represent a greater threat to our sustained material well-being than, say, Exxon-Mobil and the Koch brothers. Judge for yourself whether you find that plausible.In fact, the real underpinning the material gains of the last two centuries have been more institutional than ideational. This in turn implies that we must scrutinize the solidity of our institutional matrix if we want a real purchase of the sustainability of these gains. First, there have been numerous civilizations achieving marked improvement in the welfare and well-being of their populations – at least their upper classes. The Maya, the Romans, and several dynastic episodes of the Chinese achieved such gains. Of course, the gains that industrial modernity has achieved over the last quarter millennium outstrips all previous improvements. But taking the longer view, the gains of modernity are perhaps less impressive than they seem. Almost all those gains have taken place in the last quarter millennium, and 250 years, after all, isn’t that long of a run for a civilization. Other historical civilizations have sustained their gains for much longer. The Roman Empire’s eastern branch basked in cultural glory for a thousand years. And even though it’s usually meant pejoratively, it’s no coincidence that the word “byzantine” is a synonym for institutional complexity.Second, there are reasons to suspect that modernity’s run of material amelioration may be drawing to a close—and may even go into reverse. Broadly speaking these reasons can be divided in two. The first concern biophysical limits to growth. These are enduring arguments that the Breakthrough Institute has done much to illuminate and clarify, so suffice to say that, as a long term proposition, Malthus hasn’t yet been proven wrong, and climate change presents challenges of unprecedented scale that will only be addressed if there is sufficient collective political will to overcome collective action and free riding challenges. It’s at best unclear whether we have the global social capital to do so. Put another way: we live in an era of wicked problems.My own skepticism about whether humanity can overcome these challenges brings me to my fundamental critique of Pinker’s optimism: not only the sustainability of the gains of the last quarter millennium, but also the extensibility of these to larger sections of humanity, as well as the ability to address the growing headwinds posed by anthropogenic climate change depend crucially on a massive strengthening of our global institutional and governance infrastructure. From this perspective, all the indicators are sharply negative over the last fifty and especially the last ten years.For nearly fifty years, Gallup has run a series of polls asking Americans about their confidence in various institutions – universities, the media, business, political institutions, and so forth. While the data are noisy, the overall trendline is inexorably downwards. The decline in confidence is partly the result of sustained anti-institutional propaganda, which exists in both leftwing and rightwing versions. But as I have argued elsewhere, I believe the root cause of this declining trust is the objectively poor institutional performance and a lack of elite accountability. A general feature of late modernity is a declining faith in social authority of all sorts, as ever more individuated and autonomous polities become ever less willing to entrust political agents to do anything. The advent of Donald Trump is merely a symptom of both the failure and the rejection of institutions in the United States.Nor is this just an American phenomenon. The rise of populism across Europe likewise reflects distrust of institutions. The Brexit vote two years ago of course represented a direct rebuke to transnational institutions. More recently, the triumph in the Italian elections of the Five Start Movement, whose calling card was a rejection of political party infrastructure, signaled nothing if not a rejection of institutions. (It remains unclear whether the Movement can manage even a small city, let alone Italy as a whole.)With the United States in the grip of Trumpism and the European Union caught between shambolic national politics and collective dissolution, the primary hope for global leadership seems to be falling by default to the Chinese. Some people have argued that China is filling the institutional gap left by a receding Europe and the United States. Eric X. Li, for example, recently argued that Xi Jinping’s merging of Chinese state and party infrastructure makes sense given that “the party has developed into the most competent national political institution in the world today.” What this bold claim tacitly conceded is that, despite the huge successes the Chinese state has had in poverty reduction over the last 40 years, China’s existing institutions are inadequate to managing the bumpy course corrections that lie ahead if it is to sustain its gains.Even more worrying than the declining performance of global and national political institutions are the faltering institutional underpinnings of sustained technological innovation – innovation which everyone, optimists and pessimists alike, agrees is essential to any adequate plan for addressing the challenges posed by climate change. As Mariana Mazzucato has shown, state support for innovation and entrepreneurship has in fact been at the root of almost all major technological breakthroughs of the last 75 years. Specifically, much of this support has taken place through trillions of dollars of state funding for research universities. But universities today are under unprecedented assault. Variously accused of being hotbeds of leftist indoctrination, engines of neoliberal reproduction, or simply wastes of money, no one trusts universities anymore. (This is the real place where the “postmodernists” have something to answer for: they have both been a primary vector of critique of universities, in effect sawing at the branch they sit on, while at the same time provoking hysteria about the supposed insanity of the humanities, of which Pinker’s book is a characteristic example.) While it seems inconceivable that the United States in particular would flush away the linchpin of its technological, industrial, and soft power success, the cultural assault on universities today is unparalleled. Non-coincidentally, universities also face a funding crisis of unprecedented proportions, one that is hitting humanities departments first but which the STEM fields are unlikely to escape. All this threatens to cut the legs out from under the innovation engine that is critical to any effort to escape the grim climate reaper."

The author moved effortlessly and quickly from topic to topic to topic. That style worked here. So the 4 stars is for the entertainment value that I was able to place on this. Now with all that said, it usually bothers me when the author slants all the info to fit his views and then completely glosses over other things that might deflate his defense. While this author did that (abundantly), I didn't find it offensive or annoying. He had some well placed humor to soften that reaction. "
58,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68472482-daniel,5,"This is the best book I have ever read which is something I’m not saying lightly. It makes you so optimistic about the state of human progress and it makes you truly appreciate how much progress we have made over the past couple of centuries. It is really mind-blowing. If you weren’t already, it will also make you very optimistic about the likeliness of this progress continuing in the future with the help of, among other things, technology and today’s widely available information resources.Pinker goes through a wide range of subjects from Life expectancy, Peace and Safety to Equal rights, Knowledge, Quality of life and Happiness. He backs it up with rigorous research and clearly shows how almost every relevant parameter is going in the right direction. The only two areas that as of now haven't shown clear-as-day improvements over time are Terrorism and Global warming. (Another area, which Pinker didn’t include in the book, that could be considered a blip in the otherwise steady drumbeat of progress, are the recent reports of increasing death rates among middle-aged Americans over the past decade.) Focusing on the bigger picture analysis that Pinker provides all throughout the book rather than the daily news and shorter-term trends, you get the true picture of how well humanity is doing.One fascinating example of this is what Pinker calls the consumer surplus. Think about the washing machine. It saves us 10h per week compared to 1920 and costs a few hundred dollars. Now, if you think about how much someone would have to pay you for you to give up your washing machine, the number is clearly not in the hundreds of dollars anymore. Many people in developed nations would say that there is no price that would make them give it up. So not only are we richer but many of the utilities (and other things) that we use everyday can be bought for almost nothing compared to their actual value to us. This wasn't true 50 and 100 years ago. Another example is that today the average American worker retires at 62. Hundred years ago the average American worker died at 51.Pinker thinks (and I agree) that the media is responsible for a large part of today’s unfounded, but in many parts of the Western world, prevailing pessimism. As he puts it “When voters are inches away from the news, optimism can seem naive.” He points out that if newspapers would have elected to report more good news, they could have run the headline ""Number of people in extreme poverty fell by 137,000 since yesterday"" every day for the past 25 years.The book is structured in such a way that you can easily read only one chapter that you find interesting and skip the rest. There is for example a very good chapter on the environment and climate change if you want to read up on that. I do think Pinker misses some of the big potential risks in his discussion on AI, for example advanced AI systems in the wrong hands. And I think you can safely skim through the final three chapters without missing too much of an otherwise wonderful book.As a side note, the reason I decided to read this book was Bill Gates' glowing review of it some time ago. As you can see, I wasn’t disappointed. In his review, Bill said that he read the book very slowly because he loved it so much, but that he thought “most people will find it a quick and accessible read.” Perhaps he wrote the review in the ensuing euphoria after having just finished the book because I can assure you of one thing: this book is a lot of things, an easy read for most people it is not (it’s all relative I guess). But it is enormously fun reading and often highly enlightening so it's well worth your time. A big thank you to Pinker for putting things in the right perspective and allowing readers to see the bigger picture so clearly."
59,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21797839-rafael,5,"Ok, it took me a while to finish this one not because something is wrong with it but because the amount of facts and info it has on it, its a beautiful tesis on the world today facts about economy, politics, religion and social behavior, humanism is the sole purpose of this book and explains it with brilliant research, this a not an easy book but is a wonderful explanation on how science works and how research and enlightenment could and is guiding our future, we still a long way to go but if we keep preaching facts, science and critical thinking then out future will be bright, people just has to let go of religion and superstition, get educated, preach science, i really loved this book but is not an easy read, i'd say is must read for everyone."
60,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"In many ways, reading this book was similar to reading Pinker's book ""Better Angels of our Nature."" The theory of the book was straight-forward, the evidence was well-organized, and the insights from the data were presented clearly. The first drawback to reading this book is that it covers a lot of the same ground as ""Better Angels of our Nature."" The second drawback to this book is that...well, even if the conclusions of this book aren't common sense, to people who are roughly familiar with enlightenment ideals and are fairly well-read on current affairs, it sort of is common sense. That's a nice way of saying that there are few ideas in this book that will leave you awe-struck. That's not to see that Pinker isn't capable of writing such a book. I found ""The Blank Slate"" to be just such a book. That book remains one of my favorite books to this day. That is also the book I point to when I want to convince people what a great thinker Pinker is. Pinker's argument is straightforward and comes in the preface: ""I will present a different understanding of the world, grounded in fact and inspired by the ideals of the Enlightenment: reason, science, humanism, and progress. Enlightenment ideals, I hope to show, are timeless, but they have never been more relevant than they are right now."" (page 12). If Enlightenment ideas are timeless, then why do they need a defense? Pinker's answer: ""The ideals of the Enlightenment are products of human reason, but they always struggle with other strands of human nature: loyalty to tribe, deference to authority, magical thinking, the blaming of misfortune on evildoers"" (page 18). In many ways, ""Enlightenment Now"" is similar to ""Factfullness"" in its use of quantitative data to make the case that life is indeed getting better. Pinker's earlier book ""Better Angels of our Nature"" was also a book that relied heavily on quantitative data. However, by my recollection, that book did a better job of reflecting on how the numbers were arrived at. I think numeracy is an important skill, and too often it is easy to be wowed by numbers without realizing how they are produced and the difficulty of getting reliable numbers in certain contexts -- for example, the distant past and developing countries. My recollection of ""Better Angels"" is a few years removed, but I seem to remember Pinker doing a better job with educating readers on how numbers were arrived at. Having said that, I do think the graphs are presented in a useful and simple way. Often, the data comes in the form of time series line charts. I think the repeated use of these kinds of statistics is great for more casual readers who need to be convinced. Another drawback to this book is that it tends to ignore and short-change the possibility of cataclysmic blowups. The discussion of the disruptive power of AI is discussed briefly, but pales in seriousness to Yuval Harari's analysis in ""21 Lessons for the 21st Century."" The benefits of enlightenment are discussed abundantly, but Frankenstein monsters like mortgage-backed securities are barely mentioned. In addition, one of the most important trends of the 21st century, the explosion of debt is barely discussed. The looming debt crisis (or, I should say crises since we are talking about various kinds of debts, government, municipal, shadow banking, and private) as well as other potential crises with systemic implications -- climate change, the growing use of social media, the introduction of disruptive technologies -- are under-discussed in this book. And because these systemic crises are under-discussed, Pinker fails to deal with the mother of all questions about modernity. Does modernity increase the risk of catastrophic blow-ups? Since nuclear war, climate change, and contagious financial panics are the product in one way or another of modernity, science, and globalization, is there a likelihood that more potentially catastrophic phenomena could be birthed from them? And, if so, what can we do to prevent potential catastrophic blow-ups from occurring? Another way to think about the question is this way: In what ways is modern progress like a financial bubble? For me, a high point of the book was its discussion of tribal epistemology. I have read short articles on tribal thinking, but the review of the literature here was excellent. And for those who are searching for literature that discusses this topic, the book can make for an effective gateway. This was written in the Guardian about this book: ""More pertinently, the failed 2016 campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Remain demonstrated that, in the eyes of many people, “progress” simply meant more of the same. When people feel trapped and patronised by progress, then any alternative – even regress – will feel like freedom. Informing them that the policies of the past 40 years are still the best available starts to sound hopeless."" (Full review here: https://www.theguardian.com/books/201...)Perhaps that's another way of saying that technocratic modernity (complete with its wonky charts) can feel emotionally ungratifying. Instead of gradual improvements and progress by a thousand nudges, there is a part of the soul that yearns for liberation, heroism, and love. People like stories with heroes and villains. Enlightenment often sees the world in terms of mechanical and quasi-mechanical cause and effect relationships. Heroism seems less like heroism when it requires design and system-thinking rather than great sacrifices. Nassim Taleb, another writer whose work I admire, steeps his writing in decidedly non-modern ideas and sentiments -- his thinking perhaps is best described as classical and romantic. I believe anyone who reads this book ought to put it in conversation with some of Taleb's writing (one or two books is enough). I'm sure each of the authors would hate to hear it, but I'll say it anyway -- they are better read together than separately. The unabashed modernist/enlightenment thinker is better with a classical/romantic counterpart and vice versa. I will repeat this: People who are only familiar with Pinker for ""Better Angels"" and ""Enlightenment Now"" ought to read his earlier work ""Blank Slate."" That book, more than his more recent works, demonstrates that he is a true thinker and not simply a chart-jockey or dataphile. Overall, even if you do not need to be convinced of the merit of enlightenment ideas and ideals, this is a wonderful book to read. "
61,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,4,"If you're looking for a cure for the common pessimism, you might do much, much worse than to pick up this book. I've read or seen many other examples of the facts portrayed here, but Steven Pinker does a very admirable job of showing us, exactly, how much better the world is now compared to the one we had even a hundred years ago. It's not just time-saving devices or some outright reversals of ecological damage, but how lifespans, general IQ, overall poverty level, and even WAR has improved for the better for all. Not that war is ever really all that great, mind you, but few nations jump into it with quite as little reason or abandon as they used to.Pinker isn't saying that everything is peachy, of course, but the trend toward real positive progress is undeniable. This is, despite setbacks. And yes, we have many. But for every problem that exists, he makes a very good point that we have it in us to FIX our problems. It's not out of the question.Global Warming, for example, not only has possible temporary and minor fixes available, such as applying a metaphorical sunscreen to the atmosphere, but we have the means to do much more than cut our carbon footprint down to the bone. We have a history of moving on to different methods whenever resources of one type or another run out, too. Health and education are at an all-time high. What we don't have is our optimism. In fact, we have a very solid outlook that things are worse than ever. Terrorists are few in number and never accomplish their stated goals. They merely rouse the combined might of all the powers to quash them. Most of the first world countries have made a point of living by equality in the sexes and the trend is more of the same across the world. LGBT is already accepted on the same scale. Pinker attributes all our actual progress to the Enlightenment. The old standard of 19th-century thinking, where humanism reigns supreme. Look. I freely admit to being a humanist, myself. I LOVE the idea that we all should get along. That every life is valuable. That we should have a high fundamental basis for living for every man, woman, and child alive. It's so pervasive an idea that practically everyone shares it. It's like... OBVIOUS, right? And as far as I know, Steven Pinker is right. But he also makes a very cogent point about the need to be rational, to use science for what it is intended. Inquiry, truth-seeking. No matter what the result, the truth is much more important than any ideology. He uses this to encourage each and every one of us to see past the doomsayers and the demagogs. Again, I totally agree. Skepticism is not the same thing as pessimism. Almost everyone I know is a fundamentally decent person and we all want the same fundamental things.So why didn't I give this book a full five stars?Because he gives all the credit to humanism. Wishing does not make it so. He might be right, but let's face it: this might be what he, himself warned us about. Selection Bias.Even so, I love thinking about it and I totally recommend this book for anyone who is sick and tired of the news and wants someone with a lot of facts and good reasoning to pick them up off the ground, dust their shoulders, and tell them that we are, on the whole, doing pretty damn well for ourselves. You know, despite the actual problems. But then, we DO have it in ourselves to FIX THEM. :)"
62,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51602586-dominika,2,"I did not like this book.I would say that this book was middling for the majority of it. The idea of the book is that progress has already happened, and we shouldn't be as doom and gloom as we are. But for a man who emphasizes the use of data and critical thinking, he doesn't really read said data that well and some of his arguments are riddled with gaping holes. This was a book that was read at our book club (but I was the only person at that book club who read the book in its entirety) and one of the points was that you need to show that progress has been made in order to do more progress. I have mixed feelings: I feel as though that erases the issues that people are actually facing by trying to point out that ""oh but you won't die in the woods from an infection"". While it is nice that countries that were in extreme poverty 50 years ago are being lifted to the middle class, it won't matter to the person who is working 3 jobs at minimum wage so that they can support a family. We have a lot of great innovations in healthcare, but it doesn't matter when a person cannot take an ambulance because it will cost them $600. Some of the progress sections have rather weak arguments as well. The environment one was basically him saying that the system will fix itself (in terms of a capitalist system supporting renewable energy) and that we'll totally invent carbon capture technology. The happiness one also bugged me, because the data is just not consistent. But the section that really got my blood boiling was Science. First off, he tries putting his deregulation mindset against IRBs and says a really fucking insensitive thing about the Tuskegee Syphilis study (But black people worked on it and it's not like they were INFECTING people with Syphilis). And then the rest of it was a STEM circlejerk (Wah, why are these SOCIAL SCIENCES invading my medical research). I work in medical research and am working towards a masters in Epidemiology. We cannot live in our own bubbles, we must learn from different disciplines. Hard sciences bring data-driven analysis to every subject, but social sciences bring the ability to look at the whole picture. Humanities bring the ability to make these things appealing and also to think creatively, to gain inspiration. We need them all, and it's a shame that Pinker doesn't realize that.Oh boy, and I'm not even going to start on the Humanism section and his comments on Islam. Not only does he not see how Western Imperialism could have POSSIBLY encouraged a more patriarchal regime as opposed to just reading religious texts (Look at the south), he also is just full of double standards. Oh, and his arguement against Nietsche is that dictators read him. He doesn't seem to get the Nietsche is all about skepticism. I do really like the chapter on Ideas. While it isn't something that I haven't heard before, I liked the comment on how a lot of politics now isn't even about core fundamental beliefs, but about who's team is winning. The truth is, Pinker and I differ on some core ideologies. Pinker refutes Postmodern philosophy while I am very postmodern. We have some differing opinions on the amount of regulations things should get and whether systems will correct themselves. I understand that. I read Ayn Rand, and I felt as though more of the arguments were at least compelling (if not occassionally bat-shit crazy). I didn't feel the same way about Pinker.All of this isn't helped by how reading this book felt equivelent to eating raw almonds. It was bland, it was dense, Pinker repeated himself and would attempt some flowery tangent while utterly failing. My friend said he tried reading the book during his night shift job and then fell asleep, and then got the audiobook and fell asleep again. I know he's not trying to say that we shouldn't work hard to improve the world, but I don't particularly feel any inspiration from this book, particularly when the vast majority does try to read as a pat on the back in spite of his introduction. I felt like a majority of his arguments were flaccid with the occasionally toxic take, and this book in general was overbloated. "
63,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"In Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, Steven Pinker spends 550+ pages attempting to disavow you of any notion of ""the good ol' days"".And he IS pretty convincing. He's got stats and graphs and lots of evidence to bolster his case that we live in amazing times - that progress and Enlightenment-era ideals have lead to better conditions in almost every measurable sphere. And he's right. He spends some ink and time on why we feel the opposite so often - the world is a hell hole! - pointing towards psychological phenomena like the optimism gap, the availability heuristic, (leaning heavily on Kahneman and Tvorsky's work) and the tendency we all have to remember negative over positive.I didn't read his earlier book about the decline of violence, The Better Angels of our Nature, but this book looks like a more robust version of that one, with a broad focus to include public health, economics, climate change, nuclear weapons, and the timely discussion of authoritarian populism.It's not all roses and puppies, but there are many great things and amazing research that lead to more great things. That's a good thing to remember, and a clarion call to keep going with research and evidence-based activism. All in the name of progress and making things more equal."
64,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11654681-paul,3,"I'm a big fan of Pinker, but I can't say I really enjoyed this book. Impeccably written, as always, but I feel like some of the conclusions he draws from the data he cites are somewhat spurious. "

However, it's clear things need to be taken with a large grain of salt. I admit, my initial five star rating was more out of the hopefulness associated with the book. Hopefulness that the world isn't really going to hell in a handbasket, and hopeful that the mass generalizations and questionable analysis of facts/statistics had a firm foundation. After reading Nassim Nicholas Taleb's multiple epic burns on Pinker in his book  Skin in the Game: The Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life, I had to reassess my star rating after I stopped laughing. Basically,  Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are, and  But What If We're Wrong? Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past. You can't trust anything or anyone! Fake news! Still, this book provides a sweeping view that is very much appreciated, if not 100% infallible. "

Let us rid ourselves of scientific illiteracy, shed our primitive intuitions, and abolish our hopeful apocalyptic superstitions. Let this book be the spotlight that removes the shadows of ignorance from our echo-chamber brains. Crime, war, and famine rates are lower than they’ve ever been. GMOs, fertilizers, and vaccines have and continue to save billions of lives. The global standard of living has never been higher. In virtually every measurable way, life is better for us than it has ever been for any generation of humanity before us. True, Donald Trump is the president of the United States and average global temperatures are increasing. But those problems have solutions. Reason, science, and humanism. Buy this book and take comfort in the life science has afforded us. Let us all recognize how wonderful life is and contribute to humanity’s continued progress."
67,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35-michael-siliski,4,"Recommended for anyone interested in a wake-up call about the progress made over the past few centuries.Enlightenment Now makes the case that the ideals of reason, science, and humanism have driven the greatest advances in the history of human civilization over the past few centuries. The book is divided into three parts: the history of the enlightenment, the progress we’ve made, and the enlightenment ideals that must be defended going forward. However, the meat of the book, and Pinker’s passion, is clearly the middle section, which is a thorough and data-based walk through fifteen areas where human lives are almost indistinguishably improved from just 10 generations ago, including health, peace, freedom, inequality, the environment, and happiness. Pinker’s enemies are “progressophobes” on both the right (the anti-science forces, the Trumpian politics of grievance) and left (New York Times-style liberal handwringing and catastrophizing). Both sides are prone to populism and a desire to return to an imagined utopian past. Pinker is successful in his main goal of thoroughly debunking that such a past ever existed.Enlightenment Now has a lot in common with Hans Rosling’s Factfulness, which I wrote about recently. Pinker is quite a bit longer and goes much deeper, so if you’re the type to ask for the data backing each claim, this might be the better book for you. I also thought Pinker was much more successful in grounding his celebration of human progress in a memorable framework.Both books suffer from a relentless optimism that can feel a bit strident at times. For Pinker, I thought this was most evident in his discussions of inequality and happiness, both of which felt a bit blithe to me. I think there is good reason to reject the most pessimistic takes on these: that more wealth doesn’t make people any happier or even that people are less happy these days, that inequality within a society is far more important than absolute means. Pinker does a good job making the case that inequality is not equivalent to poverty, and that “in some ways the world has become less equal, but in more ways the world’s people have become better off.” He makes a compelling argument that happiness is directly related to wealth, in particular using Stevenson & Wolfers studies. But these are not the same as proving “the irrelevance of inequality to happiness” or demonstrating that individual happiness is primarily driven by wealth. I thought these sections would be stronger if they didn’t reach quite so far.I agree with Pinker that reason, science, and humanism are critically important to human well-being globally, and these days it does feel a defense of them is needed. While I doubt that many who disagree with the thesis would even pick this book up, Pinker does make a similar point to Rosling that many of the most well-educated, including academics, are unaware of how much progress actually has been made through Enlightenment ideals. So perhaps there is hope that books like this could have a positive influence.From: https://medium.com/@msiliski/enlighte..."
68,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13941368-bakunin,4,"I usually wait a while to write a review of a book in order to digest all the important aspects of the work and this is certainly true in this case as well. Being somewhat of a libertarian with conservative leanings I found this book to be both illuminating as well as challenging. This book is Pinkers best attempt to defend the enlightenment; that is to say humanism, science and reason. He goes through many aspects quantitatively to prove his point - health, inequality, evironment, peace, safety, equal rights, quality of life etc - and all these things seem to be going in the right direction. Countries which are more democratic and more liberal are happier. This is essentially a more scientific defense of what Popper called ""the open society"". Although I find it refreshing to read a somewhat optimistic book in the midst of all the usual gloom one encounters in the daily press, I find myself in disagreement with Pinker. I agree with Pinker in that we are living the best possible time but what bothers me is the fact that I believe that the welfare state won't be able to sustain this growth (or progress if you will). Although Pinker has a certain classical liberal leaning, he is not very worried about the implications of an ever expanding welfare state: the destruction of the family, mass immigration, and the infantilization of citizens in the west. His liberal predilection is also shown by his apparent scorn of Trump and 'populism'. I suppose that this is where the rubber meets the road - I believe that communities are necessary and that the individual is not a tabula rasa. I also strongly reject the notion of an enlightened elite telling people how to better live their lives. While my values often may coincide with Pinkers, I believe in a slow and organic change in society, rather than a forced political one. Pinker by contrast scorns tribalist behavior and finds this to be reactionary; a force to be fought with a scientific mind. Although I have a certain buddhist leaning myself, I am slowly becoming more convinced of the need to be a person in modern society and the need therefore to retain certain elements of tribalism. Where to draw this line is however unclear. "
69,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75777506-tom-zacharski,2,"I picked ""Enlightenment Now"" after Bill Gates's recommendation. It's not every day that you hear someone like Gates recommend their favorite book of all time. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed. The premise of the book is that, as humanity, we are much better off nowadays than ever before in history. Pinker draws on many statistics, graphs, and facts to show that is indeed the reality. While I love that premise and couldn't agree more (we need more of those reminders in the age of 24h media) I found the language and general style a bit hard to read and unpleasant to a reader - it read a bit too much like a textbook and too often felt like going through well researched and academic in nature Powerpoint slides. The book could have easily been three times shorter and would drive the points home more effectively. Nonetheless, the points are important and if you've never read anything about how far we have come as humanity I do recommend the book. I recently saw ""The Final Year"" - a documentary about Barafh Obama's last year in office and how his foreign policy team operated during the time of a divisive, and later shocking, election. At one point Obama says that history does not follow a straight line, rather it zigs and zags, there's ups and downs, but it's our job to make sure the trend continues upward. And that trend is what the ""Enlightenment Now"" is all about."

Pinker was named one of Time Magazine’s 100 most influential people in the world in 2004 and his books are regularly featured in the best-selling lists. While the purpose of this book is commendable – to show with extensive use of data that we are living in the best of times – two reasons made me cringe while reading it. Firstly, the author completely misses the mark on the topic I have dedicated part of my professional life for the past 10+ years: climate change.

72,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"I listened to this as an audiobook & it was good, but he has a lot of graphs so quick reference to the PDF is a big plus. There are also sections where it's nice to reread his thoughts, although most are straightforward enough that it's not necessary. His writing is clean & uncluttered. It follows a logical progression.There are 3 sections:1) Enlightenment2) Progress3) Reason, Science, & HumanismThe first two sections are great. I've read about the Age of Ignorance, its history, & its benefits before, but his is one of the best as he proves the benefit of the scientific method to mankind through some very telling statistics. I loved the section on how much wealth we now have comparatively. I've read comparisons about the cost of an hour of light, but it always impresses me. He shows how much less violence, starvation, & disease there is. So why do we think the world is in such danger? He thinks it's due mostly to brain bugs & loud extremists both on the left & right.The last section ""Reason, Science, & Humanism"" was preaching to the choir. It was long & boring at times. There was a lot of good information in it & while I agreed with him in general, he went over the top or underplayed several things. For instance, he seems to consider an existential threat as serious only if they'll kill off most people. He fails to mention how horrific a tragedy which abruptly killed 1% of our population would be (1% of 7 billion is 700 million!) or what the loss of an entire city could do to our society. IIRC, some have said it could take as little as losing 10% of the population to bring down our civilization since it is incredibly interconnected. Something like a nationwide outage of electric could be catastrophic even if it lasted a fairly short time. Cities only have a few days worth of food & places like LA rely on a lot of infrastructure. Millions are living in a desert, an area where the first settlement didn't make it.His thoughts on nuclear bombs were very simplistic & incomplete. Hindsight of what the Kremlin would have actually done during the Cold War based on records we're now reading is armchair quarterbacking at its worst. He also didn't get into the options of nuclear bombs like tactical nukes. I remember some talking heads discussing how great the tactical nuke option was going to be at one point. It was insane! Apparently he doesn't believe how close we were to annihilation.Worse, he dismissed the effect of the atomic bombs we did drop saying that the Japanese surrendered because the Russians were entering their area of the war. That's ridiculously simplistic, just one of many factors & I don't believe it was the deciding one. The Japanese were out of everything & the Allies were pushing them back in force. Kamikazes weren't their first choice as weapons, but born of desperation. In March, Tokyo was bombed by something like 300 planes - nothing like Dolittle's desperate raid of a few years before. It was a huge force with horrific results, but it was also understandable & they knew we couldn't afford it too often. In August, one plane dropped one bomb that was about as bad. A few days later, we repeated the trick. They didn't know the cost or how many more we had. How can anyone dismiss that?It's crazy hard to get fissionable materials, but they aren't the only nuclear threat. It's a lot easier to get radioactive waste & spread it around with conventional explosives. It doesn't take a genius & if it or a biological/chemical agent is put in the right place, someplace upwind. It could be devastating. Not an end of the world catastrophe, but up there with the Twin Towers. I don't think it's particularly likely, but everyone thought Clancy's novel, Debt of Honor (1994) was just unlikely fiction, too. If you haven't read it, a guy crashes a jet into Congress & pretty much wipes them all out. This was 7 years before 9/11, but airline security didn't change so his dismissive attitude towards terrorists seems a bit over done. Still, I generally agreed with him. We can be too anxious. Current airline security is a good example, but there are a lot of smart people trying to keep us safe. We're walking a tightrope between safety & losing our freedoms. Our anxiety only makes the latter more likely, so I'm glad of his perspective.Overall, it's a good book. If you're super religious or a big Trump supporter, you'll probably dislike the last section especially. Pinker beats on both sides of the aisle, but the anti-humanist & anti-science of the current administration is in front of us now, so he gives a lot of good reasons for his negative opinions.Highly recommended in any format, but do get the PDF with the audiobook. Very well narrated."

What is progress? You might think that the question is so subjective and culturally relative as to be forever unanswerable. In fact, it’s one of the easier questions to answer. Most people agree that life is better than death. Health is better than sickness. Sustenance is better than hunger. Abundance is better than poverty. Peace is better than war. Safety is better than danger. Freedom is better than tyranny. Equal rights are better than bigotry and discrimination. Literacy is better than illiteracy. Knowledge is better than ignorance. Intelligence is better than dull-wittedness. Happiness is better than misery. Opportunities to enjoy family, friends, culture, and nature are better than drudgery and monotony. All these things can be measured. If they have increased over time, that is progress. 
The subtitle of Enlightenment Now is: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, and as someone who has benefitted from all of these – in all of the ways enumerated in the opening quote – I don't know to what extent I needed the “case to be made” for these values. The difficulty I had is that while author Steven Pinker does define and defend each of these principles throughout the book, he is actually attempting to make the case for optimism – as though the entire world today has progressed in the direction of betterment (to greater or lesser degrees), as a direct result of Enlightenment thinkers, and as there isn't any problem facing us that can't be solved by doubling down on Enlightenment thinking and the advancement of science and technology, anyone who tends to pessimism (whether over the environment, existential angst, or the rise of populism and despotism) simply needs a long history lesson about all the ways in which things have gotten better and better. Pinker includes more than seventy graphs with pleasing curves (trending up or down over time, depending on whether they're tracking positive or negative metrics), he provides double, or even triple, digit footnotes for each chapter (assuring me that every statement he makes is backed by published sources), and with thirty fine-print pages of references at the end, I couldn't possibly track them all down in order to reach my own conclusions about the state of the world. The reader is repeatedly asked to take Dr. Pinker's word for it that everything is progressing well (towards a place of measurable betterment for humanity), and as I found myself often squirming with the uneasiness of not just wanting to take his word for it, and as I also found myself without the informational/philosophical background from which to dispute his arguments, I couldn't always follow where Pinker wanted to lead me; often as impatient with myself as with him. I'm glad I read this book – at least in an effort to understand what the big debates of our time might be – but I just don't have the knowledge base to properly respond to Pinker's arguments; three stars reflects my not taking a stand on this one.So, I'll make an aesthetic judgment: Pinker stretched my concentration with his frequent philosophical references to hermeneutics, dialectics, ontological this and that, but when he would descend to informal/hippie references to presumably lighten things up (many retirees are happy “seeing the national parks in a Winnebago, or dandling Vera, Chuck, and Dave in a cottage on the Isle of Wight”; drivers safely enjoy the pleasures of “seeing the USA in their Chevrolet, or just cruising down the streets, feeling out of sight, spending all their money on a Saturday night”), I found the writing forced, or worse, anachronistic. And I grew impatient with Pinker's smugly rhetorical strawman-punchline gags:
There is no law of complex systems that says that intelligent agents must turn into ruthless conquistadors. Indeed, we know of one highly advanced form of intelligence that evolved without this defect. They’re called women.
Or:
Of course, one can always imagine a Doomsday Computer that is malevolent, universally empowered, always on, and tamperproof. The way to deal with this threat is straightforward: don't build one.
Other ideas that made me squirm: Pinker stresses the need for rational thinking and the belief that the scientific method is the only way of measuring the world (using that, at a stroke, to dismiss human consciousness as a mere byproduct of evolution and the nonexistence of gods as an accepted fact). History progresses in one direction, and so long as we continue to embrace Enlightenment thinking and turn to science to solve our problems, there will be no environmental doomsday, no nuclear wars, no real terrorist threat to democracy, no Singularity (no “foom”). Pinker insists that science is politically bipartisan and he takes swipes at the anti-progressivism of the left (those who are reflexively anti-GMO, anti-vaccine, anti-nuclear) and the anti-intellectualism of the right (those who are creationists, anti-immigration, protectionist), and while that might make him seem a neutral party, Pinker never misses an opportunity to name President Trump as the anti-Enlightenment bogeyman who could reverse centuries of human progress. And since, as I pointed out, I don't feel qualified to confront Pinker on his facts, here is some of the professional response to Enlightenment Now (note: I chose to share reviews from left-slanting sources in order to prevent partisan fakenewsmanship):From the (officially bipartisan but purportedly leftwing) Australian public broadcaster, ABC –Pinker never seems to see the force of the question: How do we know that all this did not take place in spite of, rather than because of, the Enlightenment? In fact, he doesn't even pretend to go to the trouble of establishing a causal connection between his contentious version of the Enlightenment and the various improvements that he imagines follow in its wake. Post hoc, ergo propter hoc seems to be the operative principle. From New Statesman, a British newsmagazine that self-describes as having a “liberal, sceptical political position” –Judged as a contribution to thought, Enlightenment Now is embarrassingly feeble. With its primitive scientism and manga-style history of ideas, the book is a parody of Enlightenment thinking at its crudest. A more intellectually inquiring author would have conveyed something of the Enlightenment’s richness and diversity. Yet even if Pinker was capable of providing it, intellectual inquiry is not what his anxious flock demands. Only an anodyne, mythical Enlightenment can give them what they crave, which is relief from painful doubt.From The Globe & Mail, a decidedly progressive Canadian daily newspaper –
Pinker's gripe is largely aesthetic. A prominent egghead who writes and composes himself with Spock-like coldness and clarity, he seems annoyed at the frenzy (and so, irrationality) of ""editorialists,"" ""climate justice warriors,"" ""relativists,"" and the ""politically correct"" left. What Pinker never substantially considers is that such frenzy – whether deployed as a deliberate political tactic, or manifesting as the sputtering incoherence of the true believer – may help mobilize the spirit of change and progress; dams and ditches of passion that channel the turbulent tides of Enlightenment. 
And from one such “frenzied climate justice warrior” at The Guardian, the British daily that famously tilts left –
Pinker insults the Enlightenment principles he claims to defend. Could he have succumbed to the motivated reasoning these principles are supposed to suppress? If the environmental crisis cannot be so easily dismissed, it threatens his argument that life is steadily improving. What looks like a relentless enhancement in human welfare could emerge instead as an interlude between one form of deprivation and the next.
The bottom line: I slogged through this long read, encouraged by its optimism, but unconvinced by its argument. I was further annoyed by my own inability to articulate my increasingly negative response to Pinker's thesis, and recognise that as my own failing; I remain uncertain that I've adequately outlined my objections even with the addition of other reviewers' voices. Even so, I'm glad to have read this book and would recommend it to anyone interested in what “the eggheads” are talking about."
74,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5979619-boudewijn,3,"In this book, Steven Pinker wants to provide insight in the fruits of the Enlightenment and that the norms and values are still as important as everContrary to what you might believe, the world is in a much better shape than ever. Whether it is life expectancy, welfare, peace, democracy, knowledge or prosperity, there is not better moment to live than now.Most of the pages are dedicated with scores of statistics, all showing that things are going well. World life expectancy has doubled from 30 years (1800) to 71,4 years (2015). The world’s GDP has increased a 100 times and - despite the growing population - the number of people living in abject poverty is decreasing.But what about the challenges we’re facing today? The deplorable state of nature, extinctions and climate change? Yes, Steven Pinker acknowledges that these challenges exist, but where other relapse in doom scenario’s. Pinker advocates for a continuation of an optimal relation between (economic) progress and pollution. If humanity wants to survive, it needs to invest in progress itself: only after achieving a certain amount of welfare, people are willing to invest in (and sacrifice themselves for) a better environment. In other words, keep investing in the core values of the Enlightenment: rationalism, science and humanism. And yes, this includes nuclear energy, as a clean way of energy.In the last part of the book, Pinker delves into the current problems of the left and the right. The left thinks that the world is being plagued by inequality and the environment being endangered, the right think that his ‘culture’ is being destroyed by immigrations and minorities. Fact and figures that show that this is not the case, are being falsified or simply denied.The problem that I had with this book was its lack of nuance. He knows, or thinks he knows all, and does not refrain from his mantra that all is well, and will be well. There is no room for any considerations for those who - even today - might not be living their lives to their full capacity. Not because they don’t want to, but because they are simply kept from achieving it.

75,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48909861-dan-ust,4,"Overall a good book, though I believe Pinker overstates his case and is too narrowly focused on the Enlightenment itself — as if all progress were waiting for the 18th century to really start. This is strange given his earlier book, _The Better Angels of Our Nature_, where he documents the reduction in violence from the Stone Age on.He minimizes things like improved capabilities, while fine in themselves, can also breed greater risks. He does recognize this in the case of nuclear weapons. (One can argue that both ways: maybe nuclear deterrence has reduced or ended wars between major powers. But the devastation of one such weapon is certainly progress of a type many would question.)Also, he has what might best be called stylistic ticks. These wouldn’t be as bad in a brief talk, but became more vexing to me as I read the near 500 pages of the main text. (There are extensive footnotes worth mining too. I’ve read or skimmed a number of the works he cites.) By these I mean he seems to have to reword adages or quote songs and the like for somewhat comic effect. This works sometimes, but when it feels like every section must have one or two, it feels like padding in an already long work.I winced a little at his oversimplification of intellectual history, too, though I believe his trashing of Nietzsche is spot on. I winced further at his seeming to think the ruling class simply wants the best for everyone rather than it’s often resistant to progress and benefits from “gloom and doom” attitudes. (Politicians don’t run on the slogan that things are okay and getting better. Instead, election campaigns are morality plays where good is battling evil, where one side will redeem us and move is forward from the collapsing state we find ourselves in while the other wishes to push society over a cliff.)In many ways, too, Pinker’s work is an update of that of economist Julian Simon. One can argue that Pinker will have a greater impact because he’s not an economist and, despite my reservations above, is a much more accessible and wittier writer. (To be fair, it’s been a while since I’ve read Simon.)Ian Goldin also wrote a balanced review for Nature:https://www.nature.com/articles/d4158..."
76,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"This book was simply amazing. I've read the whole thing in less than two weeks. The material was very captivating, and the chapters in the book are well organized, allowing for natural breaks. Steven Pinker, the author, provides a rational and balanced view of the current state of humankind, how we got here, and where we're headed. He dives into vital topics directly and doesn't hold back or avoid anything. The book covers topics such as wealth, health, quality of life, society as a whole, climate change, education, and a lot more.The information shared is also backed up by real data which is quite refreshing. We're all surrounded with so much negativity from the mainstream news which can make the world seem like a terrible place to live in. And with this book, what I enjoyed was the more balanced presentation of the data without resorting to fear-mongering, which is so common these days with clickbait media.If you have any doubts, this book will open your eyes to the fact that we're all living in the best time for humankind since the beginning of our existence and things are getting better.As much as I enjoyed the optimistic viewpoint on certain topics in this book, I also like the fact that the author didn't exclude critical areas we as humans need to work on — one of those being climate change.There's very little doubt about the current situation with climate change and the urgency at which we need to operate to avoid a global disaster. The truth is, we all have to step up and do our part as this presents one of the biggest challenges for humankind yet.Overall, this book is a great read, and I highly recommend it. It covers so many important areas, and I'm glad I decided to read it. I have no doubts you'll enjoy it as much as I did."
77,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5196256-mindy,1,"I read this because Bill Gates highly recommended it, and because I felt I needed a more optimistic view of the progress of humanity. Why did I think Bill Gates’ reading list would hold any interest for me? This book is simply further evidence that all data can be manipulated to achieve a purpose. If you include yourself among the world’s wealthiest “citizens”, this is a great read to assuage any hint of privilege-related guilt you may feel. The extremely poor are in decline, and if the bulk of humanity is now simply poor, they should be content with their plight and thank their overlords from lifting them out of the squalor. I kept reading hoping for a redeeming moment. It never happened."
78,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"In 2011 Steven Pinker wrote a magnificent book, The Better Angels of our Nature, in which he showed – by using historical analysis, statistical methods and informed estimates – how the world has gotten safer (hence the subtitle of the book: The Decline of Violence). The gist of the book was that there have been continuous social reforms that have led to an environment in which our inner demons have fewer opportunities to surface and in which zero-sum games have been turned into positive-sum games. In 2017, Pinker followed up his 2011 work by extending his scientific method to the whole scale of human progress. In Enlightenment Now he wants to show us how the world not only got safer, but also became a much more pleasant place to live in – for almost all human beings that are born. Pinker wants to show us that this progress wasn’t inevitable: it was a conscious effort of human beings to start – for the first time in history – to apply reason to the goal of making the world a better place to live. This is important, since it shows us to not be complacent and to take all the gains for granted. Pinker tries to convince us readers that the Enlightenment values that drove this progress have to be remembered by and re-stated to each new generation.The book itself is divided into three parts; I will briefly summarize each part in the rest of this review.In part 1, Pinker describes how in the Enlightenment era people started to use reason to understand the world (science) and to distinguish right from wrong (ethics). No more witch hunts; no more mythologies; no more harsh punishments; etc. According to Pinker, mankind has to fight continuously against three natural entities: (1) entropy (the increasing of disorder), (2) evolution (the competition of all against all; zero-sum games), and (3) information (increasing our knowledge). In this fight, reason is the most important, and only, tool that we have to – temporarily – create a good place to live for ourselves. Pinker sees two contemporary threats to this ideal though: religion and populism (left- and rightwing). His goal of the rest of the book is hence; first to show that real progress has taken place; and next, to convince us that this progress was driven by Enlightenment values that have to be defended. So, in part 2 of the book Pinker applies the scientific method to analyze the different domains of human progress. He uses lots of graphs and he meticulously describes all the relevant scientific findings – just like he did in his 2011 book on the decline of violence. In short, people live longer; are healthier; are economically better off, even though inequality increases; the environment is (slowly) better off and the climate change fatalism is misguided (especially in light of all the technological advances); the world is more peaceful and safer than ever, while terrorism is a minor (insignificant) blip; democracy and equal rights are strongly instituted; and knowledge is readily accessible for masses of people and ever-progressing. In the closing chapters of part 2, Pinker also states that the newer generations are much happier, healthier and experience a much higher quality of life than earlier generations. Within generations this progress is also visible. The hailed existential threats to progress – technological enslavement and nuclear war – are serious issues but there really is no reason to be scared shitless: human beings, according to Pinker, are better and better equipped to turn zero-sum games into positive-sum games (i.e. turning existential threats into cooperated effort to ward off disaster). Pinker finishes part 2 by claiming that progress, even though contingent (i.e. depending on human choices), is a self-enhancing cycle: as the world is better off each year, countries will tend to cooperate more and more and living conditions of all human beings will tend to increase. Minor setbacks, such as the Trump presidency and the Brexit referendum, cannot stop the long-term trend of ever-increasing progress.After showing us how much the world has progressed, Pinker turns his book into an essay. In part 3 he makes a case for three Enlightenment values that are, according to him, essential to actively promote and continue the progress we have already made. The first of these values is reason, which is under increasing attack by generations of postmodernists (“objective reality doesn’t exist”, “all cultures are equal”, etc.) and populists (“the will of the people should be followed”, “we need a strong leader”, etc.). Next to these two ideologies, human beings suffer from biases and hence the media portray a picture of a world that is almost continuously on the brink of World War III. Pinker, essentially, advocates a more rational public discourse, in which fact checking and statistical reasoning trump Trumpism (pun intended).The second value Pinker advocates is science. In other words: trial and error. Not just to gain more knowledge and hence receive more control over our lives (by fighting diseases, natural disasters, etc.), but also to base our policies on. Politics, according to Pinker, should be more evidence-based and less ideology-driven. This is the old argument of piecemeal social engineering promoted by Karl Popper: changing policy in small steps; measuring and evaluating the results of each step; and adjusting where necessary.Pinker notices a trend in literary and cultural circles, especially due to scientifically illiterate self-proclaimed intellectuals, to blackball science and act like science is the root of all evil. The truth is that science is a-moral – in the sense that it doesn’t say whether we should build a-bombs, nuclear reactors for energy, or both, and in which situation – and that science offers us the possibility to better our lives. It is due to science that we live longer, healthier and wealthier.The third and last value that Pinker advocates is humanism. Humanism is the answer to the problem of the a-morality of science: it tells us what to do with all the knowledge, wealth and technological possibilities. Pinker uses the ethics of one of the founders of the Enlightenment, Spinoza. According to Spinoza, any human being that is governed by reason will wish for any other human the same things as they wish for themselves. This is a strong ethical imperative, and Pinker uses the rest of the chapter to state it more fully (in short: consequentialism) and to refute the two counter-narratives: religious morals (which are, according to Pinker, humanized by humanism – with the exception of Islam) and populism/nationalism (which are inspired by the ethics of Nietzsche’s Übermensch and heroism).All of the above is my try to summarize Pinker’s thoughts as honest and representative as possible. Of course this is practically impossible: the book is huge and Pinker is much nuanced on all of the themes mentioned. But: what to think of it all?First, I applaud Pinker for stating clearly how far we have come since the 16th century: how much better off human beings are in the 21st century world. As Pinker himself repeats, it is trendy to be a cultural pessimist. All this liberalism and progress has led to atomized societies and hedonistic, empty lives. It is also very fancy to be a fatalist, especially regarding the environment and climate. Pinker's book is a healthy antidote to all this doom-thinking and the masses of studies and graphs he uses to back up his arguments make cultural pessimism and climate fatalism hard to sustain.Second, I think Pinker is right in seeing humanism, reason and science as the driving forces behind the world we live in nowadays. It is only when reason is set aside – consciously or unconsciously – that progress halts and that we fall back on our primitive nature and zero-sum value systems. I think he is also right in describing the two major threats to the world as we know it: religious morality and populism (again, left- as well as rightwing). So in all this, Enlightenment Now is a terribly accurate and timely book.But I do disagree with some of Pinker’s observations, especially the ones on happiness and quality of life. I cannot help but reflect that Enlightenment Now is written by a Harvard professor whose life is spent on creative thinking and intellectual effort to understand the world. I don’t think many of us can share this luxury, and that for many of us leading ‘normal lives’ life isn’t as fulfilling or free as we wish. Pinker’s line of argument is (albeit simplified): younger generations suffer less from addictions; commit fewer suicides; suffer less from depression; etc.; hence, they are happier than earlier generations and have a higher quality of life. I don’t know if the amount of suicides and depressions says anything (or much) about the happiness of people. And another problem with this line of thinking – which really surfaces throughout the whole book – is that it generalizes over everyone. It is entirely possible that certain parts of the population are worse off, but that this negative effect is swamped by an exponential increase of happiness by the rest of the population. For example, due to globalization, the world is better off, and the poorest people and the poorest countries are the real gainers in health and wealth; yet the (lower) middle classes and lower classes in richer countries are really worse off than earlier generations – combined with an ever-increasing decline of social mobility. The same thing goes with people in vulnerable professions or in vulnerable life situations: handicapped people, sick people, old people, etc. In all developed countries we see an ever-increasing jungle of rules and regulations, to guarantee an equal treatment for all people in like situations. This sounds beautiful and noble, but it results in health care workers clocking five minutes for washing elderly people; treating schoolchildren as revenue and future tax payers; making people who depend on social welfare end up in mazes of bureaucracy; etc. Is this truly progress? (Of course, Pinker would counter: would they be better off in the nineteenth century?)My point is that statistics are useful to describe general trends and to understand what causes play a role. When we understand what factors make the world a better place to live in, we can apply more of the same potion. Understanding is fundamental. But scientific studies of subjects like happiness - even apart from all the methodological issues involved - are rather empty when we're dealing with our own personal lives and our loved ones around us. Stating, for example, that more people are better off and that poverty declines, is a rather meaningless statement when talking to someone who just lost his or her job because his or her employer moved to a developing country. Personally, I think the diffusion of liberalism, the results of equal rights movements (including feminism), and decades of migration have led to a diminishing social cohesion in Western societies – and between countries worldwide. This is, for example, illustrated by contemporary elections: a huge assembly of small political factions and an increasingly polarized climate. It is also illustrated by the popularity of identity politics, in which individuals base their personal identity on biological and cultural traits. Western societies have degraded into collections of individuals without much common ground. Hence, all the rules and regulations to enforce equality: people don’t trust each other anymore – or at least less than before. I cannot help but remark that in Sweden there are plans to make laws to make two adults consent to have sexual intercourse - as if the intricate and complex dealings in real life can be translated and enforced by abstract laws. The same applies to the laws against islamophobia that the Canadian parliament put into practice in 2017. This is symptomatic of societies lacking social cohesion and reciprocal trust and commitment.I think Pinker is over-optimistic when it comes to a better world. He does notice an increase in global and national inequality and declining social mobility, but he doesn’t see it as serious arguments against progress. Of course, from a macro-perspective, the world is better off and this is a good thing. But people don’t like grim futures and this can become very problematic in countries in which large swathes of the population have to give up health and wealth to transfer it to developing countries – something which is inevitable if the world economy continues the way it does now. I think the safe thing to say is that Enlightenment Now is a reliably optimistic book on how the world as a whole is much better off in 2018 than in 1618. The causes of this progress are humanism, reason and science. On a grand scale, Pinker’s book is an important reminder of the possibilities of human progress – if/when we set our minds to it we can do a lot to better our lives. Yet by zooming out, Pinker steers around the (equally important) question of a declining standard of life for individuals and particular social groups and a feeling of loss of social cohesion. Yet, these last points weren’t the goal of his book, so I shouldn’t end this review on such a sour note. It’s a very interesting and readable book: read it!"
79,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1139239-michael-austin,4,"Steven Pinker is a rare creature in the academic world: a liberal who is not a leftist. As a liberal he supports things like free speech, civil rights, democratic ideals, and a strong government that ensures safety, protects the environment, and redistributes some portion of income to support education, health care, infrastructure, and the reduction of poverty. As a non-leftist, he supports things like a democratic government and a capitalist economy that, while subject to government regulation and income redistribution, still functions as a free market. Like most of Pinker’s books, Enlightenment Now is big and filled with lots of data, but actually very tightly argued. The sequence of his argument goes something like this:1.	In the eighteenth century, European intellectuals produced a movement that we call “the Enlightenment” that was built on four interrelated principles: reason, science, humanism, and progress. They set in motion revolutions in government, science, and culture that has shaped the world ever since. 2.	The Enlightenment worked. Over the last two and a half centuries, nearly every measure of human flourishing has increased dramatically across the world. People alive today are better educated, healthier, richer, and safer than they have ever been at any time in history. Major diseases have been wiped out by vaccination, extreme poverty has been substantially reduced by global markets, and war and violence have decreased to their lowest levels in world history.3.	Since its beginning, the Enlightenment has had to contend with “counter-Enlightenment” narratives from both the left and the right. Counter-Enlightenment narratives are those that portray the world as getting worse, either because people are falling away from religious belief and values (the conservative counter-narrative), or because capitalism has enervated the world for its own profit and turned 99% of people into labor machines that feed its insatiable greed (the leftist counter-narrative). 4.	The work of the Enlightenment is not finished. There is still poverty, war, and injustice. There are still threats to safety and to the environment. We still have many, many problems to solve. But these problems are best solved by using the tools of the Enlightenment (reason, science, and humanism) rather than by reverting to counter-Enlightenment narratives such as religious fundamentalism or Marxism to address them. As one who is, like Pinker, a liberal but not a leftist, I find myself agreeing with almost everything in this over-arching argument. Sure I have specific quibbles with all kinds of stuff. Pinker is not content to show that most things are a little bit better. He wants to be more comprehensive than that and show that everything is a lot better. And in the process, he often stretches his argument beyond what can be reasonably proved. But even adjusting for some hyperbole, the data he presents is overwhelmingly persuasive—not just that life has gotten better in the world since the 18th century, but that it has improved dramatically in just the last 30 years. During this time, extreme poverty has fallen from 50% of the world to 10%, the number of people killed in wars has fallen by 200%, criminal violence has decreased dramatically, cars are safer, more countries are democratic, and income inequality has decreased in all but the most developed nations. It seems to me that there is no reasonable way to refute the proposition that the world today is more amenable to human flourishing than it has ever been.But there are a whole lot of unreasonable ways to refute this, and this, really, is the most important part of the book. Pinker identifies two key cognitive biases that causes many people to reject the Enlightenment narrative that the world is getting better and embrace one of several counter-Enlightenment narratives that insist that the world is getting worse.The first of these biases is the “availability heuristic.” We have a lot more access to information than we have ever had before, so we see more of the bad stuff than anybody ever has. Our Internet and social media feeds immediately show us acts of racism, police brutality, mass violence, civil strife, and even genocide. We see these with much greater frequency, and when we do, our minds tell us that they are happening with greater frequency, which is generally not the case. But don’t try to tell us that, because we probably won’t believe it.The more troubling factor in our tendency to see a world in decline is the confirmation bias, which simply means that we tend to see what confirms our beliefs and ignore what does not. And we are attracted to narratives of decline because they fit with so many ready-made world views. They are, in fact, an indispensable part of contemporary politics.“We are doing well, but we need to do better” is not a good political message. “We are in decline and need to make America great again” is. And herein lies the fundamental attraction to narratives that cannot be supported by reason or data. We want to believe that things are getting worse, because this is the best way to accomplish political and religious goals. These narratives create fear, and fear motivates us to vote, to donate to politicians, to attend Church, to donate to Churches, and to agitate for change. We can do this through reason and science, of course, but it doesn’t work as well. And this is probably Pinker’s most important point: we are in danger of losing much of the progress that we have made as a nation, and as a world, by rejecting the principles responsible for that progress and embracing narratives that emphasize tribalism, magical thinking, resentment, and unwarranted fear. In the United States, we are rolling back the government regulations that have kept us safe and improved our environment, and we currently have an administration that insists that global relations are a zero-sum game. Globally, people are rejecting the vaccines that wiped out diseases and attacking the advances in food technology that have dramatically reduced hunger and poverty. Countries that once embraced secularism and democracy are starting to turn to religious fundamentalism. We are abandoning things that work in favor of things that won’t. And this is very dangerous. It is possible to argue with almost everything that Pinker says in Enlightenment Now. But those arguments must also adopt Enlightenment principles: showing where his reason fails, providing better evidence, rejecting conclusions that he makes because they are not adequately supported. This kind of debate is necessary and proper.Unfortunately, this is not the debate that we are having. Across the political spectrum, the Enlightenment ideals that Pinker champions are being refuted from fundamentally illiberal and unenlightened positions with a strong interest in making the world seem like a fetid hell hole that is only a moment away from the apocalypse. These arguments are dangerous because they appeal to the kind of thinking that caused most of our problems in the first place."
80,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,5,"There is no one alive who writes with the mind-sweeping clarity and breadth of knowledge that Steven Pinker possesses. Though there are other works of his that are perhaps more revolutionary (The Blank Slate) or ambitious in their singular explanatory power (How the Mind Works), it is this latest volume of his that is his most timely and all-encompassing cerebral broom.If the idea of needing to defend Enlightenment values is mysterious to you at this point then I can only pity you your global-scale ignorance or apathy. In Pinker, that cause of defense has found its most able champion. Offering an incredible array of 75 statistical graphs that are properly contextualized and interpreted, he has produced such an incredibly coherent and well-argued line of thinking that has enough independent and objective fact to annoy partisans of both sides of the political/philosophical spectrum. Much of the work seems to follow-up on several of the arguments brought forth in his previous volume, ""The Better Angels of Our Nature."" Following a deft summary as to what Enlightenment ideals and practices are, Pinker proceeds to show just how they have benefited society and the world as a whole ever since, where they have come up short, and recommends several new usages of these ideas for future mutual benefit. Along the way he casts off so many misconceptions and anecdotal ""arguments"" against the Enlightenment, something long overdue in writings by contemporary intellectuals who - alarmingly and genuinely stupidly - have distanced themselves from these values. This is not done with flippant casuistry or mere rhetorical prolepsis but with relentless data and cogent, in-depth examination. Some telling and amusing samples from the work include:""If you extol reason, then what matters is the integrity of the thoughts, not the personalities of the thinkers.""""While a vision of world peace may have given John and Yoko some good songs, it is hopelessly naïve in the real world.""""However long it takes, we must not let the existence of cognitive and emotional biases or the spasms of irrationality in the political arena discourage us from the Enlightenment ideal of relentlessly pursuing reason and truth.""This is the book of the year, no question. No one has this diverse array of knowledge, no one marshals their facts better, and no one does so with the ease of language that Dr. Pinker presents across a work of 500+ pages. In closing I will let him sum up one of the major points of this monumental achievement: ""Remember your math: an anecdote is not a trend. Remember your history: the fact that something is bad today doesn't mean it was better in the past. Remember your philosophy: one cannot reason that there's no such thing as reason, or that something is true or good because God said it is. And remember your psychology: much of what we know isn't so, especially when our comrades know it too."""
81,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58890815-andrii-zakharov,5,"There are a lot of bad reviews of Steven Pinker's new book out there, mostly arguing against some of his particular points taken out of context, putting words in his mouth, falsely attributing some agenda to him, or simply twisting his words. But reading the book attentively, one can't help but notice how much thought went into Pinker's formulations, and how careful he is with what he is saying and showing. The one detailed review I can recommend which appreciates the precision and is not politically loaded is Scott Aaronson's: https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p....Here, I will only give my brief impression. First, I must admit that I found some chapters in the book stronger than others. This is to be expected of a work that attempts to cover the whole span of the human condition across history, and do so in an exclusively data-driven, empirical way. For some developments, there is just not enough good data available, and so some of the conjectures and estimates will necessarily be better supported than others. That said, taken as a whole, Enlightenment Now is an exceptional piece of popular scholarship, providing a most enjoyable review of all the relevant aspects of human life. Page after page, figure after figure, relentlessly hammering home the crucial point way too many of us are unaware of: the world and our lives in it are continually getting better, along almost every conceivable dimension. One could argue at length about the data in each and every chapter. One could rightly point out that some of it is one-sided, that his historical accounts are incomplete and some of the conclusions premature. But the sheer weight of evidence makes it impossible to deny the central points:* life has been, and is, getting better for ever more people in ever more places* it is happening as we create new knowledge and use it to gradually solve problems* problems are inevitable, new ones will always arise, but problems are also solvable, given the right knowledge* the best system we have to create new knowledge is science* continuing to gradually improve our institutions will continue to bring incremental progress* we are facing many dangers, some of them existential, which call for unprecedented global cooperation and knowledge production to overcome* the ideas outlined above are, sadly, time and again attacked by hostile ideologies from all sides of the political spectrum, and have to be defended if we are to continue our progress.These points were made very persuasively in the course of the book, and appear to me of paramount importance. Reading Enlightenment Now significantly shifted my worldview towards conditional future optimism, motivating to work very hard to sustain our amazing progress so far."
82,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"Pinker builds on his previous book The Better Angels of Our Nature to make a strong case for enlightenment values.His writing is excellent and always an absolute joy to read.He puts apparent contemporary reversals of progress in perspective. He defends humanism. He pulls no punches discussing religion. He weighs in on economics as key to those Better Angels. He wipes the floor with Friedrich Nietzsche and his intellectual heritage in fascism, Nazism, etc. He backs up everything with scientific evidence. Even if sometimes the interpretation comes off a bit forced, he's still working on solid ground throughout the book."
83,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,5,"Steven Pinker was one of the first writers to kindle my passion for scientific thinking. When I read 
The Blank Slate
 in 2011, it exposed me to a host of intellectual disciplines that my undergraduate training in philosophy had neglected––most notably evolutionary psychology, skepticism, and the empirical foundations of human nature. Nearly a decade later, I am thrilled not only to have another opportunity to journey through Pinker’s impressive mind, but also that his chosen message is rooted in data-driven, responsible optimism. Given the psychological and political difficulties of 2017, I was on the verge of thinking that such optimism was nothing more than shrugging in the face of inevitable doom. But Enlightenment Now turned my frown upside down, made me feel good about being human again, and restored much of my belief that humanity still has a bright future (or many possible bright futures) ahead.If I could rename this book without worrying about marketing, my chosen title would be: Everybody Calm the Fuck Down: The Case for Sanity, by Steven Pinker. At a moment in global and American history when many citizens feel like the sky is continually falling, Enlightenment Now provides a hard-nosed critique of our tendency to indulge our inner Chicken Littles. Instead of taking the in vogue route of mining for new reasons why human civilization is inherently dishonorable and teetering on the brink of destruction, Pinker argues the exact opposite. To make his case, Pinker demonstrates that the Enlightenment, the great intellectual movement that precipitated the rise of modernity, has been a rollicking success:""This book is my attempt to restate the ideals of the Enlightenment in the language and concepts of the 21st century. I will first lay out a framework for understanding the human condition informed by modern science––who we are, where we came from, what our challenges are, and how we can meet them. The bulk of the book is devoted to defending those ideals in a distinctively 21st-century way: with data. This evidence-based take on the Enlightenment project reveals that it was not a naïve hope. The Enlightenment has worked––perhaps the greatest story seldom told. And because this triumph is so unsung, the underlying ideals of reason, science, and humanism are unappreciated as well. Far from being an insipid consensus, these ideals are treated by today’s intellectuals with indifference, skepticism, and sometimes contempt. When properly appreciated, I will suggest, the ideals of the Enlightenment are in fact stirring, inspiring, noble––a reason to live."" (5-6, emphasis his)This passage reveals both the considerable strengths and non-negligible weaknesses of Pinker’s position. Since I agree with Pinker’s outlook and think this book represents a hugely valuable contribution to the modern moment, I’ll deal with the chinks in his armor first and follow with praise. First, Pinker’s characterization of the Enlightenment’s success as “the greatest story seldom told” is an overstatement. I’d like to say it’s an overstatement that isn’t repeated in the rest of the text, but that wouldn’t be an honest appraisal. It’s my feeling that the Enlightenment-rejecting “intellectuals” in Pinker’s crosshairs––frustrating and myopic as they may be––do not represent a majority opinion in America or anywhere else. In fact, as Pinker points out, they do not even represent a majority of intellectuals:""During the 20th century, the landscape of human knowledge was carved into professionalized duchies, and the growth of science (particularly the sciences of human nature) is often seen as an encroachment on territories that had been staked and enclosed by the academic humanities. It’s not that practitioners of the humanities themselves have this zero-sum mindset. Most artists show no signs of it…Nor is the anxiety expressed by the scholars who delve into the historical epochs, genres of art, systems of ideas, and other subject matter in the humanities, since a true scholar is receptive to ideas regardless of their origin. The defensive pugnacity belongs to a culture: Snow’s Second Culture of literary intellectuals, cultural critics, and erudite essayists."" (389-90, emphasis his)This Second Culture is Pinker’s true enemy, and while he does a good job of calling them out directly in the latter chapters, some of his earlier assertions belie the genuine nuances that bolster the rest of the text. For example, the opening sentences of a chapter called “Progressophobia” read thus: “Intellectuals hate progress. Intellectuals who call themselves progressive really hate progress” (39, emphasis his). Such sweeping statements needlessly open a path for critics to characterize Pinker as nothing more than a Panglossian apologist for modernity; sadly, this path will be well-trodden given how Pinker has been villainized by the Second Culture and its acolytes (this review  is a good example). Here we find the downside of Pinker’s iconoclastic nature, which is not only the source of his intellectual vitality and undeniable wit, but also his most significant vulnerability.My other worry about this book is that, despite Pinker’s repeated claims that the Enlightenment’s success is not a justification for complacency in the face of extant problems, it may nevertheless end up playing that role in cultural and political discussions, as well as in the hearts and minds of readers. Over and over, Enlightenment Now caused me to take a deep breath and remind myself that things aren’t so bad, which is terrific for my personal health and state of mind, but probably not the best way to get me into the proverbial trenches solving humanity’s most difficult challenges. Of course, one of Pinker’s central claims is that the best way to fight those battles is to eschew unnecessary excitation in favor of calm calculation and reasoned negotiation. But I still worry that readers like myself––privileged first-worlders for whom modernity is working just fine––may utilize this perspective to thicken our own socioeconomic and ideological bubbles instead of heeding Pinker’s call to action. The lesson here is that Enlightenment Now represents just one important perspective amongst others, and should not be treated as a comprehensive guide to the world’s present state. In other words, it’s like any other intellectual endeavor.Okay, now for the fun stuff! As ever, Pinker has crafted a book that is engaging, cleanly written, and packed with dense and fascinating thoughts. Since this is a book about progress, we should start with Pinker’s chosen definition:""What is progress? You might think that the question is so subjective and culturally relative as to be forever unanswerable. In fact, it’s one of the easier questions to answer. Most people agree that life is better than death. Abundance is better than poverty. Peace is better than war. Safety is better than danger. Freedom is better than tyranny. Equal rights are better than bigotry and discrimination. Literacy is better than illiteracy. Knowledge is better than ignorance. Intelligence is better than dull-wittedness. Happiness is better than misery. Opportunities to enjoy family, friends, culture, and nature are better than drudgery and monotony. All these things can be measured. If they have increased over time, that is progress."" (51)Pinker is not posturing when he claims that these indicators of progress can be measured. His commitment to empiricism runs much deeper than that of most public intellectuals, as evidenced by the 70+ graphs/charts and 100 pages of notes/references that accompany his superb argumentation. While he is well aware that data generation is a flawed human process (404), the raw power of evidentiary convergence becomes increasingly undeniable as Pinker’s explication of progress unfolds over about 300 pages.In my view, Pinker’s most important insight about progress is this: “It’s in the nature of progress that it erases its tracks, and its champions fixate on the remaining injustices and forget how far we have come” (215). This dynamic can make progress very difficult to identify and acknowledge, since even a world that is improving will always create new obstacles during the process of rendering old ones obsolete: “Progress cannot be monotonic because solutions to problems always create new problems. But progress can resume when the new problems are solved in their turn” (44). While it may seem simplistic to some readers, I think Pinker’s characterization of the world’s difficulties as mere problems to be solved is a critical and often-elided truth that we need to rediscover. In a cultural milieu where doubling down on embattled ideological positions and demonizing one’s opponents is routine, it becomes heroic to refocus one’s attention and energy on discovering the empirical nature of a problem and following the road to solutions wherever it may lead.Of the seventeen topics Pinker addresses in his discussion of progress, the one that most pleased me was his chapter on the environment. This is a topic that many big thinkers still neglect, even though climate change is perhaps the most ominous long-term threat to the continuance of human progress. Pinker takes up the climate problem with distinctive poise, showing how sentimental, anti-industrial positions on the political left and denialist positions on the right have both failed to provide a viable platform for global climate action. He advocates for “Ecomodernism,” a nascent field of study founded on three tenets: (1) some degree of pollution is unavoidable due to the entropic nature of the universe, (2) industrialization has generally been good for humanity, and (3) technology is the primary tool we should use to mitigate environmental damage without relinquishing the myriad benefits of modern life (123-4).While Second Culturists will surely write Pinker off as an obsequious technocrat beguiled by the corrupt comforts of elite capitalist culture, a sober assessment of Ecomodernism reveals it as the most reasonable and realizable approach for dealing with climate change. Pinker advocates for a combination of solutions, including decarbonization, alternative energies, dematerialization, and nuclear power––no silver bullets here. His recommendations, especially on the nuclear issue, pay no heed to the entrenched ideological positions of climate warriors or denialists, but rather follow the evidence wherever it leads. Climate change is serious and daunting, but panicking and using it as an excuse to upend the economic and institutional foundations of progress is foolish. This message is starkest in Pinker’s takedown of Naomi Klein’s position that the only way to address climate change is to raze contemporary capitalism and rebuild it with a much heavier emphasis on centrally-planned economies. His critique was especially salutary for me, given that I was completely seduced by Klein’s point of view when I read This Changes Everything back in 2014. I love an opportunity to update my opinions and reflect on the informational and perspectival limitations of my past selves.Instead of succumbing to the idea that humanity must repent for the great sin of modernity, Pinker instead demonstrates that we can approach this daunting challenge with a rational maturity:""It’s time to retire the morality play in which modern humans are a vile race of despoilers and plunderers who will hasten the apocalypse unless they undo the Industrial Revolution, renounce technology, and return to an ascetic harmony with nature. Instead, we can treat environmental protection as a problem to be solved: how can people live safe, comfortable, and stimulating lives with the least possible pollution and loss of natural habitats?"" (134)As it has always been, the solution is to press forward using the human wellsprings of creativity and innovation; it does no good to nostalgically pine for previous eras when life for average folks and even most elites was much worse than today.Also laudable is Pinker’s defense of rationality, which is endangered by political partisanship and religious/magical thinking. Pinker’s rejection of political partisanship, which he likens to sports fandom, is particularly valuable (359-60). He lays out a battery of research showing how ideologues bend over backwards to deny their opponents the benefit of the doubt, then ties it off with a much-needed reminder that progress is not owned by any individual or group, but is rather the collective result of countless actions and shifts over time that can come from even the most unlikely places:""It should not be surprising that the facts of human progress confound the major -isms. The ideologies are more than two centuries old and are based on mile-high visions such as whether humans are tragically flawed or infinitely malleable, and whether society is an organic whole or a collection of individuals. A real society comprises hundreds of millions of social beings, each with a trillion-synapse brain, who pursue their well-being while affecting the well-being of others in complex networks with massive positive and negative externalities, many of them historically unprecedented. It is bound to defy any simple narrative of what will happen under a given set of rules. A more rational approach is to treat societies as ongoing experiments and open-mindedly learn the best practices, whichever part of the spectrum they come from."" (365)All of us are inescapably embedded in Pinker’s “real society,” and our ability to intelligently acknowledge and navigate this messy reality can stave off madness and keep progress coming.Enlightenment Now closes with Pinker’s celebration of humanism––a strong message that rehabilitated my humanist loyalties, which took a hit when I read Yuval Noah Harari’s 
Homo Deus
 last year. I still wonder how humanism will stay relevant as we evolve into new transhuman and posthuman forms, but I’ve no doubt that Pinker’s perspective is the right one for the here and now:""The first step toward wisdom is the realization that the laws of the universe don’t care about you. The next is the realization that this does not imply that life is meaningless, because people care about you, and vice versa. You care about yourself, and you have a responsibility to respect the laws of the universe that keep you alive, so don’t squander your existence. Your loved ones care about you, and you have a responsibility not to orphan your children, widow your spouse, and shatter your parents. And anyone with a humanistic sensibility cares about you, not in the sense of feeling your pain––human empathy is too feeble to spread itself across billions of strangers––but in the sense of realizing that your existence is cosmically no less important than theirs, and that we all have a responsibility to use the laws of the universe to enhance the conditions in which we all can flourish.""

86,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3055905-nils,1,"Dr Pangloss lives! I’m unconvinced that the various Enlightenments (there actually were several distinct Enlightenments, though Pinker seems unaware of this), much as I love them, can really be credited for the huge increase in human material well-being that has taken place over the last couple of centuries. This turns out not to be a trivial critique, since Pinker’s argument that the Enlightenment is what “caused” the material improvement drives his conclusion that the main threat to sustaining that improvement comes from those who he alleges are undermining the Enlightenment, e.g. the so-called postmodernists. This in turn leads to Pinker’s bizarre suggestion that the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche represent a greater threat to our sustained material well-being than, say, Exxon-Mobil and the Koch brothers. Judge for yourself whether you find that plausible.In fact, the real underpinning the material gains of the last two centuries have been more institutional than ideational. This in turn implies that we must scrutinize the solidity of our institutional matrix if we want a real purchase of the sustainability of these gains. First, there have been numerous civilizations achieving marked improvement in the welfare and well-being of their populations – at least their upper classes. The Maya, the Romans, and several dynastic episodes of the Chinese achieved such gains. Of course, the gains that industrial modernity has achieved over the last quarter millennium outstrips all previous improvements. But taking the longer view, the gains of modernity are perhaps less impressive than they seem. Almost all those gains have taken place in the last quarter millennium, and 250 years, after all, isn’t that long of a run for a civilization. Other historical civilizations have sustained their gains for much longer. The Roman Empire’s eastern branch basked in cultural glory for a thousand years. And even though it’s usually meant pejoratively, it’s no coincidence that the word “byzantine” is a synonym for institutional complexity.Second, there are reasons to suspect that modernity’s run of material amelioration may be drawing to a close—and may even go into reverse. Broadly speaking these reasons can be divided in two. The first concern biophysical limits to growth. These are enduring arguments that the Breakthrough Institute has done much to illuminate and clarify, so suffice to say that, as a long term proposition, Malthus hasn’t yet been proven wrong, and climate change presents challenges of unprecedented scale that will only be addressed if there is sufficient collective political will to overcome collective action and free riding challenges. It’s at best unclear whether we have the global social capital to do so. Put another way: we live in an era of wicked problems.My own skepticism about whether humanity can overcome these challenges brings me to my fundamental critique of Pinker’s optimism: not only the sustainability of the gains of the last quarter millennium, but also the extensibility of these to larger sections of humanity, as well as the ability to address the growing headwinds posed by anthropogenic climate change depend crucially on a massive strengthening of our global institutional and governance infrastructure. From this perspective, all the indicators are sharply negative over the last fifty and especially the last ten years.For nearly fifty years, Gallup has run a series of polls asking Americans about their confidence in various institutions – universities, the media, business, political institutions, and so forth. While the data are noisy, the overall trendline is inexorably downwards. The decline in confidence is partly the result of sustained anti-institutional propaganda, which exists in both leftwing and rightwing versions. But as I have argued elsewhere, I believe the root cause of this declining trust is the objectively poor institutional performance and a lack of elite accountability. A general feature of late modernity is a declining faith in social authority of all sorts, as ever more individuated and autonomous polities become ever less willing to entrust political agents to do anything. The advent of Donald Trump is merely a symptom of both the failure and the rejection of institutions in the United States.Nor is this just an American phenomenon. The rise of populism across Europe likewise reflects distrust of institutions. The Brexit vote two years ago of course represented a direct rebuke to transnational institutions. More recently, the triumph in the Italian elections of the Five Start Movement, whose calling card was a rejection of political party infrastructure, signaled nothing if not a rejection of institutions. (It remains unclear whether the Movement can manage even a small city, let alone Italy as a whole.)With the United States in the grip of Trumpism and the European Union caught between shambolic national politics and collective dissolution, the primary hope for global leadership seems to be falling by default to the Chinese. Some people have argued that China is filling the institutional gap left by a receding Europe and the United States. Eric X. Li, for example, recently argued that Xi Jinping’s merging of Chinese state and party infrastructure makes sense given that “the party has developed into the most competent national political institution in the world today.” What this bold claim tacitly conceded is that, despite the huge successes the Chinese state has had in poverty reduction over the last 40 years, China’s existing institutions are inadequate to managing the bumpy course corrections that lie ahead if it is to sustain its gains.Even more worrying than the declining performance of global and national political institutions are the faltering institutional underpinnings of sustained technological innovation – innovation which everyone, optimists and pessimists alike, agrees is essential to any adequate plan for addressing the challenges posed by climate change. As Mariana Mazzucato has shown, state support for innovation and entrepreneurship has in fact been at the root of almost all major technological breakthroughs of the last 75 years. Specifically, much of this support has taken place through trillions of dollars of state funding for research universities. But universities today are under unprecedented assault. Variously accused of being hotbeds of leftist indoctrination, engines of neoliberal reproduction, or simply wastes of money, no one trusts universities anymore. (This is the real place where the “postmodernists” have something to answer for: they have both been a primary vector of critique of universities, in effect sawing at the branch they sit on, while at the same time provoking hysteria about the supposed insanity of the humanities, of which Pinker’s book is a characteristic example.) While it seems inconceivable that the United States in particular would flush away the linchpin of its technological, industrial, and soft power success, the cultural assault on universities today is unparalleled. Non-coincidentally, universities also face a funding crisis of unprecedented proportions, one that is hitting humanities departments first but which the STEM fields are unlikely to escape. All this threatens to cut the legs out from under the innovation engine that is critical to any effort to escape the grim climate reaper."
87,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna,4,"This is nonfiction and it covers a giant host of various topics, including politics, racism, war, etc. For as long as this audiobook was, I was never bored. The author moved effortlessly and quickly from topic to topic to topic. That style worked here. So the 4 stars is for the entertainment value that I was able to place on this. Now with all that said, it usually bothers me when the author slants all the info to fit his views and then completely glosses over other things that might deflate his defense. While this author did that (abundantly), I didn't find it offensive or annoying. He had some well placed humor to soften that reaction. "
88,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68472482-daniel,5,"This is the best book I have ever read which is something I’m not saying lightly. It makes you so optimistic about the state of human progress and it makes you truly appreciate how much progress we have made over the past couple of centuries. It is really mind-blowing. If you weren’t already, it will also make you very optimistic about the likeliness of this progress continuing in the future with the help of, among other things, technology and today’s widely available information resources.Pinker goes through a wide range of subjects from Life expectancy, Peace and Safety to Equal rights, Knowledge, Quality of life and Happiness. He backs it up with rigorous research and clearly shows how almost every relevant parameter is going in the right direction. The only two areas that as of now haven't shown clear-as-day improvements over time are Terrorism and Global warming. (Another area, which Pinker didn’t include in the book, that could be considered a blip in the otherwise steady drumbeat of progress, are the recent reports of increasing death rates among middle-aged Americans over the past decade.) Focusing on the bigger picture analysis that Pinker provides all throughout the book rather than the daily news and shorter-term trends, you get the true picture of how well humanity is doing.One fascinating example of this is what Pinker calls the consumer surplus. Think about the washing machine. It saves us 10h per week compared to 1920 and costs a few hundred dollars. Now, if you think about how much someone would have to pay you for you to give up your washing machine, the number is clearly not in the hundreds of dollars anymore. Many people in developed nations would say that there is no price that would make them give it up. So not only are we richer but many of the utilities (and other things) that we use everyday can be bought for almost nothing compared to their actual value to us. This wasn't true 50 and 100 years ago. Another example is that today the average American worker retires at 62. Hundred years ago the average American worker died at 51.Pinker thinks (and I agree) that the media is responsible for a large part of today’s unfounded, but in many parts of the Western world, prevailing pessimism. As he puts it “When voters are inches away from the news, optimism can seem naive.” He points out that if newspapers would have elected to report more good news, they could have run the headline ""Number of people in extreme poverty fell by 137,000 since yesterday"" every day for the past 25 years.The book is structured in such a way that you can easily read only one chapter that you find interesting and skip the rest. There is for example a very good chapter on the environment and climate change if you want to read up on that. I do think Pinker misses some of the big potential risks in his discussion on AI, for example advanced AI systems in the wrong hands. And I think you can safely skim through the final three chapters without missing too much of an otherwise wonderful book.As a side note, the reason I decided to read this book was Bill Gates' glowing review of it some time ago. As you can see, I wasn’t disappointed. In his review, Bill said that he read the book very slowly because he loved it so much, but that he thought “most people will find it a quick and accessible read.” Perhaps he wrote the review in the ensuing euphoria after having just finished the book because I can assure you of one thing: this book is a lot of things, an easy read for most people it is not (it’s all relative I guess). But it is enormously fun reading and often highly enlightening so it's well worth your time. A big thank you to Pinker for putting things in the right perspective and allowing readers to see the bigger picture so clearly."

The first drawback to reading this book is that it covers a lot of the same ground as ""Better Angels of our Nature."" The second drawback to this book is that...well, even if the conclusions of this book aren't common sense, to people who are roughly familiar with enlightenment ideals and are fairly well-read on current affairs, it sort of is common sense. That's a nice way of saying that there are few ideas in this book that will leave you awe-struck. That's not to see that Pinker isn't capable of writing such a book. I found ""The Blank Slate"" to be just such a book. That book remains one of my favorite books to this day. That is also the book I point to when I want to convince people what a great thinker Pinker is. Pinker's argument is straightforward and comes in the preface: ""I will present a different understanding of the world, grounded in fact and inspired by the ideals of the Enlightenment: reason, science, humanism, and progress. Enlightenment ideals, I hope to show, are timeless, but they have never been more relevant than they are right now."" (page 12). If Enlightenment ideas are timeless, then why do they need a defense? Pinker's answer: ""The ideals of the Enlightenment are products of human reason, but they always struggle with other strands of human nature: loyalty to tribe, deference to authority, magical thinking, the blaming of misfortune on evildoers"" (page 18). In many ways, ""Enlightenment Now"" is similar to ""Factfullness"" in its use of quantitative data to make the case that life is indeed getting better. Pinker's earlier book ""Better Angels of our Nature"" was also a book that relied heavily on quantitative data. However, by my recollection, that book did a better job of reflecting on how the numbers were arrived at. I think numeracy is an important skill, and too often it is easy to be wowed by numbers without realizing how they are produced and the difficulty of getting reliable numbers in certain contexts -- for example, the distant past and developing countries. My recollection of ""Better Angels"" is a few years removed, but I seem to remember Pinker doing a better job with educating readers on how numbers were arrived at. Having said that, I do think the graphs are presented in a useful and simple way. Often, the data comes in the form of time series line charts. I think the repeated use of these kinds of statistics is great for more casual readers who need to be convinced. Another drawback to this book is that it tends to ignore and short-change the possibility of cataclysmic blowups. The discussion of the disruptive power of AI is discussed briefly, but pales in seriousness to Yuval Harari's analysis in ""21 Lessons for the 21st Century."" The benefits of enlightenment are discussed abundantly, but Frankenstein monsters like mortgage-backed securities are barely mentioned. In addition, one of the most important trends of the 21st century, the explosion of debt is barely discussed. The looming debt crisis (or, I should say crises since we are talking about various kinds of debts, government, municipal, shadow banking, and private) as well as other potential crises with systemic implications -- climate change, the growing use of social media, the introduction of disruptive technologies -- are under-discussed in this book. And because these systemic crises are under-discussed, Pinker fails to deal with the mother of all questions about modernity. Does modernity increase the risk of catastrophic blow-ups? Since nuclear war, climate change, and contagious financial panics are the product in one way or another of modernity, science, and globalization, is there a likelihood that more potentially catastrophic phenomena could be birthed from them? And, if so, what can we do to prevent potential catastrophic blow-ups from occurring? Another way to think about the question is this way: In what ways is modern progress like a financial bubble? For me, a high point of the book was its discussion of tribal epistemology. I have read short articles on tribal thinking, but the review of the literature here was excellent. And for those who are searching for literature that discusses this topic, the book can make for an effective gateway. This was written in the Guardian about this book: ""More pertinently, the failed 2016 campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Remain demonstrated that, in the eyes of many people, “progress” simply meant more of the same. When people feel trapped and patronised by progress, then any alternative – even regress – will feel like freedom. Informing them that the policies of the past 40 years are still the best available starts to sound hopeless."" (Full review here: https://www.theguardian.com/books/201...)Perhaps that's another way of saying that technocratic modernity (complete with its wonky charts) can feel emotionally ungratifying. Instead of gradual improvements and progress by a thousand nudges, there is a part of the soul that yearns for liberation, heroism, and love. People like stories with heroes and villains. Enlightenment often sees the world in terms of mechanical and quasi-mechanical cause and effect relationships. Heroism seems less like heroism when it requires design and system-thinking rather than great sacrifices. Nassim Taleb, another writer whose work I admire, steeps his writing in decidedly non-modern ideas and sentiments -- his thinking perhaps is best described as classical and romantic. I believe anyone who reads this book ought to put it in conversation with some of Taleb's writing (one or two books is enough). I'm sure each of the authors would hate to hear it, but I'll say it anyway -- they are better read together than separately. The unabashed modernist/enlightenment thinker is better with a classical/romantic counterpart and vice versa. I will repeat this: People who are only familiar with Pinker for ""Better Angels"" and ""Enlightenment Now"" ought to read his earlier work ""Blank Slate."" That book, more than his more recent works, demonstrates that he is a true thinker and not simply a chart-jockey or dataphile. Overall, even if you do not need to be convinced of the merit of enlightenment ideas and ideals, this is a wonderful book to read. "
91,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,4,"If you're looking for a cure for the common pessimism, you might do much, much worse than to pick up this book. I've read or seen many other examples of the facts portrayed here, but Steven Pinker does a very admirable job of showing us, exactly, how much better the world is now compared to the one we had even a hundred years ago. It's not just time-saving devices or some outright reversals of ecological damage, but how lifespans, general IQ, overall poverty level, and even WAR has improved for the better for all. Not that war is ever really all that great, mind you, but few nations jump into it with quite as little reason or abandon as they used to.Pinker isn't saying that everything is peachy, of course, but the trend toward real positive progress is undeniable. This is, despite setbacks. And yes, we have many. But for every problem that exists, he makes a very good point that we have it in us to FIX our problems. It's not out of the question.Global Warming, for example, not only has possible temporary and minor fixes available, such as applying a metaphorical sunscreen to the atmosphere, but we have the means to do much more than cut our carbon footprint down to the bone. We have a history of moving on to different methods whenever resources of one type or another run out, too. Health and education are at an all-time high. What we don't have is our optimism. In fact, we have a very solid outlook that things are worse than ever. Terrorists are few in number and never accomplish their stated goals. They merely rouse the combined might of all the powers to quash them. Most of the first world countries have made a point of living by equality in the sexes and the trend is more of the same across the world. LGBT is already accepted on the same scale. Pinker attributes all our actual progress to the Enlightenment. The old standard of 19th-century thinking, where humanism reigns supreme. Look. I freely admit to being a humanist, myself. I LOVE the idea that we all should get along. That every life is valuable. That we should have a high fundamental basis for living for every man, woman, and child alive. It's so pervasive an idea that practically everyone shares it. It's like... OBVIOUS, right? And as far as I know, Steven Pinker is right. But he also makes a very cogent point about the need to be rational, to use science for what it is intended. Inquiry, truth-seeking. No matter what the result, the truth is much more important than any ideology. He uses this to encourage each and every one of us to see past the doomsayers and the demagogs. Again, I totally agree. Skepticism is not the same thing as pessimism. Almost everyone I know is a fundamentally decent person and we all want the same fundamental things.So why didn't I give this book a full five stars?Because he gives all the credit to humanism. Wishing does not make it so. He might be right, but let's face it: this might be what he, himself warned us about. Selection Bias.Even so, I love thinking about it and I totally recommend this book for anyone who is sick and tired of the news and wants someone with a lot of facts and good reasoning to pick them up off the ground, dust their shoulders, and tell them that we are, on the whole, doing pretty damn well for ourselves. You know, despite the actual problems. But then, we DO have it in ourselves to FIX THEM. :)"
92,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51602586-dominika,2,"I did not like this book.I would say that this book was middling for the majority of it. The idea of the book is that progress has already happened, and we shouldn't be as doom and gloom as we are. But for a man who emphasizes the use of data and critical thinking, he doesn't really read said data that well and some of his arguments are riddled with gaping holes. This was a book that was read at our book club (but I was the only person at that book club who read the book in its entirety) and one of the points was that you need to show that progress has been made in order to do more progress. I have mixed feelings: I feel as though that erases the issues that people are actually facing by trying to point out that ""oh but you won't die in the woods from an infection"". While it is nice that countries that were in extreme poverty 50 years ago are being lifted to the middle class, it won't matter to the person who is working 3 jobs at minimum wage so that they can support a family. We have a lot of great innovations in healthcare, but it doesn't matter when a person cannot take an ambulance because it will cost them $600. Some of the progress sections have rather weak arguments as well. The environment one was basically him saying that the system will fix itself (in terms of a capitalist system supporting renewable energy) and that we'll totally invent carbon capture technology. The happiness one also bugged me, because the data is just not consistent. But the section that really got my blood boiling was Science. First off, he tries putting his deregulation mindset against IRBs and says a really fucking insensitive thing about the Tuskegee Syphilis study (But black people worked on it and it's not like they were INFECTING people with Syphilis). And then the rest of it was a STEM circlejerk (Wah, why are these SOCIAL SCIENCES invading my medical research). I work in medical research and am working towards a masters in Epidemiology. We cannot live in our own bubbles, we must learn from different disciplines. Hard sciences bring data-driven analysis to every subject, but social sciences bring the ability to look at the whole picture. Humanities bring the ability to make these things appealing and also to think creatively, to gain inspiration. We need them all, and it's a shame that Pinker doesn't realize that.Oh boy, and I'm not even going to start on the Humanism section and his comments on Islam. Not only does he not see how Western Imperialism could have POSSIBLY encouraged a more patriarchal regime as opposed to just reading religious texts (Look at the south), he also is just full of double standards. Oh, and his arguement against Nietsche is that dictators read him. He doesn't seem to get the Nietsche is all about skepticism. I do really like the chapter on Ideas. While it isn't something that I haven't heard before, I liked the comment on how a lot of politics now isn't even about core fundamental beliefs, but about who's team is winning. The truth is, Pinker and I differ on some core ideologies. Pinker refutes Postmodern philosophy while I am very postmodern. We have some differing opinions on the amount of regulations things should get and whether systems will correct themselves. I understand that. I read Ayn Rand, and I felt as though more of the arguments were at least compelling (if not occassionally bat-shit crazy). I didn't feel the same way about Pinker.All of this isn't helped by how reading this book felt equivelent to eating raw almonds. It was bland, it was dense, Pinker repeated himself and would attempt some flowery tangent while utterly failing. My friend said he tried reading the book during his night shift job and then fell asleep, and then got the audiobook and fell asleep again. I know he's not trying to say that we shouldn't work hard to improve the world, but I don't particularly feel any inspiration from this book, particularly when the vast majority does try to read as a pat on the back in spite of his introduction. I felt like a majority of his arguments were flaccid with the occasionally toxic take, and this book in general was overbloated. "
93,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"In Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, Steven Pinker spends 550+ pages attempting to disavow you of any notion of ""the good ol' days"".And he IS pretty convincing. He's got stats and graphs and lots of evidence to bolster his case that we live in amazing times - that progress and Enlightenment-era ideals have lead to better conditions in almost every measurable sphere. And he's right. He spends some ink and time on why we feel the opposite so often - the world is a hell hole! - pointing towards psychological phenomena like the optimism gap, the availability heuristic, (leaning heavily on Kahneman and Tvorsky's work) and the tendency we all have to remember negative over positive.I didn't read his earlier book about the decline of violence, The Better Angels of our Nature, but this book looks like a more robust version of that one, with a broad focus to include public health, economics, climate change, nuclear weapons, and the timely discussion of authoritarian populism.It's not all roses and puppies, but there are many great things and amazing research that lead to more great things. That's a good thing to remember, and a clarion call to keep going with research and evidence-based activism. All in the name of progress and making things more equal."
94,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11654681-paul,3,"I'm a big fan of Pinker, but I can't say I really enjoyed this book. Impeccably written, as always, but I feel like some of the conclusions he draws from the data he cites are somewhat spurious. "
95,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47417894-laura-noggle,4,"This was an encouraging, uplifting look at many of the successes and bright spots that often get overlooked. However, it's clear things need to be taken with a large grain of salt. I admit, my initial five star rating was more out of the hopefulness associated with the book. Hopefulness that the world isn't really going to hell in a handbasket, and hopeful that the mass generalizations and questionable analysis of facts/statistics had a firm foundation. After reading Nassim Nicholas Taleb's multiple epic burns on Pinker in his book  Skin in the Game: The Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life, I had to reassess my star rating after I stopped laughing. Basically,  Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are, and  But What If We're Wrong? Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past. You can't trust anything or anyone! Fake news! Still, this book provides a sweeping view that is very much appreciated, if not 100% infallible. "

GMOs, fertilizers, and vaccines have and continue to save billions of lives. The global standard of living has never been higher. In virtually every measurable way, life is better for us than it has ever been for any generation of humanity before us. True, Donald Trump is the president of the United States and average global temperatures are increasing. But those problems have solutions. Reason, science, and humanism.

97,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35-michael-siliski,4,"Recommended for anyone interested in a wake-up call about the progress made over the past few centuries.Enlightenment Now makes the case that the ideals of reason, science, and humanism have driven the greatest advances in the history of human civilization over the past few centuries. The book is divided into three parts: the history of the enlightenment, the progress we’ve made, and the enlightenment ideals that must be defended going forward. However, the meat of the book, and Pinker’s passion, is clearly the middle section, which is a thorough and data-based walk through fifteen areas where human lives are almost indistinguishably improved from just 10 generations ago, including health, peace, freedom, inequality, the environment, and happiness. Pinker’s enemies are “progressophobes” on both the right (the anti-science forces, the Trumpian politics of grievance) and left (New York Times-style liberal handwringing and catastrophizing). Both sides are prone to populism and a desire to return to an imagined utopian past. Pinker is successful in his main goal of thoroughly debunking that such a past ever existed.Enlightenment Now has a lot in common with Hans Rosling’s Factfulness, which I wrote about recently. Pinker is quite a bit longer and goes much deeper, so if you’re the type to ask for the data backing each claim, this might be the better book for you. I also thought Pinker was much more successful in grounding his celebration of human progress in a memorable framework.Both books suffer from a relentless optimism that can feel a bit strident at times. For Pinker, I thought this was most evident in his discussions of inequality and happiness, both of which felt a bit blithe to me. I think there is good reason to reject the most pessimistic takes on these: that more wealth doesn’t make people any happier or even that people are less happy these days, that inequality within a society is far more important than absolute means. Pinker does a good job making the case that inequality is not equivalent to poverty, and that “in some ways the world has become less equal, but in more ways the world’s people have become better off.” He makes a compelling argument that happiness is directly related to wealth, in particular using Stevenson & Wolfers studies. But these are not the same as proving “the irrelevance of inequality to happiness” or demonstrating that individual happiness is primarily driven by wealth. I thought these sections would be stronger if they didn’t reach quite so far.I agree with Pinker that reason, science, and humanism are critically important to human well-being globally, and these days it does feel a defense of them is needed. While I doubt that many who disagree with the thesis would even pick this book up, Pinker does make a similar point to Rosling that many of the most well-educated, including academics, are unaware of how much progress actually has been made through Enlightenment ideals. So perhaps there is hope that books like this could have a positive influence.From: https://medium.com/@msiliski/enlighte..."
98,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13941368-bakunin,4,"I usually wait a while to write a review of a book in order to digest all the important aspects of the work and this is certainly true in this case as well. Being somewhat of a libertarian with conservative leanings I found this book to be both illuminating as well as challenging. This book is Pinkers best attempt to defend the enlightenment; that is to say humanism, science and reason. He goes through many aspects quantitatively to prove his point - health, inequality, evironment, peace, safety, equal rights, quality of life etc - and all these things seem to be going in the right direction. Countries which are more democratic and more liberal are happier. This is essentially a more scientific defense of what Popper called ""the open society"". Although I find it refreshing to read a somewhat optimistic book in the midst of all the usual gloom one encounters in the daily press, I find myself in disagreement with Pinker. I agree with Pinker in that we are living the best possible time but what bothers me is the fact that I believe that the welfare state won't be able to sustain this growth (or progress if you will). Although Pinker has a certain classical liberal leaning, he is not very worried about the implications of an ever expanding welfare state: the destruction of the family, mass immigration, and the infantilization of citizens in the west. His liberal predilection is also shown by his apparent scorn of Trump and 'populism'. I suppose that this is where the rubber meets the road - I believe that communities are necessary and that the individual is not a tabula rasa. I also strongly reject the notion of an enlightened elite telling people how to better live their lives. While my values often may coincide with Pinkers, I believe in a slow and organic change in society, rather than a forced political one. Pinker by contrast scorns tribalist behavior and finds this to be reactionary; a force to be fought with a scientific mind. Although I have a certain buddhist leaning myself, I am slowly becoming more convinced of the need to be a person in modern society and the need therefore to retain certain elements of tribalism. Where to draw this line is however unclear. "
99,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75777506-tom-zacharski,2,"I picked ""Enlightenment Now"" after Bill Gates's recommendation. It's not every day that you hear someone like Gates recommend their favorite book of all time. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed. The premise of the book is that, as humanity, we are much better off nowadays than ever before in history. Pinker draws on many statistics, graphs, and facts to show that is indeed the reality. While I love that premise and couldn't agree more (we need more of those reminders in the age of 24h media) I found the language and general style a bit hard to read and unpleasant to a reader - it read a bit too much like a textbook and too often felt like going through well researched and academic in nature Powerpoint slides. The book could have easily been three times shorter and would drive the points home more effectively. Nonetheless, the points are important and if you've never read anything about how far we have come as humanity I do recommend the book. I recently saw ""The Final Year"" - a documentary about Barafh Obama's last year in office and how his foreign policy team operated during the time of a divisive, and later shocking, election. At one point Obama says that history does not follow a straight line, rather it zigs and zags, there's ups and downs, but it's our job to make sure the trend continues upward. And that trend is what the ""Enlightenment Now"" is all about."

Pinker was named one of Time Magazine’s 100 most influential people in the world in 2004 and his books are regularly featured in the best-selling lists. While the purpose of this book is commendable – to show with extensive use of data that we are living in the best of times – two reasons made me cringe while reading it. Firstly, the author completely misses the mark on the topic I have dedicated part of my professional life for the past 10+ years: climate change.

102,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"I listened to this as an audiobook & it was good, but he has a lot of graphs so quick reference to the PDF is a big plus. There are also sections where it's nice to reread his thoughts, although most are straightforward enough that it's not necessary. His writing is clean & uncluttered. It follows a logical progression.There are 3 sections:1) Enlightenment2) Progress3) Reason, Science, & HumanismThe first two sections are great. I've read about the Age of Ignorance, its history, & its benefits before, but his is one of the best as he proves the benefit of the scientific method to mankind through some very telling statistics. I loved the section on how much wealth we now have comparatively. I've read comparisons about the cost of an hour of light, but it always impresses me. He shows how much less violence, starvation, & disease there is. So why do we think the world is in such danger? He thinks it's due mostly to brain bugs & loud extremists both on the left & right.The last section ""Reason, Science, & Humanism"" was preaching to the choir. It was long & boring at times. There was a lot of good information in it & while I agreed with him in general, he went over the top or underplayed several things. For instance, he seems to consider an existential threat as serious only if they'll kill off most people. He fails to mention how horrific a tragedy which abruptly killed 1% of our population would be (1% of 7 billion is 700 million!) or what the loss of an entire city could do to our society. IIRC, some have said it could take as little as losing 10% of the population to bring down our civilization since it is incredibly interconnected. Something like a nationwide outage of electric could be catastrophic even if it lasted a fairly short time. Cities only have a few days worth of food & places like LA rely on a lot of infrastructure. Millions are living in a desert, an area where the first settlement didn't make it.His thoughts on nuclear bombs were very simplistic & incomplete. Hindsight of what the Kremlin would have actually done during the Cold War based on records we're now reading is armchair quarterbacking at its worst. He also didn't get into the options of nuclear bombs like tactical nukes. I remember some talking heads discussing how great the tactical nuke option was going to be at one point. It was insane! Apparently he doesn't believe how close we were to annihilation.Worse, he dismissed the effect of the atomic bombs we did drop saying that the Japanese surrendered because the Russians were entering their area of the war. That's ridiculously simplistic, just one of many factors & I don't believe it was the deciding one. The Japanese were out of everything & the Allies were pushing them back in force. Kamikazes weren't their first choice as weapons, but born of desperation. In March, Tokyo was bombed by something like 300 planes - nothing like Dolittle's desperate raid of a few years before. It was a huge force with horrific results, but it was also understandable & they knew we couldn't afford it too often. In August, one plane dropped one bomb that was about as bad. A few days later, we repeated the trick. They didn't know the cost or how many more we had. How can anyone dismiss that?It's crazy hard to get fissionable materials, but they aren't the only nuclear threat. It's a lot easier to get radioactive waste & spread it around with conventional explosives. It doesn't take a genius & if it or a biological/chemical agent is put in the right place, someplace upwind. It could be devastating. Not an end of the world catastrophe, but up there with the Twin Towers. I don't think it's particularly likely, but everyone thought Clancy's novel, Debt of Honor (1994) was just unlikely fiction, too. If you haven't read it, a guy crashes a jet into Congress & pretty much wipes them all out. This was 7 years before 9/11, but airline security didn't change so his dismissive attitude towards terrorists seems a bit over done. Still, I generally agreed with him. We can be too anxious. Current airline security is a good example, but there are a lot of smart people trying to keep us safe. We're walking a tightrope between safety & losing our freedoms. Our anxiety only makes the latter more likely, so I'm glad of his perspective.Overall, it's a good book. If you're super religious or a big Trump supporter, you'll probably dislike the last section especially. Pinker beats on both sides of the aisle, but the anti-humanist & anti-science of the current administration is in front of us now, so he gives a lot of good reasons for his negative opinions.Highly recommended in any format, but do get the PDF with the audiobook. Very well narrated."

What is progress? You might think that the question is so subjective and culturally relative as to be forever unanswerable. In fact, it’s one of the easier questions to answer. Most people agree that life is better than death. Health is better than sickness. Sustenance is better than hunger. Abundance is better than poverty. Peace is better than war. Safety is better than danger. Freedom is better than tyranny. Equal rights are better than bigotry and discrimination. Literacy is better than illiteracy. Knowledge is better than ignorance. Intelligence is better than dull-wittedness. Happiness is better than misery. Opportunities to enjoy family, friends, culture, and nature are better than drudgery and monotony. All these things can be measured. If they have increased over time, that is progress. 
The subtitle of Enlightenment Now is: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, and as someone who has benefitted from all of these – in all of the ways enumerated in the opening quote – I don't know to what extent I needed the “case to be made” for these values. The difficulty I had is that while author Steven Pinker does define and defend each of these principles throughout the book, he is actually attempting to make the case for optimism – as though the entire world today has progressed in the direction of betterment (to greater or lesser degrees), as a direct result of Enlightenment thinkers, and as there isn't any problem facing us that can't be solved by doubling down on Enlightenment thinking and the advancement of science and technology, anyone who tends to pessimism (whether over the environment, existential angst, or the rise of populism and despotism) simply needs a long history lesson about all the ways in which things have gotten better and better. Pinker includes more than seventy graphs with pleasing curves (trending up or down over time, depending on whether they're tracking positive or negative metrics), he provides double, or even triple, digit footnotes for each chapter (assuring me that every statement he makes is backed by published sources), and with thirty fine-print pages of references at the end, I couldn't possibly track them all down in order to reach my own conclusions about the state of the world. The reader is repeatedly asked to take Dr. Pinker's word for it that everything is progressing well (towards a place of measurable betterment for humanity), and as I found myself often squirming with the uneasiness of not just wanting to take his word for it, and as I also found myself without the informational/philosophical background from which to dispute his arguments, I couldn't always follow where Pinker wanted to lead me; often as impatient with myself as with him. I'm glad I read this book – at least in an effort to understand what the big debates of our time might be – but I just don't have the knowledge base to properly respond to Pinker's arguments; three stars reflects my not taking a stand on this one.So, I'll make an aesthetic judgment: Pinker stretched my concentration with his frequent philosophical references to hermeneutics, dialectics, ontological this and that, but when he would descend to informal/hippie references to presumably lighten things up (many retirees are happy “seeing the national parks in a Winnebago, or dandling Vera, Chuck, and Dave in a cottage on the Isle of Wight”; drivers safely enjoy the pleasures of “seeing the USA in their Chevrolet, or just cruising down the streets, feeling out of sight, spending all their money on a Saturday night”), I found the writing forced, or worse, anachronistic. And I grew impatient with Pinker's smugly rhetorical strawman-punchline gags:
There is no law of complex systems that says that intelligent agents must turn into ruthless conquistadors. Indeed, we know of one highly advanced form of intelligence that evolved without this defect. They’re called women.
Or:
Of course, one can always imagine a Doomsday Computer that is malevolent, universally empowered, always on, and tamperproof. The way to deal with this threat is straightforward: don't build one.
Other ideas that made me squirm: Pinker stresses the need for rational thinking and the belief that the scientific method is the only way of measuring the world (using that, at a stroke, to dismiss human consciousness as a mere byproduct of evolution and the nonexistence of gods as an accepted fact). History progresses in one direction, and so long as we continue to embrace Enlightenment thinking and turn to science to solve our problems, there will be no environmental doomsday, no nuclear wars, no real terrorist threat to democracy, no Singularity (no “foom”). Pinker insists that science is politically bipartisan and he takes swipes at the anti-progressivism of the left (those who are reflexively anti-GMO, anti-vaccine, anti-nuclear) and the anti-intellectualism of the right (those who are creationists, anti-immigration, protectionist), and while that might make him seem a neutral party, Pinker never misses an opportunity to name President Trump as the anti-Enlightenment bogeyman who could reverse centuries of human progress. And since, as I pointed out, I don't feel qualified to confront Pinker on his facts, here is some of the professional response to Enlightenment Now (note: I chose to share reviews from left-slanting sources in order to prevent partisan fakenewsmanship):From the (officially bipartisan but purportedly leftwing) Australian public broadcaster, ABC –Pinker never seems to see the force of the question: How do we know that all this did not take place in spite of, rather than because of, the Enlightenment? In fact, he doesn't even pretend to go to the trouble of establishing a causal connection between his contentious version of the Enlightenment and the various improvements that he imagines follow in its wake. Post hoc, ergo propter hoc seems to be the operative principle. From New Statesman, a British newsmagazine that self-describes as having a “liberal, sceptical political position” –Judged as a contribution to thought, Enlightenment Now is embarrassingly feeble. With its primitive scientism and manga-style history of ideas, the book is a parody of Enlightenment thinking at its crudest. A more intellectually inquiring author would have conveyed something of the Enlightenment’s richness and diversity. Yet even if Pinker was capable of providing it, intellectual inquiry is not what his anxious flock demands. Only an anodyne, mythical Enlightenment can give them what they crave, which is relief from painful doubt.From The Globe & Mail, a decidedly progressive Canadian daily newspaper –
Pinker's gripe is largely aesthetic. A prominent egghead who writes and composes himself with Spock-like coldness and clarity, he seems annoyed at the frenzy (and so, irrationality) of ""editorialists,"" ""climate justice warriors,"" ""relativists,"" and the ""politically correct"" left. What Pinker never substantially considers is that such frenzy – whether deployed as a deliberate political tactic, or manifesting as the sputtering incoherence of the true believer – may help mobilize the spirit of change and progress; dams and ditches of passion that channel the turbulent tides of Enlightenment. 
And from one such “frenzied climate justice warrior” at The Guardian, the British daily that famously tilts left –
Pinker insults the Enlightenment principles he claims to defend. Could he have succumbed to the motivated reasoning these principles are supposed to suppress? If the environmental crisis cannot be so easily dismissed, it threatens his argument that life is steadily improving. What looks like a relentless enhancement in human welfare could emerge instead as an interlude between one form of deprivation and the next.
The bottom line: I slogged through this long read, encouraged by its optimism, but unconvinced by its argument. I was further annoyed by my own inability to articulate my increasingly negative response to Pinker's thesis, and recognise that as my own failing; I remain uncertain that I've adequately outlined my objections even with the addition of other reviewers' voices. Even so, I'm glad to have read this book and would recommend it to anyone interested in what “the eggheads” are talking about."
104,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5979619-boudewijn,3,"In this book, Steven Pinker wants to provide insight in the fruits of the Enlightenment and that the norms and values are still as important as everContrary to what you might believe, the world is in a much better shape than ever. Whether it is life expectancy, welfare, peace, democracy, knowledge or prosperity, there is not better moment to live than now.Most of the pages are dedicated with scores of statistics, all showing that things are going well. World life expectancy has doubled from 30 years (1800) to 71,4 years (2015). The world’s GDP has increased a 100 times and - despite the growing population - the number of people living in abject poverty is decreasing.But what about the challenges we’re facing today? The deplorable state of nature, extinctions and climate change? Yes, Steven Pinker acknowledges that these challenges exist, but where other relapse in doom scenario’s. Pinker advocates for a continuation of an optimal relation between (economic) progress and pollution. If humanity wants to survive, it needs to invest in progress itself: only after achieving a certain amount of welfare, people are willing to invest in (and sacrifice themselves for) a better environment. In other words, keep investing in the core values of the Enlightenment: rationalism, science and humanism. And yes, this includes nuclear energy, as a clean way of energy.In the last part of the book, Pinker delves into the current problems of the left and the right. The left thinks that the world is being plagued by inequality and the environment being endangered, the right think that his ‘culture’ is being destroyed by immigrations and minorities. Fact and figures that show that this is not the case, are being falsified or simply denied.The problem that I had with this book was its lack of nuance. He knows, or thinks he knows all, and does not refrain from his mantra that all is well, and will be well. There is no room for any considerations for those who - even today - might not be living their lives to their full capacity. Not because they don’t want to, but because they are simply kept from achieving it.

105,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48909861-dan-ust,4,"Overall a good book, though I believe Pinker overstates his case and is too narrowly focused on the Enlightenment itself — as if all progress were waiting for the 18th century to really start. This is strange given his earlier book, _The Better Angels of Our Nature_, where he documents the reduction in violence from the Stone Age on.He minimizes things like improved capabilities, while fine in themselves, can also breed greater risks. He does recognize this in the case of nuclear weapons. (One can argue that both ways: maybe nuclear deterrence has reduced or ended wars between major powers. But the devastation of one such weapon is certainly progress of a type many would question.)Also, he has what might best be called stylistic ticks. These wouldn’t be as bad in a brief talk, but became more vexing to me as I read the near 500 pages of the main text. (There are extensive footnotes worth mining too. I’ve read or skimmed a number of the works he cites.) By these I mean he seems to have to reword adages or quote songs and the like for somewhat comic effect. This works sometimes, but when it feels like every section must have one or two, it feels like padding in an already long work.I winced a little at his oversimplification of intellectual history, too, though I believe his trashing of Nietzsche is spot on. I winced further at his seeming to think the ruling class simply wants the best for everyone rather than it’s often resistant to progress and benefits from “gloom and doom” attitudes. (Politicians don’t run on the slogan that things are okay and getting better. Instead, election campaigns are morality plays where good is battling evil, where one side will redeem us and move is forward from the collapsing state we find ourselves in while the other wishes to push society over a cliff.)In many ways, too, Pinker’s work is an update of that of economist Julian Simon. One can argue that Pinker will have a greater impact because he’s not an economist and, despite my reservations above, is a much more accessible and wittier writer. (To be fair, it’s been a while since I’ve read Simon.)Ian Goldin also wrote a balanced review for Nature:https://www.nature.com/articles/d4158..."
106,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"This book was simply amazing. I've read the whole thing in less than two weeks. The material was very captivating, and the chapters in the book are well organized, allowing for natural breaks. Steven Pinker, the author, provides a rational and balanced view of the current state of humankind, how we got here, and where we're headed. He dives into vital topics directly and doesn't hold back or avoid anything. The book covers topics such as wealth, health, quality of life, society as a whole, climate change, education, and a lot more.The information shared is also backed up by real data which is quite refreshing. We're all surrounded with so much negativity from the mainstream news which can make the world seem like a terrible place to live in. And with this book, what I enjoyed was the more balanced presentation of the data without resorting to fear-mongering, which is so common these days with clickbait media.If you have any doubts, this book will open your eyes to the fact that we're all living in the best time for humankind since the beginning of our existence and things are getting better.As much as I enjoyed the optimistic viewpoint on certain topics in this book, I also like the fact that the author didn't exclude critical areas we as humans need to work on — one of those being climate change.There's very little doubt about the current situation with climate change and the urgency at which we need to operate to avoid a global disaster. The truth is, we all have to step up and do our part as this presents one of the biggest challenges for humankind yet.Overall, this book is a great read, and I highly recommend it. It covers so many important areas, and I'm glad I decided to read it. I have no doubts you'll enjoy it as much as I did."
107,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5196256-mindy,1,"I read this because Bill Gates highly recommended it, and because I felt I needed a more optimistic view of the progress of humanity. Why did I think Bill Gates’ reading list would hold any interest for me? This book is simply further evidence that all data can be manipulated to achieve a purpose. If you include yourself among the world’s wealthiest “citizens”, this is a great read to assuage any hint of privilege-related guilt you may feel. The extremely poor are in decline, and if the bulk of humanity is now simply poor, they should be content with their plight and thank their overlords from lifting them out of the squalor. I kept reading hoping for a redeeming moment. It never happened."
108,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"In 2011 Steven Pinker wrote a magnificent book, The Better Angels of our Nature, in which he showed – by using historical analysis, statistical methods and informed estimates – how the world has gotten safer (hence the subtitle of the book: The Decline of Violence). The gist of the book was that there have been continuous social reforms that have led to an environment in which our inner demons have fewer opportunities to surface and in which zero-sum games have been turned into positive-sum games. In 2017, Pinker followed up his 2011 work by extending his scientific method to the whole scale of human progress. In Enlightenment Now he wants to show us how the world not only got safer, but also became a much more pleasant place to live in – for almost all human beings that are born. Pinker wants to show us that this progress wasn’t inevitable: it was a conscious effort of human beings to start – for the first time in history – to apply reason to the goal of making the world a better place to live. This is important, since it shows us to not be complacent and to take all the gains for granted. Pinker tries to convince us readers that the Enlightenment values that drove this progress have to be remembered by and re-stated to each new generation.The book itself is divided into three parts; I will briefly summarize each part in the rest of this review.In part 1, Pinker describes how in the Enlightenment era people started to use reason to understand the world (science) and to distinguish right from wrong (ethics). No more witch hunts; no more mythologies; no more harsh punishments; etc. According to Pinker, mankind has to fight continuously against three natural entities: (1) entropy (the increasing of disorder), (2) evolution (the competition of all against all; zero-sum games), and (3) information (increasing our knowledge). In this fight, reason is the most important, and only, tool that we have to – temporarily – create a good place to live for ourselves. Pinker sees two contemporary threats to this ideal though: religion and populism (left- and rightwing). His goal of the rest of the book is hence; first to show that real progress has taken place; and next, to convince us that this progress was driven by Enlightenment values that have to be defended. So, in part 2 of the book Pinker applies the scientific method to analyze the different domains of human progress. He uses lots of graphs and he meticulously describes all the relevant scientific findings – just like he did in his 2011 book on the decline of violence. In short, people live longer; are healthier; are economically better off, even though inequality increases; the environment is (slowly) better off and the climate change fatalism is misguided (especially in light of all the technological advances); the world is more peaceful and safer than ever, while terrorism is a minor (insignificant) blip; democracy and equal rights are strongly instituted; and knowledge is readily accessible for masses of people and ever-progressing. In the closing chapters of part 2, Pinker also states that the newer generations are much happier, healthier and experience a much higher quality of life than earlier generations. Within generations this progress is also visible. The hailed existential threats to progress – technological enslavement and nuclear war – are serious issues but there really is no reason to be scared shitless: human beings, according to Pinker, are better and better equipped to turn zero-sum games into positive-sum games (i.e. turning existential threats into cooperated effort to ward off disaster). Pinker finishes part 2 by claiming that progress, even though contingent (i.e. depending on human choices), is a self-enhancing cycle: as the world is better off each year, countries will tend to cooperate more and more and living conditions of all human beings will tend to increase. Minor setbacks, such as the Trump presidency and the Brexit referendum, cannot stop the long-term trend of ever-increasing progress.After showing us how much the world has progressed, Pinker turns his book into an essay. In part 3 he makes a case for three Enlightenment values that are, according to him, essential to actively promote and continue the progress we have already made. The first of these values is reason, which is under increasing attack by generations of postmodernists (“objective reality doesn’t exist”, “all cultures are equal”, etc.) and populists (“the will of the people should be followed”, “we need a strong leader”, etc.). Next to these two ideologies, human beings suffer from biases and hence the media portray a picture of a world that is almost continuously on the brink of World War III. Pinker, essentially, advocates a more rational public discourse, in which fact checking and statistical reasoning trump Trumpism (pun intended).The second value Pinker advocates is science. In other words: trial and error. Not just to gain more knowledge and hence receive more control over our lives (by fighting diseases, natural disasters, etc.), but also to base our policies on. Politics, according to Pinker, should be more evidence-based and less ideology-driven. This is the old argument of piecemeal social engineering promoted by Karl Popper: changing policy in small steps; measuring and evaluating the results of each step; and adjusting where necessary.Pinker notices a trend in literary and cultural circles, especially due to scientifically illiterate self-proclaimed intellectuals, to blackball science and act like science is the root of all evil. The truth is that science is a-moral – in the sense that it doesn’t say whether we should build a-bombs, nuclear reactors for energy, or both, and in which situation – and that science offers us the possibility to better our lives. It is due to science that we live longer, healthier and wealthier.The third and last value that Pinker advocates is humanism. Humanism is the answer to the problem of the a-morality of science: it tells us what to do with all the knowledge, wealth and technological possibilities. Pinker uses the ethics of one of the founders of the Enlightenment, Spinoza. According to Spinoza, any human being that is governed by reason will wish for any other human the same things as they wish for themselves. This is a strong ethical imperative, and Pinker uses the rest of the chapter to state it more fully (in short: consequentialism) and to refute the two counter-narratives: religious morals (which are, according to Pinker, humanized by humanism – with the exception of Islam) and populism/nationalism (which are inspired by the ethics of Nietzsche’s Übermensch and heroism).All of the above is my try to summarize Pinker’s thoughts as honest and representative as possible. Of course this is practically impossible: the book is huge and Pinker is much nuanced on all of the themes mentioned. But: what to think of it all?First, I applaud Pinker for stating clearly how far we have come since the 16th century: how much better off human beings are in the 21st century world. As Pinker himself repeats, it is trendy to be a cultural pessimist. All this liberalism and progress has led to atomized societies and hedonistic, empty lives. It is also very fancy to be a fatalist, especially regarding the environment and climate. Pinker's book is a healthy antidote to all this doom-thinking and the masses of studies and graphs he uses to back up his arguments make cultural pessimism and climate fatalism hard to sustain.Second, I think Pinker is right in seeing humanism, reason and science as the driving forces behind the world we live in nowadays. It is only when reason is set aside – consciously or unconsciously – that progress halts and that we fall back on our primitive nature and zero-sum value systems. I think he is also right in describing the two major threats to the world as we know it: religious morality and populism (again, left- as well as rightwing). So in all this, Enlightenment Now is a terribly accurate and timely book.But I do disagree with some of Pinker’s observations, especially the ones on happiness and quality of life. I cannot help but reflect that Enlightenment Now is written by a Harvard professor whose life is spent on creative thinking and intellectual effort to understand the world. I don’t think many of us can share this luxury, and that for many of us leading ‘normal lives’ life isn’t as fulfilling or free as we wish. Pinker’s line of argument is (albeit simplified): younger generations suffer less from addictions; commit fewer suicides; suffer less from depression; etc.; hence, they are happier than earlier generations and have a higher quality of life. I don’t know if the amount of suicides and depressions says anything (or much) about the happiness of people. And another problem with this line of thinking – which really surfaces throughout the whole book – is that it generalizes over everyone. It is entirely possible that certain parts of the population are worse off, but that this negative effect is swamped by an exponential increase of happiness by the rest of the population. For example, due to globalization, the world is better off, and the poorest people and the poorest countries are the real gainers in health and wealth; yet the (lower) middle classes and lower classes in richer countries are really worse off than earlier generations – combined with an ever-increasing decline of social mobility. The same thing goes with people in vulnerable professions or in vulnerable life situations: handicapped people, sick people, old people, etc. In all developed countries we see an ever-increasing jungle of rules and regulations, to guarantee an equal treatment for all people in like situations. This sounds beautiful and noble, but it results in health care workers clocking five minutes for washing elderly people; treating schoolchildren as revenue and future tax payers; making people who depend on social welfare end up in mazes of bureaucracy; etc. Is this truly progress? (Of course, Pinker would counter: would they be better off in the nineteenth century?)My point is that statistics are useful to describe general trends and to understand what causes play a role. When we understand what factors make the world a better place to live in, we can apply more of the same potion. Understanding is fundamental. But scientific studies of subjects like happiness - even apart from all the methodological issues involved - are rather empty when we're dealing with our own personal lives and our loved ones around us. Stating, for example, that more people are better off and that poverty declines, is a rather meaningless statement when talking to someone who just lost his or her job because his or her employer moved to a developing country. Personally, I think the diffusion of liberalism, the results of equal rights movements (including feminism), and decades of migration have led to a diminishing social cohesion in Western societies – and between countries worldwide. This is, for example, illustrated by contemporary elections: a huge assembly of small political factions and an increasingly polarized climate. It is also illustrated by the popularity of identity politics, in which individuals base their personal identity on biological and cultural traits. Western societies have degraded into collections of individuals without much common ground. Hence, all the rules and regulations to enforce equality: people don’t trust each other anymore – or at least less than before. I cannot help but remark that in Sweden there are plans to make laws to make two adults consent to have sexual intercourse - as if the intricate and complex dealings in real life can be translated and enforced by abstract laws. The same applies to the laws against islamophobia that the Canadian parliament put into practice in 2017. This is symptomatic of societies lacking social cohesion and reciprocal trust and commitment.I think Pinker is over-optimistic when it comes to a better world. He does notice an increase in global and national inequality and declining social mobility, but he doesn’t see it as serious arguments against progress. Of course, from a macro-perspective, the world is better off and this is a good thing. But people don’t like grim futures and this can become very problematic in countries in which large swathes of the population have to give up health and wealth to transfer it to developing countries – something which is inevitable if the world economy continues the way it does now. I think the safe thing to say is that Enlightenment Now is a reliably optimistic book on how the world as a whole is much better off in 2018 than in 1618. The causes of this progress are humanism, reason and science. On a grand scale, Pinker’s book is an important reminder of the possibilities of human progress – if/when we set our minds to it we can do a lot to better our lives. Yet by zooming out, Pinker steers around the (equally important) question of a declining standard of life for individuals and particular social groups and a feeling of loss of social cohesion. Yet, these last points weren’t the goal of his book, so I shouldn’t end this review on such a sour note. It’s a very interesting and readable book: read it!"
109,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1139239-michael-austin,4,"Steven Pinker is a rare creature in the academic world: a liberal who is not a leftist. As a liberal he supports things like free speech, civil rights, democratic ideals, and a strong government that ensures safety, protects the environment, and redistributes some portion of income to support education, health care, infrastructure, and the reduction of poverty. As a non-leftist, he supports things like a democratic government and a capitalist economy that, while subject to government regulation and income redistribution, still functions as a free market. Like most of Pinker’s books, Enlightenment Now is big and filled with lots of data, but actually very tightly argued. The sequence of his argument goes something like this:1.	In the eighteenth century, European intellectuals produced a movement that we call “the Enlightenment” that was built on four interrelated principles: reason, science, humanism, and progress. They set in motion revolutions in government, science, and culture that has shaped the world ever since. 2.	The Enlightenment worked. Over the last two and a half centuries, nearly every measure of human flourishing has increased dramatically across the world. People alive today are better educated, healthier, richer, and safer than they have ever been at any time in history. Major diseases have been wiped out by vaccination, extreme poverty has been substantially reduced by global markets, and war and violence have decreased to their lowest levels in world history.3.	Since its beginning, the Enlightenment has had to contend with “counter-Enlightenment” narratives from both the left and the right. Counter-Enlightenment narratives are those that portray the world as getting worse, either because people are falling away from religious belief and values (the conservative counter-narrative), or because capitalism has enervated the world for its own profit and turned 99% of people into labor machines that feed its insatiable greed (the leftist counter-narrative). 4.	The work of the Enlightenment is not finished. There is still poverty, war, and injustice. There are still threats to safety and to the environment. We still have many, many problems to solve. But these problems are best solved by using the tools of the Enlightenment (reason, science, and humanism) rather than by reverting to counter-Enlightenment narratives such as religious fundamentalism or Marxism to address them. As one who is, like Pinker, a liberal but not a leftist, I find myself agreeing with almost everything in this over-arching argument. Sure I have specific quibbles with all kinds of stuff. Pinker is not content to show that most things are a little bit better. He wants to be more comprehensive than that and show that everything is a lot better. And in the process, he often stretches his argument beyond what can be reasonably proved. But even adjusting for some hyperbole, the data he presents is overwhelmingly persuasive—not just that life has gotten better in the world since the 18th century, but that it has improved dramatically in just the last 30 years. During this time, extreme poverty has fallen from 50% of the world to 10%, the number of people killed in wars has fallen by 200%, criminal violence has decreased dramatically, cars are safer, more countries are democratic, and income inequality has decreased in all but the most developed nations. It seems to me that there is no reasonable way to refute the proposition that the world today is more amenable to human flourishing than it has ever been.But there are a whole lot of unreasonable ways to refute this, and this, really, is the most important part of the book. Pinker identifies two key cognitive biases that causes many people to reject the Enlightenment narrative that the world is getting better and embrace one of several counter-Enlightenment narratives that insist that the world is getting worse.The first of these biases is the “availability heuristic.” We have a lot more access to information than we have ever had before, so we see more of the bad stuff than anybody ever has. Our Internet and social media feeds immediately show us acts of racism, police brutality, mass violence, civil strife, and even genocide. We see these with much greater frequency, and when we do, our minds tell us that they are happening with greater frequency, which is generally not the case. But don’t try to tell us that, because we probably won’t believe it.The more troubling factor in our tendency to see a world in decline is the confirmation bias, which simply means that we tend to see what confirms our beliefs and ignore what does not. And we are attracted to narratives of decline because they fit with so many ready-made world views. They are, in fact, an indispensable part of contemporary politics.“We are doing well, but we need to do better” is not a good political message. “We are in decline and need to make America great again” is. And herein lies the fundamental attraction to narratives that cannot be supported by reason or data. We want to believe that things are getting worse, because this is the best way to accomplish political and religious goals. These narratives create fear, and fear motivates us to vote, to donate to politicians, to attend Church, to donate to Churches, and to agitate for change. We can do this through reason and science, of course, but it doesn’t work as well. And this is probably Pinker’s most important point: we are in danger of losing much of the progress that we have made as a nation, and as a world, by rejecting the principles responsible for that progress and embracing narratives that emphasize tribalism, magical thinking, resentment, and unwarranted fear. In the United States, we are rolling back the government regulations that have kept us safe and improved our environment, and we currently have an administration that insists that global relations are a zero-sum game. Globally, people are rejecting the vaccines that wiped out diseases and attacking the advances in food technology that have dramatically reduced hunger and poverty. Countries that once embraced secularism and democracy are starting to turn to religious fundamentalism. We are abandoning things that work in favor of things that won’t. And this is very dangerous. It is possible to argue with almost everything that Pinker says in Enlightenment Now. But those arguments must also adopt Enlightenment principles: showing where his reason fails, providing better evidence, rejecting conclusions that he makes because they are not adequately supported. This kind of debate is necessary and proper.Unfortunately, this is not the debate that we are having. Across the political spectrum, the Enlightenment ideals that Pinker champions are being refuted from fundamentally illiberal and unenlightened positions with a strong interest in making the world seem like a fetid hell hole that is only a moment away from the apocalypse. These arguments are dangerous because they appeal to the kind of thinking that caused most of our problems in the first place."
110,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,5,"There is no one alive who writes with the mind-sweeping clarity and breadth of knowledge that Steven Pinker possesses. Though there are other works of his that are perhaps more revolutionary (The Blank Slate) or ambitious in their singular explanatory power (How the Mind Works), it is this latest volume of his that is his most timely and all-encompassing cerebral broom.If the idea of needing to defend Enlightenment values is mysterious to you at this point then I can only pity you your global-scale ignorance or apathy. In Pinker, that cause of defense has found its most able champion. Offering an incredible array of 75 statistical graphs that are properly contextualized and interpreted, he has produced such an incredibly coherent and well-argued line of thinking that has enough independent and objective fact to annoy partisans of both sides of the political/philosophical spectrum. Much of the work seems to follow-up on several of the arguments brought forth in his previous volume, ""The Better Angels of Our Nature."" Following a deft summary as to what Enlightenment ideals and practices are, Pinker proceeds to show just how they have benefited society and the world as a whole ever since, where they have come up short, and recommends several new usages of these ideas for future mutual benefit. Along the way he casts off so many misconceptions and anecdotal ""arguments"" against the Enlightenment, something long overdue in writings by contemporary intellectuals who - alarmingly and genuinely stupidly - have distanced themselves from these values. This is not done with flippant casuistry or mere rhetorical prolepsis but with relentless data and cogent, in-depth examination. Some telling and amusing samples from the work include:""If you extol reason, then what matters is the integrity of the thoughts, not the personalities of the thinkers.""""While a vision of world peace may have given John and Yoko some good songs, it is hopelessly naïve in the real world.""""However long it takes, we must not let the existence of cognitive and emotional biases or the spasms of irrationality in the political arena discourage us from the Enlightenment ideal of relentlessly pursuing reason and truth.""This is the book of the year, no question. No one has this diverse array of knowledge, no one marshals their facts better, and no one does so with the ease of language that Dr. Pinker presents across a work of 500+ pages. In closing I will let him sum up one of the major points of this monumental achievement: ""Remember your math: an anecdote is not a trend. Remember your history: the fact that something is bad today doesn't mean it was better in the past. Remember your philosophy: one cannot reason that there's no such thing as reason, or that something is true or good because God said it is.

111,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58890815-andrii-zakharov,5,"There are a lot of bad reviews of Steven Pinker's new book out there, mostly arguing against some of his particular points taken out of context, putting words in his mouth, falsely attributing some agenda to him, or simply twisting his words. But reading the book attentively, one can't help but notice how much thought went into Pinker's formulations, and how careful he is with what he is saying and showing. The one detailed review I can recommend which appreciates the precision and is not politically loaded is Scott Aaronson's: https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p....Here, I will only give my brief impression. First, I must admit that I found some chapters in the book stronger than others. This is to be expected of a work that attempts to cover the whole span of the human condition across history, and do so in an exclusively data-driven, empirical way. For some developments, there is just not enough good data available, and so some of the conjectures and estimates will necessarily be better supported than others. That said, taken as a whole, Enlightenment Now is an exceptional piece of popular scholarship, providing a most enjoyable review of all the relevant aspects of human life. Page after page, figure after figure, relentlessly hammering home the crucial point way too many of us are unaware of: the world and our lives in it are continually getting better, along almost every conceivable dimension. One could argue at length about the data in each and every chapter. One could rightly point out that some of it is one-sided, that his historical accounts are incomplete and some of the conclusions premature. But the sheer weight of evidence makes it impossible to deny the central points:* life has been, and is, getting better for ever more people in ever more places* it is happening as we create new knowledge and use it to gradually solve problems* problems are inevitable, new ones will always arise, but problems are also solvable, given the right knowledge* the best system we have to create new knowledge is science* continuing to gradually improve our institutions will continue to bring incremental progress* we are facing many dangers, some of them existential, which call for unprecedented global cooperation and knowledge production to overcome* the ideas outlined above are, sadly, time and again attacked by hostile ideologies from all sides of the political spectrum, and have to be defended if we are to continue our progress.These points were made very persuasively in the course of the book, and appear to me of paramount importance. Reading Enlightenment Now significantly shifted my worldview towards conditional future optimism, motivating to work very hard to sustain our amazing progress so far."
112,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"Pinker builds on his previous book The Better Angels of Our Nature to make a strong case for enlightenment values.His writing is excellent and always an absolute joy to read.He puts apparent contemporary reversals of progress in perspective. He defends humanism. He pulls no punches discussing religion. He weighs in on economics as key to those Better Angels. He wipes the floor with Friedrich Nietzsche and his intellectual heritage in fascism, Nazism, etc. He backs up everything with scientific evidence. Even if sometimes the interpretation comes off a bit forced, he's still working on solid ground throughout the book."
113,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,5,"Steven Pinker was one of the first writers to kindle my passion for scientific thinking. When I read 
The Blank Slate
 in 2011, it exposed me to a host of intellectual disciplines that my undergraduate training in philosophy had neglected––most notably evolutionary psychology, skepticism, and the empirical foundations of human nature. Nearly a decade later, I am thrilled not only to have another opportunity to journey through Pinker’s impressive mind, but also that his chosen message is rooted in data-driven, responsible optimism. Given the psychological and political difficulties of 2017, I was on the verge of thinking that such optimism was nothing more than shrugging in the face of inevitable doom. But Enlightenment Now turned my frown upside down, made me feel good about being human again, and restored much of my belief that humanity still has a bright future (or many possible bright futures) ahead.If I could rename this book without worrying about marketing, my chosen title would be: Everybody Calm the Fuck Down: The Case for Sanity, by Steven Pinker. At a moment in global and American history when many citizens feel like the sky is continually falling, Enlightenment Now provides a hard-nosed critique of our tendency to indulge our inner Chicken Littles. Instead of taking the in vogue route of mining for new reasons why human civilization is inherently dishonorable and teetering on the brink of destruction, Pinker argues the exact opposite. To make his case, Pinker demonstrates that the Enlightenment, the great intellectual movement that precipitated the rise of modernity, has been a rollicking success:""This book is my attempt to restate the ideals of the Enlightenment in the language and concepts of the 21st century. I will first lay out a framework for understanding the human condition informed by modern science––who we are, where we came from, what our challenges are, and how we can meet them. The bulk of the book is devoted to defending those ideals in a distinctively 21st-century way: with data. This evidence-based take on the Enlightenment project reveals that it was not a naïve hope. The Enlightenment has worked––perhaps the greatest story seldom told. And because this triumph is so unsung, the underlying ideals of reason, science, and humanism are unappreciated as well. Far from being an insipid consensus, these ideals are treated by today’s intellectuals with indifference, skepticism, and sometimes contempt. When properly appreciated, I will suggest, the ideals of the Enlightenment are in fact stirring, inspiring, noble––a reason to live."" (5-6, emphasis his)This passage reveals both the considerable strengths and non-negligible weaknesses of Pinker’s position. Since I agree with Pinker’s outlook and think this book represents a hugely valuable contribution to the modern moment, I’ll deal with the chinks in his armor first and follow with praise. First, Pinker’s characterization of the Enlightenment’s success as “the greatest story seldom told” is an overstatement. I’d like to say it’s an overstatement that isn’t repeated in the rest of the text, but that wouldn’t be an honest appraisal. It’s my feeling that the Enlightenment-rejecting “intellectuals” in Pinker’s crosshairs––frustrating and myopic as they may be––do not represent a majority opinion in America or anywhere else. In fact, as Pinker points out, they do not even represent a majority of intellectuals:""During the 20th century, the landscape of human knowledge was carved into professionalized duchies, and the growth of science (particularly the sciences of human nature) is often seen as an encroachment on territories that had been staked and enclosed by the academic humanities. It’s not that practitioners of the humanities themselves have this zero-sum mindset. Most artists show no signs of it…Nor is the anxiety expressed by the scholars who delve into the historical epochs, genres of art, systems of ideas, and other subject matter in the humanities, since a true scholar is receptive to ideas regardless of their origin. The defensive pugnacity belongs to a culture: Snow’s Second Culture of literary intellectuals, cultural critics, and erudite essayists."" (389-90, emphasis his)This Second Culture is Pinker’s true enemy, and while he does a good job of calling them out directly in the latter chapters, some of his earlier assertions belie the genuine nuances that bolster the rest of the text. For example, the opening sentences of a chapter called “Progressophobia” read thus: “Intellectuals hate progress. Intellectuals who call themselves progressive really hate progress” (39, emphasis his). Such sweeping statements needlessly open a path for critics to characterize Pinker as nothing more than a Panglossian apologist for modernity; sadly, this path will be well-trodden given how Pinker has been villainized by the Second Culture and its acolytes (this review  is a good example). Here we find the downside of Pinker’s iconoclastic nature, which is not only the source of his intellectual vitality and undeniable wit, but also his most significant vulnerability.My other worry about this book is that, despite Pinker’s repeated claims that the Enlightenment’s success is not a justification for complacency in the face of extant problems, it may nevertheless end up playing that role in cultural and political discussions, as well as in the hearts and minds of readers. Over and over, Enlightenment Now caused me to take a deep breath and remind myself that things aren’t so bad, which is terrific for my personal health and state of mind, but probably not the best way to get me into the proverbial trenches solving humanity’s most difficult challenges. Of course, one of Pinker’s central claims is that the best way to fight those battles is to eschew unnecessary excitation in favor of calm calculation and reasoned negotiation. But I still worry that readers like myself––privileged first-worlders for whom modernity is working just fine––may utilize this perspective to thicken our own socioeconomic and ideological bubbles instead of heeding Pinker’s call to action. The lesson here is that Enlightenment Now represents just one important perspective amongst others, and should not be treated as a comprehensive guide to the world’s present state. In other words, it’s like any other intellectual endeavor.Okay, now for the fun stuff! As ever, Pinker has crafted a book that is engaging, cleanly written, and packed with dense and fascinating thoughts. Since this is a book about progress, we should start with Pinker’s chosen definition:""What is progress? You might think that the question is so subjective and culturally relative as to be forever unanswerable. In fact, it’s one of the easier questions to answer. Most people agree that life is better than death. Abundance is better than poverty. Peace is better than war. Safety is better than danger. Freedom is better than tyranny. Equal rights are better than bigotry and discrimination. Literacy is better than illiteracy. Knowledge is better than ignorance. Intelligence is better than dull-wittedness. Happiness is better than misery. Opportunities to enjoy family, friends, culture, and nature are better than drudgery and monotony. All these things can be measured. If they have increased over time, that is progress."" (51)Pinker is not posturing when he claims that these indicators of progress can be measured. His commitment to empiricism runs much deeper than that of most public intellectuals, as evidenced by the 70+ graphs/charts and 100 pages of notes/references that accompany his superb argumentation. While he is well aware that data generation is a flawed human process (404), the raw power of evidentiary convergence becomes increasingly undeniable as Pinker’s explication of progress unfolds over about 300 pages.In my view, Pinker’s most important insight about progress is this: “It’s in the nature of progress that it erases its tracks, and its champions fixate on the remaining injustices and forget how far we have come” (215). This dynamic can make progress very difficult to identify and acknowledge, since even a world that is improving will always create new obstacles during the process of rendering old ones obsolete: “Progress cannot be monotonic because solutions to problems always create new problems. But progress can resume when the new problems are solved in their turn” (44). While it may seem simplistic to some readers, I think Pinker’s characterization of the world’s difficulties as mere problems to be solved is a critical and often-elided truth that we need to rediscover. In a cultural milieu where doubling down on embattled ideological positions and demonizing one’s opponents is routine, it becomes heroic to refocus one’s attention and energy on discovering the empirical nature of a problem and following the road to solutions wherever it may lead.Of the seventeen topics Pinker addresses in his discussion of progress, the one that most pleased me was his chapter on the environment. This is a topic that many big thinkers still neglect, even though climate change is perhaps the most ominous long-term threat to the continuance of human progress. Pinker takes up the climate problem with distinctive poise, showing how sentimental, anti-industrial positions on the political left and denialist positions on the right have both failed to provide a viable platform for global climate action. He advocates for “Ecomodernism,” a nascent field of study founded on three tenets: (1) some degree of pollution is unavoidable due to the entropic nature of the universe, (2) industrialization has generally been good for humanity, and (3) technology is the primary tool we should use to mitigate environmental damage without relinquishing the myriad benefits of modern life (123-4).While Second Culturists will surely write Pinker off as an obsequious technocrat beguiled by the corrupt comforts of elite capitalist culture, a sober assessment of Ecomodernism reveals it as the most reasonable and realizable approach for dealing with climate change. Pinker advocates for a combination of solutions, including decarbonization, alternative energies, dematerialization, and nuclear power––no silver bullets here. His recommendations, especially on the nuclear issue, pay no heed to the entrenched ideological positions of climate warriors or denialists, but rather follow the evidence wherever it leads. Climate change is serious and daunting, but panicking and using it as an excuse to upend the economic and institutional foundations of progress is foolish. This message is starkest in Pinker’s takedown of Naomi Klein’s position that the only way to address climate change is to raze contemporary capitalism and rebuild it with a much heavier emphasis on centrally-planned economies. His critique was especially salutary for me, given that I was completely seduced by Klein’s point of view when I read This Changes Everything back in 2014. I love an opportunity to update my opinions and reflect on the informational and perspectival limitations of my past selves.Instead of succumbing to the idea that humanity must repent for the great sin of modernity, Pinker instead demonstrates that we can approach this daunting challenge with a rational maturity:""It’s time to retire the morality play in which modern humans are a vile race of despoilers and plunderers who will hasten the apocalypse unless they undo the Industrial Revolution, renounce technology, and return to an ascetic harmony with nature. Instead, we can treat environmental protection as a problem to be solved: how can people live safe, comfortable, and stimulating lives with the least possible pollution and loss of natural habitats?"" (134)As it has always been, the solution is to press forward using the human wellsprings of creativity and innovation; it does no good to nostalgically pine for previous eras when life for average folks and even most elites was much worse than today.Also laudable is Pinker’s defense of rationality, which is endangered by political partisanship and religious/magical thinking. Pinker’s rejection of political partisanship, which he likens to sports fandom, is particularly valuable (359-60). He lays out a battery of research showing how ideologues bend over backwards to deny their opponents the benefit of the doubt, then ties it off with a much-needed reminder that progress is not owned by any individual or group, but is rather the collective result of countless actions and shifts over time that can come from even the most unlikely places:""It should not be surprising that the facts of human progress confound the major -isms. The ideologies are more than two centuries old and are based on mile-high visions such as whether humans are tragically flawed or infinitely malleable, and whether society is an organic whole or a collection of individuals. A real society comprises hundreds of millions of social beings, each with a trillion-synapse brain, who pursue their well-being while affecting the well-being of others in complex networks with massive positive and negative externalities, many of them historically unprecedented. It is bound to defy any simple narrative of what will happen under a given set of rules. A more rational approach is to treat societies as ongoing experiments and open-mindedly learn the best practices, whichever part of the spectrum they come from."" (365)All of us are inescapably embedded in Pinker’s “real society,” and our ability to intelligently acknowledge and navigate this messy reality can stave off madness and keep progress coming.Enlightenment Now closes with Pinker’s celebration of humanism––a strong message that rehabilitated my humanist loyalties, which took a hit when I read Yuval Noah Harari’s 
Homo Deus
 last year. I still wonder how humanism will stay relevant as we evolve into new transhuman and posthuman forms, but I’ve no doubt that Pinker’s perspective is the right one for the here and now:""The first step toward wisdom is the realization that the laws of the universe don’t care about you. The next is the realization that this does not imply that life is meaningless, because people care about you, and vice versa. You care about yourself, and you have a responsibility to respect the laws of the universe that keep you alive, so don’t squander your existence. Your loved ones care about you, and you have a responsibility not to orphan your children, widow your spouse, and shatter your parents. And anyone with a humanistic sensibility cares about you, not in the sense of feeling your pain––human empathy is too feeble to spread itself across billions of strangers––but in the sense of realizing that your existence is cosmically no less important than theirs, and that we all have a responsibility to use the laws of the universe to enhance the conditions in which we all can flourish.""

116,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3055905-nils,1,"Dr Pangloss lives! I’m unconvinced that the various Enlightenments (there actually were several distinct Enlightenments, though Pinker seems unaware of this), much as I love them, can really be credited for the huge increase in human material well-being that has taken place over the last couple of centuries. This turns out not to be a trivial critique, since Pinker’s argument that the Enlightenment is what “caused” the material improvement drives his conclusion that the main threat to sustaining that improvement comes from those who he alleges are undermining the Enlightenment, e.g. the so-called postmodernists. This in turn leads to Pinker’s bizarre suggestion that the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche represent a greater threat to our sustained material well-being than, say, Exxon-Mobil and the Koch brothers. Judge for yourself whether you find that plausible.In fact, the real underpinning the material gains of the last two centuries have been more institutional than ideational. This in turn implies that we must scrutinize the solidity of our institutional matrix if we want a real purchase of the sustainability of these gains. First, there have been numerous civilizations achieving marked improvement in the welfare and well-being of their populations – at least their upper classes. The Maya, the Romans, and several dynastic episodes of the Chinese achieved such gains. Of course, the gains that industrial modernity has achieved over the last quarter millennium outstrips all previous improvements. But taking the longer view, the gains of modernity are perhaps less impressive than they seem. Almost all those gains have taken place in the last quarter millennium, and 250 years, after all, isn’t that long of a run for a civilization. Other historical civilizations have sustained their gains for much longer. The Roman Empire’s eastern branch basked in cultural glory for a thousand years. And even though it’s usually meant pejoratively, it’s no coincidence that the word “byzantine” is a synonym for institutional complexity.Second, there are reasons to suspect that modernity’s run of material amelioration may be drawing to a close—and may even go into reverse. Broadly speaking these reasons can be divided in two. The first concern biophysical limits to growth. These are enduring arguments that the Breakthrough Institute has done much to illuminate and clarify, so suffice to say that, as a long term proposition, Malthus hasn’t yet been proven wrong, and climate change presents challenges of unprecedented scale that will only be addressed if there is sufficient collective political will to overcome collective action and free riding challenges. It’s at best unclear whether we have the global social capital to do so. Put another way: we live in an era of wicked problems.My own skepticism about whether humanity can overcome these challenges brings me to my fundamental critique of Pinker’s optimism: not only the sustainability of the gains of the last quarter millennium, but also the extensibility of these to larger sections of humanity, as well as the ability to address the growing headwinds posed by anthropogenic climate change depend crucially on a massive strengthening of our global institutional and governance infrastructure. From this perspective, all the indicators are sharply negative over the last fifty and especially the last ten years.For nearly fifty years, Gallup has run a series of polls asking Americans about their confidence in various institutions – universities, the media, business, political institutions, and so forth. While the data are noisy, the overall trendline is inexorably downwards. The decline in confidence is partly the result of sustained anti-institutional propaganda, which exists in both leftwing and rightwing versions. But as I have argued elsewhere, I believe the root cause of this declining trust is the objectively poor institutional performance and a lack of elite accountability. A general feature of late modernity is a declining faith in social authority of all sorts, as ever more individuated and autonomous polities become ever less willing to entrust political agents to do anything. The advent of Donald Trump is merely a symptom of both the failure and the rejection of institutions in the United States.Nor is this just an American phenomenon. The rise of populism across Europe likewise reflects distrust of institutions. The Brexit vote two years ago of course represented a direct rebuke to transnational institutions. More recently, the triumph in the Italian elections of the Five Start Movement, whose calling card was a rejection of political party infrastructure, signaled nothing if not a rejection of institutions. (It remains unclear whether the Movement can manage even a small city, let alone Italy as a whole.)With the United States in the grip of Trumpism and the European Union caught between shambolic national politics and collective dissolution, the primary hope for global leadership seems to be falling by default to the Chinese. Some people have argued that China is filling the institutional gap left by a receding Europe and the United States. Eric X. Li, for example, recently argued that Xi Jinping’s merging of Chinese state and party infrastructure makes sense given that “the party has developed into the most competent national political institution in the world today.” What this bold claim tacitly conceded is that, despite the huge successes the Chinese state has had in poverty reduction over the last 40 years, China’s existing institutions are inadequate to managing the bumpy course corrections that lie ahead if it is to sustain its gains.Even more worrying than the declining performance of global and national political institutions are the faltering institutional underpinnings of sustained technological innovation – innovation which everyone, optimists and pessimists alike, agrees is essential to any adequate plan for addressing the challenges posed by climate change. As Mariana Mazzucato has shown, state support for innovation and entrepreneurship has in fact been at the root of almost all major technological breakthroughs of the last 75 years. Specifically, much of this support has taken place through trillions of dollars of state funding for research universities. But universities today are under unprecedented assault. Variously accused of being hotbeds of leftist indoctrination, engines of neoliberal reproduction, or simply wastes of money, no one trusts universities anymore. (This is the real place where the “postmodernists” have something to answer for: they have both been a primary vector of critique of universities, in effect sawing at the branch they sit on, while at the same time provoking hysteria about the supposed insanity of the humanities, of which Pinker’s book is a characteristic example.) While it seems inconceivable that the United States in particular would flush away the linchpin of its technological, industrial, and soft power success, the cultural assault on universities today is unparalleled. Non-coincidentally, universities also face a funding crisis of unprecedented proportions, one that is hitting humanities departments first but which the STEM fields are unlikely to escape. All this threatens to cut the legs out from under the innovation engine that is critical to any effort to escape the grim climate reaper."
117,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna,4,"This is nonfiction and it covers a giant host of various topics, including politics, racism, war, etc. For as long as this audiobook was, I was never bored. The author moved effortlessly and quickly from topic to topic to topic. That style worked here. So the 4 stars is for the entertainment value that I was able to place on this. Now with all that said, it usually bothers me when the author slants all the info to fit his views and then completely glosses over other things that might deflate his defense. While this author did that (abundantly), I didn't find it offensive or annoying. He had some well placed humor to soften that reaction. "
118,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68472482-daniel,5,"This is the best book I have ever read which is something I’m not saying lightly. It makes you so optimistic about the state of human progress and it makes you truly appreciate how much progress we have made over the past couple of centuries. It is really mind-blowing. If you weren’t already, it will also make you very optimistic about the likeliness of this progress continuing in the future with the help of, among other things, technology and today’s widely available information resources.Pinker goes through a wide range of subjects from Life expectancy, Peace and Safety to Equal rights, Knowledge, Quality of life and Happiness. He backs it up with rigorous research and clearly shows how almost every relevant parameter is going in the right direction. The only two areas that as of now haven't shown clear-as-day improvements over time are Terrorism and Global warming. (Another area, which Pinker didn’t include in the book, that could be considered a blip in the otherwise steady drumbeat of progress, are the recent reports of increasing death rates among middle-aged Americans over the past decade.) Focusing on the bigger picture analysis that Pinker provides all throughout the book rather than the daily news and shorter-term trends, you get the true picture of how well humanity is doing.One fascinating example of this is what Pinker calls the consumer surplus. Think about the washing machine. It saves us 10h per week compared to 1920 and costs a few hundred dollars. Now, if you think about how much someone would have to pay you for you to give up your washing machine, the number is clearly not in the hundreds of dollars anymore. Many people in developed nations would say that there is no price that would make them give it up. So not only are we richer but many of the utilities (and other things) that we use everyday can be bought for almost nothing compared to their actual value to us. This wasn't true 50 and 100 years ago. Another example is that today the average American worker retires at 62. Hundred years ago the average American worker died at 51.Pinker thinks (and I agree) that the media is responsible for a large part of today’s unfounded, but in many parts of the Western world, prevailing pessimism. As he puts it “When voters are inches away from the news, optimism can seem naive.” He points out that if newspapers would have elected to report more good news, they could have run the headline ""Number of people in extreme poverty fell by 137,000 since yesterday"" every day for the past 25 years.The book is structured in such a way that you can easily read only one chapter that you find interesting and skip the rest. There is for example a very good chapter on the environment and climate change if you want to read up on that. I do think Pinker misses some of the big potential risks in his discussion on AI, for example advanced AI systems in the wrong hands. And I think you can safely skim through the final three chapters without missing too much of an otherwise wonderful book.As a side note, the reason I decided to read this book was Bill Gates' glowing review of it some time ago. As you can see, I wasn’t disappointed. In his review, Bill said that he read the book very slowly because he loved it so much, but that he thought “most people will find it a quick and accessible read.” Perhaps he wrote the review in the ensuing euphoria after having just finished the book because I can assure you of one thing: this book is a lot of things, an easy read for most people it is not (it’s all relative I guess). But it is enormously fun reading and often highly enlightening so it's well worth your time. A big thank you to Pinker for putting things in the right perspective and allowing readers to see the bigger picture so clearly."
119,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21797839-rafael,5,"Ok, it took me a while to finish this one not because something is wrong with it but because the amount of facts and info it has on it, its a beautiful tesis on the world today facts about economy, politics, religion and social behavior, humanism is the sole purpose of this book and explains it with brilliant research, this a not an easy book but is a wonderful explanation on how science works and how research and enlightenment could and is guiding our future, we still a long way to go but if we keep preaching facts, science and critical thinking then out future will be bright, people just has to let go of religion and superstition, get educated, preach science, i really loved this book but is not an easy read, i'd say is must read for everyone."
120,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"In many ways, reading this book was similar to reading Pinker's book ""Better Angels of our Nature."" The theory of the book was straight-forward, the evidence was well-organized, and the insights from the data were presented clearly. The first drawback to reading this book is that it covers a lot of the same ground as ""Better Angels of our Nature."" The second drawback to this book is that...well, even if the conclusions of this book aren't common sense, to people who are roughly familiar with enlightenment ideals and are fairly well-read on current affairs, it sort of is common sense. That's a nice way of saying that there are few ideas in this book that will leave you awe-struck. That's not to see that Pinker isn't capable of writing such a book. I found ""The Blank Slate"" to be just such a book. That book remains one of my favorite books to this day. That is also the book I point to when I want to convince people what a great thinker Pinker is. Pinker's argument is straightforward and comes in the preface: ""I will present a different understanding of the world, grounded in fact and inspired by the ideals of the Enlightenment: reason, science, humanism, and progress. Enlightenment ideals, I hope to show, are timeless, but they have never been more relevant than they are right now."" (page 12). If Enlightenment ideas are timeless, then why do they need a defense? Pinker's answer: ""The ideals of the Enlightenment are products of human reason, but they always struggle with other strands of human nature: loyalty to tribe, deference to authority, magical thinking, the blaming of misfortune on evildoers"" (page 18). In many ways, ""Enlightenment Now"" is similar to ""Factfullness"" in its use of quantitative data to make the case that life is indeed getting better. Pinker's earlier book ""Better Angels of our Nature"" was also a book that relied heavily on quantitative data. However, by my recollection, that book did a better job of reflecting on how the numbers were arrived at. I think numeracy is an important skill, and too often it is easy to be wowed by numbers without realizing how they are produced and the difficulty of getting reliable numbers in certain contexts -- for example, the distant past and developing countries. My recollection of ""Better Angels"" is a few years removed, but I seem to remember Pinker doing a better job with educating readers on how numbers were arrived at. Having said that, I do think the graphs are presented in a useful and simple way. Often, the data comes in the form of time series line charts. I think the repeated use of these kinds of statistics is great for more casual readers who need to be convinced. Another drawback to this book is that it tends to ignore and short-change the possibility of cataclysmic blowups. The discussion of the disruptive power of AI is discussed briefly, but pales in seriousness to Yuval Harari's analysis in ""21 Lessons for the 21st Century."" The benefits of enlightenment are discussed abundantly, but Frankenstein monsters like mortgage-backed securities are barely mentioned. In addition, one of the most important trends of the 21st century, the explosion of debt is barely discussed. The looming debt crisis (or, I should say crises since we are talking about various kinds of debts, government, municipal, shadow banking, and private) as well as other potential crises with systemic implications -- climate change, the growing use of social media, the introduction of disruptive technologies -- are under-discussed in this book. And because these systemic crises are under-discussed, Pinker fails to deal with the mother of all questions about modernity. Does modernity increase the risk of catastrophic blow-ups? Since nuclear war, climate change, and contagious financial panics are the product in one way or another of modernity, science, and globalization, is there a likelihood that more potentially catastrophic phenomena could be birthed from them? And, if so, what can we do to prevent potential catastrophic blow-ups from occurring? Another way to think about the question is this way: In what ways is modern progress like a financial bubble? For me, a high point of the book was its discussion of tribal epistemology. I have read short articles on tribal thinking, but the review of the literature here was excellent. And for those who are searching for literature that discusses this topic, the book can make for an effective gateway. This was written in the Guardian about this book: ""More pertinently, the failed 2016 campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Remain demonstrated that, in the eyes of many people, “progress” simply meant more of the same. When people feel trapped and patronised by progress, then any alternative – even regress – will feel like freedom. Informing them that the policies of the past 40 years are still the best available starts to sound hopeless."" (Full review here: https://www.theguardian.com/books/201...)Perhaps that's another way of saying that technocratic modernity (complete with its wonky charts) can feel emotionally ungratifying. Instead of gradual improvements and progress by a thousand nudges, there is a part of the soul that yearns for liberation, heroism, and love. People like stories with heroes and villains. Enlightenment often sees the world in terms of mechanical and quasi-mechanical cause and effect relationships. Heroism seems less like heroism when it requires design and system-thinking rather than great sacrifices. Nassim Taleb, another writer whose work I admire, steeps his writing in decidedly non-modern ideas and sentiments -- his thinking perhaps is best described as classical and romantic. I believe anyone who reads this book ought to put it in conversation with some of Taleb's writing (one or two books is enough). I'm sure each of the authors would hate to hear it, but I'll say it anyway -- they are better read together than separately. The unabashed modernist/enlightenment thinker is better with a classical/romantic counterpart and vice versa. I will repeat this: People who are only familiar with Pinker for ""Better Angels"" and ""Enlightenment Now"" ought to read his earlier work ""Blank Slate."" That book, more than his more recent works, demonstrates that he is a true thinker and not simply a chart-jockey or dataphile. Overall, even if you do not need to be convinced of the merit of enlightenment ideas and ideals, this is a wonderful book to read. "
121,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,4,"If you're looking for a cure for the common pessimism, you might do much, much worse than to pick up this book. I've read or seen many other examples of the facts portrayed here, but Steven Pinker does a very admirable job of showing us, exactly, how much better the world is now compared to the one we had even a hundred years ago. It's not just time-saving devices or some outright reversals of ecological damage, but how lifespans, general IQ, overall poverty level, and even WAR has improved for the better for all. Not that war is ever really all that great, mind you, but few nations jump into it with quite as little reason or abandon as they used to.Pinker isn't saying that everything is peachy, of course, but the trend toward real positive progress is undeniable. This is, despite setbacks. And yes, we have many. But for every problem that exists, he makes a very good point that we have it in us to FIX our problems. It's not out of the question.Global Warming, for example, not only has possible temporary and minor fixes available, such as applying a metaphorical sunscreen to the atmosphere, but we have the means to do much more than cut our carbon footprint down to the bone. We have a history of moving on to different methods whenever resources of one type or another run out, too. Health and education are at an all-time high. What we don't have is our optimism. In fact, we have a very solid outlook that things are worse than ever. Terrorists are few in number and never accomplish their stated goals. They merely rouse the combined might of all the powers to quash them. Most of the first world countries have made a point of living by equality in the sexes and the trend is more of the same across the world. LGBT is already accepted on the same scale. Pinker attributes all our actual progress to the Enlightenment. The old standard of 19th-century thinking, where humanism reigns supreme. Look. I freely admit to being a humanist, myself. I LOVE the idea that we all should get along. That every life is valuable. That we should have a high fundamental basis for living for every man, woman, and child alive. It's so pervasive an idea that practically everyone shares it. It's like... OBVIOUS, right? And as far as I know, Steven Pinker is right. But he also makes a very cogent point about the need to be rational, to use science for what it is intended. Inquiry, truth-seeking. No matter what the result, the truth is much more important than any ideology. He uses this to encourage each and every one of us to see past the doomsayers and the demagogs. Again, I totally agree. Skepticism is not the same thing as pessimism. Almost everyone I know is a fundamentally decent person and we all want the same fundamental things.So why didn't I give this book a full five stars?Because he gives all the credit to humanism. Wishing does not make it so. He might be right, but let's face it: this might be what he, himself warned us about. Selection Bias.Even so, I love thinking about it and I totally recommend this book for anyone who is sick and tired of the news and wants someone with a lot of facts and good reasoning to pick them up off the ground, dust their shoulders, and tell them that we are, on the whole, doing pretty damn well for ourselves. You know, despite the actual problems. But then, we DO have it in ourselves to FIX THEM. :)"
122,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51602586-dominika,2,"I did not like this book.I would say that this book was middling for the majority of it. The idea of the book is that progress has already happened, and we shouldn't be as doom and gloom as we are. But for a man who emphasizes the use of data and critical thinking, he doesn't really read said data that well and some of his arguments are riddled with gaping holes. This was a book that was read at our book club (but I was the only person at that book club who read the book in its entirety) and one of the points was that you need to show that progress has been made in order to do more progress. I have mixed feelings: I feel as though that erases the issues that people are actually facing by trying to point out that ""oh but you won't die in the woods from an infection"". While it is nice that countries that were in extreme poverty 50 years ago are being lifted to the middle class, it won't matter to the person who is working 3 jobs at minimum wage so that they can support a family. We have a lot of great innovations in healthcare, but it doesn't matter when a person cannot take an ambulance because it will cost them $600. Some of the progress sections have rather weak arguments as well. The environment one was basically him saying that the system will fix itself (in terms of a capitalist system supporting renewable energy) and that we'll totally invent carbon capture technology. The happiness one also bugged me, because the data is just not consistent. But the section that really got my blood boiling was Science. First off, he tries putting his deregulation mindset against IRBs and says a really fucking insensitive thing about the Tuskegee Syphilis study (But black people worked on it and it's not like they were INFECTING people with Syphilis). And then the rest of it was a STEM circlejerk (Wah, why are these SOCIAL SCIENCES invading my medical research). I work in medical research and am working towards a masters in Epidemiology. We cannot live in our own bubbles, we must learn from different disciplines. Hard sciences bring data-driven analysis to every subject, but social sciences bring the ability to look at the whole picture. Humanities bring the ability to make these things appealing and also to think creatively, to gain inspiration. We need them all, and it's a shame that Pinker doesn't realize that.Oh boy, and I'm not even going to start on the Humanism section and his comments on Islam. Not only does he not see how Western Imperialism could have POSSIBLY encouraged a more patriarchal regime as opposed to just reading religious texts (Look at the south), he also is just full of double standards. Oh, and his arguement against Nietsche is that dictators read him. He doesn't seem to get the Nietsche is all about skepticism. I do really like the chapter on Ideas. While it isn't something that I haven't heard before, I liked the comment on how a lot of politics now isn't even about core fundamental beliefs, but about who's team is winning. The truth is, Pinker and I differ on some core ideologies. Pinker refutes Postmodern philosophy while I am very postmodern. We have some differing opinions on the amount of regulations things should get and whether systems will correct themselves. I understand that. I read Ayn Rand, and I felt as though more of the arguments were at least compelling (if not occassionally bat-shit crazy). I didn't feel the same way about Pinker.All of this isn't helped by how reading this book felt equivelent to eating raw almonds. It was bland, it was dense, Pinker repeated himself and would attempt some flowery tangent while utterly failing. My friend said he tried reading the book during his night shift job and then fell asleep, and then got the audiobook and fell asleep again. I know he's not trying to say that we shouldn't work hard to improve the world, but I don't particularly feel any inspiration from this book, particularly when the vast majority does try to read as a pat on the back in spite of his introduction. I felt like a majority of his arguments were flaccid with the occasionally toxic take, and this book in general was overbloated. "
123,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"In Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, Steven Pinker spends 550+ pages attempting to disavow you of any notion of ""the good ol' days"".And he IS pretty convincing. He's got stats and graphs and lots of evidence to bolster his case that we live in amazing times - that progress and Enlightenment-era ideals have lead to better conditions in almost every measurable sphere. And he's right. He spends some ink and time on why we feel the opposite so often - the world is a hell hole! - pointing towards psychological phenomena like the optimism gap, the availability heuristic, (leaning heavily on Kahneman and Tvorsky's work) and the tendency we all have to remember negative over positive.I didn't read his earlier book about the decline of violence, The Better Angels of our Nature, but this book looks like a more robust version of that one, with a broad focus to include public health, economics, climate change, nuclear weapons, and the timely discussion of authoritarian populism.It's not all roses and puppies, but there are many great things and amazing research that lead to more great things. That's a good thing to remember, and a clarion call to keep going with research and evidence-based activism. All in the name of progress and making things more equal."
124,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11654681-paul,3,"I'm a big fan of Pinker, but I can't say I really enjoyed this book. Impeccably written, as always, but I feel like some of the conclusions he draws from the data he cites are somewhat spurious. "
125,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47417894-laura-noggle,4,"This was an encouraging, uplifting look at many of the successes and bright spots that often get overlooked. However, it's clear things need to be taken with a large grain of salt. I admit, my initial five star rating was more out of the hopefulness associated with the book. Hopefulness that the world isn't really going to hell in a handbasket, and hopeful that the mass generalizations and questionable analysis of facts/statistics had a firm foundation. After reading Nassim Nicholas Taleb's multiple epic burns on Pinker in his book  Skin in the Game: The Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life, I had to reassess my star rating after I stopped laughing. Basically,  Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are, and  But What If We're Wrong? Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past. You can't trust anything or anyone! Fake news! Still, this book provides a sweeping view that is very much appreciated, if not 100% infallible. "

GMOs, fertilizers, and vaccines have and continue to save billions of lives. The global standard of living has never been higher. In virtually every measurable way, life is better for us than it has ever been for any generation of humanity before us. True, Donald Trump is the president of the United States and average global temperatures are increasing. But those problems have solutions. Reason, science, and humanism. Buy this book and take comfort in the life science has afforded us. Let us all recognize how wonderful life is and contribute to humanity’s continued progress."
127,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35-michael-siliski,4,"Recommended for anyone interested in a wake-up call about the progress made over the past few centuries.Enlightenment Now makes the case that the ideals of reason, science, and humanism have driven the greatest advances in the history of human civilization over the past few centuries. The book is divided into three parts: the history of the enlightenment, the progress we’ve made, and the enlightenment ideals that must be defended going forward. However, the meat of the book, and Pinker’s passion, is clearly the middle section, which is a thorough and data-based walk through fifteen areas where human lives are almost indistinguishably improved from just 10 generations ago, including health, peace, freedom, inequality, the environment, and happiness. Pinker’s enemies are “progressophobes” on both the right (the anti-science forces, the Trumpian politics of grievance) and left (New York Times-style liberal handwringing and catastrophizing). Both sides are prone to populism and a desire to return to an imagined utopian past. Pinker is successful in his main goal of thoroughly debunking that such a past ever existed.Enlightenment Now has a lot in common with Hans Rosling’s Factfulness, which I wrote about recently. Pinker is quite a bit longer and goes much deeper, so if you’re the type to ask for the data backing each claim, this might be the better book for you. I also thought Pinker was much more successful in grounding his celebration of human progress in a memorable framework.Both books suffer from a relentless optimism that can feel a bit strident at times. For Pinker, I thought this was most evident in his discussions of inequality and happiness, both of which felt a bit blithe to me. I think there is good reason to reject the most pessimistic takes on these: that more wealth doesn’t make people any happier or even that people are less happy these days, that inequality within a society is far more important than absolute means. Pinker does a good job making the case that inequality is not equivalent to poverty, and that “in some ways the world has become less equal, but in more ways the world’s people have become better off.” He makes a compelling argument that happiness is directly related to wealth, in particular using Stevenson & Wolfers studies. But these are not the same as proving “the irrelevance of inequality to happiness” or demonstrating that individual happiness is primarily driven by wealth. I thought these sections would be stronger if they didn’t reach quite so far.I agree with Pinker that reason, science, and humanism are critically important to human well-being globally, and these days it does feel a defense of them is needed. While I doubt that many who disagree with the thesis would even pick this book up, Pinker does make a similar point to Rosling that many of the most well-educated, including academics, are unaware of how much progress actually has been made through Enlightenment ideals. So perhaps there is hope that books like this could have a positive influence.From: https://medium.com/@msiliski/enlighte..."
128,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13941368-bakunin,4,"I usually wait a while to write a review of a book in order to digest all the important aspects of the work and this is certainly true in this case as well. Being somewhat of a libertarian with conservative leanings I found this book to be both illuminating as well as challenging. This book is Pinkers best attempt to defend the enlightenment; that is to say humanism, science and reason. He goes through many aspects quantitatively to prove his point - health, inequality, evironment, peace, safety, equal rights, quality of life etc - and all these things seem to be going in the right direction. Countries which are more democratic and more liberal are happier. This is essentially a more scientific defense of what Popper called ""the open society"". Although I find it refreshing to read a somewhat optimistic book in the midst of all the usual gloom one encounters in the daily press, I find myself in disagreement with Pinker. I agree with Pinker in that we are living the best possible time but what bothers me is the fact that I believe that the welfare state won't be able to sustain this growth (or progress if you will). Although Pinker has a certain classical liberal leaning, he is not very worried about the implications of an ever expanding welfare state: the destruction of the family, mass immigration, and the infantilization of citizens in the west. His liberal predilection is also shown by his apparent scorn of Trump and 'populism'. I suppose that this is where the rubber meets the road - I believe that communities are necessary and that the individual is not a tabula rasa. I also strongly reject the notion of an enlightened elite telling people how to better live their lives. While my values often may coincide with Pinkers, I believe in a slow and organic change in society, rather than a forced political one. Pinker by contrast scorns tribalist behavior and finds this to be reactionary; a force to be fought with a scientific mind. Although I have a certain buddhist leaning myself, I am slowly becoming more convinced of the need to be a person in modern society and the need therefore to retain certain elements of tribalism. Where to draw this line is however unclear. "
129,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75777506-tom-zacharski,2,"I picked ""Enlightenment Now"" after Bill Gates's recommendation. It's not every day that you hear someone like Gates recommend their favorite book of all time. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed. The premise of the book is that, as humanity, we are much better off nowadays than ever before in history. Pinker draws on many statistics, graphs, and facts to show that is indeed the reality. While I love that premise and couldn't agree more (we need more of those reminders in the age of 24h media) I found the language and general style a bit hard to read and unpleasant to a reader - it read a bit too much like a textbook and too often felt like going through well researched and academic in nature Powerpoint slides. The book could have easily been three times shorter and would drive the points home more effectively. Nonetheless, the points are important and if you've never read anything about how far we have come as humanity I do recommend the book. I recently saw ""The Final Year"" - a documentary about Barafh Obama's last year in office and how his foreign policy team operated during the time of a divisive, and later shocking, election. At one point Obama says that history does not follow a straight line, rather it zigs and zags, there's ups and downs, but it's our job to make sure the trend continues upward. And that trend is what the ""Enlightenment Now"" is all about."

Pinker was named one of Time Magazine’s 100 most influential people in the world in 2004 and his books are regularly featured in the best-selling lists. While the purpose of this book is commendable – to show with extensive use of data that we are living in the best of times – two reasons made me cringe while reading it. Firstly, the author completely misses the mark on the topic I have dedicated part of my professional life for the past 10+ years: climate change.

132,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"I listened to this as an audiobook & it was good, but he has a lot of graphs so quick reference to the PDF is a big plus. There are also sections where it's nice to reread his thoughts, although most are straightforward enough that it's not necessary. His writing is clean & uncluttered. It follows a logical progression.There are 3 sections:1) Enlightenment2) Progress3) Reason, Science, & HumanismThe first two sections are great. I've read about the Age of Ignorance, its history, & its benefits before, but his is one of the best as he proves the benefit of the scientific method to mankind through some very telling statistics. I loved the section on how much wealth we now have comparatively. I've read comparisons about the cost of an hour of light, but it always impresses me. He shows how much less violence, starvation, & disease there is. So why do we think the world is in such danger? He thinks it's due mostly to brain bugs & loud extremists both on the left & right.The last section ""Reason, Science, & Humanism"" was preaching to the choir. It was long & boring at times. There was a lot of good information in it & while I agreed with him in general, he went over the top or underplayed several things. For instance, he seems to consider an existential threat as serious only if they'll kill off most people. He fails to mention how horrific a tragedy which abruptly killed 1% of our population would be (1% of 7 billion is 700 million!) or what the loss of an entire city could do to our society. IIRC, some have said it could take as little as losing 10% of the population to bring down our civilization since it is incredibly interconnected. Something like a nationwide outage of electric could be catastrophic even if it lasted a fairly short time. Cities only have a few days worth of food & places like LA rely on a lot of infrastructure. Millions are living in a desert, an area where the first settlement didn't make it.His thoughts on nuclear bombs were very simplistic & incomplete. Hindsight of what the Kremlin would have actually done during the Cold War based on records we're now reading is armchair quarterbacking at its worst. He also didn't get into the options of nuclear bombs like tactical nukes. I remember some talking heads discussing how great the tactical nuke option was going to be at one point. It was insane! Apparently he doesn't believe how close we were to annihilation.Worse, he dismissed the effect of the atomic bombs we did drop saying that the Japanese surrendered because the Russians were entering their area of the war. That's ridiculously simplistic, just one of many factors & I don't believe it was the deciding one. The Japanese were out of everything & the Allies were pushing them back in force. Kamikazes weren't their first choice as weapons, but born of desperation. In March, Tokyo was bombed by something like 300 planes - nothing like Dolittle's desperate raid of a few years before. It was a huge force with horrific results, but it was also understandable & they knew we couldn't afford it too often. In August, one plane dropped one bomb that was about as bad. A few days later, we repeated the trick. They didn't know the cost or how many more we had. How can anyone dismiss that?It's crazy hard to get fissionable materials, but they aren't the only nuclear threat. It's a lot easier to get radioactive waste & spread it around with conventional explosives. It doesn't take a genius & if it or a biological/chemical agent is put in the right place, someplace upwind. It could be devastating. Not an end of the world catastrophe, but up there with the Twin Towers. I don't think it's particularly likely, but everyone thought Clancy's novel, Debt of Honor (1994) was just unlikely fiction, too. If you haven't read it, a guy crashes a jet into Congress & pretty much wipes them all out. This was 7 years before 9/11, but airline security didn't change so his dismissive attitude towards terrorists seems a bit over done. Still, I generally agreed with him. We can be too anxious. Current airline security is a good example, but there are a lot of smart people trying to keep us safe. We're walking a tightrope between safety & losing our freedoms. Our anxiety only makes the latter more likely, so I'm glad of his perspective.Overall, it's a good book. If you're super religious or a big Trump supporter, you'll probably dislike the last section especially. Pinker beats on both sides of the aisle, but the anti-humanist & anti-science of the current administration is in front of us now, so he gives a lot of good reasons for his negative opinions.Highly recommended in any format, but do get the PDF with the audiobook. Very well narrated."

What is progress? You might think that the question is so subjective and culturally relative as to be forever unanswerable. In fact, it’s one of the easier questions to answer. Most people agree that life is better than death. Health is better than sickness. Sustenance is better than hunger. Abundance is better than poverty. Peace is better than war. Safety is better than danger. Freedom is better than tyranny. Equal rights are better than bigotry and discrimination. Literacy is better than illiteracy. Knowledge is better than ignorance. Intelligence is better than dull-wittedness. Happiness is better than misery. Opportunities to enjoy family, friends, culture, and nature are better than drudgery and monotony. All these things can be measured. If they have increased over time, that is progress. 
The subtitle of Enlightenment Now is: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, and as someone who has benefitted from all of these – in all of the ways enumerated in the opening quote – I don't know to what extent I needed the “case to be made” for these values. The difficulty I had is that while author Steven Pinker does define and defend each of these principles throughout the book, he is actually attempting to make the case for optimism – as though the entire world today has progressed in the direction of betterment (to greater or lesser degrees), as a direct result of Enlightenment thinkers, and as there isn't any problem facing us that can't be solved by doubling down on Enlightenment thinking and the advancement of science and technology, anyone who tends to pessimism (whether over the environment, existential angst, or the rise of populism and despotism) simply needs a long history lesson about all the ways in which things have gotten better and better. Pinker includes more than seventy graphs with pleasing curves (trending up or down over time, depending on whether they're tracking positive or negative metrics), he provides double, or even triple, digit footnotes for each chapter (assuring me that every statement he makes is backed by published sources), and with thirty fine-print pages of references at the end, I couldn't possibly track them all down in order to reach my own conclusions about the state of the world. The reader is repeatedly asked to take Dr. Pinker's word for it that everything is progressing well (towards a place of measurable betterment for humanity), and as I found myself often squirming with the uneasiness of not just wanting to take his word for it, and as I also found myself without the informational/philosophical background from which to dispute his arguments, I couldn't always follow where Pinker wanted to lead me; often as impatient with myself as with him. I'm glad I read this book – at least in an effort to understand what the big debates of our time might be – but I just don't have the knowledge base to properly respond to Pinker's arguments; three stars reflects my not taking a stand on this one.So, I'll make an aesthetic judgment: Pinker stretched my concentration with his frequent philosophical references to hermeneutics, dialectics, ontological this and that, but when he would descend to informal/hippie references to presumably lighten things up (many retirees are happy “seeing the national parks in a Winnebago, or dandling Vera, Chuck, and Dave in a cottage on the Isle of Wight”; drivers safely enjoy the pleasures of “seeing the USA in their Chevrolet, or just cruising down the streets, feeling out of sight, spending all their money on a Saturday night”), I found the writing forced, or worse, anachronistic. And I grew impatient with Pinker's smugly rhetorical strawman-punchline gags:
There is no law of complex systems that says that intelligent agents must turn into ruthless conquistadors. Indeed, we know of one highly advanced form of intelligence that evolved without this defect. They’re called women.
Or:
Of course, one can always imagine a Doomsday Computer that is malevolent, universally empowered, always on, and tamperproof. The way to deal with this threat is straightforward: don't build one.
Other ideas that made me squirm: Pinker stresses the need for rational thinking and the belief that the scientific method is the only way of measuring the world (using that, at a stroke, to dismiss human consciousness as a mere byproduct of evolution and the nonexistence of gods as an accepted fact). History progresses in one direction, and so long as we continue to embrace Enlightenment thinking and turn to science to solve our problems, there will be no environmental doomsday, no nuclear wars, no real terrorist threat to democracy, no Singularity (no “foom”). Pinker insists that science is politically bipartisan and he takes swipes at the anti-progressivism of the left (those who are reflexively anti-GMO, anti-vaccine, anti-nuclear) and the anti-intellectualism of the right (those who are creationists, anti-immigration, protectionist), and while that might make him seem a neutral party, Pinker never misses an opportunity to name President Trump as the anti-Enlightenment bogeyman who could reverse centuries of human progress. And since, as I pointed out, I don't feel qualified to confront Pinker on his facts, here is some of the professional response to Enlightenment Now (note: I chose to share reviews from left-slanting sources in order to prevent partisan fakenewsmanship):From the (officially bipartisan but purportedly leftwing) Australian public broadcaster, ABC –Pinker never seems to see the force of the question: How do we know that all this did not take place in spite of, rather than because of, the Enlightenment? In fact, he doesn't even pretend to go to the trouble of establishing a causal connection between his contentious version of the Enlightenment and the various improvements that he imagines follow in its wake. Post hoc, ergo propter hoc seems to be the operative principle. From New Statesman, a British newsmagazine that self-describes as having a “liberal, sceptical political position” –Judged as a contribution to thought, Enlightenment Now is embarrassingly feeble. With its primitive scientism and manga-style history of ideas, the book is a parody of Enlightenment thinking at its crudest. A more intellectually inquiring author would have conveyed something of the Enlightenment’s richness and diversity. Yet even if Pinker was capable of providing it, intellectual inquiry is not what his anxious flock demands. Only an anodyne, mythical Enlightenment can give them what they crave, which is relief from painful doubt.From The Globe & Mail, a decidedly progressive Canadian daily newspaper –
Pinker's gripe is largely aesthetic. A prominent egghead who writes and composes himself with Spock-like coldness and clarity, he seems annoyed at the frenzy (and so, irrationality) of ""editorialists,"" ""climate justice warriors,"" ""relativists,"" and the ""politically correct"" left. What Pinker never substantially considers is that such frenzy – whether deployed as a deliberate political tactic, or manifesting as the sputtering incoherence of the true believer – may help mobilize the spirit of change and progress; dams and ditches of passion that channel the turbulent tides of Enlightenment. 
And from one such “frenzied climate justice warrior” at The Guardian, the British daily that famously tilts left –
Pinker insults the Enlightenment principles he claims to defend. Could he have succumbed to the motivated reasoning these principles are supposed to suppress? If the environmental crisis cannot be so easily dismissed, it threatens his argument that life is steadily improving. What looks like a relentless enhancement in human welfare could emerge instead as an interlude between one form of deprivation and the next.
The bottom line: I slogged through this long read, encouraged by its optimism, but unconvinced by its argument. I was further annoyed by my own inability to articulate my increasingly negative response to Pinker's thesis, and recognise that as my own failing; I remain uncertain that I've adequately outlined my objections even with the addition of other reviewers' voices. Even so, I'm glad to have read this book and would recommend it to anyone interested in what “the eggheads” are talking about."

Whether it is life expectancy, welfare, peace, democracy, knowledge or prosperity, there is not better moment to live than now.Most of the pages are dedicated with scores of statistics, all showing that things are going well. World life expectancy has doubled from 30 years (1800) to 71,4 years (2015). The world’s GDP has increased a 100 times and - despite the growing population - the number of people living in abject poverty is decreasing.But what about the challenges we’re facing today? The deplorable state of nature, extinctions and climate change? Yes, Steven Pinker acknowledges that these challenges exist, but where other relapse in doom scenario’s. Pinker advocates for a continuation of an optimal relation between (economic) progress and pollution. If humanity wants to survive, it needs to invest in progress itself: only after achieving a certain amount of welfare, people are willing to invest in (and sacrifice themselves for) a better environment. In other words, keep investing in the core values of the Enlightenment: rationalism, science and humanism. And yes, this includes nuclear energy, as a clean way of energy.In the last part of the book, Pinker delves into the current problems of the left and the right. The left thinks that the world is being plagued by inequality and the environment being endangered, the right think that his ‘culture’ is being destroyed by immigrations and minorities. Fact and figures that show that this is not the case, are being falsified or simply denied.The problem that I had with this book was its lack of nuance. He knows, or thinks he knows all, and does not refrain from his mantra that all is well, and will be well. There is no room for any considerations for those who - even today - might not be living their lives to their full capacity. Not because they don’t want to, but because they are simply kept from achieving it.

135,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48909861-dan-ust,4,"Overall a good book, though I believe Pinker overstates his case and is too narrowly focused on the Enlightenment itself — as if all progress were waiting for the 18th century to really start. This is strange given his earlier book, _The Better Angels of Our Nature_, where he documents the reduction in violence from the Stone Age on.He minimizes things like improved capabilities, while fine in themselves, can also breed greater risks. He does recognize this in the case of nuclear weapons. (One can argue that both ways: maybe nuclear deterrence has reduced or ended wars between major powers. But the devastation of one such weapon is certainly progress of a type many would question.)Also, he has what might best be called stylistic ticks. These wouldn’t be as bad in a brief talk, but became more vexing to me as I read the near 500 pages of the main text. (There are extensive footnotes worth mining too. I’ve read or skimmed a number of the works he cites.) By these I mean he seems to have to reword adages or quote songs and the like for somewhat comic effect. This works sometimes, but when it feels like every section must have one or two, it feels like padding in an already long work.I winced a little at his oversimplification of intellectual history, too, though I believe his trashing of Nietzsche is spot on. I winced further at his seeming to think the ruling class simply wants the best for everyone rather than it’s often resistant to progress and benefits from “gloom and doom” attitudes. (Politicians don’t run on the slogan that things are okay and getting better. Instead, election campaigns are morality plays where good is battling evil, where one side will redeem us and move is forward from the collapsing state we find ourselves in while the other wishes to push society over a cliff.)In many ways, too, Pinker’s work is an update of that of economist Julian Simon. One can argue that Pinker will have a greater impact because he’s not an economist and, despite my reservations above, is a much more accessible and wittier writer. (To be fair, it’s been a while since I’ve read Simon.)Ian Goldin also wrote a balanced review for Nature:https://www.nature.com/articles/d4158..."
136,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"This book was simply amazing. I've read the whole thing in less than two weeks. The material was very captivating, and the chapters in the book are well organized, allowing for natural breaks. Steven Pinker, the author, provides a rational and balanced view of the current state of humankind, how we got here, and where we're headed. He dives into vital topics directly and doesn't hold back or avoid anything. The book covers topics such as wealth, health, quality of life, society as a whole, climate change, education, and a lot more.The information shared is also backed up by real data which is quite refreshing. We're all surrounded with so much negativity from the mainstream news which can make the world seem like a terrible place to live in. And with this book, what I enjoyed was the more balanced presentation of the data without resorting to fear-mongering, which is so common these days with clickbait media.If you have any doubts, this book will open your eyes to the fact that we're all living in the best time for humankind since the beginning of our existence and things are getting better.As much as I enjoyed the optimistic viewpoint on certain topics in this book, I also like the fact that the author didn't exclude critical areas we as humans need to work on — one of those being climate change.There's very little doubt about the current situation with climate change and the urgency at which we need to operate to avoid a global disaster. The truth is, we all have to step up and do our part as this presents one of the biggest challenges for humankind yet.Overall, this book is a great read, and I highly recommend it. It covers so many important areas, and I'm glad I decided to read it. I have no doubts you'll enjoy it as much as I did."
137,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5196256-mindy,1,"I read this because Bill Gates highly recommended it, and because I felt I needed a more optimistic view of the progress of humanity. Why did I think Bill Gates’ reading list would hold any interest for me? This book is simply further evidence that all data can be manipulated to achieve a purpose. If you include yourself among the world’s wealthiest “citizens”, this is a great read to assuage any hint of privilege-related guilt you may feel. The extremely poor are in decline, and if the bulk of humanity is now simply poor, they should be content with their plight and thank their overlords from lifting them out of the squalor. I kept reading hoping for a redeeming moment. It never happened."
138,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"In 2011 Steven Pinker wrote a magnificent book, The Better Angels of our Nature, in which he showed – by using historical analysis, statistical methods and informed estimates – how the world has gotten safer (hence the subtitle of the book: The Decline of Violence). The gist of the book was that there have been continuous social reforms that have led to an environment in which our inner demons have fewer opportunities to surface and in which zero-sum games have been turned into positive-sum games. In 2017, Pinker followed up his 2011 work by extending his scientific method to the whole scale of human progress. In Enlightenment Now he wants to show us how the world not only got safer, but also became a much more pleasant place to live in – for almost all human beings that are born. Pinker wants to show us that this progress wasn’t inevitable: it was a conscious effort of human beings to start – for the first time in history – to apply reason to the goal of making the world a better place to live. This is important, since it shows us to not be complacent and to take all the gains for granted. Pinker tries to convince us readers that the Enlightenment values that drove this progress have to be remembered by and re-stated to each new generation.The book itself is divided into three parts; I will briefly summarize each part in the rest of this review.In part 1, Pinker describes how in the Enlightenment era people started to use reason to understand the world (science) and to distinguish right from wrong (ethics). No more witch hunts; no more mythologies; no more harsh punishments; etc. According to Pinker, mankind has to fight continuously against three natural entities: (1) entropy (the increasing of disorder), (2) evolution (the competition of all against all; zero-sum games), and (3) information (increasing our knowledge). In this fight, reason is the most important, and only, tool that we have to – temporarily – create a good place to live for ourselves. Pinker sees two contemporary threats to this ideal though: religion and populism (left- and rightwing). His goal of the rest of the book is hence; first to show that real progress has taken place; and next, to convince us that this progress was driven by Enlightenment values that have to be defended. So, in part 2 of the book Pinker applies the scientific method to analyze the different domains of human progress. He uses lots of graphs and he meticulously describes all the relevant scientific findings – just like he did in his 2011 book on the decline of violence. In short, people live longer; are healthier; are economically better off, even though inequality increases; the environment is (slowly) better off and the climate change fatalism is misguided (especially in light of all the technological advances); the world is more peaceful and safer than ever, while terrorism is a minor (insignificant) blip; democracy and equal rights are strongly instituted; and knowledge is readily accessible for masses of people and ever-progressing. In the closing chapters of part 2, Pinker also states that the newer generations are much happier, healthier and experience a much higher quality of life than earlier generations. Within generations this progress is also visible. The hailed existential threats to progress – technological enslavement and nuclear war – are serious issues but there really is no reason to be scared shitless: human beings, according to Pinker, are better and better equipped to turn zero-sum games into positive-sum games (i.e. turning existential threats into cooperated effort to ward off disaster). Pinker finishes part 2 by claiming that progress, even though contingent (i.e. depending on human choices), is a self-enhancing cycle: as the world is better off each year, countries will tend to cooperate more and more and living conditions of all human beings will tend to increase. Minor setbacks, such as the Trump presidency and the Brexit referendum, cannot stop the long-term trend of ever-increasing progress.After showing us how much the world has progressed, Pinker turns his book into an essay. In part 3 he makes a case for three Enlightenment values that are, according to him, essential to actively promote and continue the progress we have already made. The first of these values is reason, which is under increasing attack by generations of postmodernists (“objective reality doesn’t exist”, “all cultures are equal”, etc.) and populists (“the will of the people should be followed”, “we need a strong leader”, etc.). Next to these two ideologies, human beings suffer from biases and hence the media portray a picture of a world that is almost continuously on the brink of World War III. Pinker, essentially, advocates a more rational public discourse, in which fact checking and statistical reasoning trump Trumpism (pun intended).The second value Pinker advocates is science. In other words: trial and error. Not just to gain more knowledge and hence receive more control over our lives (by fighting diseases, natural disasters, etc.), but also to base our policies on. Politics, according to Pinker, should be more evidence-based and less ideology-driven. This is the old argument of piecemeal social engineering promoted by Karl Popper: changing policy in small steps; measuring and evaluating the results of each step; and adjusting where necessary.Pinker notices a trend in literary and cultural circles, especially due to scientifically illiterate self-proclaimed intellectuals, to blackball science and act like science is the root of all evil. The truth is that science is a-moral – in the sense that it doesn’t say whether we should build a-bombs, nuclear reactors for energy, or both, and in which situation – and that science offers us the possibility to better our lives. It is due to science that we live longer, healthier and wealthier.The third and last value that Pinker advocates is humanism. Humanism is the answer to the problem of the a-morality of science: it tells us what to do with all the knowledge, wealth and technological possibilities. Pinker uses the ethics of one of the founders of the Enlightenment, Spinoza. According to Spinoza, any human being that is governed by reason will wish for any other human the same things as they wish for themselves. This is a strong ethical imperative, and Pinker uses the rest of the chapter to state it more fully (in short: consequentialism) and to refute the two counter-narratives: religious morals (which are, according to Pinker, humanized by humanism – with the exception of Islam) and populism/nationalism (which are inspired by the ethics of Nietzsche’s Übermensch and heroism).All of the above is my try to summarize Pinker’s thoughts as honest and representative as possible. Of course this is practically impossible: the book is huge and Pinker is much nuanced on all of the themes mentioned. But: what to think of it all?First, I applaud Pinker for stating clearly how far we have come since the 16th century: how much better off human beings are in the 21st century world. As Pinker himself repeats, it is trendy to be a cultural pessimist. All this liberalism and progress has led to atomized societies and hedonistic, empty lives. It is also very fancy to be a fatalist, especially regarding the environment and climate. Pinker's book is a healthy antidote to all this doom-thinking and the masses of studies and graphs he uses to back up his arguments make cultural pessimism and climate fatalism hard to sustain.Second, I think Pinker is right in seeing humanism, reason and science as the driving forces behind the world we live in nowadays. It is only when reason is set aside – consciously or unconsciously – that progress halts and that we fall back on our primitive nature and zero-sum value systems. I think he is also right in describing the two major threats to the world as we know it: religious morality and populism (again, left- as well as rightwing). So in all this, Enlightenment Now is a terribly accurate and timely book.But I do disagree with some of Pinker’s observations, especially the ones on happiness and quality of life. I cannot help but reflect that Enlightenment Now is written by a Harvard professor whose life is spent on creative thinking and intellectual effort to understand the world. I don’t think many of us can share this luxury, and that for many of us leading ‘normal lives’ life isn’t as fulfilling or free as we wish. Pinker’s line of argument is (albeit simplified): younger generations suffer less from addictions; commit fewer suicides; suffer less from depression; etc.; hence, they are happier than earlier generations and have a higher quality of life. I don’t know if the amount of suicides and depressions says anything (or much) about the happiness of people. And another problem with this line of thinking – which really surfaces throughout the whole book – is that it generalizes over everyone. It is entirely possible that certain parts of the population are worse off, but that this negative effect is swamped by an exponential increase of happiness by the rest of the population. For example, due to globalization, the world is better off, and the poorest people and the poorest countries are the real gainers in health and wealth; yet the (lower) middle classes and lower classes in richer countries are really worse off than earlier generations – combined with an ever-increasing decline of social mobility. The same thing goes with people in vulnerable professions or in vulnerable life situations: handicapped people, sick people, old people, etc. In all developed countries we see an ever-increasing jungle of rules and regulations, to guarantee an equal treatment for all people in like situations. This sounds beautiful and noble, but it results in health care workers clocking five minutes for washing elderly people; treating schoolchildren as revenue and future tax payers; making people who depend on social welfare end up in mazes of bureaucracy; etc. Is this truly progress? (Of course, Pinker would counter: would they be better off in the nineteenth century?)My point is that statistics are useful to describe general trends and to understand what causes play a role. When we understand what factors make the world a better place to live in, we can apply more of the same potion. Understanding is fundamental. But scientific studies of subjects like happiness - even apart from all the methodological issues involved - are rather empty when we're dealing with our own personal lives and our loved ones around us. Stating, for example, that more people are better off and that poverty declines, is a rather meaningless statement when talking to someone who just lost his or her job because his or her employer moved to a developing country. Personally, I think the diffusion of liberalism, the results of equal rights movements (including feminism), and decades of migration have led to a diminishing social cohesion in Western societies – and between countries worldwide. This is, for example, illustrated by contemporary elections: a huge assembly of small political factions and an increasingly polarized climate. It is also illustrated by the popularity of identity politics, in which individuals base their personal identity on biological and cultural traits. Western societies have degraded into collections of individuals without much common ground. Hence, all the rules and regulations to enforce equality: people don’t trust each other anymore – or at least less than before. I cannot help but remark that in Sweden there are plans to make laws to make two adults consent to have sexual intercourse - as if the intricate and complex dealings in real life can be translated and enforced by abstract laws. The same applies to the laws against islamophobia that the Canadian parliament put into practice in 2017. This is symptomatic of societies lacking social cohesion and reciprocal trust and commitment.I think Pinker is over-optimistic when it comes to a better world. He does notice an increase in global and national inequality and declining social mobility, but he doesn’t see it as serious arguments against progress. Of course, from a macro-perspective, the world is better off and this is a good thing. But people don’t like grim futures and this can become very problematic in countries in which large swathes of the population have to give up health and wealth to transfer it to developing countries – something which is inevitable if the world economy continues the way it does now. I think the safe thing to say is that Enlightenment Now is a reliably optimistic book on how the world as a whole is much better off in 2018 than in 1618. The causes of this progress are humanism, reason and science. On a grand scale, Pinker’s book is an important reminder of the possibilities of human progress – if/when we set our minds to it we can do a lot to better our lives. Yet by zooming out, Pinker steers around the (equally important) question of a declining standard of life for individuals and particular social groups and a feeling of loss of social cohesion. Yet, these last points weren’t the goal of his book, so I shouldn’t end this review on such a sour note. It’s a very interesting and readable book: read it!"
139,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1139239-michael-austin,4,"Steven Pinker is a rare creature in the academic world: a liberal who is not a leftist. As a liberal he supports things like free speech, civil rights, democratic ideals, and a strong government that ensures safety, protects the environment, and redistributes some portion of income to support education, health care, infrastructure, and the reduction of poverty. As a non-leftist, he supports things like a democratic government and a capitalist economy that, while subject to government regulation and income redistribution, still functions as a free market. Like most of Pinker’s books, Enlightenment Now is big and filled with lots of data, but actually very tightly argued. The sequence of his argument goes something like this:1.	In the eighteenth century, European intellectuals produced a movement that we call “the Enlightenment” that was built on four interrelated principles: reason, science, humanism, and progress. They set in motion revolutions in government, science, and culture that has shaped the world ever since. 2.	The Enlightenment worked. Over the last two and a half centuries, nearly every measure of human flourishing has increased dramatically across the world. People alive today are better educated, healthier, richer, and safer than they have ever been at any time in history. Major diseases have been wiped out by vaccination, extreme poverty has been substantially reduced by global markets, and war and violence have decreased to their lowest levels in world history.3.	Since its beginning, the Enlightenment has had to contend with “counter-Enlightenment” narratives from both the left and the right. Counter-Enlightenment narratives are those that portray the world as getting worse, either because people are falling away from religious belief and values (the conservative counter-narrative), or because capitalism has enervated the world for its own profit and turned 99% of people into labor machines that feed its insatiable greed (the leftist counter-narrative). 4.	The work of the Enlightenment is not finished. There is still poverty, war, and injustice. There are still threats to safety and to the environment. We still have many, many problems to solve. But these problems are best solved by using the tools of the Enlightenment (reason, science, and humanism) rather than by reverting to counter-Enlightenment narratives such as religious fundamentalism or Marxism to address them. As one who is, like Pinker, a liberal but not a leftist, I find myself agreeing with almost everything in this over-arching argument. Sure I have specific quibbles with all kinds of stuff. Pinker is not content to show that most things are a little bit better. He wants to be more comprehensive than that and show that everything is a lot better. And in the process, he often stretches his argument beyond what can be reasonably proved. But even adjusting for some hyperbole, the data he presents is overwhelmingly persuasive—not just that life has gotten better in the world since the 18th century, but that it has improved dramatically in just the last 30 years. During this time, extreme poverty has fallen from 50% of the world to 10%, the number of people killed in wars has fallen by 200%, criminal violence has decreased dramatically, cars are safer, more countries are democratic, and income inequality has decreased in all but the most developed nations. It seems to me that there is no reasonable way to refute the proposition that the world today is more amenable to human flourishing than it has ever been.But there are a whole lot of unreasonable ways to refute this, and this, really, is the most important part of the book. Pinker identifies two key cognitive biases that causes many people to reject the Enlightenment narrative that the world is getting better and embrace one of several counter-Enlightenment narratives that insist that the world is getting worse.The first of these biases is the “availability heuristic.” We have a lot more access to information than we have ever had before, so we see more of the bad stuff than anybody ever has. Our Internet and social media feeds immediately show us acts of racism, police brutality, mass violence, civil strife, and even genocide. We see these with much greater frequency, and when we do, our minds tell us that they are happening with greater frequency, which is generally not the case. But don’t try to tell us that, because we probably won’t believe it.The more troubling factor in our tendency to see a world in decline is the confirmation bias, which simply means that we tend to see what confirms our beliefs and ignore what does not. And we are attracted to narratives of decline because they fit with so many ready-made world views. They are, in fact, an indispensable part of contemporary politics.“We are doing well, but we need to do better” is not a good political message. “We are in decline and need to make America great again” is. And herein lies the fundamental attraction to narratives that cannot be supported by reason or data. We want to believe that things are getting worse, because this is the best way to accomplish political and religious goals. These narratives create fear, and fear motivates us to vote, to donate to politicians, to attend Church, to donate to Churches, and to agitate for change. We can do this through reason and science, of course, but it doesn’t work as well. And this is probably Pinker’s most important point: we are in danger of losing much of the progress that we have made as a nation, and as a world, by rejecting the principles responsible for that progress and embracing narratives that emphasize tribalism, magical thinking, resentment, and unwarranted fear. In the United States, we are rolling back the government regulations that have kept us safe and improved our environment, and we currently have an administration that insists that global relations are a zero-sum game. Globally, people are rejecting the vaccines that wiped out diseases and attacking the advances in food technology that have dramatically reduced hunger and poverty. Countries that once embraced secularism and democracy are starting to turn to religious fundamentalism. We are abandoning things that work in favor of things that won’t. And this is very dangerous. It is possible to argue with almost everything that Pinker says in Enlightenment Now. But those arguments must also adopt Enlightenment principles: showing where his reason fails, providing better evidence, rejecting conclusions that he makes because they are not adequately supported. This kind of debate is necessary and proper.Unfortunately, this is not the debate that we are having. Across the political spectrum, the Enlightenment ideals that Pinker champions are being refuted from fundamentally illiberal and unenlightened positions with a strong interest in making the world seem like a fetid hell hole that is only a moment away from the apocalypse. These arguments are dangerous because they appeal to the kind of thinking that caused most of our problems in the first place."
140,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,5,"There is no one alive who writes with the mind-sweeping clarity and breadth of knowledge that Steven Pinker possesses. Though there are other works of his that are perhaps more revolutionary (The Blank Slate) or ambitious in their singular explanatory power (How the Mind Works), it is this latest volume of his that is his most timely and all-encompassing cerebral broom.If the idea of needing to defend Enlightenment values is mysterious to you at this point then I can only pity you your global-scale ignorance or apathy. In Pinker, that cause of defense has found its most able champion. Offering an incredible array of 75 statistical graphs that are properly contextualized and interpreted, he has produced such an incredibly coherent and well-argued line of thinking that has enough independent and objective fact to annoy partisans of both sides of the political/philosophical spectrum. Much of the work seems to follow-up on several of the arguments brought forth in his previous volume, ""The Better Angels of Our Nature."" Following a deft summary as to what Enlightenment ideals and practices are, Pinker proceeds to show just how they have benefited society and the world as a whole ever since, where they have come up short, and recommends several new usages of these ideas for future mutual benefit. Along the way he casts off so many misconceptions and anecdotal ""arguments"" against the Enlightenment, something long overdue in writings by contemporary intellectuals who - alarmingly and genuinely stupidly - have distanced themselves from these values. This is not done with flippant casuistry or mere rhetorical prolepsis but with relentless data and cogent, in-depth examination. Some telling and amusing samples from the work include:""If you extol reason, then what matters is the integrity of the thoughts, not the personalities of the thinkers.""""While a vision of world peace may have given John and Yoko some good songs, it is hopelessly naïve in the real world.""""However long it takes, we must not let the existence of cognitive and emotional biases or the spasms of irrationality in the political arena discourage us from the Enlightenment ideal of relentlessly pursuing reason and truth.""This is the book of the year, no question. No one has this diverse array of knowledge, no one marshals their facts better, and no one does so with the ease of language that Dr. Pinker presents across a work of 500+ pages. In closing I will let him sum up one of the major points of this monumental achievement: ""Remember your math: an anecdote is not a trend. Remember your history: the fact that something is bad today doesn't mean it was better in the past. Remember your philosophy: one cannot reason that there's no such thing as reason, or that something is true or good because God said it is. And remember your psychology: much of what we know isn't so, especially when our comrades know it too."""
141,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58890815-andrii-zakharov,5,"There are a lot of bad reviews of Steven Pinker's new book out there, mostly arguing against some of his particular points taken out of context, putting words in his mouth, falsely attributing some agenda to him, or simply twisting his words. But reading the book attentively, one can't help but notice how much thought went into Pinker's formulations, and how careful he is with what he is saying and showing. The one detailed review I can recommend which appreciates the precision and is not politically loaded is Scott Aaronson's: https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p....Here, I will only give my brief impression. First, I must admit that I found some chapters in the book stronger than others. This is to be expected of a work that attempts to cover the whole span of the human condition across history, and do so in an exclusively data-driven, empirical way. For some developments, there is just not enough good data available, and so some of the conjectures and estimates will necessarily be better supported than others. That said, taken as a whole, Enlightenment Now is an exceptional piece of popular scholarship, providing a most enjoyable review of all the relevant aspects of human life. Page after page, figure after figure, relentlessly hammering home the crucial point way too many of us are unaware of: the world and our lives in it are continually getting better, along almost every conceivable dimension. One could argue at length about the data in each and every chapter. One could rightly point out that some of it is one-sided, that his historical accounts are incomplete and some of the conclusions premature. But the sheer weight of evidence makes it impossible to deny the central points:* life has been, and is, getting better for ever more people in ever more places* it is happening as we create new knowledge and use it to gradually solve problems* problems are inevitable, new ones will always arise, but problems are also solvable, given the right knowledge* the best system we have to create new knowledge is science* continuing to gradually improve our institutions will continue to bring incremental progress* we are facing many dangers, some of them existential, which call for unprecedented global cooperation and knowledge production to overcome* the ideas outlined above are, sadly, time and again attacked by hostile ideologies from all sides of the political spectrum, and have to be defended if we are to continue our progress.These points were made very persuasively in the course of the book, and appear to me of paramount importance. Reading Enlightenment Now significantly shifted my worldview towards conditional future optimism, motivating to work very hard to sustain our amazing progress so far."
142,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"Pinker builds on his previous book The Better Angels of Our Nature to make a strong case for enlightenment values.His writing is excellent and always an absolute joy to read.He puts apparent contemporary reversals of progress in perspective. He defends humanism. He pulls no punches discussing religion. He weighs in on economics as key to those Better Angels. He wipes the floor with Friedrich Nietzsche and his intellectual heritage in fascism, Nazism, etc. He backs up everything with scientific evidence. Even if sometimes the interpretation comes off a bit forced, he's still working on solid ground throughout the book."
143,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,5,"Steven Pinker was one of the first writers to kindle my passion for scientific thinking. When I read 
The Blank Slate
 in 2011, it exposed me to a host of intellectual disciplines that my undergraduate training in philosophy had neglected––most notably evolutionary psychology, skepticism, and the empirical foundations of human nature. Nearly a decade later, I am thrilled not only to have another opportunity to journey through Pinker’s impressive mind, but also that his chosen message is rooted in data-driven, responsible optimism. Given the psychological and political difficulties of 2017, I was on the verge of thinking that such optimism was nothing more than shrugging in the face of inevitable doom. But Enlightenment Now turned my frown upside down, made me feel good about being human again, and restored much of my belief that humanity still has a bright future (or many possible bright futures) ahead.If I could rename this book without worrying about marketing, my chosen title would be: Everybody Calm the Fuck Down: The Case for Sanity, by Steven Pinker. At a moment in global and American history when many citizens feel like the sky is continually falling, Enlightenment Now provides a hard-nosed critique of our tendency to indulge our inner Chicken Littles. Instead of taking the in vogue route of mining for new reasons why human civilization is inherently dishonorable and teetering on the brink of destruction, Pinker argues the exact opposite. To make his case, Pinker demonstrates that the Enlightenment, the great intellectual movement that precipitated the rise of modernity, has been a rollicking success:""This book is my attempt to restate the ideals of the Enlightenment in the language and concepts of the 21st century. I will first lay out a framework for understanding the human condition informed by modern science––who we are, where we came from, what our challenges are, and how we can meet them. The bulk of the book is devoted to defending those ideals in a distinctively 21st-century way: with data. This evidence-based take on the Enlightenment project reveals that it was not a naïve hope. The Enlightenment has worked––perhaps the greatest story seldom told. And because this triumph is so unsung, the underlying ideals of reason, science, and humanism are unappreciated as well. Far from being an insipid consensus, these ideals are treated by today’s intellectuals with indifference, skepticism, and sometimes contempt. When properly appreciated, I will suggest, the ideals of the Enlightenment are in fact stirring, inspiring, noble––a reason to live."" (5-6, emphasis his)This passage reveals both the considerable strengths and non-negligible weaknesses of Pinker’s position. Since I agree with Pinker’s outlook and think this book represents a hugely valuable contribution to the modern moment, I’ll deal with the chinks in his armor first and follow with praise. First, Pinker’s characterization of the Enlightenment’s success as “the greatest story seldom told” is an overstatement. I’d like to say it’s an overstatement that isn’t repeated in the rest of the text, but that wouldn’t be an honest appraisal. It’s my feeling that the Enlightenment-rejecting “intellectuals” in Pinker’s crosshairs––frustrating and myopic as they may be––do not represent a majority opinion in America or anywhere else. In fact, as Pinker points out, they do not even represent a majority of intellectuals:""During the 20th century, the landscape of human knowledge was carved into professionalized duchies, and the growth of science (particularly the sciences of human nature) is often seen as an encroachment on territories that had been staked and enclosed by the academic humanities. It’s not that practitioners of the humanities themselves have this zero-sum mindset. Most artists show no signs of it…Nor is the anxiety expressed by the scholars who delve into the historical epochs, genres of art, systems of ideas, and other subject matter in the humanities, since a true scholar is receptive to ideas regardless of their origin. The defensive pugnacity belongs to a culture: Snow’s Second Culture of literary intellectuals, cultural critics, and erudite essayists."" (389-90, emphasis his)This Second Culture is Pinker’s true enemy, and while he does a good job of calling them out directly in the latter chapters, some of his earlier assertions belie the genuine nuances that bolster the rest of the text. For example, the opening sentences of a chapter called “Progressophobia” read thus: “Intellectuals hate progress. Intellectuals who call themselves progressive really hate progress” (39, emphasis his). Such sweeping statements needlessly open a path for critics to characterize Pinker as nothing more than a Panglossian apologist for modernity; sadly, this path will be well-trodden given how Pinker has been villainized by the Second Culture and its acolytes (this review  is a good example). Here we find the downside of Pinker’s iconoclastic nature, which is not only the source of his intellectual vitality and undeniable wit, but also his most significant vulnerability.My other worry about this book is that, despite Pinker’s repeated claims that the Enlightenment’s success is not a justification for complacency in the face of extant problems, it may nevertheless end up playing that role in cultural and political discussions, as well as in the hearts and minds of readers. Over and over, Enlightenment Now caused me to take a deep breath and remind myself that things aren’t so bad, which is terrific for my personal health and state of mind, but probably not the best way to get me into the proverbial trenches solving humanity’s most difficult challenges. Of course, one of Pinker’s central claims is that the best way to fight those battles is to eschew unnecessary excitation in favor of calm calculation and reasoned negotiation. But I still worry that readers like myself––privileged first-worlders for whom modernity is working just fine––may utilize this perspective to thicken our own socioeconomic and ideological bubbles instead of heeding Pinker’s call to action. The lesson here is that Enlightenment Now represents just one important perspective amongst others, and should not be treated as a comprehensive guide to the world’s present state. In other words, it’s like any other intellectual endeavor.Okay, now for the fun stuff! As ever, Pinker has crafted a book that is engaging, cleanly written, and packed with dense and fascinating thoughts. Since this is a book about progress, we should start with Pinker’s chosen definition:""What is progress? You might think that the question is so subjective and culturally relative as to be forever unanswerable. In fact, it’s one of the easier questions to answer. Most people agree that life is better than death. Abundance is better than poverty. Peace is better than war. Safety is better than danger. Freedom is better than tyranny. Equal rights are better than bigotry and discrimination. Literacy is better than illiteracy. Knowledge is better than ignorance. Intelligence is better than dull-wittedness. Happiness is better than misery. Opportunities to enjoy family, friends, culture, and nature are better than drudgery and monotony. All these things can be measured. If they have increased over time, that is progress."" (51)Pinker is not posturing when he claims that these indicators of progress can be measured. His commitment to empiricism runs much deeper than that of most public intellectuals, as evidenced by the 70+ graphs/charts and 100 pages of notes/references that accompany his superb argumentation. While he is well aware that data generation is a flawed human process (404), the raw power of evidentiary convergence becomes increasingly undeniable as Pinker’s explication of progress unfolds over about 300 pages.In my view, Pinker’s most important insight about progress is this: “It’s in the nature of progress that it erases its tracks, and its champions fixate on the remaining injustices and forget how far we have come” (215). This dynamic can make progress very difficult to identify and acknowledge, since even a world that is improving will always create new obstacles during the process of rendering old ones obsolete: “Progress cannot be monotonic because solutions to problems always create new problems. But progress can resume when the new problems are solved in their turn” (44). While it may seem simplistic to some readers, I think Pinker’s characterization of the world’s difficulties as mere problems to be solved is a critical and often-elided truth that we need to rediscover. In a cultural milieu where doubling down on embattled ideological positions and demonizing one’s opponents is routine, it becomes heroic to refocus one’s attention and energy on discovering the empirical nature of a problem and following the road to solutions wherever it may lead.Of the seventeen topics Pinker addresses in his discussion of progress, the one that most pleased me was his chapter on the environment. This is a topic that many big thinkers still neglect, even though climate change is perhaps the most ominous long-term threat to the continuance of human progress. Pinker takes up the climate problem with distinctive poise, showing how sentimental, anti-industrial positions on the political left and denialist positions on the right have both failed to provide a viable platform for global climate action. He advocates for “Ecomodernism,” a nascent field of study founded on three tenets: (1) some degree of pollution is unavoidable due to the entropic nature of the universe, (2) industrialization has generally been good for humanity, and (3) technology is the primary tool we should use to mitigate environmental damage without relinquishing the myriad benefits of modern life (123-4).While Second Culturists will surely write Pinker off as an obsequious technocrat beguiled by the corrupt comforts of elite capitalist culture, a sober assessment of Ecomodernism reveals it as the most reasonable and realizable approach for dealing with climate change. Pinker advocates for a combination of solutions, including decarbonization, alternative energies, dematerialization, and nuclear power––no silver bullets here. His recommendations, especially on the nuclear issue, pay no heed to the entrenched ideological positions of climate warriors or denialists, but rather follow the evidence wherever it leads. Climate change is serious and daunting, but panicking and using it as an excuse to upend the economic and institutional foundations of progress is foolish. This message is starkest in Pinker’s takedown of Naomi Klein’s position that the only way to address climate change is to raze contemporary capitalism and rebuild it with a much heavier emphasis on centrally-planned economies. His critique was especially salutary for me, given that I was completely seduced by Klein’s point of view when I read This Changes Everything back in 2014. I love an opportunity to update my opinions and reflect on the informational and perspectival limitations of my past selves.Instead of succumbing to the idea that humanity must repent for the great sin of modernity, Pinker instead demonstrates that we can approach this daunting challenge with a rational maturity:""It’s time to retire the morality play in which modern humans are a vile race of despoilers and plunderers who will hasten the apocalypse unless they undo the Industrial Revolution, renounce technology, and return to an ascetic harmony with nature. Instead, we can treat environmental protection as a problem to be solved: how can people live safe, comfortable, and stimulating lives with the least possible pollution and loss of natural habitats?"" (134)As it has always been, the solution is to press forward using the human wellsprings of creativity and innovation; it does no good to nostalgically pine for previous eras when life for average folks and even most elites was much worse than today.Also laudable is Pinker’s defense of rationality, which is endangered by political partisanship and religious/magical thinking. Pinker’s rejection of political partisanship, which he likens to sports fandom, is particularly valuable (359-60). He lays out a battery of research showing how ideologues bend over backwards to deny their opponents the benefit of the doubt, then ties it off with a much-needed reminder that progress is not owned by any individual or group, but is rather the collective result of countless actions and shifts over time that can come from even the most unlikely places:""It should not be surprising that the facts of human progress confound the major -isms. The ideologies are more than two centuries old and are based on mile-high visions such as whether humans are tragically flawed or infinitely malleable, and whether society is an organic whole or a collection of individuals. A real society comprises hundreds of millions of social beings, each with a trillion-synapse brain, who pursue their well-being while affecting the well-being of others in complex networks with massive positive and negative externalities, many of them historically unprecedented. It is bound to defy any simple narrative of what will happen under a given set of rules. A more rational approach is to treat societies as ongoing experiments and open-mindedly learn the best practices, whichever part of the spectrum they come from."" (365)All of us are inescapably embedded in Pinker’s “real society,” and our ability to intelligently acknowledge and navigate this messy reality can stave off madness and keep progress coming.Enlightenment Now closes with Pinker’s celebration of humanism––a strong message that rehabilitated my humanist loyalties, which took a hit when I read Yuval Noah Harari’s 
Homo Deus
 last year. I still wonder how humanism will stay relevant as we evolve into new transhuman and posthuman forms, but I’ve no doubt that Pinker’s perspective is the right one for the here and now:""The first step toward wisdom is the realization that the laws of the universe don’t care about you. The next is the realization that this does not imply that life is meaningless, because people care about you, and vice versa. You care about yourself, and you have a responsibility to respect the laws of the universe that keep you alive, so don’t squander your existence. Your loved ones care about you, and you have a responsibility not to orphan your children, widow your spouse, and shatter your parents. And anyone with a humanistic sensibility cares about you, not in the sense of feeling your pain––human empathy is too feeble to spread itself across billions of strangers––but in the sense of realizing that your existence is cosmically no less important than theirs, and that we all have a responsibility to use the laws of the universe to enhance the conditions in which we all can flourish.""

146,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3055905-nils,1,"Dr Pangloss lives! I’m unconvinced that the various Enlightenments (there actually were several distinct Enlightenments, though Pinker seems unaware of this), much as I love them, can really be credited for the huge increase in human material well-being that has taken place over the last couple of centuries. This turns out not to be a trivial critique, since Pinker’s argument that the Enlightenment is what “caused” the material improvement drives his conclusion that the main threat to sustaining that improvement comes from those who he alleges are undermining the Enlightenment, e.g. the so-called postmodernists. This in turn leads to Pinker’s bizarre suggestion that the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche represent a greater threat to our sustained material well-being than, say, Exxon-Mobil and the Koch brothers. Judge for yourself whether you find that plausible.In fact, the real underpinning the material gains of the last two centuries have been more institutional than ideational. This in turn implies that we must scrutinize the solidity of our institutional matrix if we want a real purchase of the sustainability of these gains. First, there have been numerous civilizations achieving marked improvement in the welfare and well-being of their populations – at least their upper classes. The Maya, the Romans, and several dynastic episodes of the Chinese achieved such gains. Of course, the gains that industrial modernity has achieved over the last quarter millennium outstrips all previous improvements. But taking the longer view, the gains of modernity are perhaps less impressive than they seem. Almost all those gains have taken place in the last quarter millennium, and 250 years, after all, isn’t that long of a run for a civilization. Other historical civilizations have sustained their gains for much longer. The Roman Empire’s eastern branch basked in cultural glory for a thousand years. And even though it’s usually meant pejoratively, it’s no coincidence that the word “byzantine” is a synonym for institutional complexity.Second, there are reasons to suspect that modernity’s run of material amelioration may be drawing to a close—and may even go into reverse. Broadly speaking these reasons can be divided in two. The first concern biophysical limits to growth. These are enduring arguments that the Breakthrough Institute has done much to illuminate and clarify, so suffice to say that, as a long term proposition, Malthus hasn’t yet been proven wrong, and climate change presents challenges of unprecedented scale that will only be addressed if there is sufficient collective political will to overcome collective action and free riding challenges. It’s at best unclear whether we have the global social capital to do so. Put another way: we live in an era of wicked problems.My own skepticism about whether humanity can overcome these challenges brings me to my fundamental critique of Pinker’s optimism: not only the sustainability of the gains of the last quarter millennium, but also the extensibility of these to larger sections of humanity, as well as the ability to address the growing headwinds posed by anthropogenic climate change depend crucially on a massive strengthening of our global institutional and governance infrastructure. From this perspective, all the indicators are sharply negative over the last fifty and especially the last ten years.For nearly fifty years, Gallup has run a series of polls asking Americans about their confidence in various institutions – universities, the media, business, political institutions, and so forth. While the data are noisy, the overall trendline is inexorably downwards. The decline in confidence is partly the result of sustained anti-institutional propaganda, which exists in both leftwing and rightwing versions. But as I have argued elsewhere, I believe the root cause of this declining trust is the objectively poor institutional performance and a lack of elite accountability. A general feature of late modernity is a declining faith in social authority of all sorts, as ever more individuated and autonomous polities become ever less willing to entrust political agents to do anything. The advent of Donald Trump is merely a symptom of both the failure and the rejection of institutions in the United States.Nor is this just an American phenomenon. The rise of populism across Europe likewise reflects distrust of institutions. The Brexit vote two years ago of course represented a direct rebuke to transnational institutions. More recently, the triumph in the Italian elections of the Five Start Movement, whose calling card was a rejection of political party infrastructure, signaled nothing if not a rejection of institutions. (It remains unclear whether the Movement can manage even a small city, let alone Italy as a whole.)With the United States in the grip of Trumpism and the European Union caught between shambolic national politics and collective dissolution, the primary hope for global leadership seems to be falling by default to the Chinese. Some people have argued that China is filling the institutional gap left by a receding Europe and the United States. Eric X. Li, for example, recently argued that Xi Jinping’s merging of Chinese state and party infrastructure makes sense given that “the party has developed into the most competent national political institution in the world today.” What this bold claim tacitly conceded is that, despite the huge successes the Chinese state has had in poverty reduction over the last 40 years, China’s existing institutions are inadequate to managing the bumpy course corrections that lie ahead if it is to sustain its gains.Even more worrying than the declining performance of global and national political institutions are the faltering institutional underpinnings of sustained technological innovation – innovation which everyone, optimists and pessimists alike, agrees is essential to any adequate plan for addressing the challenges posed by climate change. As Mariana Mazzucato has shown, state support for innovation and entrepreneurship has in fact been at the root of almost all major technological breakthroughs of the last 75 years. Specifically, much of this support has taken place through trillions of dollars of state funding for research universities. But universities today are under unprecedented assault. Variously accused of being hotbeds of leftist indoctrination, engines of neoliberal reproduction, or simply wastes of money, no one trusts universities anymore. (This is the real place where the “postmodernists” have something to answer for: they have both been a primary vector of critique of universities, in effect sawing at the branch they sit on, while at the same time provoking hysteria about the supposed insanity of the humanities, of which Pinker’s book is a characteristic example.) While it seems inconceivable that the United States in particular would flush away the linchpin of its technological, industrial, and soft power success, the cultural assault on universities today is unparalleled. Non-coincidentally, universities also face a funding crisis of unprecedented proportions, one that is hitting humanities departments first but which the STEM fields are unlikely to escape. All this threatens to cut the legs out from under the innovation engine that is critical to any effort to escape the grim climate reaper."
147,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna,4,"This is nonfiction and it covers a giant host of various topics, including politics, racism, war, etc. For as long as this audiobook was, I was never bored. The author moved effortlessly and quickly from topic to topic to topic. That style worked here. So the 4 stars is for the entertainment value that I was able to place on this. Now with all that said, it usually bothers me when the author slants all the info to fit his views and then completely glosses over other things that might deflate his defense. While this author did that (abundantly), I didn't find it offensive or annoying. He had some well placed humor to soften that reaction. "
148,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68472482-daniel,5,"This is the best book I have ever read which is something I’m not saying lightly. It makes you so optimistic about the state of human progress and it makes you truly appreciate how much progress we have made over the past couple of centuries. It is really mind-blowing. If you weren’t already, it will also make you very optimistic about the likeliness of this progress continuing in the future with the help of, among other things, technology and today’s widely available information resources.Pinker goes through a wide range of subjects from Life expectancy, Peace and Safety to Equal rights, Knowledge, Quality of life and Happiness. He backs it up with rigorous research and clearly shows how almost every relevant parameter is going in the right direction. The only two areas that as of now haven't shown clear-as-day improvements over time are Terrorism and Global warming. (Another area, which Pinker didn’t include in the book, that could be considered a blip in the otherwise steady drumbeat of progress, are the recent reports of increasing death rates among middle-aged Americans over the past decade.) Focusing on the bigger picture analysis that Pinker provides all throughout the book rather than the daily news and shorter-term trends, you get the true picture of how well humanity is doing.One fascinating example of this is what Pinker calls the consumer surplus. Think about the washing machine. It saves us 10h per week compared to 1920 and costs a few hundred dollars. Now, if you think about how much someone would have to pay you for you to give up your washing machine, the number is clearly not in the hundreds of dollars anymore. Many people in developed nations would say that there is no price that would make them give it up. So not only are we richer but many of the utilities (and other things) that we use everyday can be bought for almost nothing compared to their actual value to us. This wasn't true 50 and 100 years ago. Another example is that today the average American worker retires at 62. Hundred years ago the average American worker died at 51.Pinker thinks (and I agree) that the media is responsible for a large part of today’s unfounded, but in many parts of the Western world, prevailing pessimism. As he puts it “When voters are inches away from the news, optimism can seem naive.” He points out that if newspapers would have elected to report more good news, they could have run the headline ""Number of people in extreme poverty fell by 137,000 since yesterday"" every day for the past 25 years.The book is structured in such a way that you can easily read only one chapter that you find interesting and skip the rest. There is for example a very good chapter on the environment and climate change if you want to read up on that. I do think Pinker misses some of the big potential risks in his discussion on AI, for example advanced AI systems in the wrong hands. And I think you can safely skim through the final three chapters without missing too much of an otherwise wonderful book.As a side note, the reason I decided to read this book was Bill Gates' glowing review of it some time ago. As you can see, I wasn’t disappointed. In his review, Bill said that he read the book very slowly because he loved it so much, but that he thought “most people will find it a quick and accessible read.” Perhaps he wrote the review in the ensuing euphoria after having just finished the book because I can assure you of one thing: this book is a lot of things, an easy read for most people it is not (it’s all relative I guess). But it is enormously fun reading and often highly enlightening so it's well worth your time. A big thank you to Pinker for putting things in the right perspective and allowing readers to see the bigger picture so clearly."

150,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"In many ways, reading this book was similar to reading Pinker's book ""Better Angels of our Nature."" The theory of the book was straight-forward, the evidence was well-organized, and the insights from the data were presented clearly. The first drawback to reading this book is that it covers a lot of the same ground as ""Better Angels of our Nature."" The second drawback to this book is that...well, even if the conclusions of this book aren't common sense, to people who are roughly familiar with enlightenment ideals and are fairly well-read on current affairs, it sort of is common sense. That's a nice way of saying that there are few ideas in this book that will leave you awe-struck. That's not to see that Pinker isn't capable of writing such a book. I found ""The Blank Slate"" to be just such a book. That book remains one of my favorite books to this day. That is also the book I point to when I want to convince people what a great thinker Pinker is. Pinker's argument is straightforward and comes in the preface: ""I will present a different understanding of the world, grounded in fact and inspired by the ideals of the Enlightenment: reason, science, humanism, and progress. Enlightenment ideals, I hope to show, are timeless, but they have never been more relevant than they are right now."" (page 12). If Enlightenment ideas are timeless, then why do they need a defense? Pinker's answer: ""The ideals of the Enlightenment are products of human reason, but they always struggle with other strands of human nature: loyalty to tribe, deference to authority, magical thinking, the blaming of misfortune on evildoers"" (page 18). In many ways, ""Enlightenment Now"" is similar to ""Factfullness"" in its use of quantitative data to make the case that life is indeed getting better. Pinker's earlier book ""Better Angels of our Nature"" was also a book that relied heavily on quantitative data. However, by my recollection, that book did a better job of reflecting on how the numbers were arrived at. I think numeracy is an important skill, and too often it is easy to be wowed by numbers without realizing how they are produced and the difficulty of getting reliable numbers in certain contexts -- for example, the distant past and developing countries. My recollection of ""Better Angels"" is a few years removed, but I seem to remember Pinker doing a better job with educating readers on how numbers were arrived at. Having said that, I do think the graphs are presented in a useful and simple way. Often, the data comes in the form of time series line charts. I think the repeated use of these kinds of statistics is great for more casual readers who need to be convinced. Another drawback to this book is that it tends to ignore and short-change the possibility of cataclysmic blowups. The discussion of the disruptive power of AI is discussed briefly, but pales in seriousness to Yuval Harari's analysis in ""21 Lessons for the 21st Century."" The benefits of enlightenment are discussed abundantly, but Frankenstein monsters like mortgage-backed securities are barely mentioned. In addition, one of the most important trends of the 21st century, the explosion of debt is barely discussed. The looming debt crisis (or, I should say crises since we are talking about various kinds of debts, government, municipal, shadow banking, and private) as well as other potential crises with systemic implications -- climate change, the growing use of social media, the introduction of disruptive technologies -- are under-discussed in this book. And because these systemic crises are under-discussed, Pinker fails to deal with the mother of all questions about modernity. Does modernity increase the risk of catastrophic blow-ups? Since nuclear war, climate change, and contagious financial panics are the product in one way or another of modernity, science, and globalization, is there a likelihood that more potentially catastrophic phenomena could be birthed from them? And, if so, what can we do to prevent potential catastrophic blow-ups from occurring? Another way to think about the question is this way: In what ways is modern progress like a financial bubble? For me, a high point of the book was its discussion of tribal epistemology. I have read short articles on tribal thinking, but the review of the literature here was excellent. And for those who are searching for literature that discusses this topic, the book can make for an effective gateway. This was written in the Guardian about this book: ""More pertinently, the failed 2016 campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Remain demonstrated that, in the eyes of many people, “progress” simply meant more of the same. When people feel trapped and patronised by progress, then any alternative – even regress – will feel like freedom. Informing them that the policies of the past 40 years are still the best available starts to sound hopeless."" (Full review here: https://www.theguardian.com/books/201...)Perhaps that's another way of saying that technocratic modernity (complete with its wonky charts) can feel emotionally ungratifying. Instead of gradual improvements and progress by a thousand nudges, there is a part of the soul that yearns for liberation, heroism, and love. People like stories with heroes and villains. Enlightenment often sees the world in terms of mechanical and quasi-mechanical cause and effect relationships. Heroism seems less like heroism when it requires design and system-thinking rather than great sacrifices. Nassim Taleb, another writer whose work I admire, steeps his writing in decidedly non-modern ideas and sentiments -- his thinking perhaps is best described as classical and romantic. I believe anyone who reads this book ought to put it in conversation with some of Taleb's writing (one or two books is enough). I'm sure each of the authors would hate to hear it, but I'll say it anyway -- they are better read together than separately. The unabashed modernist/enlightenment thinker is better with a classical/romantic counterpart and vice versa. I will repeat this: People who are only familiar with Pinker for ""Better Angels"" and ""Enlightenment Now"" ought to read his earlier work ""Blank Slate."" That book, more than his more recent works, demonstrates that he is a true thinker and not simply a chart-jockey or dataphile. Overall, even if you do not need to be convinced of the merit of enlightenment ideas and ideals, this is a wonderful book to read. "
151,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,4,"If you're looking for a cure for the common pessimism, you might do much, much worse than to pick up this book. I've read or seen many other examples of the facts portrayed here, but Steven Pinker does a very admirable job of showing us, exactly, how much better the world is now compared to the one we had even a hundred years ago. It's not just time-saving devices or some outright reversals of ecological damage, but how lifespans, general IQ, overall poverty level, and even WAR has improved for the better for all. Not that war is ever really all that great, mind you, but few nations jump into it with quite as little reason or abandon as they used to.Pinker isn't saying that everything is peachy, of course, but the trend toward real positive progress is undeniable. This is, despite setbacks. And yes, we have many. But for every problem that exists, he makes a very good point that we have it in us to FIX our problems. It's not out of the question.Global Warming, for example, not only has possible temporary and minor fixes available, such as applying a metaphorical sunscreen to the atmosphere, but we have the means to do much more than cut our carbon footprint down to the bone. We have a history of moving on to different methods whenever resources of one type or another run out, too. Health and education are at an all-time high. What we don't have is our optimism. In fact, we have a very solid outlook that things are worse than ever. Terrorists are few in number and never accomplish their stated goals. They merely rouse the combined might of all the powers to quash them. Most of the first world countries have made a point of living by equality in the sexes and the trend is more of the same across the world. LGBT is already accepted on the same scale. Pinker attributes all our actual progress to the Enlightenment. The old standard of 19th-century thinking, where humanism reigns supreme. Look. I freely admit to being a humanist, myself. I LOVE the idea that we all should get along. That every life is valuable. That we should have a high fundamental basis for living for every man, woman, and child alive. It's so pervasive an idea that practically everyone shares it. It's like... OBVIOUS, right? And as far as I know, Steven Pinker is right. But he also makes a very cogent point about the need to be rational, to use science for what it is intended. Inquiry, truth-seeking. No matter what the result, the truth is much more important than any ideology. He uses this to encourage each and every one of us to see past the doomsayers and the demagogs. Again, I totally agree. Skepticism is not the same thing as pessimism. Almost everyone I know is a fundamentally decent person and we all want the same fundamental things.So why didn't I give this book a full five stars?Because he gives all the credit to humanism. Wishing does not make it so. He might be right, but let's face it: this might be what he, himself warned us about. Selection Bias.Even so, I love thinking about it and I totally recommend this book for anyone who is sick and tired of the news and wants someone with a lot of facts and good reasoning to pick them up off the ground, dust their shoulders, and tell them that we are, on the whole, doing pretty damn well for ourselves. You know, despite the actual problems. But then, we DO have it in ourselves to FIX THEM. :)"
152,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51602586-dominika,2,"I did not like this book.I would say that this book was middling for the majority of it. The idea of the book is that progress has already happened, and we shouldn't be as doom and gloom as we are. But for a man who emphasizes the use of data and critical thinking, he doesn't really read said data that well and some of his arguments are riddled with gaping holes. This was a book that was read at our book club (but I was the only person at that book club who read the book in its entirety) and one of the points was that you need to show that progress has been made in order to do more progress. I have mixed feelings: I feel as though that erases the issues that people are actually facing by trying to point out that ""oh but you won't die in the woods from an infection"". While it is nice that countries that were in extreme poverty 50 years ago are being lifted to the middle class, it won't matter to the person who is working 3 jobs at minimum wage so that they can support a family. We have a lot of great innovations in healthcare, but it doesn't matter when a person cannot take an ambulance because it will cost them $600. Some of the progress sections have rather weak arguments as well. The environment one was basically him saying that the system will fix itself (in terms of a capitalist system supporting renewable energy) and that we'll totally invent carbon capture technology. The happiness one also bugged me, because the data is just not consistent. But the section that really got my blood boiling was Science. First off, he tries putting his deregulation mindset against IRBs and says a really fucking insensitive thing about the Tuskegee Syphilis study (But black people worked on it and it's not like they were INFECTING people with Syphilis). And then the rest of it was a STEM circlejerk (Wah, why are these SOCIAL SCIENCES invading my medical research). I work in medical research and am working towards a masters in Epidemiology. We cannot live in our own bubbles, we must learn from different disciplines. Hard sciences bring data-driven analysis to every subject, but social sciences bring the ability to look at the whole picture. Humanities bring the ability to make these things appealing and also to think creatively, to gain inspiration. We need them all, and it's a shame that Pinker doesn't realize that.Oh boy, and I'm not even going to start on the Humanism section and his comments on Islam. Not only does he not see how Western Imperialism could have POSSIBLY encouraged a more patriarchal regime as opposed to just reading religious texts (Look at the south), he also is just full of double standards. Oh, and his arguement against Nietsche is that dictators read him. He doesn't seem to get the Nietsche is all about skepticism. I do really like the chapter on Ideas. While it isn't something that I haven't heard before, I liked the comment on how a lot of politics now isn't even about core fundamental beliefs, but about who's team is winning. The truth is, Pinker and I differ on some core ideologies. Pinker refutes Postmodern philosophy while I am very postmodern. We have some differing opinions on the amount of regulations things should get and whether systems will correct themselves. I understand that. I read Ayn Rand, and I felt as though more of the arguments were at least compelling (if not occassionally bat-shit crazy). I didn't feel the same way about Pinker.All of this isn't helped by how reading this book felt equivelent to eating raw almonds. It was bland, it was dense, Pinker repeated himself and would attempt some flowery tangent while utterly failing. My friend said he tried reading the book during his night shift job and then fell asleep, and then got the audiobook and fell asleep again. I know he's not trying to say that we shouldn't work hard to improve the world, but I don't particularly feel any inspiration from this book, particularly when the vast majority does try to read as a pat on the back in spite of his introduction. I felt like a majority of his arguments were flaccid with the occasionally toxic take, and this book in general was overbloated. "
153,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"In Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, Steven Pinker spends 550+ pages attempting to disavow you of any notion of ""the good ol' days"".And he IS pretty convincing. He's got stats and graphs and lots of evidence to bolster his case that we live in amazing times - that progress and Enlightenment-era ideals have lead to better conditions in almost every measurable sphere. And he's right. He spends some ink and time on why we feel the opposite so often - the world is a hell hole! - pointing towards psychological phenomena like the optimism gap, the availability heuristic, (leaning heavily on Kahneman and Tvorsky's work) and the tendency we all have to remember negative over positive.I didn't read his earlier book about the decline of violence, The Better Angels of our Nature, but this book looks like a more robust version of that one, with a broad focus to include public health, economics, climate change, nuclear weapons, and the timely discussion of authoritarian populism.It's not all roses and puppies, but there are many great things and amazing research that lead to more great things. That's a good thing to remember, and a clarion call to keep going with research and evidence-based activism. All in the name of progress and making things more equal."

However, it's clear things need to be taken with a large grain of salt. I admit, my initial five star rating was more out of the hopefulness associated with the book. Hopefulness that the world isn't really going to hell in a handbasket, and hopeful that the mass generalizations and questionable analysis of facts/statistics had a firm foundation. After reading Nassim Nicholas Taleb's multiple epic burns on Pinker in his book  Skin in the Game: The Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life, I had to reassess my star rating after I stopped laughing. Basically,  Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are, and  But What If We're Wrong? Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past. You can't trust anything or anyone! Fake news! Still, this book provides a sweeping view that is very much appreciated, if not 100% infallible. "

GMOs, fertilizers, and vaccines have and continue to save billions of lives. The global standard of living has never been higher. In virtually every measurable way, life is better for us than it has ever been for any generation of humanity before us. True, Donald Trump is the president of the United States and average global temperatures are increasing. But those problems have solutions. Reason, science, and humanism.

157,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35-michael-siliski,4,"Recommended for anyone interested in a wake-up call about the progress made over the past few centuries.Enlightenment Now makes the case that the ideals of reason, science, and humanism have driven the greatest advances in the history of human civilization over the past few centuries. The book is divided into three parts: the history of the enlightenment, the progress we’ve made, and the enlightenment ideals that must be defended going forward. However, the meat of the book, and Pinker’s passion, is clearly the middle section, which is a thorough and data-based walk through fifteen areas where human lives are almost indistinguishably improved from just 10 generations ago, including health, peace, freedom, inequality, the environment, and happiness. Pinker’s enemies are “progressophobes” on both the right (the anti-science forces, the Trumpian politics of grievance) and left (New York Times-style liberal handwringing and catastrophizing). Both sides are prone to populism and a desire to return to an imagined utopian past. Pinker is successful in his main goal of thoroughly debunking that such a past ever existed.Enlightenment Now has a lot in common with Hans Rosling’s Factfulness, which I wrote about recently. Pinker is quite a bit longer and goes much deeper, so if you’re the type to ask for the data backing each claim, this might be the better book for you. I also thought Pinker was much more successful in grounding his celebration of human progress in a memorable framework.Both books suffer from a relentless optimism that can feel a bit strident at times. For Pinker, I thought this was most evident in his discussions of inequality and happiness, both of which felt a bit blithe to me. I think there is good reason to reject the most pessimistic takes on these: that more wealth doesn’t make people any happier or even that people are less happy these days, that inequality within a society is far more important than absolute means. Pinker does a good job making the case that inequality is not equivalent to poverty, and that “in some ways the world has become less equal, but in more ways the world’s people have become better off.” He makes a compelling argument that happiness is directly related to wealth, in particular using Stevenson & Wolfers studies. But these are not the same as proving “the irrelevance of inequality to happiness” or demonstrating that individual happiness is primarily driven by wealth. I thought these sections would be stronger if they didn’t reach quite so far.I agree with Pinker that reason, science, and humanism are critically important to human well-being globally, and these days it does feel a defense of them is needed. While I doubt that many who disagree with the thesis would even pick this book up, Pinker does make a similar point to Rosling that many of the most well-educated, including academics, are unaware of how much progress actually has been made through Enlightenment ideals. So perhaps there is hope that books like this could have a positive influence.From: https://medium.com/@msiliski/enlighte..."
158,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13941368-bakunin,4,"I usually wait a while to write a review of a book in order to digest all the important aspects of the work and this is certainly true in this case as well. Being somewhat of a libertarian with conservative leanings I found this book to be both illuminating as well as challenging. This book is Pinkers best attempt to defend the enlightenment; that is to say humanism, science and reason. He goes through many aspects quantitatively to prove his point - health, inequality, evironment, peace, safety, equal rights, quality of life etc - and all these things seem to be going in the right direction. Countries which are more democratic and more liberal are happier. This is essentially a more scientific defense of what Popper called ""the open society"". Although I find it refreshing to read a somewhat optimistic book in the midst of all the usual gloom one encounters in the daily press, I find myself in disagreement with Pinker. I agree with Pinker in that we are living the best possible time but what bothers me is the fact that I believe that the welfare state won't be able to sustain this growth (or progress if you will). Although Pinker has a certain classical liberal leaning, he is not very worried about the implications of an ever expanding welfare state: the destruction of the family, mass immigration, and the infantilization of citizens in the west. His liberal predilection is also shown by his apparent scorn of Trump and 'populism'. I suppose that this is where the rubber meets the road - I believe that communities are necessary and that the individual is not a tabula rasa. I also strongly reject the notion of an enlightened elite telling people how to better live their lives. While my values often may coincide with Pinkers, I believe in a slow and organic change in society, rather than a forced political one. Pinker by contrast scorns tribalist behavior and finds this to be reactionary; a force to be fought with a scientific mind. Although I have a certain buddhist leaning myself, I am slowly becoming more convinced of the need to be a person in modern society and the need therefore to retain certain elements of tribalism. Where to draw this line is however unclear. "
159,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75777506-tom-zacharski,2,"I picked ""Enlightenment Now"" after Bill Gates's recommendation. It's not every day that you hear someone like Gates recommend their favorite book of all time. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed. The premise of the book is that, as humanity, we are much better off nowadays than ever before in history. Pinker draws on many statistics, graphs, and facts to show that is indeed the reality. While I love that premise and couldn't agree more (we need more of those reminders in the age of 24h media) I found the language and general style a bit hard to read and unpleasant to a reader - it read a bit too much like a textbook and too often felt like going through well researched and academic in nature Powerpoint slides. The book could have easily been three times shorter and would drive the points home more effectively. Nonetheless, the points are important and if you've never read anything about how far we have come as humanity I do recommend the book. I recently saw ""The Final Year"" - a documentary about Barafh Obama's last year in office and how his foreign policy team operated during the time of a divisive, and later shocking, election. At one point Obama says that history does not follow a straight line, rather it zigs and zags, there's ups and downs, but it's our job to make sure the trend continues upward. And that trend is what the ""Enlightenment Now"" is all about."

Pinker was named one of Time Magazine’s 100 most influential people in the world in 2004 and his books are regularly featured in the best-selling lists. While the purpose of this book is commendable – to show with extensive use of data that we are living in the best of times – two reasons made me cringe while reading it. Firstly, the author completely misses the mark on the topic I have dedicated part of my professional life for the past 10+ years: climate change.

162,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"I listened to this as an audiobook & it was good, but he has a lot of graphs so quick reference to the PDF is a big plus. There are also sections where it's nice to reread his thoughts, although most are straightforward enough that it's not necessary. His writing is clean & uncluttered. It follows a logical progression.There are 3 sections:1) Enlightenment2) Progress3) Reason, Science, & HumanismThe first two sections are great. I've read about the Age of Ignorance, its history, & its benefits before, but his is one of the best as he proves the benefit of the scientific method to mankind through some very telling statistics. I loved the section on how much wealth we now have comparatively. I've read comparisons about the cost of an hour of light, but it always impresses me. He shows how much less violence, starvation, & disease there is. So why do we think the world is in such danger? He thinks it's due mostly to brain bugs & loud extremists both on the left & right.The last section ""Reason, Science, & Humanism"" was preaching to the choir. It was long & boring at times. There was a lot of good information in it & while I agreed with him in general, he went over the top or underplayed several things. For instance, he seems to consider an existential threat as serious only if they'll kill off most people. He fails to mention how horrific a tragedy which abruptly killed 1% of our population would be (1% of 7 billion is 700 million!) or what the loss of an entire city could do to our society. IIRC, some have said it could take as little as losing 10% of the population to bring down our civilization since it is incredibly interconnected. Something like a nationwide outage of electric could be catastrophic even if it lasted a fairly short time. Cities only have a few days worth of food & places like LA rely on a lot of infrastructure. Millions are living in a desert, an area where the first settlement didn't make it.His thoughts on nuclear bombs were very simplistic & incomplete. Hindsight of what the Kremlin would have actually done during the Cold War based on records we're now reading is armchair quarterbacking at its worst. He also didn't get into the options of nuclear bombs like tactical nukes. I remember some talking heads discussing how great the tactical nuke option was going to be at one point. It was insane! Apparently he doesn't believe how close we were to annihilation.Worse, he dismissed the effect of the atomic bombs we did drop saying that the Japanese surrendered because the Russians were entering their area of the war. That's ridiculously simplistic, just one of many factors & I don't believe it was the deciding one. The Japanese were out of everything & the Allies were pushing them back in force. Kamikazes weren't their first choice as weapons, but born of desperation. In March, Tokyo was bombed by something like 300 planes - nothing like Dolittle's desperate raid of a few years before. It was a huge force with horrific results, but it was also understandable & they knew we couldn't afford it too often. In August, one plane dropped one bomb that was about as bad. A few days later, we repeated the trick. They didn't know the cost or how many more we had. How can anyone dismiss that?It's crazy hard to get fissionable materials, but they aren't the only nuclear threat. It's a lot easier to get radioactive waste & spread it around with conventional explosives. It doesn't take a genius & if it or a biological/chemical agent is put in the right place, someplace upwind. It could be devastating. Not an end of the world catastrophe, but up there with the Twin Towers. I don't think it's particularly likely, but everyone thought Clancy's novel, Debt of Honor (1994) was just unlikely fiction, too. If you haven't read it, a guy crashes a jet into Congress & pretty much wipes them all out. This was 7 years before 9/11, but airline security didn't change so his dismissive attitude towards terrorists seems a bit over done. Still, I generally agreed with him. We can be too anxious. Current airline security is a good example, but there are a lot of smart people trying to keep us safe. We're walking a tightrope between safety & losing our freedoms. Our anxiety only makes the latter more likely, so I'm glad of his perspective.Overall, it's a good book. If you're super religious or a big Trump supporter, you'll probably dislike the last section especially. Pinker beats on both sides of the aisle, but the anti-humanist & anti-science of the current administration is in front of us now, so he gives a lot of good reasons for his negative opinions.Highly recommended in any format, but do get the PDF with the audiobook. Very well narrated."

What is progress? You might think that the question is so subjective and culturally relative as to be forever unanswerable. In fact, it’s one of the easier questions to answer. Most people agree that life is better than death. Health is better than sickness. Sustenance is better than hunger. Abundance is better than poverty. Peace is better than war. Safety is better than danger. Freedom is better than tyranny. Equal rights are better than bigotry and discrimination. Literacy is better than illiteracy. Knowledge is better than ignorance. Intelligence is better than dull-wittedness. Happiness is better than misery. Opportunities to enjoy family, friends, culture, and nature are better than drudgery and monotony. All these things can be measured. If they have increased over time, that is progress. 
The subtitle of Enlightenment Now is: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, and as someone who has benefitted from all of these – in all of the ways enumerated in the opening quote – I don't know to what extent I needed the “case to be made” for these values. The difficulty I had is that while author Steven Pinker does define and defend each of these principles throughout the book, he is actually attempting to make the case for optimism – as though the entire world today has progressed in the direction of betterment (to greater or lesser degrees), as a direct result of Enlightenment thinkers, and as there isn't any problem facing us that can't be solved by doubling down on Enlightenment thinking and the advancement of science and technology, anyone who tends to pessimism (whether over the environment, existential angst, or the rise of populism and despotism) simply needs a long history lesson about all the ways in which things have gotten better and better. Pinker includes more than seventy graphs with pleasing curves (trending up or down over time, depending on whether they're tracking positive or negative metrics), he provides double, or even triple, digit footnotes for each chapter (assuring me that every statement he makes is backed by published sources), and with thirty fine-print pages of references at the end, I couldn't possibly track them all down in order to reach my own conclusions about the state of the world. The reader is repeatedly asked to take Dr. Pinker's word for it that everything is progressing well (towards a place of measurable betterment for humanity), and as I found myself often squirming with the uneasiness of not just wanting to take his word for it, and as I also found myself without the informational/philosophical background from which to dispute his arguments, I couldn't always follow where Pinker wanted to lead me; often as impatient with myself as with him. I'm glad I read this book – at least in an effort to understand what the big debates of our time might be – but I just don't have the knowledge base to properly respond to Pinker's arguments; three stars reflects my not taking a stand on this one.So, I'll make an aesthetic judgment: Pinker stretched my concentration with his frequent philosophical references to hermeneutics, dialectics, ontological this and that, but when he would descend to informal/hippie references to presumably lighten things up (many retirees are happy “seeing the national parks in a Winnebago, or dandling Vera, Chuck, and Dave in a cottage on the Isle of Wight”; drivers safely enjoy the pleasures of “seeing the USA in their Chevrolet, or just cruising down the streets, feeling out of sight, spending all their money on a Saturday night”), I found the writing forced, or worse, anachronistic. And I grew impatient with Pinker's smugly rhetorical strawman-punchline gags:
There is no law of complex systems that says that intelligent agents must turn into ruthless conquistadors. Indeed, we know of one highly advanced form of intelligence that evolved without this defect. They’re called women.
Or:
Of course, one can always imagine a Doomsday Computer that is malevolent, universally empowered, always on, and tamperproof. The way to deal with this threat is straightforward: don't build one.
Other ideas that made me squirm: Pinker stresses the need for rational thinking and the belief that the scientific method is the only way of measuring the world (using that, at a stroke, to dismiss human consciousness as a mere byproduct of evolution and the nonexistence of gods as an accepted fact). History progresses in one direction, and so long as we continue to embrace Enlightenment thinking and turn to science to solve our problems, there will be no environmental doomsday, no nuclear wars, no real terrorist threat to democracy, no Singularity (no “foom”). Pinker insists that science is politically bipartisan and he takes swipes at the anti-progressivism of the left (those who are reflexively anti-GMO, anti-vaccine, anti-nuclear) and the anti-intellectualism of the right (those who are creationists, anti-immigration, protectionist), and while that might make him seem a neutral party, Pinker never misses an opportunity to name President Trump as the anti-Enlightenment bogeyman who could reverse centuries of human progress. And since, as I pointed out, I don't feel qualified to confront Pinker on his facts, here is some of the professional response to Enlightenment Now (note: I chose to share reviews from left-slanting sources in order to prevent partisan fakenewsmanship):From the (officially bipartisan but purportedly leftwing) Australian public broadcaster, ABC –Pinker never seems to see the force of the question: How do we know that all this did not take place in spite of, rather than because of, the Enlightenment? In fact, he doesn't even pretend to go to the trouble of establishing a causal connection between his contentious version of the Enlightenment and the various improvements that he imagines follow in its wake. Post hoc, ergo propter hoc seems to be the operative principle. From New Statesman, a British newsmagazine that self-describes as having a “liberal, sceptical political position” –Judged as a contribution to thought, Enlightenment Now is embarrassingly feeble. With its primitive scientism and manga-style history of ideas, the book is a parody of Enlightenment thinking at its crudest. A more intellectually inquiring author would have conveyed something of the Enlightenment’s richness and diversity. Yet even if Pinker was capable of providing it, intellectual inquiry is not what his anxious flock demands. Only an anodyne, mythical Enlightenment can give them what they crave, which is relief from painful doubt.From The Globe & Mail, a decidedly progressive Canadian daily newspaper –
Pinker's gripe is largely aesthetic. A prominent egghead who writes and composes himself with Spock-like coldness and clarity, he seems annoyed at the frenzy (and so, irrationality) of ""editorialists,"" ""climate justice warriors,"" ""relativists,"" and the ""politically correct"" left. What Pinker never substantially considers is that such frenzy – whether deployed as a deliberate political tactic, or manifesting as the sputtering incoherence of the true believer – may help mobilize the spirit of change and progress; dams and ditches of passion that channel the turbulent tides of Enlightenment. 
And from one such “frenzied climate justice warrior” at The Guardian, the British daily that famously tilts left –
Pinker insults the Enlightenment principles he claims to defend. Could he have succumbed to the motivated reasoning these principles are supposed to suppress? If the environmental crisis cannot be so easily dismissed, it threatens his argument that life is steadily improving. What looks like a relentless enhancement in human welfare could emerge instead as an interlude between one form of deprivation and the next.
The bottom line: I slogged through this long read, encouraged by its optimism, but unconvinced by its argument. I was further annoyed by my own inability to articulate my increasingly negative response to Pinker's thesis, and recognise that as my own failing; I remain uncertain that I've adequately outlined my objections even with the addition of other reviewers' voices. Even so, I'm glad to have read this book and would recommend it to anyone interested in what “the eggheads” are talking about."
164,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5979619-boudewijn,3,"In this book, Steven Pinker wants to provide insight in the fruits of the Enlightenment and that the norms and values are still as important as everContrary to what you might believe, the world is in a much better shape than ever. Whether it is life expectancy, welfare, peace, democracy, knowledge or prosperity, there is not better moment to live than now.Most of the pages are dedicated with scores of statistics, all showing that things are going well. World life expectancy has doubled from 30 years (1800) to 71,4 years (2015). The world’s GDP has increased a 100 times and - despite the growing population - the number of people living in abject poverty is decreasing.But what about the challenges we’re facing today? The deplorable state of nature, extinctions and climate change? Yes, Steven Pinker acknowledges that these challenges exist, but where other relapse in doom scenario’s. Pinker advocates for a continuation of an optimal relation between (economic) progress and pollution. If humanity wants to survive, it needs to invest in progress itself: only after achieving a certain amount of welfare, people are willing to invest in (and sacrifice themselves for) a better environment. In other words, keep investing in the core values of the Enlightenment: rationalism, science and humanism. And yes, this includes nuclear energy, as a clean way of energy.In the last part of the book, Pinker delves into the current problems of the left and the right. The left thinks that the world is being plagued by inequality and the environment being endangered, the right think that his ‘culture’ is being destroyed by immigrations and minorities. Fact and figures that show that this is not the case, are being falsified or simply denied.The problem that I had with this book was its lack of nuance. He knows, or thinks he knows all, and does not refrain from his mantra that all is well, and will be well. There is no room for any considerations for those who - even today - might not be living their lives to their full capacity. Not because they don’t want to, but because they are simply kept from achieving it.

165,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48909861-dan-ust,4,"Overall a good book, though I believe Pinker overstates his case and is too narrowly focused on the Enlightenment itself — as if all progress were waiting for the 18th century to really start. This is strange given his earlier book, _The Better Angels of Our Nature_, where he documents the reduction in violence from the Stone Age on.He minimizes things like improved capabilities, while fine in themselves, can also breed greater risks. He does recognize this in the case of nuclear weapons. (One can argue that both ways: maybe nuclear deterrence has reduced or ended wars between major powers. But the devastation of one such weapon is certainly progress of a type many would question.)Also, he has what might best be called stylistic ticks. These wouldn’t be as bad in a brief talk, but became more vexing to me as I read the near 500 pages of the main text. (There are extensive footnotes worth mining too. I’ve read or skimmed a number of the works he cites.) By these I mean he seems to have to reword adages or quote songs and the like for somewhat comic effect. This works sometimes, but when it feels like every section must have one or two, it feels like padding in an already long work.I winced a little at his oversimplification of intellectual history, too, though I believe his trashing of Nietzsche is spot on. I winced further at his seeming to think the ruling class simply wants the best for everyone rather than it’s often resistant to progress and benefits from “gloom and doom” attitudes. (Politicians don’t run on the slogan that things are okay and getting better. Instead, election campaigns are morality plays where good is battling evil, where one side will redeem us and move is forward from the collapsing state we find ourselves in while the other wishes to push society over a cliff.)In many ways, too, Pinker’s work is an update of that of economist Julian Simon. One can argue that Pinker will have a greater impact because he’s not an economist and, despite my reservations above, is a much more accessible and wittier writer. (To be fair, it’s been a while since I’ve read Simon.)Ian Goldin also wrote a balanced review for Nature:https://www.nature.com/articles/d4158..."

The material was very captivating, and the chapters in the book are well organized, allowing for natural breaks. Steven Pinker, the author, provides a rational and balanced view of the current state of humankind, how we got here, and where we're headed. He dives into vital topics directly and doesn't hold back or avoid anything. The book covers topics such as wealth, health, quality of life, society as a whole, climate change, education, and a lot more.The information shared is also backed up by real data which is quite refreshing. We're all surrounded with so much negativity from the mainstream news which can make the world seem like a terrible place to live in. And with this book, what I enjoyed was the more balanced presentation of the data without resorting to fear-mongering, which is so common these days with clickbait media.If you have any doubts, this book will open your eyes to the fact that we're all living in the best time for humankind since the beginning of our existence and things are getting better.As much as I enjoyed the optimistic viewpoint on certain topics in this book, I also like the fact that the author didn't exclude critical areas we as humans need to work on — one of those being climate change.There's very little doubt about the current situation with climate change and the urgency at which we need to operate to avoid a global disaster. The truth is, we all have to step up and do our part as this presents one of the biggest challenges for humankind yet.Overall, this book is a great read, and I highly recommend it. It covers so many important areas, and I'm glad I decided to read it. I have no doubts you'll enjoy it as much as I did."

Why did I think Bill Gates’ reading list would hold any interest for me? This book is simply further evidence that all data can be manipulated to achieve a purpose. If you include yourself among the world’s wealthiest “citizens”, this is a great read to assuage any hint of privilege-related guilt you may feel. The extremely poor are in decline, and if the bulk of humanity is now simply poor, they should be content with their plight and thank their overlords from lifting them out of the squalor. I kept reading hoping for a redeeming moment. It never happened."
168,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"In 2011 Steven Pinker wrote a magnificent book, The Better Angels of our Nature, in which he showed – by using historical analysis, statistical methods and informed estimates – how the world has gotten safer (hence the subtitle of the book: The Decline of Violence). The gist of the book was that there have been continuous social reforms that have led to an environment in which our inner demons have fewer opportunities to surface and in which zero-sum games have been turned into positive-sum games. In 2017, Pinker followed up his 2011 work by extending his scientific method to the whole scale of human progress. In Enlightenment Now he wants to show us how the world not only got safer, but also became a much more pleasant place to live in – for almost all human beings that are born. Pinker wants to show us that this progress wasn’t inevitable: it was a conscious effort of human beings to start – for the first time in history – to apply reason to the goal of making the world a better place to live. This is important, since it shows us to not be complacent and to take all the gains for granted. Pinker tries to convince us readers that the Enlightenment values that drove this progress have to be remembered by and re-stated to each new generation.The book itself is divided into three parts; I will briefly summarize each part in the rest of this review.In part 1, Pinker describes how in the Enlightenment era people started to use reason to understand the world (science) and to distinguish right from wrong (ethics). No more witch hunts; no more mythologies; no more harsh punishments; etc. According to Pinker, mankind has to fight continuously against three natural entities: (1) entropy (the increasing of disorder), (2) evolution (the competition of all against all; zero-sum games), and (3) information (increasing our knowledge). In this fight, reason is the most important, and only, tool that we have to – temporarily – create a good place to live for ourselves. Pinker sees two contemporary threats to this ideal though: religion and populism (left- and rightwing). His goal of the rest of the book is hence; first to show that real progress has taken place; and next, to convince us that this progress was driven by Enlightenment values that have to be defended. So, in part 2 of the book Pinker applies the scientific method to analyze the different domains of human progress. He uses lots of graphs and he meticulously describes all the relevant scientific findings – just like he did in his 2011 book on the decline of violence. In short, people live longer; are healthier; are economically better off, even though inequality increases; the environment is (slowly) better off and the climate change fatalism is misguided (especially in light of all the technological advances); the world is more peaceful and safer than ever, while terrorism is a minor (insignificant) blip; democracy and equal rights are strongly instituted; and knowledge is readily accessible for masses of people and ever-progressing. In the closing chapters of part 2, Pinker also states that the newer generations are much happier, healthier and experience a much higher quality of life than earlier generations. Within generations this progress is also visible. The hailed existential threats to progress – technological enslavement and nuclear war – are serious issues but there really is no reason to be scared shitless: human beings, according to Pinker, are better and better equipped to turn zero-sum games into positive-sum games (i.e. turning existential threats into cooperated effort to ward off disaster). Pinker finishes part 2 by claiming that progress, even though contingent (i.e. depending on human choices), is a self-enhancing cycle: as the world is better off each year, countries will tend to cooperate more and more and living conditions of all human beings will tend to increase. Minor setbacks, such as the Trump presidency and the Brexit referendum, cannot stop the long-term trend of ever-increasing progress.After showing us how much the world has progressed, Pinker turns his book into an essay. In part 3 he makes a case for three Enlightenment values that are, according to him, essential to actively promote and continue the progress we have already made. The first of these values is reason, which is under increasing attack by generations of postmodernists (“objective reality doesn’t exist”, “all cultures are equal”, etc.) and populists (“the will of the people should be followed”, “we need a strong leader”, etc.). Next to these two ideologies, human beings suffer from biases and hence the media portray a picture of a world that is almost continuously on the brink of World War III. Pinker, essentially, advocates a more rational public discourse, in which fact checking and statistical reasoning trump Trumpism (pun intended).The second value Pinker advocates is science. In other words: trial and error. Not just to gain more knowledge and hence receive more control over our lives (by fighting diseases, natural disasters, etc.), but also to base our policies on. Politics, according to Pinker, should be more evidence-based and less ideology-driven. This is the old argument of piecemeal social engineering promoted by Karl Popper: changing policy in small steps; measuring and evaluating the results of each step; and adjusting where necessary.Pinker notices a trend in literary and cultural circles, especially due to scientifically illiterate self-proclaimed intellectuals, to blackball science and act like science is the root of all evil. The truth is that science is a-moral – in the sense that it doesn’t say whether we should build a-bombs, nuclear reactors for energy, or both, and in which situation – and that science offers us the possibility to better our lives. It is due to science that we live longer, healthier and wealthier.The third and last value that Pinker advocates is humanism. Humanism is the answer to the problem of the a-morality of science: it tells us what to do with all the knowledge, wealth and technological possibilities. Pinker uses the ethics of one of the founders of the Enlightenment, Spinoza. According to Spinoza, any human being that is governed by reason will wish for any other human the same things as they wish for themselves. This is a strong ethical imperative, and Pinker uses the rest of the chapter to state it more fully (in short: consequentialism) and to refute the two counter-narratives: religious morals (which are, according to Pinker, humanized by humanism – with the exception of Islam) and populism/nationalism (which are inspired by the ethics of Nietzsche’s Übermensch and heroism).All of the above is my try to summarize Pinker’s thoughts as honest and representative as possible. Of course this is practically impossible: the book is huge and Pinker is much nuanced on all of the themes mentioned. But: what to think of it all?First, I applaud Pinker for stating clearly how far we have come since the 16th century: how much better off human beings are in the 21st century world. As Pinker himself repeats, it is trendy to be a cultural pessimist. All this liberalism and progress has led to atomized societies and hedonistic, empty lives. It is also very fancy to be a fatalist, especially regarding the environment and climate. Pinker's book is a healthy antidote to all this doom-thinking and the masses of studies and graphs he uses to back up his arguments make cultural pessimism and climate fatalism hard to sustain.Second, I think Pinker is right in seeing humanism, reason and science as the driving forces behind the world we live in nowadays. It is only when reason is set aside – consciously or unconsciously – that progress halts and that we fall back on our primitive nature and zero-sum value systems. I think he is also right in describing the two major threats to the world as we know it: religious morality and populism (again, left- as well as rightwing). So in all this, Enlightenment Now is a terribly accurate and timely book.But I do disagree with some of Pinker’s observations, especially the ones on happiness and quality of life. I cannot help but reflect that Enlightenment Now is written by a Harvard professor whose life is spent on creative thinking and intellectual effort to understand the world. I don’t think many of us can share this luxury, and that for many of us leading ‘normal lives’ life isn’t as fulfilling or free as we wish. Pinker’s line of argument is (albeit simplified): younger generations suffer less from addictions; commit fewer suicides; suffer less from depression; etc.; hence, they are happier than earlier generations and have a higher quality of life. I don’t know if the amount of suicides and depressions says anything (or much) about the happiness of people. And another problem with this line of thinking – which really surfaces throughout the whole book – is that it generalizes over everyone. It is entirely possible that certain parts of the population are worse off, but that this negative effect is swamped by an exponential increase of happiness by the rest of the population. For example, due to globalization, the world is better off, and the poorest people and the poorest countries are the real gainers in health and wealth; yet the (lower) middle classes and lower classes in richer countries are really worse off than earlier generations – combined with an ever-increasing decline of social mobility. The same thing goes with people in vulnerable professions or in vulnerable life situations: handicapped people, sick people, old people, etc. In all developed countries we see an ever-increasing jungle of rules and regulations, to guarantee an equal treatment for all people in like situations. This sounds beautiful and noble, but it results in health care workers clocking five minutes for washing elderly people; treating schoolchildren as revenue and future tax payers; making people who depend on social welfare end up in mazes of bureaucracy; etc. Is this truly progress? (Of course, Pinker would counter: would they be better off in the nineteenth century?)My point is that statistics are useful to describe general trends and to understand what causes play a role. When we understand what factors make the world a better place to live in, we can apply more of the same potion. Understanding is fundamental. But scientific studies of subjects like happiness - even apart from all the methodological issues involved - are rather empty when we're dealing with our own personal lives and our loved ones around us. Stating, for example, that more people are better off and that poverty declines, is a rather meaningless statement when talking to someone who just lost his or her job because his or her employer moved to a developing country. Personally, I think the diffusion of liberalism, the results of equal rights movements (including feminism), and decades of migration have led to a diminishing social cohesion in Western societies – and between countries worldwide. This is, for example, illustrated by contemporary elections: a huge assembly of small political factions and an increasingly polarized climate. It is also illustrated by the popularity of identity politics, in which individuals base their personal identity on biological and cultural traits. Western societies have degraded into collections of individuals without much common ground. Hence, all the rules and regulations to enforce equality: people don’t trust each other anymore – or at least less than before. I cannot help but remark that in Sweden there are plans to make laws to make two adults consent to have sexual intercourse - as if the intricate and complex dealings in real life can be translated and enforced by abstract laws. The same applies to the laws against islamophobia that the Canadian parliament put into practice in 2017. This is symptomatic of societies lacking social cohesion and reciprocal trust and commitment.I think Pinker is over-optimistic when it comes to a better world. He does notice an increase in global and national inequality and declining social mobility, but he doesn’t see it as serious arguments against progress. Of course, from a macro-perspective, the world is better off and this is a good thing. But people don’t like grim futures and this can become very problematic in countries in which large swathes of the population have to give up health and wealth to transfer it to developing countries – something which is inevitable if the world economy continues the way it does now. I think the safe thing to say is that Enlightenment Now is a reliably optimistic book on how the world as a whole is much better off in 2018 than in 1618. The causes of this progress are humanism, reason and science. On a grand scale, Pinker’s book is an important reminder of the possibilities of human progress – if/when we set our minds to it we can do a lot to better our lives. Yet by zooming out, Pinker steers around the (equally important) question of a declining standard of life for individuals and particular social groups and a feeling of loss of social cohesion. Yet, these last points weren’t the goal of his book, so I shouldn’t end this review on such a sour note. It’s a very interesting and readable book: read it!"
169,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1139239-michael-austin,4,"Steven Pinker is a rare creature in the academic world: a liberal who is not a leftist. As a liberal he supports things like free speech, civil rights, democratic ideals, and a strong government that ensures safety, protects the environment, and redistributes some portion of income to support education, health care, infrastructure, and the reduction of poverty. As a non-leftist, he supports things like a democratic government and a capitalist economy that, while subject to government regulation and income redistribution, still functions as a free market. Like most of Pinker’s books, Enlightenment Now is big and filled with lots of data, but actually very tightly argued. The sequence of his argument goes something like this:1.	In the eighteenth century, European intellectuals produced a movement that we call “the Enlightenment” that was built on four interrelated principles: reason, science, humanism, and progress. They set in motion revolutions in government, science, and culture that has shaped the world ever since. 2.	The Enlightenment worked. Over the last two and a half centuries, nearly every measure of human flourishing has increased dramatically across the world. People alive today are better educated, healthier, richer, and safer than they have ever been at any time in history. Major diseases have been wiped out by vaccination, extreme poverty has been substantially reduced by global markets, and war and violence have decreased to their lowest levels in world history.3.	Since its beginning, the Enlightenment has had to contend with “counter-Enlightenment” narratives from both the left and the right. Counter-Enlightenment narratives are those that portray the world as getting worse, either because people are falling away from religious belief and values (the conservative counter-narrative), or because capitalism has enervated the world for its own profit and turned 99% of people into labor machines that feed its insatiable greed (the leftist counter-narrative). 4.	The work of the Enlightenment is not finished. There is still poverty, war, and injustice. There are still threats to safety and to the environment. We still have many, many problems to solve. But these problems are best solved by using the tools of the Enlightenment (reason, science, and humanism) rather than by reverting to counter-Enlightenment narratives such as religious fundamentalism or Marxism to address them. As one who is, like Pinker, a liberal but not a leftist, I find myself agreeing with almost everything in this over-arching argument. Sure I have specific quibbles with all kinds of stuff. Pinker is not content to show that most things are a little bit better. He wants to be more comprehensive than that and show that everything is a lot better. And in the process, he often stretches his argument beyond what can be reasonably proved. But even adjusting for some hyperbole, the data he presents is overwhelmingly persuasive—not just that life has gotten better in the world since the 18th century, but that it has improved dramatically in just the last 30 years. During this time, extreme poverty has fallen from 50% of the world to 10%, the number of people killed in wars has fallen by 200%, criminal violence has decreased dramatically, cars are safer, more countries are democratic, and income inequality has decreased in all but the most developed nations. It seems to me that there is no reasonable way to refute the proposition that the world today is more amenable to human flourishing than it has ever been.But there are a whole lot of unreasonable ways to refute this, and this, really, is the most important part of the book. Pinker identifies two key cognitive biases that causes many people to reject the Enlightenment narrative that the world is getting better and embrace one of several counter-Enlightenment narratives that insist that the world is getting worse.The first of these biases is the “availability heuristic.” We have a lot more access to information than we have ever had before, so we see more of the bad stuff than anybody ever has. Our Internet and social media feeds immediately show us acts of racism, police brutality, mass violence, civil strife, and even genocide. We see these with much greater frequency, and when we do, our minds tell us that they are happening with greater frequency, which is generally not the case. But don’t try to tell us that, because we probably won’t believe it.The more troubling factor in our tendency to see a world in decline is the confirmation bias, which simply means that we tend to see what confirms our beliefs and ignore what does not. And we are attracted to narratives of decline because they fit with so many ready-made world views. They are, in fact, an indispensable part of contemporary politics.“We are doing well, but we need to do better” is not a good political message. “We are in decline and need to make America great again” is. And herein lies the fundamental attraction to narratives that cannot be supported by reason or data. We want to believe that things are getting worse, because this is the best way to accomplish political and religious goals. These narratives create fear, and fear motivates us to vote, to donate to politicians, to attend Church, to donate to Churches, and to agitate for change. We can do this through reason and science, of course, but it doesn’t work as well. And this is probably Pinker’s most important point: we are in danger of losing much of the progress that we have made as a nation, and as a world, by rejecting the principles responsible for that progress and embracing narratives that emphasize tribalism, magical thinking, resentment, and unwarranted fear. In the United States, we are rolling back the government regulations that have kept us safe and improved our environment, and we currently have an administration that insists that global relations are a zero-sum game. Globally, people are rejecting the vaccines that wiped out diseases and attacking the advances in food technology that have dramatically reduced hunger and poverty. Countries that once embraced secularism and democracy are starting to turn to religious fundamentalism. We are abandoning things that work in favor of things that won’t. And this is very dangerous. It is possible to argue with almost everything that Pinker says in Enlightenment Now. But those arguments must also adopt Enlightenment principles: showing where his reason fails, providing better evidence, rejecting conclusions that he makes because they are not adequately supported. This kind of debate is necessary and proper.Unfortunately, this is not the debate that we are having. Across the political spectrum, the Enlightenment ideals that Pinker champions are being refuted from fundamentally illiberal and unenlightened positions with a strong interest in making the world seem like a fetid hell hole that is only a moment away from the apocalypse. These arguments are dangerous because they appeal to the kind of thinking that caused most of our problems in the first place."
170,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,5,"There is no one alive who writes with the mind-sweeping clarity and breadth of knowledge that Steven Pinker possesses. Though there are other works of his that are perhaps more revolutionary (The Blank Slate) or ambitious in their singular explanatory power (How the Mind Works), it is this latest volume of his that is his most timely and all-encompassing cerebral broom.If the idea of needing to defend Enlightenment values is mysterious to you at this point then I can only pity you your global-scale ignorance or apathy. In Pinker, that cause of defense has found its most able champion. Offering an incredible array of 75 statistical graphs that are properly contextualized and interpreted, he has produced such an incredibly coherent and well-argued line of thinking that has enough independent and objective fact to annoy partisans of both sides of the political/philosophical spectrum. Much of the work seems to follow-up on several of the arguments brought forth in his previous volume, ""The Better Angels of Our Nature."" Following a deft summary as to what Enlightenment ideals and practices are, Pinker proceeds to show just how they have benefited society and the world as a whole ever since, where they have come up short, and recommends several new usages of these ideas for future mutual benefit. Along the way he casts off so many misconceptions and anecdotal ""arguments"" against the Enlightenment, something long overdue in writings by contemporary intellectuals who - alarmingly and genuinely stupidly - have distanced themselves from these values. This is not done with flippant casuistry or mere rhetorical prolepsis but with relentless data and cogent, in-depth examination. Some telling and amusing samples from the work include:""If you extol reason, then what matters is the integrity of the thoughts, not the personalities of the thinkers.""""While a vision of world peace may have given John and Yoko some good songs, it is hopelessly naïve in the real world.""""However long it takes, we must not let the existence of cognitive and emotional biases or the spasms of irrationality in the political arena discourage us from the Enlightenment ideal of relentlessly pursuing reason and truth.""This is the book of the year, no question. No one has this diverse array of knowledge, no one marshals their facts better, and no one does so with the ease of language that Dr. Pinker presents across a work of 500+ pages. In closing I will let him sum up one of the major points of this monumental achievement: ""Remember your math: an anecdote is not a trend. Remember your history: the fact that something is bad today doesn't mean it was better in the past. Remember your philosophy: one cannot reason that there's no such thing as reason, or that something is true or good because God said it is. And remember your psychology: much of what we know isn't so, especially when our comrades know it too."""
171,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58890815-andrii-zakharov,5,"There are a lot of bad reviews of Steven Pinker's new book out there, mostly arguing against some of his particular points taken out of context, putting words in his mouth, falsely attributing some agenda to him, or simply twisting his words. But reading the book attentively, one can't help but notice how much thought went into Pinker's formulations, and how careful he is with what he is saying and showing. The one detailed review I can recommend which appreciates the precision and is not politically loaded is Scott Aaronson's: https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p....Here, I will only give my brief impression. First, I must admit that I found some chapters in the book stronger than others. This is to be expected of a work that attempts to cover the whole span of the human condition across history, and do so in an exclusively data-driven, empirical way. For some developments, there is just not enough good data available, and so some of the conjectures and estimates will necessarily be better supported than others. That said, taken as a whole, Enlightenment Now is an exceptional piece of popular scholarship, providing a most enjoyable review of all the relevant aspects of human life. Page after page, figure after figure, relentlessly hammering home the crucial point way too many of us are unaware of: the world and our lives in it are continually getting better, along almost every conceivable dimension. One could argue at length about the data in each and every chapter. One could rightly point out that some of it is one-sided, that his historical accounts are incomplete and some of the conclusions premature. But the sheer weight of evidence makes it impossible to deny the central points:* life has been, and is, getting better for ever more people in ever more places* it is happening as we create new knowledge and use it to gradually solve problems* problems are inevitable, new ones will always arise, but problems are also solvable, given the right knowledge* the best system we have to create new knowledge is science* continuing to gradually improve our institutions will continue to bring incremental progress* we are facing many dangers, some of them existential, which call for unprecedented global cooperation and knowledge production to overcome* the ideas outlined above are, sadly, time and again attacked by hostile ideologies from all sides of the political spectrum, and have to be defended if we are to continue our progress.These points were made very persuasively in the course of the book, and appear to me of paramount importance. Reading Enlightenment Now significantly shifted my worldview towards conditional future optimism, motivating to work very hard to sustain our amazing progress so far."
172,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"Pinker builds on his previous book The Better Angels of Our Nature to make a strong case for enlightenment values.His writing is excellent and always an absolute joy to read.He puts apparent contemporary reversals of progress in perspective. He defends humanism. He pulls no punches discussing religion. He weighs in on economics as key to those Better Angels. He wipes the floor with Friedrich Nietzsche and his intellectual heritage in fascism, Nazism, etc. He backs up everything with scientific evidence. Even if sometimes the interpretation comes off a bit forced, he's still working on solid ground throughout the book."
173,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,5,"Steven Pinker was one of the first writers to kindle my passion for scientific thinking. When I read 
The Blank Slate
 in 2011, it exposed me to a host of intellectual disciplines that my undergraduate training in philosophy had neglected––most notably evolutionary psychology, skepticism, and the empirical foundations of human nature. Nearly a decade later, I am thrilled not only to have another opportunity to journey through Pinker’s impressive mind, but also that his chosen message is rooted in data-driven, responsible optimism. Given the psychological and political difficulties of 2017, I was on the verge of thinking that such optimism was nothing more than shrugging in the face of inevitable doom. But Enlightenment Now turned my frown upside down, made me feel good about being human again, and restored much of my belief that humanity still has a bright future (or many possible bright futures) ahead.If I could rename this book without worrying about marketing, my chosen title would be: Everybody Calm the Fuck Down: The Case for Sanity, by Steven Pinker. At a moment in global and American history when many citizens feel like the sky is continually falling, Enlightenment Now provides a hard-nosed critique of our tendency to indulge our inner Chicken Littles. Instead of taking the in vogue route of mining for new reasons why human civilization is inherently dishonorable and teetering on the brink of destruction, Pinker argues the exact opposite. To make his case, Pinker demonstrates that the Enlightenment, the great intellectual movement that precipitated the rise of modernity, has been a rollicking success:""This book is my attempt to restate the ideals of the Enlightenment in the language and concepts of the 21st century. I will first lay out a framework for understanding the human condition informed by modern science––who we are, where we came from, what our challenges are, and how we can meet them. The bulk of the book is devoted to defending those ideals in a distinctively 21st-century way: with data. This evidence-based take on the Enlightenment project reveals that it was not a naïve hope. The Enlightenment has worked––perhaps the greatest story seldom told. And because this triumph is so unsung, the underlying ideals of reason, science, and humanism are unappreciated as well. Far from being an insipid consensus, these ideals are treated by today’s intellectuals with indifference, skepticism, and sometimes contempt. When properly appreciated, I will suggest, the ideals of the Enlightenment are in fact stirring, inspiring, noble––a reason to live."" (5-6, emphasis his)This passage reveals both the considerable strengths and non-negligible weaknesses of Pinker’s position. Since I agree with Pinker’s outlook and think this book represents a hugely valuable contribution to the modern moment, I’ll deal with the chinks in his armor first and follow with praise. First, Pinker’s characterization of the Enlightenment’s success as “the greatest story seldom told” is an overstatement. I’d like to say it’s an overstatement that isn’t repeated in the rest of the text, but that wouldn’t be an honest appraisal. It’s my feeling that the Enlightenment-rejecting “intellectuals” in Pinker’s crosshairs––frustrating and myopic as they may be––do not represent a majority opinion in America or anywhere else. In fact, as Pinker points out, they do not even represent a majority of intellectuals:""During the 20th century, the landscape of human knowledge was carved into professionalized duchies, and the growth of science (particularly the sciences of human nature) is often seen as an encroachment on territories that had been staked and enclosed by the academic humanities. It’s not that practitioners of the humanities themselves have this zero-sum mindset. Most artists show no signs of it…Nor is the anxiety expressed by the scholars who delve into the historical epochs, genres of art, systems of ideas, and other subject matter in the humanities, since a true scholar is receptive to ideas regardless of their origin. The defensive pugnacity belongs to a culture: Snow’s Second Culture of literary intellectuals, cultural critics, and erudite essayists."" (389-90, emphasis his)This Second Culture is Pinker’s true enemy, and while he does a good job of calling them out directly in the latter chapters, some of his earlier assertions belie the genuine nuances that bolster the rest of the text. For example, the opening sentences of a chapter called “Progressophobia” read thus: “Intellectuals hate progress. Intellectuals who call themselves progressive really hate progress” (39, emphasis his). Such sweeping statements needlessly open a path for critics to characterize Pinker as nothing more than a Panglossian apologist for modernity; sadly, this path will be well-trodden given how Pinker has been villainized by the Second Culture and its acolytes (this review  is a good example). Here we find the downside of Pinker’s iconoclastic nature, which is not only the source of his intellectual vitality and undeniable wit, but also his most significant vulnerability.My other worry about this book is that, despite Pinker’s repeated claims that the Enlightenment’s success is not a justification for complacency in the face of extant problems, it may nevertheless end up playing that role in cultural and political discussions, as well as in the hearts and minds of readers. Over and over, Enlightenment Now caused me to take a deep breath and remind myself that things aren’t so bad, which is terrific for my personal health and state of mind, but probably not the best way to get me into the proverbial trenches solving humanity’s most difficult challenges. Of course, one of Pinker’s central claims is that the best way to fight those battles is to eschew unnecessary excitation in favor of calm calculation and reasoned negotiation. But I still worry that readers like myself––privileged first-worlders for whom modernity is working just fine––may utilize this perspective to thicken our own socioeconomic and ideological bubbles instead of heeding Pinker’s call to action. The lesson here is that Enlightenment Now represents just one important perspective amongst others, and should not be treated as a comprehensive guide to the world’s present state. In other words, it’s like any other intellectual endeavor.Okay, now for the fun stuff! As ever, Pinker has crafted a book that is engaging, cleanly written, and packed with dense and fascinating thoughts. Since this is a book about progress, we should start with Pinker’s chosen definition:""What is progress? You might think that the question is so subjective and culturally relative as to be forever unanswerable. In fact, it’s one of the easier questions to answer. Most people agree that life is better than death. Abundance is better than poverty. Peace is better than war. Safety is better than danger. Freedom is better than tyranny. Equal rights are better than bigotry and discrimination. Literacy is better than illiteracy. Knowledge is better than ignorance. Intelligence is better than dull-wittedness. Happiness is better than misery. Opportunities to enjoy family, friends, culture, and nature are better than drudgery and monotony. All these things can be measured. If they have increased over time, that is progress."" (51)Pinker is not posturing when he claims that these indicators of progress can be measured. His commitment to empiricism runs much deeper than that of most public intellectuals, as evidenced by the 70+ graphs/charts and 100 pages of notes/references that accompany his superb argumentation. While he is well aware that data generation is a flawed human process (404), the raw power of evidentiary convergence becomes increasingly undeniable as Pinker’s explication of progress unfolds over about 300 pages.In my view, Pinker’s most important insight about progress is this: “It’s in the nature of progress that it erases its tracks, and its champions fixate on the remaining injustices and forget how far we have come” (215). This dynamic can make progress very difficult to identify and acknowledge, since even a world that is improving will always create new obstacles during the process of rendering old ones obsolete: “Progress cannot be monotonic because solutions to problems always create new problems. But progress can resume when the new problems are solved in their turn” (44). While it may seem simplistic to some readers, I think Pinker’s characterization of the world’s difficulties as mere problems to be solved is a critical and often-elided truth that we need to rediscover. In a cultural milieu where doubling down on embattled ideological positions and demonizing one’s opponents is routine, it becomes heroic to refocus one’s attention and energy on discovering the empirical nature of a problem and following the road to solutions wherever it may lead.Of the seventeen topics Pinker addresses in his discussion of progress, the one that most pleased me was his chapter on the environment. This is a topic that many big thinkers still neglect, even though climate change is perhaps the most ominous long-term threat to the continuance of human progress. Pinker takes up the climate problem with distinctive poise, showing how sentimental, anti-industrial positions on the political left and denialist positions on the right have both failed to provide a viable platform for global climate action. He advocates for “Ecomodernism,” a nascent field of study founded on three tenets: (1) some degree of pollution is unavoidable due to the entropic nature of the universe, (2) industrialization has generally been good for humanity, and (3) technology is the primary tool we should use to mitigate environmental damage without relinquishing the myriad benefits of modern life (123-4).While Second Culturists will surely write Pinker off as an obsequious technocrat beguiled by the corrupt comforts of elite capitalist culture, a sober assessment of Ecomodernism reveals it as the most reasonable and realizable approach for dealing with climate change. Pinker advocates for a combination of solutions, including decarbonization, alternative energies, dematerialization, and nuclear power––no silver bullets here. His recommendations, especially on the nuclear issue, pay no heed to the entrenched ideological positions of climate warriors or denialists, but rather follow the evidence wherever it leads. Climate change is serious and daunting, but panicking and using it as an excuse to upend the economic and institutional foundations of progress is foolish. This message is starkest in Pinker’s takedown of Naomi Klein’s position that the only way to address climate change is to raze contemporary capitalism and rebuild it with a much heavier emphasis on centrally-planned economies. His critique was especially salutary for me, given that I was completely seduced by Klein’s point of view when I read This Changes Everything back in 2014. I love an opportunity to update my opinions and reflect on the informational and perspectival limitations of my past selves.Instead of succumbing to the idea that humanity must repent for the great sin of modernity, Pinker instead demonstrates that we can approach this daunting challenge with a rational maturity:""It’s time to retire the morality play in which modern humans are a vile race of despoilers and plunderers who will hasten the apocalypse unless they undo the Industrial Revolution, renounce technology, and return to an ascetic harmony with nature. Instead, we can treat environmental protection as a problem to be solved: how can people live safe, comfortable, and stimulating lives with the least possible pollution and loss of natural habitats?"" (134)As it has always been, the solution is to press forward using the human wellsprings of creativity and innovation; it does no good to nostalgically pine for previous eras when life for average folks and even most elites was much worse than today.Also laudable is Pinker’s defense of rationality, which is endangered by political partisanship and religious/magical thinking. Pinker’s rejection of political partisanship, which he likens to sports fandom, is particularly valuable (359-60). He lays out a battery of research showing how ideologues bend over backwards to deny their opponents the benefit of the doubt, then ties it off with a much-needed reminder that progress is not owned by any individual or group, but is rather the collective result of countless actions and shifts over time that can come from even the most unlikely places:""It should not be surprising that the facts of human progress confound the major -isms. The ideologies are more than two centuries old and are based on mile-high visions such as whether humans are tragically flawed or infinitely malleable, and whether society is an organic whole or a collection of individuals. A real society comprises hundreds of millions of social beings, each with a trillion-synapse brain, who pursue their well-being while affecting the well-being of others in complex networks with massive positive and negative externalities, many of them historically unprecedented. It is bound to defy any simple narrative of what will happen under a given set of rules. A more rational approach is to treat societies as ongoing experiments and open-mindedly learn the best practices, whichever part of the spectrum they come from."" (365)All of us are inescapably embedded in Pinker’s “real society,” and our ability to intelligently acknowledge and navigate this messy reality can stave off madness and keep progress coming.Enlightenment Now closes with Pinker’s celebration of humanism––a strong message that rehabilitated my humanist loyalties, which took a hit when I read Yuval Noah Harari’s 
Homo Deus
 last year. I still wonder how humanism will stay relevant as we evolve into new transhuman and posthuman forms, but I’ve no doubt that Pinker’s perspective is the right one for the here and now:""The first step toward wisdom is the realization that the laws of the universe don’t care about you. The next is the realization that this does not imply that life is meaningless, because people care about you, and vice versa. You care about yourself, and you have a responsibility to respect the laws of the universe that keep you alive, so don’t squander your existence. Your loved ones care about you, and you have a responsibility not to orphan your children, widow your spouse, and shatter your parents. And anyone with a humanistic sensibility cares about you, not in the sense of feeling your pain––human empathy is too feeble to spread itself across billions of strangers––but in the sense of realizing that your existence is cosmically no less important than theirs, and that we all have a responsibility to use the laws of the universe to enhance the conditions in which we all can flourish.""

176,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3055905-nils,1,"Dr Pangloss lives! I’m unconvinced that the various Enlightenments (there actually were several distinct Enlightenments, though Pinker seems unaware of this), much as I love them, can really be credited for the huge increase in human material well-being that has taken place over the last couple of centuries. This turns out not to be a trivial critique, since Pinker’s argument that the Enlightenment is what “caused” the material improvement drives his conclusion that the main threat to sustaining that improvement comes from those who he alleges are undermining the Enlightenment, e.g. the so-called postmodernists. This in turn leads to Pinker’s bizarre suggestion that the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche represent a greater threat to our sustained material well-being than, say, Exxon-Mobil and the Koch brothers. Judge for yourself whether you find that plausible.In fact, the real underpinning the material gains of the last two centuries have been more institutional than ideational. This in turn implies that we must scrutinize the solidity of our institutional matrix if we want a real purchase of the sustainability of these gains. First, there have been numerous civilizations achieving marked improvement in the welfare and well-being of their populations – at least their upper classes. The Maya, the Romans, and several dynastic episodes of the Chinese achieved such gains. Of course, the gains that industrial modernity has achieved over the last quarter millennium outstrips all previous improvements. But taking the longer view, the gains of modernity are perhaps less impressive than they seem. Almost all those gains have taken place in the last quarter millennium, and 250 years, after all, isn’t that long of a run for a civilization. Other historical civilizations have sustained their gains for much longer. The Roman Empire’s eastern branch basked in cultural glory for a thousand years. And even though it’s usually meant pejoratively, it’s no coincidence that the word “byzantine” is a synonym for institutional complexity.Second, there are reasons to suspect that modernity’s run of material amelioration may be drawing to a close—and may even go into reverse. Broadly speaking these reasons can be divided in two. The first concern biophysical limits to growth. These are enduring arguments that the Breakthrough Institute has done much to illuminate and clarify, so suffice to say that, as a long term proposition, Malthus hasn’t yet been proven wrong, and climate change presents challenges of unprecedented scale that will only be addressed if there is sufficient collective political will to overcome collective action and free riding challenges. It’s at best unclear whether we have the global social capital to do so. Put another way: we live in an era of wicked problems.My own skepticism about whether humanity can overcome these challenges brings me to my fundamental critique of Pinker’s optimism: not only the sustainability of the gains of the last quarter millennium, but also the extensibility of these to larger sections of humanity, as well as the ability to address the growing headwinds posed by anthropogenic climate change depend crucially on a massive strengthening of our global institutional and governance infrastructure. From this perspective, all the indicators are sharply negative over the last fifty and especially the last ten years.For nearly fifty years, Gallup has run a series of polls asking Americans about their confidence in various institutions – universities, the media, business, political institutions, and so forth. While the data are noisy, the overall trendline is inexorably downwards. The decline in confidence is partly the result of sustained anti-institutional propaganda, which exists in both leftwing and rightwing versions. But as I have argued elsewhere, I believe the root cause of this declining trust is the objectively poor institutional performance and a lack of elite accountability. A general feature of late modernity is a declining faith in social authority of all sorts, as ever more individuated and autonomous polities become ever less willing to entrust political agents to do anything. The advent of Donald Trump is merely a symptom of both the failure and the rejection of institutions in the United States.Nor is this just an American phenomenon. The rise of populism across Europe likewise reflects distrust of institutions. The Brexit vote two years ago of course represented a direct rebuke to transnational institutions. More recently, the triumph in the Italian elections of the Five Start Movement, whose calling card was a rejection of political party infrastructure, signaled nothing if not a rejection of institutions. (It remains unclear whether the Movement can manage even a small city, let alone Italy as a whole.)With the United States in the grip of Trumpism and the European Union caught between shambolic national politics and collective dissolution, the primary hope for global leadership seems to be falling by default to the Chinese. Some people have argued that China is filling the institutional gap left by a receding Europe and the United States. Eric X. Li, for example, recently argued that Xi Jinping’s merging of Chinese state and party infrastructure makes sense given that “the party has developed into the most competent national political institution in the world today.” What this bold claim tacitly conceded is that, despite the huge successes the Chinese state has had in poverty reduction over the last 40 years, China’s existing institutions are inadequate to managing the bumpy course corrections that lie ahead if it is to sustain its gains.Even more worrying than the declining performance of global and national political institutions are the faltering institutional underpinnings of sustained technological innovation – innovation which everyone, optimists and pessimists alike, agrees is essential to any adequate plan for addressing the challenges posed by climate change. As Mariana Mazzucato has shown, state support for innovation and entrepreneurship has in fact been at the root of almost all major technological breakthroughs of the last 75 years. Specifically, much of this support has taken place through trillions of dollars of state funding for research universities. But universities today are under unprecedented assault. Variously accused of being hotbeds of leftist indoctrination, engines of neoliberal reproduction, or simply wastes of money, no one trusts universities anymore. (This is the real place where the “postmodernists” have something to answer for: they have both been a primary vector of critique of universities, in effect sawing at the branch they sit on, while at the same time provoking hysteria about the supposed insanity of the humanities, of which Pinker’s book is a characteristic example.) While it seems inconceivable that the United States in particular would flush away the linchpin of its technological, industrial, and soft power success, the cultural assault on universities today is unparalleled. Non-coincidentally, universities also face a funding crisis of unprecedented proportions, one that is hitting humanities departments first but which the STEM fields are unlikely to escape. All this threatens to cut the legs out from under the innovation engine that is critical to any effort to escape the grim climate reaper."
177,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna,4,"This is nonfiction and it covers a giant host of various topics, including politics, racism, war, etc. For as long as this audiobook was, I was never bored. The author moved effortlessly and quickly from topic to topic to topic. That style worked here. So the 4 stars is for the entertainment value that I was able to place on this. Now with all that said, it usually bothers me when the author slants all the info to fit his views and then completely glosses over other things that might deflate his defense. While this author did that (abundantly), I didn't find it offensive or annoying. He had some well placed humor to soften that reaction. "
178,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68472482-daniel,5,"This is the best book I have ever read which is something I’m not saying lightly. It makes you so optimistic about the state of human progress and it makes you truly appreciate how much progress we have made over the past couple of centuries. It is really mind-blowing. If you weren’t already, it will also make you very optimistic about the likeliness of this progress continuing in the future with the help of, among other things, technology and today’s widely available information resources.Pinker goes through a wide range of subjects from Life expectancy, Peace and Safety to Equal rights, Knowledge, Quality of life and Happiness. He backs it up with rigorous research and clearly shows how almost every relevant parameter is going in the right direction. The only two areas that as of now haven't shown clear-as-day improvements over time are Terrorism and Global warming. (Another area, which Pinker didn’t include in the book, that could be considered a blip in the otherwise steady drumbeat of progress, are the recent reports of increasing death rates among middle-aged Americans over the past decade.) Focusing on the bigger picture analysis that Pinker provides all throughout the book rather than the daily news and shorter-term trends, you get the true picture of how well humanity is doing.One fascinating example of this is what Pinker calls the consumer surplus. Think about the washing machine. It saves us 10h per week compared to 1920 and costs a few hundred dollars. Now, if you think about how much someone would have to pay you for you to give up your washing machine, the number is clearly not in the hundreds of dollars anymore. Many people in developed nations would say that there is no price that would make them give it up. So not only are we richer but many of the utilities (and other things) that we use everyday can be bought for almost nothing compared to their actual value to us. This wasn't true 50 and 100 years ago. Another example is that today the average American worker retires at 62. Hundred years ago the average American worker died at 51.Pinker thinks (and I agree) that the media is responsible for a large part of today’s unfounded, but in many parts of the Western world, prevailing pessimism. As he puts it “When voters are inches away from the news, optimism can seem naive.” He points out that if newspapers would have elected to report more good news, they could have run the headline ""Number of people in extreme poverty fell by 137,000 since yesterday"" every day for the past 25 years.The book is structured in such a way that you can easily read only one chapter that you find interesting and skip the rest. There is for example a very good chapter on the environment and climate change if you want to read up on that. I do think Pinker misses some of the big potential risks in his discussion on AI, for example advanced AI systems in the wrong hands. And I think you can safely skim through the final three chapters without missing too much of an otherwise wonderful book.As a side note, the reason I decided to read this book was Bill Gates' glowing review of it some time ago. As you can see, I wasn’t disappointed. In his review, Bill said that he read the book very slowly because he loved it so much, but that he thought “most people will find it a quick and accessible read.” Perhaps he wrote the review in the ensuing euphoria after having just finished the book because I can assure you of one thing: this book is a lot of things, an easy read for most people it is not (it’s all relative I guess). But it is enormously fun reading and often highly enlightening so it's well worth your time. A big thank you to Pinker for putting things in the right perspective and allowing readers to see the bigger picture so clearly."
179,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21797839-rafael,5,"Ok, it took me a while to finish this one not because something is wrong with it but because the amount of facts and info it has on it, its a beautiful tesis on the world today facts about economy, politics, religion and social behavior, humanism is the sole purpose of this book and explains it with brilliant research, this a not an easy book but is a wonderful explanation on how science works and how research and enlightenment could and is guiding our future, we still a long way to go but if we keep preaching facts, science and critical thinking then out future will be bright, people just has to let go of religion and superstition, get educated, preach science, i really loved this book but is not an easy read, i'd say is must read for everyone."
180,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"In many ways, reading this book was similar to reading Pinker's book ""Better Angels of our Nature."" The theory of the book was straight-forward, the evidence was well-organized, and the insights from the data were presented clearly. The first drawback to reading this book is that it covers a lot of the same ground as ""Better Angels of our Nature."" The second drawback to this book is that...well, even if the conclusions of this book aren't common sense, to people who are roughly familiar with enlightenment ideals and are fairly well-read on current affairs, it sort of is common sense. That's a nice way of saying that there are few ideas in this book that will leave you awe-struck. That's not to see that Pinker isn't capable of writing such a book. I found ""The Blank Slate"" to be just such a book. That book remains one of my favorite books to this day. That is also the book I point to when I want to convince people what a great thinker Pinker is. Pinker's argument is straightforward and comes in the preface: ""I will present a different understanding of the world, grounded in fact and inspired by the ideals of the Enlightenment: reason, science, humanism, and progress. Enlightenment ideals, I hope to show, are timeless, but they have never been more relevant than they are right now."" (page 12). If Enlightenment ideas are timeless, then why do they need a defense? Pinker's answer: ""The ideals of the Enlightenment are products of human reason, but they always struggle with other strands of human nature: loyalty to tribe, deference to authority, magical thinking, the blaming of misfortune on evildoers"" (page 18). In many ways, ""Enlightenment Now"" is similar to ""Factfullness"" in its use of quantitative data to make the case that life is indeed getting better. Pinker's earlier book ""Better Angels of our Nature"" was also a book that relied heavily on quantitative data. However, by my recollection, that book did a better job of reflecting on how the numbers were arrived at. I think numeracy is an important skill, and too often it is easy to be wowed by numbers without realizing how they are produced and the difficulty of getting reliable numbers in certain contexts -- for example, the distant past and developing countries. My recollection of ""Better Angels"" is a few years removed, but I seem to remember Pinker doing a better job with educating readers on how numbers were arrived at. Having said that, I do think the graphs are presented in a useful and simple way. Often, the data comes in the form of time series line charts. I think the repeated use of these kinds of statistics is great for more casual readers who need to be convinced. Another drawback to this book is that it tends to ignore and short-change the possibility of cataclysmic blowups. The discussion of the disruptive power of AI is discussed briefly, but pales in seriousness to Yuval Harari's analysis in ""21 Lessons for the 21st Century."" The benefits of enlightenment are discussed abundantly, but Frankenstein monsters like mortgage-backed securities are barely mentioned. In addition, one of the most important trends of the 21st century, the explosion of debt is barely discussed. The looming debt crisis (or, I should say crises since we are talking about various kinds of debts, government, municipal, shadow banking, and private) as well as other potential crises with systemic implications -- climate change, the growing use of social media, the introduction of disruptive technologies -- are under-discussed in this book. And because these systemic crises are under-discussed, Pinker fails to deal with the mother of all questions about modernity. Does modernity increase the risk of catastrophic blow-ups? Since nuclear war, climate change, and contagious financial panics are the product in one way or another of modernity, science, and globalization, is there a likelihood that more potentially catastrophic phenomena could be birthed from them? And, if so, what can we do to prevent potential catastrophic blow-ups from occurring? Another way to think about the question is this way: In what ways is modern progress like a financial bubble? For me, a high point of the book was its discussion of tribal epistemology. I have read short articles on tribal thinking, but the review of the literature here was excellent. And for those who are searching for literature that discusses this topic, the book can make for an effective gateway. This was written in the Guardian about this book: ""More pertinently, the failed 2016 campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Remain demonstrated that, in the eyes of many people, “progress” simply meant more of the same. When people feel trapped and patronised by progress, then any alternative – even regress – will feel like freedom. Informing them that the policies of the past 40 years are still the best available starts to sound hopeless."" (Full review here: https://www.theguardian.com/books/201...)Perhaps that's another way of saying that technocratic modernity (complete with its wonky charts) can feel emotionally ungratifying. Instead of gradual improvements and progress by a thousand nudges, there is a part of the soul that yearns for liberation, heroism, and love. People like stories with heroes and villains. Enlightenment often sees the world in terms of mechanical and quasi-mechanical cause and effect relationships. Heroism seems less like heroism when it requires design and system-thinking rather than great sacrifices. Nassim Taleb, another writer whose work I admire, steeps his writing in decidedly non-modern ideas and sentiments -- his thinking perhaps is best described as classical and romantic. I believe anyone who reads this book ought to put it in conversation with some of Taleb's writing (one or two books is enough). I'm sure each of the authors would hate to hear it, but I'll say it anyway -- they are better read together than separately. The unabashed modernist/enlightenment thinker is better with a classical/romantic counterpart and vice versa. I will repeat this: People who are only familiar with Pinker for ""Better Angels"" and ""Enlightenment Now"" ought to read his earlier work ""Blank Slate."" That book, more than his more recent works, demonstrates that he is a true thinker and not simply a chart-jockey or dataphile. Overall, even if you do not need to be convinced of the merit of enlightenment ideas and ideals, this is a wonderful book to read. "
181,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,4,"If you're looking for a cure for the common pessimism, you might do much, much worse than to pick up this book. I've read or seen many other examples of the facts portrayed here, but Steven Pinker does a very admirable job of showing us, exactly, how much better the world is now compared to the one we had even a hundred years ago. It's not just time-saving devices or some outright reversals of ecological damage, but how lifespans, general IQ, overall poverty level, and even WAR has improved for the better for all. Not that war is ever really all that great, mind you, but few nations jump into it with quite as little reason or abandon as they used to.Pinker isn't saying that everything is peachy, of course, but the trend toward real positive progress is undeniable. This is, despite setbacks. And yes, we have many. But for every problem that exists, he makes a very good point that we have it in us to FIX our problems. It's not out of the question.Global Warming, for example, not only has possible temporary and minor fixes available, such as applying a metaphorical sunscreen to the atmosphere, but we have the means to do much more than cut our carbon footprint down to the bone. We have a history of moving on to different methods whenever resources of one type or another run out, too. Health and education are at an all-time high. What we don't have is our optimism. In fact, we have a very solid outlook that things are worse than ever. Terrorists are few in number and never accomplish their stated goals. They merely rouse the combined might of all the powers to quash them. Most of the first world countries have made a point of living by equality in the sexes and the trend is more of the same across the world. LGBT is already accepted on the same scale. Pinker attributes all our actual progress to the Enlightenment. The old standard of 19th-century thinking, where humanism reigns supreme. Look. I freely admit to being a humanist, myself. I LOVE the idea that we all should get along. That every life is valuable. That we should have a high fundamental basis for living for every man, woman, and child alive. It's so pervasive an idea that practically everyone shares it. It's like... OBVIOUS, right? And as far as I know, Steven Pinker is right. But he also makes a very cogent point about the need to be rational, to use science for what it is intended. Inquiry, truth-seeking. No matter what the result, the truth is much more important than any ideology. He uses this to encourage each and every one of us to see past the doomsayers and the demagogs. Again, I totally agree. Skepticism is not the same thing as pessimism. Almost everyone I know is a fundamentally decent person and we all want the same fundamental things.So why didn't I give this book a full five stars?Because he gives all the credit to humanism. Wishing does not make it so. He might be right, but let's face it: this might be what he, himself warned us about. Selection Bias.Even so, I love thinking about it and I totally recommend this book for anyone who is sick and tired of the news and wants someone with a lot of facts and good reasoning to pick them up off the ground, dust their shoulders, and tell them that we are, on the whole, doing pretty damn well for ourselves. You know, despite the actual problems. But then, we DO have it in ourselves to FIX THEM. :)"
182,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51602586-dominika,2,"I did not like this book.I would say that this book was middling for the majority of it. The idea of the book is that progress has already happened, and we shouldn't be as doom and gloom as we are. But for a man who emphasizes the use of data and critical thinking, he doesn't really read said data that well and some of his arguments are riddled with gaping holes. This was a book that was read at our book club (but I was the only person at that book club who read the book in its entirety) and one of the points was that you need to show that progress has been made in order to do more progress. I have mixed feelings: I feel as though that erases the issues that people are actually facing by trying to point out that ""oh but you won't die in the woods from an infection"". While it is nice that countries that were in extreme poverty 50 years ago are being lifted to the middle class, it won't matter to the person who is working 3 jobs at minimum wage so that they can support a family. We have a lot of great innovations in healthcare, but it doesn't matter when a person cannot take an ambulance because it will cost them $600. Some of the progress sections have rather weak arguments as well. The environment one was basically him saying that the system will fix itself (in terms of a capitalist system supporting renewable energy) and that we'll totally invent carbon capture technology. The happiness one also bugged me, because the data is just not consistent. But the section that really got my blood boiling was Science. First off, he tries putting his deregulation mindset against IRBs and says a really fucking insensitive thing about the Tuskegee Syphilis study (But black people worked on it and it's not like they were INFECTING people with Syphilis). And then the rest of it was a STEM circlejerk (Wah, why are these SOCIAL SCIENCES invading my medical research). I work in medical research and am working towards a masters in Epidemiology. We cannot live in our own bubbles, we must learn from different disciplines. Hard sciences bring data-driven analysis to every subject, but social sciences bring the ability to look at the whole picture. Humanities bring the ability to make these things appealing and also to think creatively, to gain inspiration. We need them all, and it's a shame that Pinker doesn't realize that.Oh boy, and I'm not even going to start on the Humanism section and his comments on Islam. Not only does he not see how Western Imperialism could have POSSIBLY encouraged a more patriarchal regime as opposed to just reading religious texts (Look at the south), he also is just full of double standards. Oh, and his arguement against Nietsche is that dictators read him. He doesn't seem to get the Nietsche is all about skepticism. I do really like the chapter on Ideas. While it isn't something that I haven't heard before, I liked the comment on how a lot of politics now isn't even about core fundamental beliefs, but about who's team is winning. The truth is, Pinker and I differ on some core ideologies. Pinker refutes Postmodern philosophy while I am very postmodern. We have some differing opinions on the amount of regulations things should get and whether systems will correct themselves. I understand that. I read Ayn Rand, and I felt as though more of the arguments were at least compelling (if not occassionally bat-shit crazy). I didn't feel the same way about Pinker.All of this isn't helped by how reading this book felt equivelent to eating raw almonds. It was bland, it was dense, Pinker repeated himself and would attempt some flowery tangent while utterly failing. My friend said he tried reading the book during his night shift job and then fell asleep, and then got the audiobook and fell asleep again. I know he's not trying to say that we shouldn't work hard to improve the world, but I don't particularly feel any inspiration from this book, particularly when the vast majority does try to read as a pat on the back in spite of his introduction. I felt like a majority of his arguments were flaccid with the occasionally toxic take, and this book in general was overbloated. "
183,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"In Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, Steven Pinker spends 550+ pages attempting to disavow you of any notion of ""the good ol' days"".And he IS pretty convincing. He's got stats and graphs and lots of evidence to bolster his case that we live in amazing times - that progress and Enlightenment-era ideals have lead to better conditions in almost every measurable sphere. And he's right. He spends some ink and time on why we feel the opposite so often - the world is a hell hole! - pointing towards psychological phenomena like the optimism gap, the availability heuristic, (leaning heavily on Kahneman and Tvorsky's work) and the tendency we all have to remember negative over positive.I didn't read his earlier book about the decline of violence, The Better Angels of our Nature, but this book looks like a more robust version of that one, with a broad focus to include public health, economics, climate change, nuclear weapons, and the timely discussion of authoritarian populism.It's not all roses and puppies, but there are many great things and amazing research that lead to more great things. That's a good thing to remember, and a clarion call to keep going with research and evidence-based activism. All in the name of progress and making things more equal."

However, it's clear things need to be taken with a large grain of salt. I admit, my initial five star rating was more out of the hopefulness associated with the book. Hopefulness that the world isn't really going to hell in a handbasket, and hopeful that the mass generalizations and questionable analysis of facts/statistics had a firm foundation. After reading Nassim Nicholas Taleb's multiple epic burns on Pinker in his book  Skin in the Game: The Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life, I had to reassess my star rating after I stopped laughing. Basically,  Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are, and  But What If We're Wrong? Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past. You can't trust anything or anyone! Fake news! Still, this book provides a sweeping view that is very much appreciated, if not 100% infallible. "

Let us rid ourselves of scientific illiteracy, shed our primitive intuitions, and abolish our hopeful apocalyptic superstitions. Let this book be the spotlight that removes the shadows of ignorance from our echo-chamber brains. Crime, war, and famine rates are lower than they’ve ever been. GMOs, fertilizers, and vaccines have and continue to save billions of lives. The global standard of living has never been higher. In virtually every measurable way, life is better for us than it has ever been for any generation of humanity before us. True, Donald Trump is the president of the United States and average global temperatures are increasing. But those problems have solutions. Reason, science, and humanism. Buy this book and take comfort in the life science has afforded us. Let us all recognize how wonderful life is and contribute to humanity’s continued progress."
187,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35-michael-siliski,4,"Recommended for anyone interested in a wake-up call about the progress made over the past few centuries.Enlightenment Now makes the case that the ideals of reason, science, and humanism have driven the greatest advances in the history of human civilization over the past few centuries. The book is divided into three parts: the history of the enlightenment, the progress we’ve made, and the enlightenment ideals that must be defended going forward. However, the meat of the book, and Pinker’s passion, is clearly the middle section, which is a thorough and data-based walk through fifteen areas where human lives are almost indistinguishably improved from just 10 generations ago, including health, peace, freedom, inequality, the environment, and happiness. Pinker’s enemies are “progressophobes” on both the right (the anti-science forces, the Trumpian politics of grievance) and left (New York Times-style liberal handwringing and catastrophizing). Both sides are prone to populism and a desire to return to an imagined utopian past. Pinker is successful in his main goal of thoroughly debunking that such a past ever existed.Enlightenment Now has a lot in common with Hans Rosling’s Factfulness, which I wrote about recently. Pinker is quite a bit longer and goes much deeper, so if you’re the type to ask for the data backing each claim, this might be the better book for you. I also thought Pinker was much more successful in grounding his celebration of human progress in a memorable framework.Both books suffer from a relentless optimism that can feel a bit strident at times. For Pinker, I thought this was most evident in his discussions of inequality and happiness, both of which felt a bit blithe to me. I think there is good reason to reject the most pessimistic takes on these: that more wealth doesn’t make people any happier or even that people are less happy these days, that inequality within a society is far more important than absolute means. Pinker does a good job making the case that inequality is not equivalent to poverty, and that “in some ways the world has become less equal, but in more ways the world’s people have become better off.” He makes a compelling argument that happiness is directly related to wealth, in particular using Stevenson & Wolfers studies. But these are not the same as proving “the irrelevance of inequality to happiness” or demonstrating that individual happiness is primarily driven by wealth. I thought these sections would be stronger if they didn’t reach quite so far.I agree with Pinker that reason, science, and humanism are critically important to human well-being globally, and these days it does feel a defense of them is needed. While I doubt that many who disagree with the thesis would even pick this book up, Pinker does make a similar point to Rosling that many of the most well-educated, including academics, are unaware of how much progress actually has been made through Enlightenment ideals. So perhaps there is hope that books like this could have a positive influence.From: https://medium.com/@msiliski/enlighte..."
188,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13941368-bakunin,4,"I usually wait a while to write a review of a book in order to digest all the important aspects of the work and this is certainly true in this case as well. Being somewhat of a libertarian with conservative leanings I found this book to be both illuminating as well as challenging. This book is Pinkers best attempt to defend the enlightenment; that is to say humanism, science and reason. He goes through many aspects quantitatively to prove his point - health, inequality, evironment, peace, safety, equal rights, quality of life etc - and all these things seem to be going in the right direction. Countries which are more democratic and more liberal are happier. This is essentially a more scientific defense of what Popper called ""the open society"". Although I find it refreshing to read a somewhat optimistic book in the midst of all the usual gloom one encounters in the daily press, I find myself in disagreement with Pinker. I agree with Pinker in that we are living the best possible time but what bothers me is the fact that I believe that the welfare state won't be able to sustain this growth (or progress if you will). Although Pinker has a certain classical liberal leaning, he is not very worried about the implications of an ever expanding welfare state: the destruction of the family, mass immigration, and the infantilization of citizens in the west. His liberal predilection is also shown by his apparent scorn of Trump and 'populism'. I suppose that this is where the rubber meets the road - I believe that communities are necessary and that the individual is not a tabula rasa. I also strongly reject the notion of an enlightened elite telling people how to better live their lives. While my values often may coincide with Pinkers, I believe in a slow and organic change in society, rather than a forced political one. Pinker by contrast scorns tribalist behavior and finds this to be reactionary; a force to be fought with a scientific mind. Although I have a certain buddhist leaning myself, I am slowly becoming more convinced of the need to be a person in modern society and the need therefore to retain certain elements of tribalism. Where to draw this line is however unclear. "
189,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75777506-tom-zacharski,2,"I picked ""Enlightenment Now"" after Bill Gates's recommendation. It's not every day that you hear someone like Gates recommend their favorite book of all time. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed. The premise of the book is that, as humanity, we are much better off nowadays than ever before in history. Pinker draws on many statistics, graphs, and facts to show that is indeed the reality. While I love that premise and couldn't agree more (we need more of those reminders in the age of 24h media) I found the language and general style a bit hard to read and unpleasant to a reader - it read a bit too much like a textbook and too often felt like going through well researched and academic in nature Powerpoint slides. The book could have easily been three times shorter and would drive the points home more effectively. Nonetheless, the points are important and if you've never read anything about how far we have come as humanity I do recommend the book. I recently saw ""The Final Year"" - a documentary about Barafh Obama's last year in office and how his foreign policy team operated during the time of a divisive, and later shocking, election. At one point Obama says that history does not follow a straight line, rather it zigs and zags, there's ups and downs, but it's our job to make sure the trend continues upward. And that trend is what the ""Enlightenment Now"" is all about."

Pinker was named one of Time Magazine’s 100 most influential people in the world in 2004 and his books are regularly featured in the best-selling lists. While the purpose of this book is commendable – to show with extensive use of data that we are living in the best of times – two reasons made me cringe while reading it. Firstly, the author completely misses the mark on the topic I have dedicated part of my professional life for the past 10+ years: climate change. Second, it doesn’t address the plastic pollution that is cursing our oceans.To read the rest of the review, please check out my blog post: http://www.edouardstenger.com/2018/03..."

192,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"I listened to this as an audiobook & it was good, but he has a lot of graphs so quick reference to the PDF is a big plus. There are also sections where it's nice to reread his thoughts, although most are straightforward enough that it's not necessary. His writing is clean & uncluttered. It follows a logical progression.There are 3 sections:1) Enlightenment2) Progress3) Reason, Science, & HumanismThe first two sections are great. I've read about the Age of Ignorance, its history, & its benefits before, but his is one of the best as he proves the benefit of the scientific method to mankind through some very telling statistics. I loved the section on how much wealth we now have comparatively. I've read comparisons about the cost of an hour of light, but it always impresses me. He shows how much less violence, starvation, & disease there is. So why do we think the world is in such danger? He thinks it's due mostly to brain bugs & loud extremists both on the left & right.The last section ""Reason, Science, & Humanism"" was preaching to the choir. It was long & boring at times. There was a lot of good information in it & while I agreed with him in general, he went over the top or underplayed several things. For instance, he seems to consider an existential threat as serious only if they'll kill off most people. He fails to mention how horrific a tragedy which abruptly killed 1% of our population would be (1% of 7 billion is 700 million!) or what the loss of an entire city could do to our society. IIRC, some have said it could take as little as losing 10% of the population to bring down our civilization since it is incredibly interconnected. Something like a nationwide outage of electric could be catastrophic even if it lasted a fairly short time. Cities only have a few days worth of food & places like LA rely on a lot of infrastructure. Millions are living in a desert, an area where the first settlement didn't make it.His thoughts on nuclear bombs were very simplistic & incomplete. Hindsight of what the Kremlin would have actually done during the Cold War based on records we're now reading is armchair quarterbacking at its worst. He also didn't get into the options of nuclear bombs like tactical nukes. I remember some talking heads discussing how great the tactical nuke option was going to be at one point. It was insane! Apparently he doesn't believe how close we were to annihilation.Worse, he dismissed the effect of the atomic bombs we did drop saying that the Japanese surrendered because the Russians were entering their area of the war. That's ridiculously simplistic, just one of many factors & I don't believe it was the deciding one. The Japanese were out of everything & the Allies were pushing them back in force. Kamikazes weren't their first choice as weapons, but born of desperation. In March, Tokyo was bombed by something like 300 planes - nothing like Dolittle's desperate raid of a few years before. It was a huge force with horrific results, but it was also understandable & they knew we couldn't afford it too often. In August, one plane dropped one bomb that was about as bad. A few days later, we repeated the trick. They didn't know the cost or how many more we had. How can anyone dismiss that?It's crazy hard to get fissionable materials, but they aren't the only nuclear threat. It's a lot easier to get radioactive waste & spread it around with conventional explosives. It doesn't take a genius & if it or a biological/chemical agent is put in the right place, someplace upwind. It could be devastating. Not an end of the world catastrophe, but up there with the Twin Towers. I don't think it's particularly likely, but everyone thought Clancy's novel, Debt of Honor (1994) was just unlikely fiction, too. If you haven't read it, a guy crashes a jet into Congress & pretty much wipes them all out. This was 7 years before 9/11, but airline security didn't change so his dismissive attitude towards terrorists seems a bit over done. Still, I generally agreed with him. We can be too anxious. Current airline security is a good example, but there are a lot of smart people trying to keep us safe. We're walking a tightrope between safety & losing our freedoms. Our anxiety only makes the latter more likely, so I'm glad of his perspective.Overall, it's a good book. If you're super religious or a big Trump supporter, you'll probably dislike the last section especially. Pinker beats on both sides of the aisle, but the anti-humanist & anti-science of the current administration is in front of us now, so he gives a lot of good reasons for his negative opinions.Highly recommended in any format, but do get the PDF with the audiobook. Very well narrated."

What is progress? You might think that the question is so subjective and culturally relative as to be forever unanswerable. In fact, it’s one of the easier questions to answer. Most people agree that life is better than death. Health is better than sickness. Sustenance is better than hunger. Abundance is better than poverty. Peace is better than war. Safety is better than danger. Freedom is better than tyranny. Equal rights are better than bigotry and discrimination. Literacy is better than illiteracy. Knowledge is better than ignorance. Intelligence is better than dull-wittedness. Happiness is better than misery. Opportunities to enjoy family, friends, culture, and nature are better than drudgery and monotony. All these things can be measured. If they have increased over time, that is progress. 
The subtitle of Enlightenment Now is: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, and as someone who has benefitted from all of these – in all of the ways enumerated in the opening quote – I don't know to what extent I needed the “case to be made” for these values. The difficulty I had is that while author Steven Pinker does define and defend each of these principles throughout the book, he is actually attempting to make the case for optimism – as though the entire world today has progressed in the direction of betterment (to greater or lesser degrees), as a direct result of Enlightenment thinkers, and as there isn't any problem facing us that can't be solved by doubling down on Enlightenment thinking and the advancement of science and technology, anyone who tends to pessimism (whether over the environment, existential angst, or the rise of populism and despotism) simply needs a long history lesson about all the ways in which things have gotten better and better. Pinker includes more than seventy graphs with pleasing curves (trending up or down over time, depending on whether they're tracking positive or negative metrics), he provides double, or even triple, digit footnotes for each chapter (assuring me that every statement he makes is backed by published sources), and with thirty fine-print pages of references at the end, I couldn't possibly track them all down in order to reach my own conclusions about the state of the world. The reader is repeatedly asked to take Dr. Pinker's word for it that everything is progressing well (towards a place of measurable betterment for humanity), and as I found myself often squirming with the uneasiness of not just wanting to take his word for it, and as I also found myself without the informational/philosophical background from which to dispute his arguments, I couldn't always follow where Pinker wanted to lead me; often as impatient with myself as with him. I'm glad I read this book – at least in an effort to understand what the big debates of our time might be – but I just don't have the knowledge base to properly respond to Pinker's arguments; three stars reflects my not taking a stand on this one.So, I'll make an aesthetic judgment: Pinker stretched my concentration with his frequent philosophical references to hermeneutics, dialectics, ontological this and that, but when he would descend to informal/hippie references to presumably lighten things up (many retirees are happy “seeing the national parks in a Winnebago, or dandling Vera, Chuck, and Dave in a cottage on the Isle of Wight”; drivers safely enjoy the pleasures of “seeing the USA in their Chevrolet, or just cruising down the streets, feeling out of sight, spending all their money on a Saturday night”), I found the writing forced, or worse, anachronistic. And I grew impatient with Pinker's smugly rhetorical strawman-punchline gags:
There is no law of complex systems that says that intelligent agents must turn into ruthless conquistadors. Indeed, we know of one highly advanced form of intelligence that evolved without this defect. They’re called women.
Or:
Of course, one can always imagine a Doomsday Computer that is malevolent, universally empowered, always on, and tamperproof. The way to deal with this threat is straightforward: don't build one.
Other ideas that made me squirm: Pinker stresses the need for rational thinking and the belief that the scientific method is the only way of measuring the world (using that, at a stroke, to dismiss human consciousness as a mere byproduct of evolution and the nonexistence of gods as an accepted fact). History progresses in one direction, and so long as we continue to embrace Enlightenment thinking and turn to science to solve our problems, there will be no environmental doomsday, no nuclear wars, no real terrorist threat to democracy, no Singularity (no “foom”). Pinker insists that science is politically bipartisan and he takes swipes at the anti-progressivism of the left (those who are reflexively anti-GMO, anti-vaccine, anti-nuclear) and the anti-intellectualism of the right (those who are creationists, anti-immigration, protectionist), and while that might make him seem a neutral party, Pinker never misses an opportunity to name President Trump as the anti-Enlightenment bogeyman who could reverse centuries of human progress. And since, as I pointed out, I don't feel qualified to confront Pinker on his facts, here is some of the professional response to Enlightenment Now (note: I chose to share reviews from left-slanting sources in order to prevent partisan fakenewsmanship):From the (officially bipartisan but purportedly leftwing) Australian public broadcaster, ABC –Pinker never seems to see the force of the question: How do we know that all this did not take place in spite of, rather than because of, the Enlightenment? In fact, he doesn't even pretend to go to the trouble of establishing a causal connection between his contentious version of the Enlightenment and the various improvements that he imagines follow in its wake. Post hoc, ergo propter hoc seems to be the operative principle. From New Statesman, a British newsmagazine that self-describes as having a “liberal, sceptical political position” –Judged as a contribution to thought, Enlightenment Now is embarrassingly feeble. With its primitive scientism and manga-style history of ideas, the book is a parody of Enlightenment thinking at its crudest. A more intellectually inquiring author would have conveyed something of the Enlightenment’s richness and diversity. Yet even if Pinker was capable of providing it, intellectual inquiry is not what his anxious flock demands. Only an anodyne, mythical Enlightenment can give them what they crave, which is relief from painful doubt.From The Globe & Mail, a decidedly progressive Canadian daily newspaper –
Pinker's gripe is largely aesthetic. A prominent egghead who writes and composes himself with Spock-like coldness and clarity, he seems annoyed at the frenzy (and so, irrationality) of ""editorialists,"" ""climate justice warriors,"" ""relativists,"" and the ""politically correct"" left. What Pinker never substantially considers is that such frenzy – whether deployed as a deliberate political tactic, or manifesting as the sputtering incoherence of the true believer – may help mobilize the spirit of change and progress; dams and ditches of passion that channel the turbulent tides of Enlightenment. 
And from one such “frenzied climate justice warrior” at The Guardian, the British daily that famously tilts left –
Pinker insults the Enlightenment principles he claims to defend. Could he have succumbed to the motivated reasoning these principles are supposed to suppress? If the environmental crisis cannot be so easily dismissed, it threatens his argument that life is steadily improving. What looks like a relentless enhancement in human welfare could emerge instead as an interlude between one form of deprivation and the next.
The bottom line: I slogged through this long read, encouraged by its optimism, but unconvinced by its argument. I was further annoyed by my own inability to articulate my increasingly negative response to Pinker's thesis, and recognise that as my own failing; I remain uncertain that I've adequately outlined my objections even with the addition of other reviewers' voices. Even so, I'm glad to have read this book and would recommend it to anyone interested in what “the eggheads” are talking about."
194,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5979619-boudewijn,3,"In this book, Steven Pinker wants to provide insight in the fruits of the Enlightenment and that the norms and values are still as important as everContrary to what you might believe, the world is in a much better shape than ever. Whether it is life expectancy, welfare, peace, democracy, knowledge or prosperity, there is not better moment to live than now.Most of the pages are dedicated with scores of statistics, all showing that things are going well. World life expectancy has doubled from 30 years (1800) to 71,4 years (2015). The world’s GDP has increased a 100 times and - despite the growing population - the number of people living in abject poverty is decreasing.But what about the challenges we’re facing today? The deplorable state of nature, extinctions and climate change? Yes, Steven Pinker acknowledges that these challenges exist, but where other relapse in doom scenario’s. Pinker advocates for a continuation of an optimal relation between (economic) progress and pollution. If humanity wants to survive, it needs to invest in progress itself: only after achieving a certain amount of welfare, people are willing to invest in (and sacrifice themselves for) a better environment. In other words, keep investing in the core values of the Enlightenment: rationalism, science and humanism. And yes, this includes nuclear energy, as a clean way of energy.In the last part of the book, Pinker delves into the current problems of the left and the right. The left thinks that the world is being plagued by inequality and the environment being endangered, the right think that his ‘culture’ is being destroyed by immigrations and minorities. Fact and figures that show that this is not the case, are being falsified or simply denied.The problem that I had with this book was its lack of nuance. He knows, or thinks he knows all, and does not refrain from his mantra that all is well, and will be well. There is no room for any considerations for those who - even today - might not be living their lives to their full capacity. Not because they don’t want to, but because they are simply kept from achieving it.

195,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48909861-dan-ust,4,"Overall a good book, though I believe Pinker overstates his case and is too narrowly focused on the Enlightenment itself — as if all progress were waiting for the 18th century to really start. This is strange given his earlier book, _The Better Angels of Our Nature_, where he documents the reduction in violence from the Stone Age on.He minimizes things like improved capabilities, while fine in themselves, can also breed greater risks. He does recognize this in the case of nuclear weapons. (One can argue that both ways: maybe nuclear deterrence has reduced or ended wars between major powers. But the devastation of one such weapon is certainly progress of a type many would question.)Also, he has what might best be called stylistic ticks. These wouldn’t be as bad in a brief talk, but became more vexing to me as I read the near 500 pages of the main text. (There are extensive footnotes worth mining too. I’ve read or skimmed a number of the works he cites.) By these I mean he seems to have to reword adages or quote songs and the like for somewhat comic effect. This works sometimes, but when it feels like every section must have one or two, it feels like padding in an already long work.I winced a little at his oversimplification of intellectual history, too, though I believe his trashing of Nietzsche is spot on. I winced further at his seeming to think the ruling class simply wants the best for everyone rather than it’s often resistant to progress and benefits from “gloom and doom” attitudes. (Politicians don’t run on the slogan that things are okay and getting better. Instead, election campaigns are morality plays where good is battling evil, where one side will redeem us and move is forward from the collapsing state we find ourselves in while the other wishes to push society over a cliff.)In many ways, too, Pinker’s work is an update of that of economist Julian Simon. One can argue that Pinker will have a greater impact because he’s not an economist and, despite my reservations above, is a much more accessible and wittier writer. (To be fair, it’s been a while since I’ve read Simon.)Ian Goldin also wrote a balanced review for Nature:https://www.nature.com/articles/d4158..."
196,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"This book was simply amazing. I've read the whole thing in less than two weeks. The material was very captivating, and the chapters in the book are well organized, allowing for natural breaks. Steven Pinker, the author, provides a rational and balanced view of the current state of humankind, how we got here, and where we're headed. He dives into vital topics directly and doesn't hold back or avoid anything. The book covers topics such as wealth, health, quality of life, society as a whole, climate change, education, and a lot more.The information shared is also backed up by real data which is quite refreshing. We're all surrounded with so much negativity from the mainstream news which can make the world seem like a terrible place to live in. And with this book, what I enjoyed was the more balanced presentation of the data without resorting to fear-mongering, which is so common these days with clickbait media.If you have any doubts, this book will open your eyes to the fact that we're all living in the best time for humankind since the beginning of our existence and things are getting better.As much as I enjoyed the optimistic viewpoint on certain topics in this book, I also like the fact that the author didn't exclude critical areas we as humans need to work on — one of those being climate change.There's very little doubt about the current situation with climate change and the urgency at which we need to operate to avoid a global disaster. The truth is, we all have to step up and do our part as this presents one of the biggest challenges for humankind yet.Overall, this book is a great read, and I highly recommend it. It covers so many important areas, and I'm glad I decided to read it. I have no doubts you'll enjoy it as much as I did."
197,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5196256-mindy,1,"I read this because Bill Gates highly recommended it, and because I felt I needed a more optimistic view of the progress of humanity. Why did I think Bill Gates’ reading list would hold any interest for me? This book is simply further evidence that all data can be manipulated to achieve a purpose. If you include yourself among the world’s wealthiest “citizens”, this is a great read to assuage any hint of privilege-related guilt you may feel. The extremely poor are in decline, and if the bulk of humanity is now simply poor, they should be content with their plight and thank their overlords from lifting them out of the squalor. I kept reading hoping for a redeeming moment. It never happened."
198,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"In 2011 Steven Pinker wrote a magnificent book, The Better Angels of our Nature, in which he showed – by using historical analysis, statistical methods and informed estimates – how the world has gotten safer (hence the subtitle of the book: The Decline of Violence). The gist of the book was that there have been continuous social reforms that have led to an environment in which our inner demons have fewer opportunities to surface and in which zero-sum games have been turned into positive-sum games. In 2017, Pinker followed up his 2011 work by extending his scientific method to the whole scale of human progress. In Enlightenment Now he wants to show us how the world not only got safer, but also became a much more pleasant place to live in – for almost all human beings that are born. Pinker wants to show us that this progress wasn’t inevitable: it was a conscious effort of human beings to start – for the first time in history – to apply reason to the goal of making the world a better place to live. This is important, since it shows us to not be complacent and to take all the gains for granted. Pinker tries to convince us readers that the Enlightenment values that drove this progress have to be remembered by and re-stated to each new generation.The book itself is divided into three parts; I will briefly summarize each part in the rest of this review.In part 1, Pinker describes how in the Enlightenment era people started to use reason to understand the world (science) and to distinguish right from wrong (ethics). No more witch hunts; no more mythologies; no more harsh punishments; etc. According to Pinker, mankind has to fight continuously against three natural entities: (1) entropy (the increasing of disorder), (2) evolution (the competition of all against all; zero-sum games), and (3) information (increasing our knowledge). In this fight, reason is the most important, and only, tool that we have to – temporarily – create a good place to live for ourselves. Pinker sees two contemporary threats to this ideal though: religion and populism (left- and rightwing). His goal of the rest of the book is hence; first to show that real progress has taken place; and next, to convince us that this progress was driven by Enlightenment values that have to be defended. So, in part 2 of the book Pinker applies the scientific method to analyze the different domains of human progress. He uses lots of graphs and he meticulously describes all the relevant scientific findings – just like he did in his 2011 book on the decline of violence. In short, people live longer; are healthier; are economically better off, even though inequality increases; the environment is (slowly) better off and the climate change fatalism is misguided (especially in light of all the technological advances); the world is more peaceful and safer than ever, while terrorism is a minor (insignificant) blip; democracy and equal rights are strongly instituted; and knowledge is readily accessible for masses of people and ever-progressing. In the closing chapters of part 2, Pinker also states that the newer generations are much happier, healthier and experience a much higher quality of life than earlier generations. Within generations this progress is also visible. The hailed existential threats to progress – technological enslavement and nuclear war – are serious issues but there really is no reason to be scared shitless: human beings, according to Pinker, are better and better equipped to turn zero-sum games into positive-sum games (i.e. turning existential threats into cooperated effort to ward off disaster). Pinker finishes part 2 by claiming that progress, even though contingent (i.e. depending on human choices), is a self-enhancing cycle: as the world is better off each year, countries will tend to cooperate more and more and living conditions of all human beings will tend to increase. Minor setbacks, such as the Trump presidency and the Brexit referendum, cannot stop the long-term trend of ever-increasing progress.After showing us how much the world has progressed, Pinker turns his book into an essay. In part 3 he makes a case for three Enlightenment values that are, according to him, essential to actively promote and continue the progress we have already made. The first of these values is reason, which is under increasing attack by generations of postmodernists (“objective reality doesn’t exist”, “all cultures are equal”, etc.) and populists (“the will of the people should be followed”, “we need a strong leader”, etc.). Next to these two ideologies, human beings suffer from biases and hence the media portray a picture of a world that is almost continuously on the brink of World War III. Pinker, essentially, advocates a more rational public discourse, in which fact checking and statistical reasoning trump Trumpism (pun intended).The second value Pinker advocates is science. In other words: trial and error. Not just to gain more knowledge and hence receive more control over our lives (by fighting diseases, natural disasters, etc.), but also to base our policies on. Politics, according to Pinker, should be more evidence-based and less ideology-driven. This is the old argument of piecemeal social engineering promoted by Karl Popper: changing policy in small steps; measuring and evaluating the results of each step; and adjusting where necessary.Pinker notices a trend in literary and cultural circles, especially due to scientifically illiterate self-proclaimed intellectuals, to blackball science and act like science is the root of all evil. The truth is that science is a-moral – in the sense that it doesn’t say whether we should build a-bombs, nuclear reactors for energy, or both, and in which situation – and that science offers us the possibility to better our lives. It is due to science that we live longer, healthier and wealthier.The third and last value that Pinker advocates is humanism. Humanism is the answer to the problem of the a-morality of science: it tells us what to do with all the knowledge, wealth and technological possibilities. Pinker uses the ethics of one of the founders of the Enlightenment, Spinoza. According to Spinoza, any human being that is governed by reason will wish for any other human the same things as they wish for themselves. This is a strong ethical imperative, and Pinker uses the rest of the chapter to state it more fully (in short: consequentialism) and to refute the two counter-narratives: religious morals (which are, according to Pinker, humanized by humanism – with the exception of Islam) and populism/nationalism (which are inspired by the ethics of Nietzsche’s Übermensch and heroism).All of the above is my try to summarize Pinker’s thoughts as honest and representative as possible. Of course this is practically impossible: the book is huge and Pinker is much nuanced on all of the themes mentioned. But: what to think of it all?First, I applaud Pinker for stating clearly how far we have come since the 16th century: how much better off human beings are in the 21st century world. As Pinker himself repeats, it is trendy to be a cultural pessimist. All this liberalism and progress has led to atomized societies and hedonistic, empty lives. It is also very fancy to be a fatalist, especially regarding the environment and climate. Pinker's book is a healthy antidote to all this doom-thinking and the masses of studies and graphs he uses to back up his arguments make cultural pessimism and climate fatalism hard to sustain.Second, I think Pinker is right in seeing humanism, reason and science as the driving forces behind the world we live in nowadays. It is only when reason is set aside – consciously or unconsciously – that progress halts and that we fall back on our primitive nature and zero-sum value systems. I think he is also right in describing the two major threats to the world as we know it: religious morality and populism (again, left- as well as rightwing). So in all this, Enlightenment Now is a terribly accurate and timely book.But I do disagree with some of Pinker’s observations, especially the ones on happiness and quality of life. I cannot help but reflect that Enlightenment Now is written by a Harvard professor whose life is spent on creative thinking and intellectual effort to understand the world. I don’t think many of us can share this luxury, and that for many of us leading ‘normal lives’ life isn’t as fulfilling or free as we wish. Pinker’s line of argument is (albeit simplified): younger generations suffer less from addictions; commit fewer suicides; suffer less from depression; etc.; hence, they are happier than earlier generations and have a higher quality of life. I don’t know if the amount of suicides and depressions says anything (or much) about the happiness of people. And another problem with this line of thinking – which really surfaces throughout the whole book – is that it generalizes over everyone. It is entirely possible that certain parts of the population are worse off, but that this negative effect is swamped by an exponential increase of happiness by the rest of the population. For example, due to globalization, the world is better off, and the poorest people and the poorest countries are the real gainers in health and wealth; yet the (lower) middle classes and lower classes in richer countries are really worse off than earlier generations – combined with an ever-increasing decline of social mobility. The same thing goes with people in vulnerable professions or in vulnerable life situations: handicapped people, sick people, old people, etc. In all developed countries we see an ever-increasing jungle of rules and regulations, to guarantee an equal treatment for all people in like situations. This sounds beautiful and noble, but it results in health care workers clocking five minutes for washing elderly people; treating schoolchildren as revenue and future tax payers; making people who depend on social welfare end up in mazes of bureaucracy; etc. Is this truly progress? (Of course, Pinker would counter: would they be better off in the nineteenth century?)My point is that statistics are useful to describe general trends and to understand what causes play a role. When we understand what factors make the world a better place to live in, we can apply more of the same potion. Understanding is fundamental. But scientific studies of subjects like happiness - even apart from all the methodological issues involved - are rather empty when we're dealing with our own personal lives and our loved ones around us. Stating, for example, that more people are better off and that poverty declines, is a rather meaningless statement when talking to someone who just lost his or her job because his or her employer moved to a developing country. Personally, I think the diffusion of liberalism, the results of equal rights movements (including feminism), and decades of migration have led to a diminishing social cohesion in Western societies – and between countries worldwide. This is, for example, illustrated by contemporary elections: a huge assembly of small political factions and an increasingly polarized climate. It is also illustrated by the popularity of identity politics, in which individuals base their personal identity on biological and cultural traits. Western societies have degraded into collections of individuals without much common ground. Hence, all the rules and regulations to enforce equality: people don’t trust each other anymore – or at least less than before. I cannot help but remark that in Sweden there are plans to make laws to make two adults consent to have sexual intercourse - as if the intricate and complex dealings in real life can be translated and enforced by abstract laws. The same applies to the laws against islamophobia that the Canadian parliament put into practice in 2017. This is symptomatic of societies lacking social cohesion and reciprocal trust and commitment.I think Pinker is over-optimistic when it comes to a better world. He does notice an increase in global and national inequality and declining social mobility, but he doesn’t see it as serious arguments against progress. Of course, from a macro-perspective, the world is better off and this is a good thing. But people don’t like grim futures and this can become very problematic in countries in which large swathes of the population have to give up health and wealth to transfer it to developing countries – something which is inevitable if the world economy continues the way it does now. I think the safe thing to say is that Enlightenment Now is a reliably optimistic book on how the world as a whole is much better off in 2018 than in 1618. The causes of this progress are humanism, reason and science. On a grand scale, Pinker’s book is an important reminder of the possibilities of human progress – if/when we set our minds to it we can do a lot to better our lives. Yet by zooming out, Pinker steers around the (equally important) question of a declining standard of life for individuals and particular social groups and a feeling of loss of social cohesion. Yet, these last points weren’t the goal of his book, so I shouldn’t end this review on such a sour note. It’s a very interesting and readable book: read it!"
199,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1139239-michael-austin,4,"Steven Pinker is a rare creature in the academic world: a liberal who is not a leftist. As a liberal he supports things like free speech, civil rights, democratic ideals, and a strong government that ensures safety, protects the environment, and redistributes some portion of income to support education, health care, infrastructure, and the reduction of poverty. As a non-leftist, he supports things like a democratic government and a capitalist economy that, while subject to government regulation and income redistribution, still functions as a free market. Like most of Pinker’s books, Enlightenment Now is big and filled with lots of data, but actually very tightly argued. The sequence of his argument goes something like this:1.	In the eighteenth century, European intellectuals produced a movement that we call “the Enlightenment” that was built on four interrelated principles: reason, science, humanism, and progress. They set in motion revolutions in government, science, and culture that has shaped the world ever since. 2.	The Enlightenment worked. Over the last two and a half centuries, nearly every measure of human flourishing has increased dramatically across the world. People alive today are better educated, healthier, richer, and safer than they have ever been at any time in history. Major diseases have been wiped out by vaccination, extreme poverty has been substantially reduced by global markets, and war and violence have decreased to their lowest levels in world history.3.	Since its beginning, the Enlightenment has had to contend with “counter-Enlightenment” narratives from both the left and the right. Counter-Enlightenment narratives are those that portray the world as getting worse, either because people are falling away from religious belief and values (the conservative counter-narrative), or because capitalism has enervated the world for its own profit and turned 99% of people into labor machines that feed its insatiable greed (the leftist counter-narrative). 4.	The work of the Enlightenment is not finished. There is still poverty, war, and injustice. There are still threats to safety and to the environment. We still have many, many problems to solve. But these problems are best solved by using the tools of the Enlightenment (reason, science, and humanism) rather than by reverting to counter-Enlightenment narratives such as religious fundamentalism or Marxism to address them. As one who is, like Pinker, a liberal but not a leftist, I find myself agreeing with almost everything in this over-arching argument. Sure I have specific quibbles with all kinds of stuff. Pinker is not content to show that most things are a little bit better. He wants to be more comprehensive than that and show that everything is a lot better. And in the process, he often stretches his argument beyond what can be reasonably proved. But even adjusting for some hyperbole, the data he presents is overwhelmingly persuasive—not just that life has gotten better in the world since the 18th century, but that it has improved dramatically in just the last 30 years. During this time, extreme poverty has fallen from 50% of the world to 10%, the number of people killed in wars has fallen by 200%, criminal violence has decreased dramatically, cars are safer, more countries are democratic, and income inequality has decreased in all but the most developed nations. It seems to me that there is no reasonable way to refute the proposition that the world today is more amenable to human flourishing than it has ever been.But there are a whole lot of unreasonable ways to refute this, and this, really, is the most important part of the book. Pinker identifies two key cognitive biases that causes many people to reject the Enlightenment narrative that the world is getting better and embrace one of several counter-Enlightenment narratives that insist that the world is getting worse.The first of these biases is the “availability heuristic.” We have a lot more access to information than we have ever had before, so we see more of the bad stuff than anybody ever has. Our Internet and social media feeds immediately show us acts of racism, police brutality, mass violence, civil strife, and even genocide. We see these with much greater frequency, and when we do, our minds tell us that they are happening with greater frequency, which is generally not the case. But don’t try to tell us that, because we probably won’t believe it.The more troubling factor in our tendency to see a world in decline is the confirmation bias, which simply means that we tend to see what confirms our beliefs and ignore what does not. And we are attracted to narratives of decline because they fit with so many ready-made world views. They are, in fact, an indispensable part of contemporary politics.“We are doing well, but we need to do better” is not a good political message. “We are in decline and need to make America great again” is. And herein lies the fundamental attraction to narratives that cannot be supported by reason or data. We want to believe that things are getting worse, because this is the best way to accomplish political and religious goals. These narratives create fear, and fear motivates us to vote, to donate to politicians, to attend Church, to donate to Churches, and to agitate for change. We can do this through reason and science, of course, but it doesn’t work as well. And this is probably Pinker’s most important point: we are in danger of losing much of the progress that we have made as a nation, and as a world, by rejecting the principles responsible for that progress and embracing narratives that emphasize tribalism, magical thinking, resentment, and unwarranted fear. In the United States, we are rolling back the government regulations that have kept us safe and improved our environment, and we currently have an administration that insists that global relations are a zero-sum game. Globally, people are rejecting the vaccines that wiped out diseases and attacking the advances in food technology that have dramatically reduced hunger and poverty. Countries that once embraced secularism and democracy are starting to turn to religious fundamentalism. We are abandoning things that work in favor of things that won’t. And this is very dangerous. It is possible to argue with almost everything that Pinker says in Enlightenment Now. But those arguments must also adopt Enlightenment principles: showing where his reason fails, providing better evidence, rejecting conclusions that he makes because they are not adequately supported. This kind of debate is necessary and proper.Unfortunately, this is not the debate that we are having. Across the political spectrum, the Enlightenment ideals that Pinker champions are being refuted from fundamentally illiberal and unenlightened positions with a strong interest in making the world seem like a fetid hell hole that is only a moment away from the apocalypse. These arguments are dangerous because they appeal to the kind of thinking that caused most of our problems in the first place."
200,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,5,"There is no one alive who writes with the mind-sweeping clarity and breadth of knowledge that Steven Pinker possesses. Though there are other works of his that are perhaps more revolutionary (The Blank Slate) or ambitious in their singular explanatory power (How the Mind Works), it is this latest volume of his that is his most timely and all-encompassing cerebral broom.If the idea of needing to defend Enlightenment values is mysterious to you at this point then I can only pity you your global-scale ignorance or apathy. In Pinker, that cause of defense has found its most able champion. Offering an incredible array of 75 statistical graphs that are properly contextualized and interpreted, he has produced such an incredibly coherent and well-argued line of thinking that has enough independent and objective fact to annoy partisans of both sides of the political/philosophical spectrum. Much of the work seems to follow-up on several of the arguments brought forth in his previous volume, ""The Better Angels of Our Nature."" Following a deft summary as to what Enlightenment ideals and practices are, Pinker proceeds to show just how they have benefited society and the world as a whole ever since, where they have come up short, and recommends several new usages of these ideas for future mutual benefit. Along the way he casts off so many misconceptions and anecdotal ""arguments"" against the Enlightenment, something long overdue in writings by contemporary intellectuals who - alarmingly and genuinely stupidly - have distanced themselves from these values. This is not done with flippant casuistry or mere rhetorical prolepsis but with relentless data and cogent, in-depth examination. Some telling and amusing samples from the work include:""If you extol reason, then what matters is the integrity of the thoughts, not the personalities of the thinkers.""""While a vision of world peace may have given John and Yoko some good songs, it is hopelessly naïve in the real world.""""However long it takes, we must not let the existence of cognitive and emotional biases or the spasms of irrationality in the political arena discourage us from the Enlightenment ideal of relentlessly pursuing reason and truth.""This is the book of the year, no question. No one has this diverse array of knowledge, no one marshals their facts better, and no one does so with the ease of language that Dr. Pinker presents across a work of 500+ pages. In closing I will let him sum up one of the major points of this monumental achievement: ""Remember your math: an anecdote is not a trend. Remember your history: the fact that something is bad today doesn't mean it was better in the past. Remember your philosophy: one cannot reason that there's no such thing as reason, or that something is true or good because God said it is. And remember your psychology: much of what we know isn't so, especially when our comrades know it too."""
201,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58890815-andrii-zakharov,5,"There are a lot of bad reviews of Steven Pinker's new book out there, mostly arguing against some of his particular points taken out of context, putting words in his mouth, falsely attributing some agenda to him, or simply twisting his words. But reading the book attentively, one can't help but notice how much thought went into Pinker's formulations, and how careful he is with what he is saying and showing. The one detailed review I can recommend which appreciates the precision and is not politically loaded is Scott Aaronson's: https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p....Here, I will only give my brief impression. First, I must admit that I found some chapters in the book stronger than others. This is to be expected of a work that attempts to cover the whole span of the human condition across history, and do so in an exclusively data-driven, empirical way. For some developments, there is just not enough good data available, and so some of the conjectures and estimates will necessarily be better supported than others. That said, taken as a whole, Enlightenment Now is an exceptional piece of popular scholarship, providing a most enjoyable review of all the relevant aspects of human life. Page after page, figure after figure, relentlessly hammering home the crucial point way too many of us are unaware of: the world and our lives in it are continually getting better, along almost every conceivable dimension. One could argue at length about the data in each and every chapter. One could rightly point out that some of it is one-sided, that his historical accounts are incomplete and some of the conclusions premature. But the sheer weight of evidence makes it impossible to deny the central points:* life has been, and is, getting better for ever more people in ever more places* it is happening as we create new knowledge and use it to gradually solve problems* problems are inevitable, new ones will always arise, but problems are also solvable, given the right knowledge* the best system we have to create new knowledge is science* continuing to gradually improve our institutions will continue to bring incremental progress* we are facing many dangers, some of them existential, which call for unprecedented global cooperation and knowledge production to overcome* the ideas outlined above are, sadly, time and again attacked by hostile ideologies from all sides of the political spectrum, and have to be defended if we are to continue our progress.These points were made very persuasively in the course of the book, and appear to me of paramount importance. Reading Enlightenment Now significantly shifted my worldview towards conditional future optimism, motivating to work very hard to sustain our amazing progress so far."
202,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"Pinker builds on his previous book The Better Angels of Our Nature to make a strong case for enlightenment values.His writing is excellent and always an absolute joy to read.He puts apparent contemporary reversals of progress in perspective. He defends humanism. He pulls no punches discussing religion. He weighs in on economics as key to those Better Angels. He wipes the floor with Friedrich Nietzsche and his intellectual heritage in fascism, Nazism, etc. He backs up everything with scientific evidence. Even if sometimes the interpretation comes off a bit forced, he's still working on solid ground throughout the book."
203,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,5,"Steven Pinker was one of the first writers to kindle my passion for scientific thinking. When I read 
The Blank Slate
 in 2011, it exposed me to a host of intellectual disciplines that my undergraduate training in philosophy had neglected––most notably evolutionary psychology, skepticism, and the empirical foundations of human nature. Nearly a decade later, I am thrilled not only to have another opportunity to journey through Pinker’s impressive mind, but also that his chosen message is rooted in data-driven, responsible optimism. Given the psychological and political difficulties of 2017, I was on the verge of thinking that such optimism was nothing more than shrugging in the face of inevitable doom. But Enlightenment Now turned my frown upside down, made me feel good about being human again, and restored much of my belief that humanity still has a bright future (or many possible bright futures) ahead.If I could rename this book without worrying about marketing, my chosen title would be: Everybody Calm the Fuck Down: The Case for Sanity, by Steven Pinker. At a moment in global and American history when many citizens feel like the sky is continually falling, Enlightenment Now provides a hard-nosed critique of our tendency to indulge our inner Chicken Littles. Instead of taking the in vogue route of mining for new reasons why human civilization is inherently dishonorable and teetering on the brink of destruction, Pinker argues the exact opposite. To make his case, Pinker demonstrates that the Enlightenment, the great intellectual movement that precipitated the rise of modernity, has been a rollicking success:""This book is my attempt to restate the ideals of the Enlightenment in the language and concepts of the 21st century. I will first lay out a framework for understanding the human condition informed by modern science––who we are, where we came from, what our challenges are, and how we can meet them. The bulk of the book is devoted to defending those ideals in a distinctively 21st-century way: with data. This evidence-based take on the Enlightenment project reveals that it was not a naïve hope. The Enlightenment has worked––perhaps the greatest story seldom told. And because this triumph is so unsung, the underlying ideals of reason, science, and humanism are unappreciated as well. Far from being an insipid consensus, these ideals are treated by today’s intellectuals with indifference, skepticism, and sometimes contempt. When properly appreciated, I will suggest, the ideals of the Enlightenment are in fact stirring, inspiring, noble––a reason to live."" (5-6, emphasis his)This passage reveals both the considerable strengths and non-negligible weaknesses of Pinker’s position. Since I agree with Pinker’s outlook and think this book represents a hugely valuable contribution to the modern moment, I’ll deal with the chinks in his armor first and follow with praise. First, Pinker’s characterization of the Enlightenment’s success as “the greatest story seldom told” is an overstatement. I’d like to say it’s an overstatement that isn’t repeated in the rest of the text, but that wouldn’t be an honest appraisal. It’s my feeling that the Enlightenment-rejecting “intellectuals” in Pinker’s crosshairs––frustrating and myopic as they may be––do not represent a majority opinion in America or anywhere else. In fact, as Pinker points out, they do not even represent a majority of intellectuals:""During the 20th century, the landscape of human knowledge was carved into professionalized duchies, and the growth of science (particularly the sciences of human nature) is often seen as an encroachment on territories that had been staked and enclosed by the academic humanities. It’s not that practitioners of the humanities themselves have this zero-sum mindset. Most artists show no signs of it…Nor is the anxiety expressed by the scholars who delve into the historical epochs, genres of art, systems of ideas, and other subject matter in the humanities, since a true scholar is receptive to ideas regardless of their origin. The defensive pugnacity belongs to a culture: Snow’s Second Culture of literary intellectuals, cultural critics, and erudite essayists."" (389-90, emphasis his)This Second Culture is Pinker’s true enemy, and while he does a good job of calling them out directly in the latter chapters, some of his earlier assertions belie the genuine nuances that bolster the rest of the text. For example, the opening sentences of a chapter called “Progressophobia” read thus: “Intellectuals hate progress. Intellectuals who call themselves progressive really hate progress” (39, emphasis his). Such sweeping statements needlessly open a path for critics to characterize Pinker as nothing more than a Panglossian apologist for modernity; sadly, this path will be well-trodden given how Pinker has been villainized by the Second Culture and its acolytes (this review  is a good example). Here we find the downside of Pinker’s iconoclastic nature, which is not only the source of his intellectual vitality and undeniable wit, but also his most significant vulnerability.My other worry about this book is that, despite Pinker’s repeated claims that the Enlightenment’s success is not a justification for complacency in the face of extant problems, it may nevertheless end up playing that role in cultural and political discussions, as well as in the hearts and minds of readers. Over and over, Enlightenment Now caused me to take a deep breath and remind myself that things aren’t so bad, which is terrific for my personal health and state of mind, but probably not the best way to get me into the proverbial trenches solving humanity’s most difficult challenges. Of course, one of Pinker’s central claims is that the best way to fight those battles is to eschew unnecessary excitation in favor of calm calculation and reasoned negotiation. But I still worry that readers like myself––privileged first-worlders for whom modernity is working just fine––may utilize this perspective to thicken our own socioeconomic and ideological bubbles instead of heeding Pinker’s call to action. The lesson here is that Enlightenment Now represents just one important perspective amongst others, and should not be treated as a comprehensive guide to the world’s present state. In other words, it’s like any other intellectual endeavor.Okay, now for the fun stuff! As ever, Pinker has crafted a book that is engaging, cleanly written, and packed with dense and fascinating thoughts. Since this is a book about progress, we should start with Pinker’s chosen definition:""What is progress? You might think that the question is so subjective and culturally relative as to be forever unanswerable. In fact, it’s one of the easier questions to answer. Most people agree that life is better than death. Abundance is better than poverty. Peace is better than war. Safety is better than danger. Freedom is better than tyranny. Equal rights are better than bigotry and discrimination. Literacy is better than illiteracy. Knowledge is better than ignorance. Intelligence is better than dull-wittedness. Happiness is better than misery. Opportunities to enjoy family, friends, culture, and nature are better than drudgery and monotony. All these things can be measured. If they have increased over time, that is progress."" (51)Pinker is not posturing when he claims that these indicators of progress can be measured. His commitment to empiricism runs much deeper than that of most public intellectuals, as evidenced by the 70+ graphs/charts and 100 pages of notes/references that accompany his superb argumentation. While he is well aware that data generation is a flawed human process (404), the raw power of evidentiary convergence becomes increasingly undeniable as Pinker’s explication of progress unfolds over about 300 pages.In my view, Pinker’s most important insight about progress is this: “It’s in the nature of progress that it erases its tracks, and its champions fixate on the remaining injustices and forget how far we have come” (215). This dynamic can make progress very difficult to identify and acknowledge, since even a world that is improving will always create new obstacles during the process of rendering old ones obsolete: “Progress cannot be monotonic because solutions to problems always create new problems. But progress can resume when the new problems are solved in their turn” (44). While it may seem simplistic to some readers, I think Pinker’s characterization of the world’s difficulties as mere problems to be solved is a critical and often-elided truth that we need to rediscover. In a cultural milieu where doubling down on embattled ideological positions and demonizing one’s opponents is routine, it becomes heroic to refocus one’s attention and energy on discovering the empirical nature of a problem and following the road to solutions wherever it may lead.Of the seventeen topics Pinker addresses in his discussion of progress, the one that most pleased me was his chapter on the environment. This is a topic that many big thinkers still neglect, even though climate change is perhaps the most ominous long-term threat to the continuance of human progress. Pinker takes up the climate problem with distinctive poise, showing how sentimental, anti-industrial positions on the political left and denialist positions on the right have both failed to provide a viable platform for global climate action. He advocates for “Ecomodernism,” a nascent field of study founded on three tenets: (1) some degree of pollution is unavoidable due to the entropic nature of the universe, (2) industrialization has generally been good for humanity, and (3) technology is the primary tool we should use to mitigate environmental damage without relinquishing the myriad benefits of modern life (123-4).While Second Culturists will surely write Pinker off as an obsequious technocrat beguiled by the corrupt comforts of elite capitalist culture, a sober assessment of Ecomodernism reveals it as the most reasonable and realizable approach for dealing with climate change. Pinker advocates for a combination of solutions, including decarbonization, alternative energies, dematerialization, and nuclear power––no silver bullets here. His recommendations, especially on the nuclear issue, pay no heed to the entrenched ideological positions of climate warriors or denialists, but rather follow the evidence wherever it leads. Climate change is serious and daunting, but panicking and using it as an excuse to upend the economic and institutional foundations of progress is foolish. This message is starkest in Pinker’s takedown of Naomi Klein’s position that the only way to address climate change is to raze contemporary capitalism and rebuild it with a much heavier emphasis on centrally-planned economies. His critique was especially salutary for me, given that I was completely seduced by Klein’s point of view when I read This Changes Everything back in 2014. I love an opportunity to update my opinions and reflect on the informational and perspectival limitations of my past selves.Instead of succumbing to the idea that humanity must repent for the great sin of modernity, Pinker instead demonstrates that we can approach this daunting challenge with a rational maturity:""It’s time to retire the morality play in which modern humans are a vile race of despoilers and plunderers who will hasten the apocalypse unless they undo the Industrial Revolution, renounce technology, and return to an ascetic harmony with nature. Instead, we can treat environmental protection as a problem to be solved: how can people live safe, comfortable, and stimulating lives with the least possible pollution and loss of natural habitats?"" (134)As it has always been, the solution is to press forward using the human wellsprings of creativity and innovation; it does no good to nostalgically pine for previous eras when life for average folks and even most elites was much worse than today.Also laudable is Pinker’s defense of rationality, which is endangered by political partisanship and religious/magical thinking. Pinker’s rejection of political partisanship, which he likens to sports fandom, is particularly valuable (359-60). He lays out a battery of research showing how ideologues bend over backwards to deny their opponents the benefit of the doubt, then ties it off with a much-needed reminder that progress is not owned by any individual or group, but is rather the collective result of countless actions and shifts over time that can come from even the most unlikely places:""It should not be surprising that the facts of human progress confound the major -isms. The ideologies are more than two centuries old and are based on mile-high visions such as whether humans are tragically flawed or infinitely malleable, and whether society is an organic whole or a collection of individuals. A real society comprises hundreds of millions of social beings, each with a trillion-synapse brain, who pursue their well-being while affecting the well-being of others in complex networks with massive positive and negative externalities, many of them historically unprecedented. It is bound to defy any simple narrative of what will happen under a given set of rules. A more rational approach is to treat societies as ongoing experiments and open-mindedly learn the best practices, whichever part of the spectrum they come from."" (365)All of us are inescapably embedded in Pinker’s “real society,” and our ability to intelligently acknowledge and navigate this messy reality can stave off madness and keep progress coming.Enlightenment Now closes with Pinker’s celebration of humanism––a strong message that rehabilitated my humanist loyalties, which took a hit when I read Yuval Noah Harari’s 
Homo Deus
 last year. I still wonder how humanism will stay relevant as we evolve into new transhuman and posthuman forms, but I’ve no doubt that Pinker’s perspective is the right one for the here and now:""The first step toward wisdom is the realization that the laws of the universe don’t care about you. The next is the realization that this does not imply that life is meaningless, because people care about you, and vice versa. You care about yourself, and you have a responsibility to respect the laws of the universe that keep you alive, so don’t squander your existence. Your loved ones care about you, and you have a responsibility not to orphan your children, widow your spouse, and shatter your parents. And anyone with a humanistic sensibility cares about you, not in the sense of feeling your pain––human empathy is too feeble to spread itself across billions of strangers––but in the sense of realizing that your existence is cosmically no less important than theirs, and that we all have a responsibility to use the laws of the universe to enhance the conditions in which we all can flourish.""

206,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3055905-nils,1,"Dr Pangloss lives! I’m unconvinced that the various Enlightenments (there actually were several distinct Enlightenments, though Pinker seems unaware of this), much as I love them, can really be credited for the huge increase in human material well-being that has taken place over the last couple of centuries. This turns out not to be a trivial critique, since Pinker’s argument that the Enlightenment is what “caused” the material improvement drives his conclusion that the main threat to sustaining that improvement comes from those who he alleges are undermining the Enlightenment, e.g. the so-called postmodernists. This in turn leads to Pinker’s bizarre suggestion that the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche represent a greater threat to our sustained material well-being than, say, Exxon-Mobil and the Koch brothers. Judge for yourself whether you find that plausible.In fact, the real underpinning the material gains of the last two centuries have been more institutional than ideational. This in turn implies that we must scrutinize the solidity of our institutional matrix if we want a real purchase of the sustainability of these gains. First, there have been numerous civilizations achieving marked improvement in the welfare and well-being of their populations – at least their upper classes. The Maya, the Romans, and several dynastic episodes of the Chinese achieved such gains. Of course, the gains that industrial modernity has achieved over the last quarter millennium outstrips all previous improvements. But taking the longer view, the gains of modernity are perhaps less impressive than they seem. Almost all those gains have taken place in the last quarter millennium, and 250 years, after all, isn’t that long of a run for a civilization. Other historical civilizations have sustained their gains for much longer. The Roman Empire’s eastern branch basked in cultural glory for a thousand years. And even though it’s usually meant pejoratively, it’s no coincidence that the word “byzantine” is a synonym for institutional complexity.Second, there are reasons to suspect that modernity’s run of material amelioration may be drawing to a close—and may even go into reverse. Broadly speaking these reasons can be divided in two. The first concern biophysical limits to growth. These are enduring arguments that the Breakthrough Institute has done much to illuminate and clarify, so suffice to say that, as a long term proposition, Malthus hasn’t yet been proven wrong, and climate change presents challenges of unprecedented scale that will only be addressed if there is sufficient collective political will to overcome collective action and free riding challenges. It’s at best unclear whether we have the global social capital to do so. Put another way: we live in an era of wicked problems.My own skepticism about whether humanity can overcome these challenges brings me to my fundamental critique of Pinker’s optimism: not only the sustainability of the gains of the last quarter millennium, but also the extensibility of these to larger sections of humanity, as well as the ability to address the growing headwinds posed by anthropogenic climate change depend crucially on a massive strengthening of our global institutional and governance infrastructure. From this perspective, all the indicators are sharply negative over the last fifty and especially the last ten years.For nearly fifty years, Gallup has run a series of polls asking Americans about their confidence in various institutions – universities, the media, business, political institutions, and so forth. While the data are noisy, the overall trendline is inexorably downwards. The decline in confidence is partly the result of sustained anti-institutional propaganda, which exists in both leftwing and rightwing versions. But as I have argued elsewhere, I believe the root cause of this declining trust is the objectively poor institutional performance and a lack of elite accountability. A general feature of late modernity is a declining faith in social authority of all sorts, as ever more individuated and autonomous polities become ever less willing to entrust political agents to do anything. The advent of Donald Trump is merely a symptom of both the failure and the rejection of institutions in the United States.Nor is this just an American phenomenon. The rise of populism across Europe likewise reflects distrust of institutions. The Brexit vote two years ago of course represented a direct rebuke to transnational institutions. More recently, the triumph in the Italian elections of the Five Start Movement, whose calling card was a rejection of political party infrastructure, signaled nothing if not a rejection of institutions. (It remains unclear whether the Movement can manage even a small city, let alone Italy as a whole.)With the United States in the grip of Trumpism and the European Union caught between shambolic national politics and collective dissolution, the primary hope for global leadership seems to be falling by default to the Chinese. Some people have argued that China is filling the institutional gap left by a receding Europe and the United States. Eric X. Li, for example, recently argued that Xi Jinping’s merging of Chinese state and party infrastructure makes sense given that “the party has developed into the most competent national political institution in the world today.” What this bold claim tacitly conceded is that, despite the huge successes the Chinese state has had in poverty reduction over the last 40 years, China’s existing institutions are inadequate to managing the bumpy course corrections that lie ahead if it is to sustain its gains.Even more worrying than the declining performance of global and national political institutions are the faltering institutional underpinnings of sustained technological innovation – innovation which everyone, optimists and pessimists alike, agrees is essential to any adequate plan for addressing the challenges posed by climate change. As Mariana Mazzucato has shown, state support for innovation and entrepreneurship has in fact been at the root of almost all major technological breakthroughs of the last 75 years. Specifically, much of this support has taken place through trillions of dollars of state funding for research universities. But universities today are under unprecedented assault. Variously accused of being hotbeds of leftist indoctrination, engines of neoliberal reproduction, or simply wastes of money, no one trusts universities anymore. (This is the real place where the “postmodernists” have something to answer for: they have both been a primary vector of critique of universities, in effect sawing at the branch they sit on, while at the same time provoking hysteria about the supposed insanity of the humanities, of which Pinker’s book is a characteristic example.) While it seems inconceivable that the United States in particular would flush away the linchpin of its technological, industrial, and soft power success, the cultural assault on universities today is unparalleled. Non-coincidentally, universities also face a funding crisis of unprecedented proportions, one that is hitting humanities departments first but which the STEM fields are unlikely to escape. All this threatens to cut the legs out from under the innovation engine that is critical to any effort to escape the grim climate reaper."
207,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna,4,"This is nonfiction and it covers a giant host of various topics, including politics, racism, war, etc. For as long as this audiobook was, I was never bored. The author moved effortlessly and quickly from topic to topic to topic. That style worked here. So the 4 stars is for the entertainment value that I was able to place on this. Now with all that said, it usually bothers me when the author slants all the info to fit his views and then completely glosses over other things that might deflate his defense. While this author did that (abundantly), I didn't find it offensive or annoying. He had some well placed humor to soften that reaction. "
208,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68472482-daniel,5,"This is the best book I have ever read which is something I’m not saying lightly. It makes you so optimistic about the state of human progress and it makes you truly appreciate how much progress we have made over the past couple of centuries. It is really mind-blowing. If you weren’t already, it will also make you very optimistic about the likeliness of this progress continuing in the future with the help of, among other things, technology and today’s widely available information resources.Pinker goes through a wide range of subjects from Life expectancy, Peace and Safety to Equal rights, Knowledge, Quality of life and Happiness. He backs it up with rigorous research and clearly shows how almost every relevant parameter is going in the right direction. The only two areas that as of now haven't shown clear-as-day improvements over time are Terrorism and Global warming. (Another area, which Pinker didn’t include in the book, that could be considered a blip in the otherwise steady drumbeat of progress, are the recent reports of increasing death rates among middle-aged Americans over the past decade.) Focusing on the bigger picture analysis that Pinker provides all throughout the book rather than the daily news and shorter-term trends, you get the true picture of how well humanity is doing.One fascinating example of this is what Pinker calls the consumer surplus. Think about the washing machine. It saves us 10h per week compared to 1920 and costs a few hundred dollars. Now, if you think about how much someone would have to pay you for you to give up your washing machine, the number is clearly not in the hundreds of dollars anymore. Many people in developed nations would say that there is no price that would make them give it up. So not only are we richer but many of the utilities (and other things) that we use everyday can be bought for almost nothing compared to their actual value to us. This wasn't true 50 and 100 years ago. Another example is that today the average American worker retires at 62. Hundred years ago the average American worker died at 51.Pinker thinks (and I agree) that the media is responsible for a large part of today’s unfounded, but in many parts of the Western world, prevailing pessimism. As he puts it “When voters are inches away from the news, optimism can seem naive.” He points out that if newspapers would have elected to report more good news, they could have run the headline ""Number of people in extreme poverty fell by 137,000 since yesterday"" every day for the past 25 years.The book is structured in such a way that you can easily read only one chapter that you find interesting and skip the rest. There is for example a very good chapter on the environment and climate change if you want to read up on that. I do think Pinker misses some of the big potential risks in his discussion on AI, for example advanced AI systems in the wrong hands. And I think you can safely skim through the final three chapters without missing too much of an otherwise wonderful book.As a side note, the reason I decided to read this book was Bill Gates' glowing review of it some time ago. As you can see, I wasn’t disappointed. In his review, Bill said that he read the book very slowly because he loved it so much, but that he thought “most people will find it a quick and accessible read.” Perhaps he wrote the review in the ensuing euphoria after having just finished the book because I can assure you of one thing: this book is a lot of things, an easy read for most people it is not (it’s all relative I guess). But it is enormously fun reading and often highly enlightening so it's well worth your time. A big thank you to Pinker for putting things in the right perspective and allowing readers to see the bigger picture so clearly."
209,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21797839-rafael,5,"Ok, it took me a while to finish this one not because something is wrong with it but because the amount of facts and info it has on it, its a beautiful tesis on the world today facts about economy, politics, religion and social behavior, humanism is the sole purpose of this book and explains it with brilliant research, this a not an easy book but is a wonderful explanation on how science works and how research and enlightenment could and is guiding our future, we still a long way to go but if we keep preaching facts, science and critical thinking then out future will be bright, people just has to let go of religion and superstition, get educated, preach science, i really loved this book but is not an easy read, i'd say is must read for everyone."
210,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"In many ways, reading this book was similar to reading Pinker's book ""Better Angels of our Nature."" The theory of the book was straight-forward, the evidence was well-organized, and the insights from the data were presented clearly. The first drawback to reading this book is that it covers a lot of the same ground as ""Better Angels of our Nature."" The second drawback to this book is that...well, even if the conclusions of this book aren't common sense, to people who are roughly familiar with enlightenment ideals and are fairly well-read on current affairs, it sort of is common sense. That's a nice way of saying that there are few ideas in this book that will leave you awe-struck. That's not to see that Pinker isn't capable of writing such a book. I found ""The Blank Slate"" to be just such a book. That book remains one of my favorite books to this day. That is also the book I point to when I want to convince people what a great thinker Pinker is. Pinker's argument is straightforward and comes in the preface: ""I will present a different understanding of the world, grounded in fact and inspired by the ideals of the Enlightenment: reason, science, humanism, and progress. Enlightenment ideals, I hope to show, are timeless, but they have never been more relevant than they are right now."" (page 12). If Enlightenment ideas are timeless, then why do they need a defense? Pinker's answer: ""The ideals of the Enlightenment are products of human reason, but they always struggle with other strands of human nature: loyalty to tribe, deference to authority, magical thinking, the blaming of misfortune on evildoers"" (page 18). In many ways, ""Enlightenment Now"" is similar to ""Factfullness"" in its use of quantitative data to make the case that life is indeed getting better. Pinker's earlier book ""Better Angels of our Nature"" was also a book that relied heavily on quantitative data. However, by my recollection, that book did a better job of reflecting on how the numbers were arrived at. I think numeracy is an important skill, and too often it is easy to be wowed by numbers without realizing how they are produced and the difficulty of getting reliable numbers in certain contexts -- for example, the distant past and developing countries. My recollection of ""Better Angels"" is a few years removed, but I seem to remember Pinker doing a better job with educating readers on how numbers were arrived at. Having said that, I do think the graphs are presented in a useful and simple way. Often, the data comes in the form of time series line charts. I think the repeated use of these kinds of statistics is great for more casual readers who need to be convinced. Another drawback to this book is that it tends to ignore and short-change the possibility of cataclysmic blowups. The discussion of the disruptive power of AI is discussed briefly, but pales in seriousness to Yuval Harari's analysis in ""21 Lessons for the 21st Century."" The benefits of enlightenment are discussed abundantly, but Frankenstein monsters like mortgage-backed securities are barely mentioned. In addition, one of the most important trends of the 21st century, the explosion of debt is barely discussed. The looming debt crisis (or, I should say crises since we are talking about various kinds of debts, government, municipal, shadow banking, and private) as well as other potential crises with systemic implications -- climate change, the growing use of social media, the introduction of disruptive technologies -- are under-discussed in this book. And because these systemic crises are under-discussed, Pinker fails to deal with the mother of all questions about modernity. Does modernity increase the risk of catastrophic blow-ups? Since nuclear war, climate change, and contagious financial panics are the product in one way or another of modernity, science, and globalization, is there a likelihood that more potentially catastrophic phenomena could be birthed from them? And, if so, what can we do to prevent potential catastrophic blow-ups from occurring? Another way to think about the question is this way: In what ways is modern progress like a financial bubble? For me, a high point of the book was its discussion of tribal epistemology. I have read short articles on tribal thinking, but the review of the literature here was excellent. And for those who are searching for literature that discusses this topic, the book can make for an effective gateway. This was written in the Guardian about this book: ""More pertinently, the failed 2016 campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Remain demonstrated that, in the eyes of many people, “progress” simply meant more of the same. When people feel trapped and patronised by progress, then any alternative – even regress – will feel like freedom. Informing them that the policies of the past 40 years are still the best available starts to sound hopeless."" (Full review here: https://www.theguardian.com/books/201...)Perhaps that's another way of saying that technocratic modernity (complete with its wonky charts) can feel emotionally ungratifying. Instead of gradual improvements and progress by a thousand nudges, there is a part of the soul that yearns for liberation, heroism, and love. People like stories with heroes and villains. Enlightenment often sees the world in terms of mechanical and quasi-mechanical cause and effect relationships. Heroism seems less like heroism when it requires design and system-thinking rather than great sacrifices. Nassim Taleb, another writer whose work I admire, steeps his writing in decidedly non-modern ideas and sentiments -- his thinking perhaps is best described as classical and romantic. I believe anyone who reads this book ought to put it in conversation with some of Taleb's writing (one or two books is enough). I'm sure each of the authors would hate to hear it, but I'll say it anyway -- they are better read together than separately. The unabashed modernist/enlightenment thinker is better with a classical/romantic counterpart and vice versa. I will repeat this: People who are only familiar with Pinker for ""Better Angels"" and ""Enlightenment Now"" ought to read his earlier work ""Blank Slate."" That book, more than his more recent works, demonstrates that he is a true thinker and not simply a chart-jockey or dataphile. Overall, even if you do not need to be convinced of the merit of enlightenment ideas and ideals, this is a wonderful book to read. "
211,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,4,"If you're looking for a cure for the common pessimism, you might do much, much worse than to pick up this book. I've read or seen many other examples of the facts portrayed here, but Steven Pinker does a very admirable job of showing us, exactly, how much better the world is now compared to the one we had even a hundred years ago. It's not just time-saving devices or some outright reversals of ecological damage, but how lifespans, general IQ, overall poverty level, and even WAR has improved for the better for all. Not that war is ever really all that great, mind you, but few nations jump into it with quite as little reason or abandon as they used to.Pinker isn't saying that everything is peachy, of course, but the trend toward real positive progress is undeniable. This is, despite setbacks. And yes, we have many. But for every problem that exists, he makes a very good point that we have it in us to FIX our problems. It's not out of the question.Global Warming, for example, not only has possible temporary and minor fixes available, such as applying a metaphorical sunscreen to the atmosphere, but we have the means to do much more than cut our carbon footprint down to the bone. We have a history of moving on to different methods whenever resources of one type or another run out, too. Health and education are at an all-time high. What we don't have is our optimism. In fact, we have a very solid outlook that things are worse than ever. Terrorists are few in number and never accomplish their stated goals. They merely rouse the combined might of all the powers to quash them. Most of the first world countries have made a point of living by equality in the sexes and the trend is more of the same across the world. LGBT is already accepted on the same scale. Pinker attributes all our actual progress to the Enlightenment. The old standard of 19th-century thinking, where humanism reigns supreme. Look. I freely admit to being a humanist, myself. I LOVE the idea that we all should get along. That every life is valuable. That we should have a high fundamental basis for living for every man, woman, and child alive. It's so pervasive an idea that practically everyone shares it. It's like... OBVIOUS, right? And as far as I know, Steven Pinker is right. But he also makes a very cogent point about the need to be rational, to use science for what it is intended. Inquiry, truth-seeking. No matter what the result, the truth is much more important than any ideology. He uses this to encourage each and every one of us to see past the doomsayers and the demagogs. Again, I totally agree. Skepticism is not the same thing as pessimism. Almost everyone I know is a fundamentally decent person and we all want the same fundamental things.So why didn't I give this book a full five stars?Because he gives all the credit to humanism. Wishing does not make it so. He might be right, but let's face it: this might be what he, himself warned us about. Selection Bias.Even so, I love thinking about it and I totally recommend this book for anyone who is sick and tired of the news and wants someone with a lot of facts and good reasoning to pick them up off the ground, dust their shoulders, and tell them that we are, on the whole, doing pretty damn well for ourselves. You know, despite the actual problems. But then, we DO have it in ourselves to FIX THEM. :)"
212,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51602586-dominika,2,"I did not like this book.I would say that this book was middling for the majority of it. The idea of the book is that progress has already happened, and we shouldn't be as doom and gloom as we are. But for a man who emphasizes the use of data and critical thinking, he doesn't really read said data that well and some of his arguments are riddled with gaping holes. This was a book that was read at our book club (but I was the only person at that book club who read the book in its entirety) and one of the points was that you need to show that progress has been made in order to do more progress. I have mixed feelings: I feel as though that erases the issues that people are actually facing by trying to point out that ""oh but you won't die in the woods from an infection"". While it is nice that countries that were in extreme poverty 50 years ago are being lifted to the middle class, it won't matter to the person who is working 3 jobs at minimum wage so that they can support a family. We have a lot of great innovations in healthcare, but it doesn't matter when a person cannot take an ambulance because it will cost them $600. Some of the progress sections have rather weak arguments as well. The environment one was basically him saying that the system will fix itself (in terms of a capitalist system supporting renewable energy) and that we'll totally invent carbon capture technology. The happiness one also bugged me, because the data is just not consistent. But the section that really got my blood boiling was Science. First off, he tries putting his deregulation mindset against IRBs and says a really fucking insensitive thing about the Tuskegee Syphilis study (But black people worked on it and it's not like they were INFECTING people with Syphilis). And then the rest of it was a STEM circlejerk (Wah, why are these SOCIAL SCIENCES invading my medical research). I work in medical research and am working towards a masters in Epidemiology. We cannot live in our own bubbles, we must learn from different disciplines. Hard sciences bring data-driven analysis to every subject, but social sciences bring the ability to look at the whole picture. Humanities bring the ability to make these things appealing and also to think creatively, to gain inspiration. We need them all, and it's a shame that Pinker doesn't realize that.Oh boy, and I'm not even going to start on the Humanism section and his comments on Islam. Not only does he not see how Western Imperialism could have POSSIBLY encouraged a more patriarchal regime as opposed to just reading religious texts (Look at the south), he also is just full of double standards. Oh, and his arguement against Nietsche is that dictators read him. He doesn't seem to get the Nietsche is all about skepticism. I do really like the chapter on Ideas. While it isn't something that I haven't heard before, I liked the comment on how a lot of politics now isn't even about core fundamental beliefs, but about who's team is winning. The truth is, Pinker and I differ on some core ideologies. Pinker refutes Postmodern philosophy while I am very postmodern. We have some differing opinions on the amount of regulations things should get and whether systems will correct themselves. I understand that. I read Ayn Rand, and I felt as though more of the arguments were at least compelling (if not occassionally bat-shit crazy). I didn't feel the same way about Pinker.All of this isn't helped by how reading this book felt equivelent to eating raw almonds. It was bland, it was dense, Pinker repeated himself and would attempt some flowery tangent while utterly failing. My friend said he tried reading the book during his night shift job and then fell asleep, and then got the audiobook and fell asleep again. I know he's not trying to say that we shouldn't work hard to improve the world, but I don't particularly feel any inspiration from this book, particularly when the vast majority does try to read as a pat on the back in spite of his introduction. I felt like a majority of his arguments were flaccid with the occasionally toxic take, and this book in general was overbloated. "
213,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"In Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, Steven Pinker spends 550+ pages attempting to disavow you of any notion of ""the good ol' days"".And he IS pretty convincing. He's got stats and graphs and lots of evidence to bolster his case that we live in amazing times - that progress and Enlightenment-era ideals have lead to better conditions in almost every measurable sphere. And he's right. He spends some ink and time on why we feel the opposite so often - the world is a hell hole! - pointing towards psychological phenomena like the optimism gap, the availability heuristic, (leaning heavily on Kahneman and Tvorsky's work) and the tendency we all have to remember negative over positive.I didn't read his earlier book about the decline of violence, The Better Angels of our Nature, but this book looks like a more robust version of that one, with a broad focus to include public health, economics, climate change, nuclear weapons, and the timely discussion of authoritarian populism.It's not all roses and puppies, but there are many great things and amazing research that lead to more great things. That's a good thing to remember, and a clarion call to keep going with research and evidence-based activism. All in the name of progress and making things more equal."

However, it's clear things need to be taken with a large grain of salt. I admit, my initial five star rating was more out of the hopefulness associated with the book. Hopefulness that the world isn't really going to hell in a handbasket, and hopeful that the mass generalizations and questionable analysis of facts/statistics had a firm foundation. After reading Nassim Nicholas Taleb's multiple epic burns on Pinker in his book  Skin in the Game: The Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life, I had to reassess my star rating after I stopped laughing. Basically,  Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are, and  But What If We're Wrong? Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past.

Let us rid ourselves of scientific illiteracy, shed our primitive intuitions, and abolish our hopeful apocalyptic superstitions. Let this book be the spotlight that removes the shadows of ignorance from our echo-chamber brains. Crime, war, and famine rates are lower than they’ve ever been. GMOs, fertilizers, and vaccines have and continue to save billions of lives. The global standard of living has never been higher. In virtually every measurable way, life is better for us than it has ever been for any generation of humanity before us. True, Donald Trump is the president of the United States and average global temperatures are increasing. But those problems have solutions. Reason, science, and humanism.

217,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35-michael-siliski,4,"Recommended for anyone interested in a wake-up call about the progress made over the past few centuries.Enlightenment Now makes the case that the ideals of reason, science, and humanism have driven the greatest advances in the history of human civilization over the past few centuries. The book is divided into three parts: the history of the enlightenment, the progress we’ve made, and the enlightenment ideals that must be defended going forward. However, the meat of the book, and Pinker’s passion, is clearly the middle section, which is a thorough and data-based walk through fifteen areas where human lives are almost indistinguishably improved from just 10 generations ago, including health, peace, freedom, inequality, the environment, and happiness. Pinker’s enemies are “progressophobes” on both the right (the anti-science forces, the Trumpian politics of grievance) and left (New York Times-style liberal handwringing and catastrophizing). Both sides are prone to populism and a desire to return to an imagined utopian past. Pinker is successful in his main goal of thoroughly debunking that such a past ever existed.Enlightenment Now has a lot in common with Hans Rosling’s Factfulness, which I wrote about recently. Pinker is quite a bit longer and goes much deeper, so if you’re the type to ask for the data backing each claim, this might be the better book for you. I also thought Pinker was much more successful in grounding his celebration of human progress in a memorable framework.Both books suffer from a relentless optimism that can feel a bit strident at times. For Pinker, I thought this was most evident in his discussions of inequality and happiness, both of which felt a bit blithe to me. I think there is good reason to reject the most pessimistic takes on these: that more wealth doesn’t make people any happier or even that people are less happy these days, that inequality within a society is far more important than absolute means. Pinker does a good job making the case that inequality is not equivalent to poverty, and that “in some ways the world has become less equal, but in more ways the world’s people have become better off.” He makes a compelling argument that happiness is directly related to wealth, in particular using Stevenson & Wolfers studies. But these are not the same as proving “the irrelevance of inequality to happiness” or demonstrating that individual happiness is primarily driven by wealth. I thought these sections would be stronger if they didn’t reach quite so far.I agree with Pinker that reason, science, and humanism are critically important to human well-being globally, and these days it does feel a defense of them is needed. While I doubt that many who disagree with the thesis would even pick this book up, Pinker does make a similar point to Rosling that many of the most well-educated, including academics, are unaware of how much progress actually has been made through Enlightenment ideals.

218,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13941368-bakunin,4,"I usually wait a while to write a review of a book in order to digest all the important aspects of the work and this is certainly true in this case as well. Being somewhat of a libertarian with conservative leanings I found this book to be both illuminating as well as challenging. This book is Pinkers best attempt to defend the enlightenment; that is to say humanism, science and reason. He goes through many aspects quantitatively to prove his point - health, inequality, evironment, peace, safety, equal rights, quality of life etc - and all these things seem to be going in the right direction. Countries which are more democratic and more liberal are happier. This is essentially a more scientific defense of what Popper called ""the open society"". Although I find it refreshing to read a somewhat optimistic book in the midst of all the usual gloom one encounters in the daily press, I find myself in disagreement with Pinker. I agree with Pinker in that we are living the best possible time but what bothers me is the fact that I believe that the welfare state won't be able to sustain this growth (or progress if you will). Although Pinker has a certain classical liberal leaning, he is not very worried about the implications of an ever expanding welfare state: the destruction of the family, mass immigration, and the infantilization of citizens in the west. His liberal predilection is also shown by his apparent scorn of Trump and 'populism'. I suppose that this is where the rubber meets the road - I believe that communities are necessary and that the individual is not a tabula rasa. I also strongly reject the notion of an enlightened elite telling people how to better live their lives. While my values often may coincide with Pinkers, I believe in a slow and organic change in society, rather than a forced political one. Pinker by contrast scorns tribalist behavior and finds this to be reactionary; a force to be fought with a scientific mind. Although I have a certain buddhist leaning myself, I am slowly becoming more convinced of the need to be a person in modern society and the need therefore to retain certain elements of tribalism. Where to draw this line is however unclear. "
219,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75777506-tom-zacharski,2,"I picked ""Enlightenment Now"" after Bill Gates's recommendation. It's not every day that you hear someone like Gates recommend their favorite book of all time. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed. The premise of the book is that, as humanity, we are much better off nowadays than ever before in history. Pinker draws on many statistics, graphs, and facts to show that is indeed the reality. While I love that premise and couldn't agree more (we need more of those reminders in the age of 24h media) I found the language and general style a bit hard to read and unpleasant to a reader - it read a bit too much like a textbook and too often felt like going through well researched and academic in nature Powerpoint slides. The book could have easily been three times shorter and would drive the points home more effectively. Nonetheless, the points are important and if you've never read anything about how far we have come as humanity I do recommend the book. I recently saw ""The Final Year"" - a documentary about Barafh Obama's last year in office and how his foreign policy team operated during the time of a divisive, and later shocking, election. At one point Obama says that history does not follow a straight line, rather it zigs and zags, there's ups and downs, but it's our job to make sure the trend continues upward. And that trend is what the ""Enlightenment Now"" is all about."

Pinker was named one of Time Magazine’s 100 most influential people in the world in 2004 and his books are regularly featured in the best-selling lists. While the purpose of this book is commendable – to show with extensive use of data that we are living in the best of times – two reasons made me cringe while reading it. Firstly, the author completely misses the mark on the topic I have dedicated part of my professional life for the past 10+ years: climate change. Second, it doesn’t address the plastic pollution that is cursing our oceans.To read the rest of the review, please check out my blog post: http://www.edouardstenger.com/2018/03..."

222,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"I listened to this as an audiobook & it was good, but he has a lot of graphs so quick reference to the PDF is a big plus. There are also sections where it's nice to reread his thoughts, although most are straightforward enough that it's not necessary. His writing is clean & uncluttered. It follows a logical progression.There are 3 sections:1) Enlightenment2) Progress3) Reason, Science, & HumanismThe first two sections are great. I've read about the Age of Ignorance, its history, & its benefits before, but his is one of the best as he proves the benefit of the scientific method to mankind through some very telling statistics. I loved the section on how much wealth we now have comparatively. I've read comparisons about the cost of an hour of light, but it always impresses me. He shows how much less violence, starvation, & disease there is. So why do we think the world is in such danger? He thinks it's due mostly to brain bugs & loud extremists both on the left & right.The last section ""Reason, Science, & Humanism"" was preaching to the choir. It was long & boring at times. There was a lot of good information in it & while I agreed with him in general, he went over the top or underplayed several things. For instance, he seems to consider an existential threat as serious only if they'll kill off most people. He fails to mention how horrific a tragedy which abruptly killed 1% of our population would be (1% of 7 billion is 700 million!) or what the loss of an entire city could do to our society. IIRC, some have said it could take as little as losing 10% of the population to bring down our civilization since it is incredibly interconnected. Something like a nationwide outage of electric could be catastrophic even if it lasted a fairly short time. Cities only have a few days worth of food & places like LA rely on a lot of infrastructure. Millions are living in a desert, an area where the first settlement didn't make it.His thoughts on nuclear bombs were very simplistic & incomplete. Hindsight of what the Kremlin would have actually done during the Cold War based on records we're now reading is armchair quarterbacking at its worst. He also didn't get into the options of nuclear bombs like tactical nukes. I remember some talking heads discussing how great the tactical nuke option was going to be at one point. It was insane! Apparently he doesn't believe how close we were to annihilation.Worse, he dismissed the effect of the atomic bombs we did drop saying that the Japanese surrendered because the Russians were entering their area of the war. That's ridiculously simplistic, just one of many factors & I don't believe it was the deciding one. The Japanese were out of everything & the Allies were pushing them back in force. Kamikazes weren't their first choice as weapons, but born of desperation. In March, Tokyo was bombed by something like 300 planes - nothing like Dolittle's desperate raid of a few years before. It was a huge force with horrific results, but it was also understandable & they knew we couldn't afford it too often. In August, one plane dropped one bomb that was about as bad. A few days later, we repeated the trick. They didn't know the cost or how many more we had. How can anyone dismiss that?It's crazy hard to get fissionable materials, but they aren't the only nuclear threat. It's a lot easier to get radioactive waste & spread it around with conventional explosives. It doesn't take a genius & if it or a biological/chemical agent is put in the right place, someplace upwind. It could be devastating. Not an end of the world catastrophe, but up there with the Twin Towers. I don't think it's particularly likely, but everyone thought Clancy's novel, Debt of Honor (1994) was just unlikely fiction, too. If you haven't read it, a guy crashes a jet into Congress & pretty much wipes them all out. This was 7 years before 9/11, but airline security didn't change so his dismissive attitude towards terrorists seems a bit over done. Still, I generally agreed with him. We can be too anxious. Current airline security is a good example, but there are a lot of smart people trying to keep us safe. We're walking a tightrope between safety & losing our freedoms. Our anxiety only makes the latter more likely, so I'm glad of his perspective.Overall, it's a good book. If you're super religious or a big Trump supporter, you'll probably dislike the last section especially. Pinker beats on both sides of the aisle, but the anti-humanist & anti-science of the current administration is in front of us now, so he gives a lot of good reasons for his negative opinions.Highly recommended in any format, but do get the PDF with the audiobook. Very well narrated."

What is progress? You might think that the question is so subjective and culturally relative as to be forever unanswerable. In fact, it’s one of the easier questions to answer. Most people agree that life is better than death. Health is better than sickness. Sustenance is better than hunger. Abundance is better than poverty. Peace is better than war. Safety is better than danger. Freedom is better than tyranny. Equal rights are better than bigotry and discrimination. Literacy is better than illiteracy. Knowledge is better than ignorance. Intelligence is better than dull-wittedness. Happiness is better than misery. Opportunities to enjoy family, friends, culture, and nature are better than drudgery and monotony. All these things can be measured. If they have increased over time, that is progress. 
The subtitle of Enlightenment Now is: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, and as someone who has benefitted from all of these – in all of the ways enumerated in the opening quote – I don't know to what extent I needed the “case to be made” for these values. The difficulty I had is that while author Steven Pinker does define and defend each of these principles throughout the book, he is actually attempting to make the case for optimism – as though the entire world today has progressed in the direction of betterment (to greater or lesser degrees), as a direct result of Enlightenment thinkers, and as there isn't any problem facing us that can't be solved by doubling down on Enlightenment thinking and the advancement of science and technology, anyone who tends to pessimism (whether over the environment, existential angst, or the rise of populism and despotism) simply needs a long history lesson about all the ways in which things have gotten better and better. Pinker includes more than seventy graphs with pleasing curves (trending up or down over time, depending on whether they're tracking positive or negative metrics), he provides double, or even triple, digit footnotes for each chapter (assuring me that every statement he makes is backed by published sources), and with thirty fine-print pages of references at the end, I couldn't possibly track them all down in order to reach my own conclusions about the state of the world. The reader is repeatedly asked to take Dr. Pinker's word for it that everything is progressing well (towards a place of measurable betterment for humanity), and as I found myself often squirming with the uneasiness of not just wanting to take his word for it, and as I also found myself without the informational/philosophical background from which to dispute his arguments, I couldn't always follow where Pinker wanted to lead me; often as impatient with myself as with him. I'm glad I read this book – at least in an effort to understand what the big debates of our time might be – but I just don't have the knowledge base to properly respond to Pinker's arguments; three stars reflects my not taking a stand on this one.So, I'll make an aesthetic judgment: Pinker stretched my concentration with his frequent philosophical references to hermeneutics, dialectics, ontological this and that, but when he would descend to informal/hippie references to presumably lighten things up (many retirees are happy “seeing the national parks in a Winnebago, or dandling Vera, Chuck, and Dave in a cottage on the Isle of Wight”; drivers safely enjoy the pleasures of “seeing the USA in their Chevrolet, or just cruising down the streets, feeling out of sight, spending all their money on a Saturday night”), I found the writing forced, or worse, anachronistic. And I grew impatient with Pinker's smugly rhetorical strawman-punchline gags:
There is no law of complex systems that says that intelligent agents must turn into ruthless conquistadors. Indeed, we know of one highly advanced form of intelligence that evolved without this defect. They’re called women.
Or:
Of course, one can always imagine a Doomsday Computer that is malevolent, universally empowered, always on, and tamperproof. The way to deal with this threat is straightforward: don't build one.
Other ideas that made me squirm: Pinker stresses the need for rational thinking and the belief that the scientific method is the only way of measuring the world (using that, at a stroke, to dismiss human consciousness as a mere byproduct of evolution and the nonexistence of gods as an accepted fact). History progresses in one direction, and so long as we continue to embrace Enlightenment thinking and turn to science to solve our problems, there will be no environmental doomsday, no nuclear wars, no real terrorist threat to democracy, no Singularity (no “foom”). Pinker insists that science is politically bipartisan and he takes swipes at the anti-progressivism of the left (those who are reflexively anti-GMO, anti-vaccine, anti-nuclear) and the anti-intellectualism of the right (those who are creationists, anti-immigration, protectionist), and while that might make him seem a neutral party, Pinker never misses an opportunity to name President Trump as the anti-Enlightenment bogeyman who could reverse centuries of human progress. And since, as I pointed out, I don't feel qualified to confront Pinker on his facts, here is some of the professional response to Enlightenment Now (note: I chose to share reviews from left-slanting sources in order to prevent partisan fakenewsmanship):From the (officially bipartisan but purportedly leftwing) Australian public broadcaster, ABC –Pinker never seems to see the force of the question: How do we know that all this did not take place in spite of, rather than because of, the Enlightenment? In fact, he doesn't even pretend to go to the trouble of establishing a causal connection between his contentious version of the Enlightenment and the various improvements that he imagines follow in its wake. Post hoc, ergo propter hoc seems to be the operative principle. From New Statesman, a British newsmagazine that self-describes as having a “liberal, sceptical political position” –Judged as a contribution to thought, Enlightenment Now is embarrassingly feeble. With its primitive scientism and manga-style history of ideas, the book is a parody of Enlightenment thinking at its crudest. A more intellectually inquiring author would have conveyed something of the Enlightenment’s richness and diversity. Yet even if Pinker was capable of providing it, intellectual inquiry is not what his anxious flock demands. Only an anodyne, mythical Enlightenment can give them what they crave, which is relief from painful doubt.From The Globe & Mail, a decidedly progressive Canadian daily newspaper –
Pinker's gripe is largely aesthetic. A prominent egghead who writes and composes himself with Spock-like coldness and clarity, he seems annoyed at the frenzy (and so, irrationality) of ""editorialists,"" ""climate justice warriors,"" ""relativists,"" and the ""politically correct"" left. What Pinker never substantially considers is that such frenzy – whether deployed as a deliberate political tactic, or manifesting as the sputtering incoherence of the true believer – may help mobilize the spirit of change and progress; dams and ditches of passion that channel the turbulent tides of Enlightenment. 
And from one such “frenzied climate justice warrior” at The Guardian, the British daily that famously tilts left –
Pinker insults the Enlightenment principles he claims to defend. Could he have succumbed to the motivated reasoning these principles are supposed to suppress? If the environmental crisis cannot be so easily dismissed, it threatens his argument that life is steadily improving. What looks like a relentless enhancement in human welfare could emerge instead as an interlude between one form of deprivation and the next.
The bottom line: I slogged through this long read, encouraged by its optimism, but unconvinced by its argument. I was further annoyed by my own inability to articulate my increasingly negative response to Pinker's thesis, and recognise that as my own failing; I remain uncertain that I've adequately outlined my objections even with the addition of other reviewers' voices. Even so, I'm glad to have read this book and would recommend it to anyone interested in what “the eggheads” are talking about."
224,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5979619-boudewijn,3,"In this book, Steven Pinker wants to provide insight in the fruits of the Enlightenment and that the norms and values are still as important as everContrary to what you might believe, the world is in a much better shape than ever. Whether it is life expectancy, welfare, peace, democracy, knowledge or prosperity, there is not better moment to live than now.Most of the pages are dedicated with scores of statistics, all showing that things are going well. World life expectancy has doubled from 30 years (1800) to 71,4 years (2015). The world’s GDP has increased a 100 times and - despite the growing population - the number of people living in abject poverty is decreasing.But what about the challenges we’re facing today? The deplorable state of nature, extinctions and climate change? Yes, Steven Pinker acknowledges that these challenges exist, but where other relapse in doom scenario’s. Pinker advocates for a continuation of an optimal relation between (economic) progress and pollution. If humanity wants to survive, it needs to invest in progress itself: only after achieving a certain amount of welfare, people are willing to invest in (and sacrifice themselves for) a better environment. In other words, keep investing in the core values of the Enlightenment: rationalism, science and humanism. And yes, this includes nuclear energy, as a clean way of energy.In the last part of the book, Pinker delves into the current problems of the left and the right. The left thinks that the world is being plagued by inequality and the environment being endangered, the right think that his ‘culture’ is being destroyed by immigrations and minorities. Fact and figures that show that this is not the case, are being falsified or simply denied.The problem that I had with this book was its lack of nuance. He knows, or thinks he knows all, and does not refrain from his mantra that all is well, and will be well. There is no room for any considerations for those who - even today - might not be living their lives to their full capacity. Not because they don’t want to, but because they are simply kept from achieving it.

225,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48909861-dan-ust,4,"Overall a good book, though I believe Pinker overstates his case and is too narrowly focused on the Enlightenment itself — as if all progress were waiting for the 18th century to really start. This is strange given his earlier book, _The Better Angels of Our Nature_, where he documents the reduction in violence from the Stone Age on.He minimizes things like improved capabilities, while fine in themselves, can also breed greater risks. He does recognize this in the case of nuclear weapons. (One can argue that both ways: maybe nuclear deterrence has reduced or ended wars between major powers. But the devastation of one such weapon is certainly progress of a type many would question.)Also, he has what might best be called stylistic ticks. These wouldn’t be as bad in a brief talk, but became more vexing to me as I read the near 500 pages of the main text. (There are extensive footnotes worth mining too. I’ve read or skimmed a number of the works he cites.) By these I mean he seems to have to reword adages or quote songs and the like for somewhat comic effect. This works sometimes, but when it feels like every section must have one or two, it feels like padding in an already long work.I winced a little at his oversimplification of intellectual history, too, though I believe his trashing of Nietzsche is spot on. I winced further at his seeming to think the ruling class simply wants the best for everyone rather than it’s often resistant to progress and benefits from “gloom and doom” attitudes. (Politicians don’t run on the slogan that things are okay and getting better. Instead, election campaigns are morality plays where good is battling evil, where one side will redeem us and move is forward from the collapsing state we find ourselves in while the other wishes to push society over a cliff.)In many ways, too, Pinker’s work is an update of that of economist Julian Simon. One can argue that Pinker will have a greater impact because he’s not an economist and, despite my reservations above, is a much more accessible and wittier writer. (To be fair, it’s been a while since I’ve read Simon.)Ian Goldin also wrote a balanced review for Nature:https://www.nature.com/articles/d4158..."
226,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"This book was simply amazing. I've read the whole thing in less than two weeks. The material was very captivating, and the chapters in the book are well organized, allowing for natural breaks. Steven Pinker, the author, provides a rational and balanced view of the current state of humankind, how we got here, and where we're headed. He dives into vital topics directly and doesn't hold back or avoid anything. The book covers topics such as wealth, health, quality of life, society as a whole, climate change, education, and a lot more.The information shared is also backed up by real data which is quite refreshing. We're all surrounded with so much negativity from the mainstream news which can make the world seem like a terrible place to live in. And with this book, what I enjoyed was the more balanced presentation of the data without resorting to fear-mongering, which is so common these days with clickbait media.If you have any doubts, this book will open your eyes to the fact that we're all living in the best time for humankind since the beginning of our existence and things are getting better.As much as I enjoyed the optimistic viewpoint on certain topics in this book, I also like the fact that the author didn't exclude critical areas we as humans need to work on — one of those being climate change.There's very little doubt about the current situation with climate change and the urgency at which we need to operate to avoid a global disaster. The truth is, we all have to step up and do our part as this presents one of the biggest challenges for humankind yet.Overall, this book is a great read, and I highly recommend it. It covers so many important areas, and I'm glad I decided to read it. I have no doubts you'll enjoy it as much as I did."
227,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5196256-mindy,1,"I read this because Bill Gates highly recommended it, and because I felt I needed a more optimistic view of the progress of humanity. Why did I think Bill Gates’ reading list would hold any interest for me? This book is simply further evidence that all data can be manipulated to achieve a purpose. If you include yourself among the world’s wealthiest “citizens”, this is a great read to assuage any hint of privilege-related guilt you may feel. The extremely poor are in decline, and if the bulk of humanity is now simply poor, they should be content with their plight and thank their overlords from lifting them out of the squalor. I kept reading hoping for a redeeming moment. It never happened."
228,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"In 2011 Steven Pinker wrote a magnificent book, The Better Angels of our Nature, in which he showed – by using historical analysis, statistical methods and informed estimates – how the world has gotten safer (hence the subtitle of the book: The Decline of Violence). The gist of the book was that there have been continuous social reforms that have led to an environment in which our inner demons have fewer opportunities to surface and in which zero-sum games have been turned into positive-sum games. In 2017, Pinker followed up his 2011 work by extending his scientific method to the whole scale of human progress. In Enlightenment Now he wants to show us how the world not only got safer, but also became a much more pleasant place to live in – for almost all human beings that are born. Pinker wants to show us that this progress wasn’t inevitable: it was a conscious effort of human beings to start – for the first time in history – to apply reason to the goal of making the world a better place to live. This is important, since it shows us to not be complacent and to take all the gains for granted. Pinker tries to convince us readers that the Enlightenment values that drove this progress have to be remembered by and re-stated to each new generation.The book itself is divided into three parts; I will briefly summarize each part in the rest of this review.In part 1, Pinker describes how in the Enlightenment era people started to use reason to understand the world (science) and to distinguish right from wrong (ethics). No more witch hunts; no more mythologies; no more harsh punishments; etc. According to Pinker, mankind has to fight continuously against three natural entities: (1) entropy (the increasing of disorder), (2) evolution (the competition of all against all; zero-sum games), and (3) information (increasing our knowledge). In this fight, reason is the most important, and only, tool that we have to – temporarily – create a good place to live for ourselves. Pinker sees two contemporary threats to this ideal though: religion and populism (left- and rightwing). His goal of the rest of the book is hence; first to show that real progress has taken place; and next, to convince us that this progress was driven by Enlightenment values that have to be defended. So, in part 2 of the book Pinker applies the scientific method to analyze the different domains of human progress. He uses lots of graphs and he meticulously describes all the relevant scientific findings – just like he did in his 2011 book on the decline of violence. In short, people live longer; are healthier; are economically better off, even though inequality increases; the environment is (slowly) better off and the climate change fatalism is misguided (especially in light of all the technological advances); the world is more peaceful and safer than ever, while terrorism is a minor (insignificant) blip; democracy and equal rights are strongly instituted; and knowledge is readily accessible for masses of people and ever-progressing. In the closing chapters of part 2, Pinker also states that the newer generations are much happier, healthier and experience a much higher quality of life than earlier generations. Within generations this progress is also visible. The hailed existential threats to progress – technological enslavement and nuclear war – are serious issues but there really is no reason to be scared shitless: human beings, according to Pinker, are better and better equipped to turn zero-sum games into positive-sum games (i.e. turning existential threats into cooperated effort to ward off disaster). Pinker finishes part 2 by claiming that progress, even though contingent (i.e. depending on human choices), is a self-enhancing cycle: as the world is better off each year, countries will tend to cooperate more and more and living conditions of all human beings will tend to increase. Minor setbacks, such as the Trump presidency and the Brexit referendum, cannot stop the long-term trend of ever-increasing progress.After showing us how much the world has progressed, Pinker turns his book into an essay. In part 3 he makes a case for three Enlightenment values that are, according to him, essential to actively promote and continue the progress we have already made. The first of these values is reason, which is under increasing attack by generations of postmodernists (“objective reality doesn’t exist”, “all cultures are equal”, etc.) and populists (“the will of the people should be followed”, “we need a strong leader”, etc.). Next to these two ideologies, human beings suffer from biases and hence the media portray a picture of a world that is almost continuously on the brink of World War III. Pinker, essentially, advocates a more rational public discourse, in which fact checking and statistical reasoning trump Trumpism (pun intended).The second value Pinker advocates is science. In other words: trial and error. Not just to gain more knowledge and hence receive more control over our lives (by fighting diseases, natural disasters, etc.), but also to base our policies on. Politics, according to Pinker, should be more evidence-based and less ideology-driven. This is the old argument of piecemeal social engineering promoted by Karl Popper: changing policy in small steps; measuring and evaluating the results of each step; and adjusting where necessary.Pinker notices a trend in literary and cultural circles, especially due to scientifically illiterate self-proclaimed intellectuals, to blackball science and act like science is the root of all evil. The truth is that science is a-moral – in the sense that it doesn’t say whether we should build a-bombs, nuclear reactors for energy, or both, and in which situation – and that science offers us the possibility to better our lives. It is due to science that we live longer, healthier and wealthier.The third and last value that Pinker advocates is humanism. Humanism is the answer to the problem of the a-morality of science: it tells us what to do with all the knowledge, wealth and technological possibilities. Pinker uses the ethics of one of the founders of the Enlightenment, Spinoza. According to Spinoza, any human being that is governed by reason will wish for any other human the same things as they wish for themselves. This is a strong ethical imperative, and Pinker uses the rest of the chapter to state it more fully (in short: consequentialism) and to refute the two counter-narratives: religious morals (which are, according to Pinker, humanized by humanism – with the exception of Islam) and populism/nationalism (which are inspired by the ethics of Nietzsche’s Übermensch and heroism).All of the above is my try to summarize Pinker’s thoughts as honest and representative as possible. Of course this is practically impossible: the book is huge and Pinker is much nuanced on all of the themes mentioned. But: what to think of it all?First, I applaud Pinker for stating clearly how far we have come since the 16th century: how much better off human beings are in the 21st century world. As Pinker himself repeats, it is trendy to be a cultural pessimist. All this liberalism and progress has led to atomized societies and hedonistic, empty lives. It is also very fancy to be a fatalist, especially regarding the environment and climate. Pinker's book is a healthy antidote to all this doom-thinking and the masses of studies and graphs he uses to back up his arguments make cultural pessimism and climate fatalism hard to sustain.Second, I think Pinker is right in seeing humanism, reason and science as the driving forces behind the world we live in nowadays. It is only when reason is set aside – consciously or unconsciously – that progress halts and that we fall back on our primitive nature and zero-sum value systems. I think he is also right in describing the two major threats to the world as we know it: religious morality and populism (again, left- as well as rightwing). So in all this, Enlightenment Now is a terribly accurate and timely book.But I do disagree with some of Pinker’s observations, especially the ones on happiness and quality of life. I cannot help but reflect that Enlightenment Now is written by a Harvard professor whose life is spent on creative thinking and intellectual effort to understand the world. I don’t think many of us can share this luxury, and that for many of us leading ‘normal lives’ life isn’t as fulfilling or free as we wish. Pinker’s line of argument is (albeit simplified): younger generations suffer less from addictions; commit fewer suicides; suffer less from depression; etc.; hence, they are happier than earlier generations and have a higher quality of life. I don’t know if the amount of suicides and depressions says anything (or much) about the happiness of people. And another problem with this line of thinking – which really surfaces throughout the whole book – is that it generalizes over everyone. It is entirely possible that certain parts of the population are worse off, but that this negative effect is swamped by an exponential increase of happiness by the rest of the population. For example, due to globalization, the world is better off, and the poorest people and the poorest countries are the real gainers in health and wealth; yet the (lower) middle classes and lower classes in richer countries are really worse off than earlier generations – combined with an ever-increasing decline of social mobility. The same thing goes with people in vulnerable professions or in vulnerable life situations: handicapped people, sick people, old people, etc. In all developed countries we see an ever-increasing jungle of rules and regulations, to guarantee an equal treatment for all people in like situations. This sounds beautiful and noble, but it results in health care workers clocking five minutes for washing elderly people; treating schoolchildren as revenue and future tax payers; making people who depend on social welfare end up in mazes of bureaucracy; etc. Is this truly progress? (Of course, Pinker would counter: would they be better off in the nineteenth century?)My point is that statistics are useful to describe general trends and to understand what causes play a role. When we understand what factors make the world a better place to live in, we can apply more of the same potion. Understanding is fundamental. But scientific studies of subjects like happiness - even apart from all the methodological issues involved - are rather empty when we're dealing with our own personal lives and our loved ones around us. Stating, for example, that more people are better off and that poverty declines, is a rather meaningless statement when talking to someone who just lost his or her job because his or her employer moved to a developing country. Personally, I think the diffusion of liberalism, the results of equal rights movements (including feminism), and decades of migration have led to a diminishing social cohesion in Western societies – and between countries worldwide. This is, for example, illustrated by contemporary elections: a huge assembly of small political factions and an increasingly polarized climate. It is also illustrated by the popularity of identity politics, in which individuals base their personal identity on biological and cultural traits. Western societies have degraded into collections of individuals without much common ground. Hence, all the rules and regulations to enforce equality: people don’t trust each other anymore – or at least less than before. I cannot help but remark that in Sweden there are plans to make laws to make two adults consent to have sexual intercourse - as if the intricate and complex dealings in real life can be translated and enforced by abstract laws. The same applies to the laws against islamophobia that the Canadian parliament put into practice in 2017. This is symptomatic of societies lacking social cohesion and reciprocal trust and commitment.I think Pinker is over-optimistic when it comes to a better world. He does notice an increase in global and national inequality and declining social mobility, but he doesn’t see it as serious arguments against progress. Of course, from a macro-perspective, the world is better off and this is a good thing. But people don’t like grim futures and this can become very problematic in countries in which large swathes of the population have to give up health and wealth to transfer it to developing countries – something which is inevitable if the world economy continues the way it does now. I think the safe thing to say is that Enlightenment Now is a reliably optimistic book on how the world as a whole is much better off in 2018 than in 1618. The causes of this progress are humanism, reason and science. On a grand scale, Pinker’s book is an important reminder of the possibilities of human progress – if/when we set our minds to it we can do a lot to better our lives. Yet by zooming out, Pinker steers around the (equally important) question of a declining standard of life for individuals and particular social groups and a feeling of loss of social cohesion. Yet, these last points weren’t the goal of his book, so I shouldn’t end this review on such a sour note. It’s a very interesting and readable book: read it!"
229,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1139239-michael-austin,4,"Steven Pinker is a rare creature in the academic world: a liberal who is not a leftist. As a liberal he supports things like free speech, civil rights, democratic ideals, and a strong government that ensures safety, protects the environment, and redistributes some portion of income to support education, health care, infrastructure, and the reduction of poverty. As a non-leftist, he supports things like a democratic government and a capitalist economy that, while subject to government regulation and income redistribution, still functions as a free market. Like most of Pinker’s books, Enlightenment Now is big and filled with lots of data, but actually very tightly argued. The sequence of his argument goes something like this:1.	In the eighteenth century, European intellectuals produced a movement that we call “the Enlightenment” that was built on four interrelated principles: reason, science, humanism, and progress. They set in motion revolutions in government, science, and culture that has shaped the world ever since. 2.	The Enlightenment worked. Over the last two and a half centuries, nearly every measure of human flourishing has increased dramatically across the world. People alive today are better educated, healthier, richer, and safer than they have ever been at any time in history. Major diseases have been wiped out by vaccination, extreme poverty has been substantially reduced by global markets, and war and violence have decreased to their lowest levels in world history.3.	Since its beginning, the Enlightenment has had to contend with “counter-Enlightenment” narratives from both the left and the right. Counter-Enlightenment narratives are those that portray the world as getting worse, either because people are falling away from religious belief and values (the conservative counter-narrative), or because capitalism has enervated the world for its own profit and turned 99% of people into labor machines that feed its insatiable greed (the leftist counter-narrative). 4.	The work of the Enlightenment is not finished. There is still poverty, war, and injustice. There are still threats to safety and to the environment. We still have many, many problems to solve. But these problems are best solved by using the tools of the Enlightenment (reason, science, and humanism) rather than by reverting to counter-Enlightenment narratives such as religious fundamentalism or Marxism to address them. As one who is, like Pinker, a liberal but not a leftist, I find myself agreeing with almost everything in this over-arching argument. Sure I have specific quibbles with all kinds of stuff. Pinker is not content to show that most things are a little bit better. He wants to be more comprehensive than that and show that everything is a lot better. And in the process, he often stretches his argument beyond what can be reasonably proved. But even adjusting for some hyperbole, the data he presents is overwhelmingly persuasive—not just that life has gotten better in the world since the 18th century, but that it has improved dramatically in just the last 30 years. During this time, extreme poverty has fallen from 50% of the world to 10%, the number of people killed in wars has fallen by 200%, criminal violence has decreased dramatically, cars are safer, more countries are democratic, and income inequality has decreased in all but the most developed nations. It seems to me that there is no reasonable way to refute the proposition that the world today is more amenable to human flourishing than it has ever been.But there are a whole lot of unreasonable ways to refute this, and this, really, is the most important part of the book. Pinker identifies two key cognitive biases that causes many people to reject the Enlightenment narrative that the world is getting better and embrace one of several counter-Enlightenment narratives that insist that the world is getting worse.The first of these biases is the “availability heuristic.” We have a lot more access to information than we have ever had before, so we see more of the bad stuff than anybody ever has. Our Internet and social media feeds immediately show us acts of racism, police brutality, mass violence, civil strife, and even genocide. We see these with much greater frequency, and when we do, our minds tell us that they are happening with greater frequency, which is generally not the case. But don’t try to tell us that, because we probably won’t believe it.The more troubling factor in our tendency to see a world in decline is the confirmation bias, which simply means that we tend to see what confirms our beliefs and ignore what does not. And we are attracted to narratives of decline because they fit with so many ready-made world views. They are, in fact, an indispensable part of contemporary politics.“We are doing well, but we need to do better” is not a good political message. “We are in decline and need to make America great again” is. And herein lies the fundamental attraction to narratives that cannot be supported by reason or data. We want to believe that things are getting worse, because this is the best way to accomplish political and religious goals. These narratives create fear, and fear motivates us to vote, to donate to politicians, to attend Church, to donate to Churches, and to agitate for change. We can do this through reason and science, of course, but it doesn’t work as well. And this is probably Pinker’s most important point: we are in danger of losing much of the progress that we have made as a nation, and as a world, by rejecting the principles responsible for that progress and embracing narratives that emphasize tribalism, magical thinking, resentment, and unwarranted fear. In the United States, we are rolling back the government regulations that have kept us safe and improved our environment, and we currently have an administration that insists that global relations are a zero-sum game. Globally, people are rejecting the vaccines that wiped out diseases and attacking the advances in food technology that have dramatically reduced hunger and poverty. Countries that once embraced secularism and democracy are starting to turn to religious fundamentalism. We are abandoning things that work in favor of things that won’t. And this is very dangerous. It is possible to argue with almost everything that Pinker says in Enlightenment Now. But those arguments must also adopt Enlightenment principles: showing where his reason fails, providing better evidence, rejecting conclusions that he makes because they are not adequately supported. This kind of debate is necessary and proper.Unfortunately, this is not the debate that we are having. Across the political spectrum, the Enlightenment ideals that Pinker champions are being refuted from fundamentally illiberal and unenlightened positions with a strong interest in making the world seem like a fetid hell hole that is only a moment away from the apocalypse. These arguments are dangerous because they appeal to the kind of thinking that caused most of our problems in the first place."
230,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,5,"There is no one alive who writes with the mind-sweeping clarity and breadth of knowledge that Steven Pinker possesses. Though there are other works of his that are perhaps more revolutionary (The Blank Slate) or ambitious in their singular explanatory power (How the Mind Works), it is this latest volume of his that is his most timely and all-encompassing cerebral broom.If the idea of needing to defend Enlightenment values is mysterious to you at this point then I can only pity you your global-scale ignorance or apathy. In Pinker, that cause of defense has found its most able champion. Offering an incredible array of 75 statistical graphs that are properly contextualized and interpreted, he has produced such an incredibly coherent and well-argued line of thinking that has enough independent and objective fact to annoy partisans of both sides of the political/philosophical spectrum. Much of the work seems to follow-up on several of the arguments brought forth in his previous volume, ""The Better Angels of Our Nature."" Following a deft summary as to what Enlightenment ideals and practices are, Pinker proceeds to show just how they have benefited society and the world as a whole ever since, where they have come up short, and recommends several new usages of these ideas for future mutual benefit. Along the way he casts off so many misconceptions and anecdotal ""arguments"" against the Enlightenment, something long overdue in writings by contemporary intellectuals who - alarmingly and genuinely stupidly - have distanced themselves from these values. This is not done with flippant casuistry or mere rhetorical prolepsis but with relentless data and cogent, in-depth examination. Some telling and amusing samples from the work include:""If you extol reason, then what matters is the integrity of the thoughts, not the personalities of the thinkers.""""While a vision of world peace may have given John and Yoko some good songs, it is hopelessly naïve in the real world.""""However long it takes, we must not let the existence of cognitive and emotional biases or the spasms of irrationality in the political arena discourage us from the Enlightenment ideal of relentlessly pursuing reason and truth.""This is the book of the year, no question. No one has this diverse array of knowledge, no one marshals their facts better, and no one does so with the ease of language that Dr. Pinker presents across a work of 500+ pages. In closing I will let him sum up one of the major points of this monumental achievement: ""Remember your math: an anecdote is not a trend. Remember your history: the fact that something is bad today doesn't mean it was better in the past. Remember your philosophy: one cannot reason that there's no such thing as reason, or that something is true or good because God said it is. And remember your psychology: much of what we know isn't so, especially when our comrades know it too."""
231,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58890815-andrii-zakharov,5,"There are a lot of bad reviews of Steven Pinker's new book out there, mostly arguing against some of his particular points taken out of context, putting words in his mouth, falsely attributing some agenda to him, or simply twisting his words. But reading the book attentively, one can't help but notice how much thought went into Pinker's formulations, and how careful he is with what he is saying and showing. The one detailed review I can recommend which appreciates the precision and is not politically loaded is Scott Aaronson's: https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p....Here, I will only give my brief impression. First, I must admit that I found some chapters in the book stronger than others. This is to be expected of a work that attempts to cover the whole span of the human condition across history, and do so in an exclusively data-driven, empirical way. For some developments, there is just not enough good data available, and so some of the conjectures and estimates will necessarily be better supported than others. That said, taken as a whole, Enlightenment Now is an exceptional piece of popular scholarship, providing a most enjoyable review of all the relevant aspects of human life. Page after page, figure after figure, relentlessly hammering home the crucial point way too many of us are unaware of: the world and our lives in it are continually getting better, along almost every conceivable dimension. One could argue at length about the data in each and every chapter. One could rightly point out that some of it is one-sided, that his historical accounts are incomplete and some of the conclusions premature. But the sheer weight of evidence makes it impossible to deny the central points:* life has been, and is, getting better for ever more people in ever more places* it is happening as we create new knowledge and use it to gradually solve problems* problems are inevitable, new ones will always arise, but problems are also solvable, given the right knowledge* the best system we have to create new knowledge is science* continuing to gradually improve our institutions will continue to bring incremental progress* we are facing many dangers, some of them existential, which call for unprecedented global cooperation and knowledge production to overcome* the ideas outlined above are, sadly, time and again attacked by hostile ideologies from all sides of the political spectrum, and have to be defended if we are to continue our progress.These points were made very persuasively in the course of the book, and appear to me of paramount importance. Reading Enlightenment Now significantly shifted my worldview towards conditional future optimism, motivating to work very hard to sustain our amazing progress so far."
232,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"Pinker builds on his previous book The Better Angels of Our Nature to make a strong case for enlightenment values.His writing is excellent and always an absolute joy to read.He puts apparent contemporary reversals of progress in perspective. He defends humanism. He pulls no punches discussing religion. He weighs in on economics as key to those Better Angels. He wipes the floor with Friedrich Nietzsche and his intellectual heritage in fascism, Nazism, etc. He backs up everything with scientific evidence. Even if sometimes the interpretation comes off a bit forced, he's still working on solid ground throughout the book."
233,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,5,"Steven Pinker was one of the first writers to kindle my passion for scientific thinking. When I read 
The Blank Slate
 in 2011, it exposed me to a host of intellectual disciplines that my undergraduate training in philosophy had neglected––most notably evolutionary psychology, skepticism, and the empirical foundations of human nature. Nearly a decade later, I am thrilled not only to have another opportunity to journey through Pinker’s impressive mind, but also that his chosen message is rooted in data-driven, responsible optimism. Given the psychological and political difficulties of 2017, I was on the verge of thinking that such optimism was nothing more than shrugging in the face of inevitable doom. But Enlightenment Now turned my frown upside down, made me feel good about being human again, and restored much of my belief that humanity still has a bright future (or many possible bright futures) ahead.If I could rename this book without worrying about marketing, my chosen title would be: Everybody Calm the Fuck Down: The Case for Sanity, by Steven Pinker. At a moment in global and American history when many citizens feel like the sky is continually falling, Enlightenment Now provides a hard-nosed critique of our tendency to indulge our inner Chicken Littles. Instead of taking the in vogue route of mining for new reasons why human civilization is inherently dishonorable and teetering on the brink of destruction, Pinker argues the exact opposite. To make his case, Pinker demonstrates that the Enlightenment, the great intellectual movement that precipitated the rise of modernity, has been a rollicking success:""This book is my attempt to restate the ideals of the Enlightenment in the language and concepts of the 21st century. I will first lay out a framework for understanding the human condition informed by modern science––who we are, where we came from, what our challenges are, and how we can meet them. The bulk of the book is devoted to defending those ideals in a distinctively 21st-century way: with data. This evidence-based take on the Enlightenment project reveals that it was not a naïve hope. The Enlightenment has worked––perhaps the greatest story seldom told. And because this triumph is so unsung, the underlying ideals of reason, science, and humanism are unappreciated as well. Far from being an insipid consensus, these ideals are treated by today’s intellectuals with indifference, skepticism, and sometimes contempt. When properly appreciated, I will suggest, the ideals of the Enlightenment are in fact stirring, inspiring, noble––a reason to live."" (5-6, emphasis his)This passage reveals both the considerable strengths and non-negligible weaknesses of Pinker’s position. Since I agree with Pinker’s outlook and think this book represents a hugely valuable contribution to the modern moment, I’ll deal with the chinks in his armor first and follow with praise. First, Pinker’s characterization of the Enlightenment’s success as “the greatest story seldom told” is an overstatement. I’d like to say it’s an overstatement that isn’t repeated in the rest of the text, but that wouldn’t be an honest appraisal. It’s my feeling that the Enlightenment-rejecting “intellectuals” in Pinker’s crosshairs––frustrating and myopic as they may be––do not represent a majority opinion in America or anywhere else. In fact, as Pinker points out, they do not even represent a majority of intellectuals:""During the 20th century, the landscape of human knowledge was carved into professionalized duchies, and the growth of science (particularly the sciences of human nature) is often seen as an encroachment on territories that had been staked and enclosed by the academic humanities. It’s not that practitioners of the humanities themselves have this zero-sum mindset. Most artists show no signs of it…Nor is the anxiety expressed by the scholars who delve into the historical epochs, genres of art, systems of ideas, and other subject matter in the humanities, since a true scholar is receptive to ideas regardless of their origin. The defensive pugnacity belongs to a culture: Snow’s Second Culture of literary intellectuals, cultural critics, and erudite essayists."" (389-90, emphasis his)This Second Culture is Pinker’s true enemy, and while he does a good job of calling them out directly in the latter chapters, some of his earlier assertions belie the genuine nuances that bolster the rest of the text. For example, the opening sentences of a chapter called “Progressophobia” read thus: “Intellectuals hate progress. Intellectuals who call themselves progressive really hate progress” (39, emphasis his). Such sweeping statements needlessly open a path for critics to characterize Pinker as nothing more than a Panglossian apologist for modernity; sadly, this path will be well-trodden given how Pinker has been villainized by the Second Culture and its acolytes (this review  is a good example). Here we find the downside of Pinker’s iconoclastic nature, which is not only the source of his intellectual vitality and undeniable wit, but also his most significant vulnerability.My other worry about this book is that, despite Pinker’s repeated claims that the Enlightenment’s success is not a justification for complacency in the face of extant problems, it may nevertheless end up playing that role in cultural and political discussions, as well as in the hearts and minds of readers. Over and over, Enlightenment Now caused me to take a deep breath and remind myself that things aren’t so bad, which is terrific for my personal health and state of mind, but probably not the best way to get me into the proverbial trenches solving humanity’s most difficult challenges. Of course, one of Pinker’s central claims is that the best way to fight those battles is to eschew unnecessary excitation in favor of calm calculation and reasoned negotiation. But I still worry that readers like myself––privileged first-worlders for whom modernity is working just fine––may utilize this perspective to thicken our own socioeconomic and ideological bubbles instead of heeding Pinker’s call to action. The lesson here is that Enlightenment Now represents just one important perspective amongst others, and should not be treated as a comprehensive guide to the world’s present state. In other words, it’s like any other intellectual endeavor.Okay, now for the fun stuff! As ever, Pinker has crafted a book that is engaging, cleanly written, and packed with dense and fascinating thoughts. Since this is a book about progress, we should start with Pinker’s chosen definition:""What is progress? You might think that the question is so subjective and culturally relative as to be forever unanswerable. In fact, it’s one of the easier questions to answer. Most people agree that life is better than death. Abundance is better than poverty. Peace is better than war. Safety is better than danger. Freedom is better than tyranny. Equal rights are better than bigotry and discrimination. Literacy is better than illiteracy. Knowledge is better than ignorance. Intelligence is better than dull-wittedness. Happiness is better than misery. Opportunities to enjoy family, friends, culture, and nature are better than drudgery and monotony. All these things can be measured. If they have increased over time, that is progress."" (51)Pinker is not posturing when he claims that these indicators of progress can be measured. His commitment to empiricism runs much deeper than that of most public intellectuals, as evidenced by the 70+ graphs/charts and 100 pages of notes/references that accompany his superb argumentation. While he is well aware that data generation is a flawed human process (404), the raw power of evidentiary convergence becomes increasingly undeniable as Pinker’s explication of progress unfolds over about 300 pages.In my view, Pinker’s most important insight about progress is this: “It’s in the nature of progress that it erases its tracks, and its champions fixate on the remaining injustices and forget how far we have come” (215). This dynamic can make progress very difficult to identify and acknowledge, since even a world that is improving will always create new obstacles during the process of rendering old ones obsolete: “Progress cannot be monotonic because solutions to problems always create new problems. But progress can resume when the new problems are solved in their turn” (44). While it may seem simplistic to some readers, I think Pinker’s characterization of the world’s difficulties as mere problems to be solved is a critical and often-elided truth that we need to rediscover. In a cultural milieu where doubling down on embattled ideological positions and demonizing one’s opponents is routine, it becomes heroic to refocus one’s attention and energy on discovering the empirical nature of a problem and following the road to solutions wherever it may lead.Of the seventeen topics Pinker addresses in his discussion of progress, the one that most pleased me was his chapter on the environment. This is a topic that many big thinkers still neglect, even though climate change is perhaps the most ominous long-term threat to the continuance of human progress. Pinker takes up the climate problem with distinctive poise, showing how sentimental, anti-industrial positions on the political left and denialist positions on the right have both failed to provide a viable platform for global climate action. He advocates for “Ecomodernism,” a nascent field of study founded on three tenets: (1) some degree of pollution is unavoidable due to the entropic nature of the universe, (2) industrialization has generally been good for humanity, and (3) technology is the primary tool we should use to mitigate environmental damage without relinquishing the myriad benefits of modern life (123-4).While Second Culturists will surely write Pinker off as an obsequious technocrat beguiled by the corrupt comforts of elite capitalist culture, a sober assessment of Ecomodernism reveals it as the most reasonable and realizable approach for dealing with climate change. Pinker advocates for a combination of solutions, including decarbonization, alternative energies, dematerialization, and nuclear power––no silver bullets here. His recommendations, especially on the nuclear issue, pay no heed to the entrenched ideological positions of climate warriors or denialists, but rather follow the evidence wherever it leads. Climate change is serious and daunting, but panicking and using it as an excuse to upend the economic and institutional foundations of progress is foolish. This message is starkest in Pinker’s takedown of Naomi Klein’s position that the only way to address climate change is to raze contemporary capitalism and rebuild it with a much heavier emphasis on centrally-planned economies. His critique was especially salutary for me, given that I was completely seduced by Klein’s point of view when I read This Changes Everything back in 2014. I love an opportunity to update my opinions and reflect on the informational and perspectival limitations of my past selves.Instead of succumbing to the idea that humanity must repent for the great sin of modernity, Pinker instead demonstrates that we can approach this daunting challenge with a rational maturity:""It’s time to retire the morality play in which modern humans are a vile race of despoilers and plunderers who will hasten the apocalypse unless they undo the Industrial Revolution, renounce technology, and return to an ascetic harmony with nature. Instead, we can treat environmental protection as a problem to be solved: how can people live safe, comfortable, and stimulating lives with the least possible pollution and loss of natural habitats?"" (134)As it has always been, the solution is to press forward using the human wellsprings of creativity and innovation; it does no good to nostalgically pine for previous eras when life for average folks and even most elites was much worse than today.Also laudable is Pinker’s defense of rationality, which is endangered by political partisanship and religious/magical thinking. Pinker’s rejection of political partisanship, which he likens to sports fandom, is particularly valuable (359-60). He lays out a battery of research showing how ideologues bend over backwards to deny their opponents the benefit of the doubt, then ties it off with a much-needed reminder that progress is not owned by any individual or group, but is rather the collective result of countless actions and shifts over time that can come from even the most unlikely places:""It should not be surprising that the facts of human progress confound the major -isms. The ideologies are more than two centuries old and are based on mile-high visions such as whether humans are tragically flawed or infinitely malleable, and whether society is an organic whole or a collection of individuals. A real society comprises hundreds of millions of social beings, each with a trillion-synapse brain, who pursue their well-being while affecting the well-being of others in complex networks with massive positive and negative externalities, many of them historically unprecedented. It is bound to defy any simple narrative of what will happen under a given set of rules. A more rational approach is to treat societies as ongoing experiments and open-mindedly learn the best practices, whichever part of the spectrum they come from."" (365)All of us are inescapably embedded in Pinker’s “real society,” and our ability to intelligently acknowledge and navigate this messy reality can stave off madness and keep progress coming.Enlightenment Now closes with Pinker’s celebration of humanism––a strong message that rehabilitated my humanist loyalties, which took a hit when I read Yuval Noah Harari’s 
Homo Deus
 last year. I still wonder how humanism will stay relevant as we evolve into new transhuman and posthuman forms, but I’ve no doubt that Pinker’s perspective is the right one for the here and now:""The first step toward wisdom is the realization that the laws of the universe don’t care about you. The next is the realization that this does not imply that life is meaningless, because people care about you, and vice versa. You care about yourself, and you have a responsibility to respect the laws of the universe that keep you alive, so don’t squander your existence. Your loved ones care about you, and you have a responsibility not to orphan your children, widow your spouse, and shatter your parents. And anyone with a humanistic sensibility cares about you, not in the sense of feeling your pain––human empathy is too feeble to spread itself across billions of strangers––but in the sense of realizing that your existence is cosmically no less important than theirs, and that we all have a responsibility to use the laws of the universe to enhance the conditions in which we all can flourish.""

236,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3055905-nils,1,"Dr Pangloss lives! I’m unconvinced that the various Enlightenments (there actually were several distinct Enlightenments, though Pinker seems unaware of this), much as I love them, can really be credited for the huge increase in human material well-being that has taken place over the last couple of centuries. This turns out not to be a trivial critique, since Pinker’s argument that the Enlightenment is what “caused” the material improvement drives his conclusion that the main threat to sustaining that improvement comes from those who he alleges are undermining the Enlightenment, e.g. the so-called postmodernists. This in turn leads to Pinker’s bizarre suggestion that the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche represent a greater threat to our sustained material well-being than, say, Exxon-Mobil and the Koch brothers. Judge for yourself whether you find that plausible.In fact, the real underpinning the material gains of the last two centuries have been more institutional than ideational. This in turn implies that we must scrutinize the solidity of our institutional matrix if we want a real purchase of the sustainability of these gains. First, there have been numerous civilizations achieving marked improvement in the welfare and well-being of their populations – at least their upper classes. The Maya, the Romans, and several dynastic episodes of the Chinese achieved such gains. Of course, the gains that industrial modernity has achieved over the last quarter millennium outstrips all previous improvements. But taking the longer view, the gains of modernity are perhaps less impressive than they seem. Almost all those gains have taken place in the last quarter millennium, and 250 years, after all, isn’t that long of a run for a civilization. Other historical civilizations have sustained their gains for much longer. The Roman Empire’s eastern branch basked in cultural glory for a thousand years. And even though it’s usually meant pejoratively, it’s no coincidence that the word “byzantine” is a synonym for institutional complexity.Second, there are reasons to suspect that modernity’s run of material amelioration may be drawing to a close—and may even go into reverse. Broadly speaking these reasons can be divided in two. The first concern biophysical limits to growth. These are enduring arguments that the Breakthrough Institute has done much to illuminate and clarify, so suffice to say that, as a long term proposition, Malthus hasn’t yet been proven wrong, and climate change presents challenges of unprecedented scale that will only be addressed if there is sufficient collective political will to overcome collective action and free riding challenges. It’s at best unclear whether we have the global social capital to do so. Put another way: we live in an era of wicked problems.My own skepticism about whether humanity can overcome these challenges brings me to my fundamental critique of Pinker’s optimism: not only the sustainability of the gains of the last quarter millennium, but also the extensibility of these to larger sections of humanity, as well as the ability to address the growing headwinds posed by anthropogenic climate change depend crucially on a massive strengthening of our global institutional and governance infrastructure. From this perspective, all the indicators are sharply negative over the last fifty and especially the last ten years.For nearly fifty years, Gallup has run a series of polls asking Americans about their confidence in various institutions – universities, the media, business, political institutions, and so forth. While the data are noisy, the overall trendline is inexorably downwards. The decline in confidence is partly the result of sustained anti-institutional propaganda, which exists in both leftwing and rightwing versions. But as I have argued elsewhere, I believe the root cause of this declining trust is the objectively poor institutional performance and a lack of elite accountability. A general feature of late modernity is a declining faith in social authority of all sorts, as ever more individuated and autonomous polities become ever less willing to entrust political agents to do anything. The advent of Donald Trump is merely a symptom of both the failure and the rejection of institutions in the United States.Nor is this just an American phenomenon. The rise of populism across Europe likewise reflects distrust of institutions. The Brexit vote two years ago of course represented a direct rebuke to transnational institutions. More recently, the triumph in the Italian elections of the Five Start Movement, whose calling card was a rejection of political party infrastructure, signaled nothing if not a rejection of institutions. (It remains unclear whether the Movement can manage even a small city, let alone Italy as a whole.)With the United States in the grip of Trumpism and the European Union caught between shambolic national politics and collective dissolution, the primary hope for global leadership seems to be falling by default to the Chinese. Some people have argued that China is filling the institutional gap left by a receding Europe and the United States. Eric X. Li, for example, recently argued that Xi Jinping’s merging of Chinese state and party infrastructure makes sense given that “the party has developed into the most competent national political institution in the world today.” What this bold claim tacitly conceded is that, despite the huge successes the Chinese state has had in poverty reduction over the last 40 years, China’s existing institutions are inadequate to managing the bumpy course corrections that lie ahead if it is to sustain its gains.Even more worrying than the declining performance of global and national political institutions are the faltering institutional underpinnings of sustained technological innovation – innovation which everyone, optimists and pessimists alike, agrees is essential to any adequate plan for addressing the challenges posed by climate change. As Mariana Mazzucato has shown, state support for innovation and entrepreneurship has in fact been at the root of almost all major technological breakthroughs of the last 75 years. Specifically, much of this support has taken place through trillions of dollars of state funding for research universities. But universities today are under unprecedented assault. Variously accused of being hotbeds of leftist indoctrination, engines of neoliberal reproduction, or simply wastes of money, no one trusts universities anymore. (This is the real place where the “postmodernists” have something to answer for: they have both been a primary vector of critique of universities, in effect sawing at the branch they sit on, while at the same time provoking hysteria about the supposed insanity of the humanities, of which Pinker’s book is a characteristic example.) While it seems inconceivable that the United States in particular would flush away the linchpin of its technological, industrial, and soft power success, the cultural assault on universities today is unparalleled. Non-coincidentally, universities also face a funding crisis of unprecedented proportions, one that is hitting humanities departments first but which the STEM fields are unlikely to escape. All this threatens to cut the legs out from under the innovation engine that is critical to any effort to escape the grim climate reaper."

The author moved effortlessly and quickly from topic to topic to topic. That style worked here. So the 4 stars is for the entertainment value that I was able to place on this. Now with all that said, it usually bothers me when the author slants all the info to fit his views and then completely glosses over other things that might deflate his defense. While this author did that (abundantly), I didn't find it offensive or annoying. He had some well placed humor to soften that reaction. "
238,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68472482-daniel,5,"This is the best book I have ever read which is something I’m not saying lightly. It makes you so optimistic about the state of human progress and it makes you truly appreciate how much progress we have made over the past couple of centuries. It is really mind-blowing. If you weren’t already, it will also make you very optimistic about the likeliness of this progress continuing in the future with the help of, among other things, technology and today’s widely available information resources.Pinker goes through a wide range of subjects from Life expectancy, Peace and Safety to Equal rights, Knowledge, Quality of life and Happiness. He backs it up with rigorous research and clearly shows how almost every relevant parameter is going in the right direction. The only two areas that as of now haven't shown clear-as-day improvements over time are Terrorism and Global warming. (Another area, which Pinker didn’t include in the book, that could be considered a blip in the otherwise steady drumbeat of progress, are the recent reports of increasing death rates among middle-aged Americans over the past decade.) Focusing on the bigger picture analysis that Pinker provides all throughout the book rather than the daily news and shorter-term trends, you get the true picture of how well humanity is doing.One fascinating example of this is what Pinker calls the consumer surplus. Think about the washing machine. It saves us 10h per week compared to 1920 and costs a few hundred dollars. Now, if you think about how much someone would have to pay you for you to give up your washing machine, the number is clearly not in the hundreds of dollars anymore. Many people in developed nations would say that there is no price that would make them give it up. So not only are we richer but many of the utilities (and other things) that we use everyday can be bought for almost nothing compared to their actual value to us. This wasn't true 50 and 100 years ago. Another example is that today the average American worker retires at 62. Hundred years ago the average American worker died at 51.Pinker thinks (and I agree) that the media is responsible for a large part of today’s unfounded, but in many parts of the Western world, prevailing pessimism. As he puts it “When voters are inches away from the news, optimism can seem naive.” He points out that if newspapers would have elected to report more good news, they could have run the headline ""Number of people in extreme poverty fell by 137,000 since yesterday"" every day for the past 25 years.The book is structured in such a way that you can easily read only one chapter that you find interesting and skip the rest. There is for example a very good chapter on the environment and climate change if you want to read up on that. I do think Pinker misses some of the big potential risks in his discussion on AI, for example advanced AI systems in the wrong hands. And I think you can safely skim through the final three chapters without missing too much of an otherwise wonderful book.As a side note, the reason I decided to read this book was Bill Gates' glowing review of it some time ago. As you can see, I wasn’t disappointed. In his review, Bill said that he read the book very slowly because he loved it so much, but that he thought “most people will find it a quick and accessible read.” Perhaps he wrote the review in the ensuing euphoria after having just finished the book because I can assure you of one thing: this book is a lot of things, an easy read for most people it is not (it’s all relative I guess). But it is enormously fun reading and often highly enlightening so it's well worth your time. A big thank you to Pinker for putting things in the right perspective and allowing readers to see the bigger picture so clearly."
239,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21797839-rafael,5,"Ok, it took me a while to finish this one not because something is wrong with it but because the amount of facts and info it has on it, its a beautiful tesis on the world today facts about economy, politics, religion and social behavior, humanism is the sole purpose of this book and explains it with brilliant research, this a not an easy book but is a wonderful explanation on how science works and how research and enlightenment could and is guiding our future, we still a long way to go but if we keep preaching facts, science and critical thinking then out future will be bright, people just has to let go of religion and superstition, get educated, preach science, i really loved this book but is not an easy read, i'd say is must read for everyone."
240,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"In many ways, reading this book was similar to reading Pinker's book ""Better Angels of our Nature."" The theory of the book was straight-forward, the evidence was well-organized, and the insights from the data were presented clearly. The first drawback to reading this book is that it covers a lot of the same ground as ""Better Angels of our Nature."" The second drawback to this book is that...well, even if the conclusions of this book aren't common sense, to people who are roughly familiar with enlightenment ideals and are fairly well-read on current affairs, it sort of is common sense. That's a nice way of saying that there are few ideas in this book that will leave you awe-struck. That's not to see that Pinker isn't capable of writing such a book. I found ""The Blank Slate"" to be just such a book. That book remains one of my favorite books to this day. That is also the book I point to when I want to convince people what a great thinker Pinker is. Pinker's argument is straightforward and comes in the preface: ""I will present a different understanding of the world, grounded in fact and inspired by the ideals of the Enlightenment: reason, science, humanism, and progress. Enlightenment ideals, I hope to show, are timeless, but they have never been more relevant than they are right now."" (page 12). If Enlightenment ideas are timeless, then why do they need a defense? Pinker's answer: ""The ideals of the Enlightenment are products of human reason, but they always struggle with other strands of human nature: loyalty to tribe, deference to authority, magical thinking, the blaming of misfortune on evildoers"" (page 18). In many ways, ""Enlightenment Now"" is similar to ""Factfullness"" in its use of quantitative data to make the case that life is indeed getting better. Pinker's earlier book ""Better Angels of our Nature"" was also a book that relied heavily on quantitative data. However, by my recollection, that book did a better job of reflecting on how the numbers were arrived at. I think numeracy is an important skill, and too often it is easy to be wowed by numbers without realizing how they are produced and the difficulty of getting reliable numbers in certain contexts -- for example, the distant past and developing countries. My recollection of ""Better Angels"" is a few years removed, but I seem to remember Pinker doing a better job with educating readers on how numbers were arrived at. Having said that, I do think the graphs are presented in a useful and simple way. Often, the data comes in the form of time series line charts. I think the repeated use of these kinds of statistics is great for more casual readers who need to be convinced. Another drawback to this book is that it tends to ignore and short-change the possibility of cataclysmic blowups. The discussion of the disruptive power of AI is discussed briefly, but pales in seriousness to Yuval Harari's analysis in ""21 Lessons for the 21st Century."" The benefits of enlightenment are discussed abundantly, but Frankenstein monsters like mortgage-backed securities are barely mentioned. In addition, one of the most important trends of the 21st century, the explosion of debt is barely discussed. The looming debt crisis (or, I should say crises since we are talking about various kinds of debts, government, municipal, shadow banking, and private) as well as other potential crises with systemic implications -- climate change, the growing use of social media, the introduction of disruptive technologies -- are under-discussed in this book. And because these systemic crises are under-discussed, Pinker fails to deal with the mother of all questions about modernity. Does modernity increase the risk of catastrophic blow-ups? Since nuclear war, climate change, and contagious financial panics are the product in one way or another of modernity, science, and globalization, is there a likelihood that more potentially catastrophic phenomena could be birthed from them? And, if so, what can we do to prevent potential catastrophic blow-ups from occurring? Another way to think about the question is this way: In what ways is modern progress like a financial bubble? For me, a high point of the book was its discussion of tribal epistemology. I have read short articles on tribal thinking, but the review of the literature here was excellent. And for those who are searching for literature that discusses this topic, the book can make for an effective gateway. This was written in the Guardian about this book: ""More pertinently, the failed 2016 campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Remain demonstrated that, in the eyes of many people, “progress” simply meant more of the same. When people feel trapped and patronised by progress, then any alternative – even regress – will feel like freedom. Informing them that the policies of the past 40 years are still the best available starts to sound hopeless."" (Full review here: https://www.theguardian.com/books/201...)Perhaps that's another way of saying that technocratic modernity (complete with its wonky charts) can feel emotionally ungratifying. Instead of gradual improvements and progress by a thousand nudges, there is a part of the soul that yearns for liberation, heroism, and love. People like stories with heroes and villains. Enlightenment often sees the world in terms of mechanical and quasi-mechanical cause and effect relationships. Heroism seems less like heroism when it requires design and system-thinking rather than great sacrifices. Nassim Taleb, another writer whose work I admire, steeps his writing in decidedly non-modern ideas and sentiments -- his thinking perhaps is best described as classical and romantic. I believe anyone who reads this book ought to put it in conversation with some of Taleb's writing (one or two books is enough). I'm sure each of the authors would hate to hear it, but I'll say it anyway -- they are better read together than separately. The unabashed modernist/enlightenment thinker is better with a classical/romantic counterpart and vice versa. I will repeat this: People who are only familiar with Pinker for ""Better Angels"" and ""Enlightenment Now"" ought to read his earlier work ""Blank Slate."" That book, more than his more recent works, demonstrates that he is a true thinker and not simply a chart-jockey or dataphile. Overall, even if you do not need to be convinced of the merit of enlightenment ideas and ideals, this is a wonderful book to read. "
241,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,4,"If you're looking for a cure for the common pessimism, you might do much, much worse than to pick up this book. I've read or seen many other examples of the facts portrayed here, but Steven Pinker does a very admirable job of showing us, exactly, how much better the world is now compared to the one we had even a hundred years ago. It's not just time-saving devices or some outright reversals of ecological damage, but how lifespans, general IQ, overall poverty level, and even WAR has improved for the better for all. Not that war is ever really all that great, mind you, but few nations jump into it with quite as little reason or abandon as they used to.Pinker isn't saying that everything is peachy, of course, but the trend toward real positive progress is undeniable. This is, despite setbacks. And yes, we have many. But for every problem that exists, he makes a very good point that we have it in us to FIX our problems. It's not out of the question.Global Warming, for example, not only has possible temporary and minor fixes available, such as applying a metaphorical sunscreen to the atmosphere, but we have the means to do much more than cut our carbon footprint down to the bone. We have a history of moving on to different methods whenever resources of one type or another run out, too. Health and education are at an all-time high. What we don't have is our optimism. In fact, we have a very solid outlook that things are worse than ever. Terrorists are few in number and never accomplish their stated goals. They merely rouse the combined might of all the powers to quash them. Most of the first world countries have made a point of living by equality in the sexes and the trend is more of the same across the world. LGBT is already accepted on the same scale. Pinker attributes all our actual progress to the Enlightenment. The old standard of 19th-century thinking, where humanism reigns supreme. Look. I freely admit to being a humanist, myself. I LOVE the idea that we all should get along. That every life is valuable. That we should have a high fundamental basis for living for every man, woman, and child alive. It's so pervasive an idea that practically everyone shares it. It's like... OBVIOUS, right? And as far as I know, Steven Pinker is right. But he also makes a very cogent point about the need to be rational, to use science for what it is intended. Inquiry, truth-seeking. No matter what the result, the truth is much more important than any ideology. He uses this to encourage each and every one of us to see past the doomsayers and the demagogs. Again, I totally agree. Skepticism is not the same thing as pessimism. Almost everyone I know is a fundamentally decent person and we all want the same fundamental things.So why didn't I give this book a full five stars?Because he gives all the credit to humanism. Wishing does not make it so. He might be right, but let's face it: this might be what he, himself warned us about. Selection Bias.Even so, I love thinking about it and I totally recommend this book for anyone who is sick and tired of the news and wants someone with a lot of facts and good reasoning to pick them up off the ground, dust their shoulders, and tell them that we are, on the whole, doing pretty damn well for ourselves. You know, despite the actual problems. But then, we DO have it in ourselves to FIX THEM. :)"
242,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51602586-dominika,2,"I did not like this book.I would say that this book was middling for the majority of it. The idea of the book is that progress has already happened, and we shouldn't be as doom and gloom as we are. But for a man who emphasizes the use of data and critical thinking, he doesn't really read said data that well and some of his arguments are riddled with gaping holes. This was a book that was read at our book club (but I was the only person at that book club who read the book in its entirety) and one of the points was that you need to show that progress has been made in order to do more progress. I have mixed feelings: I feel as though that erases the issues that people are actually facing by trying to point out that ""oh but you won't die in the woods from an infection"". While it is nice that countries that were in extreme poverty 50 years ago are being lifted to the middle class, it won't matter to the person who is working 3 jobs at minimum wage so that they can support a family. We have a lot of great innovations in healthcare, but it doesn't matter when a person cannot take an ambulance because it will cost them $600. Some of the progress sections have rather weak arguments as well. The environment one was basically him saying that the system will fix itself (in terms of a capitalist system supporting renewable energy) and that we'll totally invent carbon capture technology. The happiness one also bugged me, because the data is just not consistent. But the section that really got my blood boiling was Science. First off, he tries putting his deregulation mindset against IRBs and says a really fucking insensitive thing about the Tuskegee Syphilis study (But black people worked on it and it's not like they were INFECTING people with Syphilis). And then the rest of it was a STEM circlejerk (Wah, why are these SOCIAL SCIENCES invading my medical research). I work in medical research and am working towards a masters in Epidemiology. We cannot live in our own bubbles, we must learn from different disciplines. Hard sciences bring data-driven analysis to every subject, but social sciences bring the ability to look at the whole picture. Humanities bring the ability to make these things appealing and also to think creatively, to gain inspiration. We need them all, and it's a shame that Pinker doesn't realize that.Oh boy, and I'm not even going to start on the Humanism section and his comments on Islam. Not only does he not see how Western Imperialism could have POSSIBLY encouraged a more patriarchal regime as opposed to just reading religious texts (Look at the south), he also is just full of double standards. Oh, and his arguement against Nietsche is that dictators read him. He doesn't seem to get the Nietsche is all about skepticism. I do really like the chapter on Ideas. While it isn't something that I haven't heard before, I liked the comment on how a lot of politics now isn't even about core fundamental beliefs, but about who's team is winning. The truth is, Pinker and I differ on some core ideologies. Pinker refutes Postmodern philosophy while I am very postmodern. We have some differing opinions on the amount of regulations things should get and whether systems will correct themselves. I understand that. I read Ayn Rand, and I felt as though more of the arguments were at least compelling (if not occassionally bat-shit crazy). I didn't feel the same way about Pinker.All of this isn't helped by how reading this book felt equivelent to eating raw almonds. It was bland, it was dense, Pinker repeated himself and would attempt some flowery tangent while utterly failing. My friend said he tried reading the book during his night shift job and then fell asleep, and then got the audiobook and fell asleep again. I know he's not trying to say that we shouldn't work hard to improve the world, but I don't particularly feel any inspiration from this book, particularly when the vast majority does try to read as a pat on the back in spite of his introduction. I felt like a majority of his arguments were flaccid with the occasionally toxic take, and this book in general was overbloated. "
243,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"In Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, Steven Pinker spends 550+ pages attempting to disavow you of any notion of ""the good ol' days"".And he IS pretty convincing. He's got stats and graphs and lots of evidence to bolster his case that we live in amazing times - that progress and Enlightenment-era ideals have lead to better conditions in almost every measurable sphere. And he's right. He spends some ink and time on why we feel the opposite so often - the world is a hell hole! - pointing towards psychological phenomena like the optimism gap, the availability heuristic, (leaning heavily on Kahneman and Tvorsky's work) and the tendency we all have to remember negative over positive.I didn't read his earlier book about the decline of violence, The Better Angels of our Nature, but this book looks like a more robust version of that one, with a broad focus to include public health, economics, climate change, nuclear weapons, and the timely discussion of authoritarian populism.It's not all roses and puppies, but there are many great things and amazing research that lead to more great things. That's a good thing to remember, and a clarion call to keep going with research and evidence-based activism. All in the name of progress and making things more equal."

However, it's clear things need to be taken with a large grain of salt. I admit, my initial five star rating was more out of the hopefulness associated with the book. Hopefulness that the world isn't really going to hell in a handbasket, and hopeful that the mass generalizations and questionable analysis of facts/statistics had a firm foundation. After reading Nassim Nicholas Taleb's multiple epic burns on Pinker in his book  Skin in the Game: The Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life, I had to reassess my star rating after I stopped laughing. Basically,  Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are, and  But What If We're Wrong? Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past.

GMOs, fertilizers, and vaccines have and continue to save billions of lives. The global standard of living has never been higher. In virtually every measurable way, life is better for us than it has ever been for any generation of humanity before us. True, Donald Trump is the president of the United States and average global temperatures are increasing. But those problems have solutions. Reason, science, and humanism.

247,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35-michael-siliski,4,"Recommended for anyone interested in a wake-up call about the progress made over the past few centuries.Enlightenment Now makes the case that the ideals of reason, science, and humanism have driven the greatest advances in the history of human civilization over the past few centuries. The book is divided into three parts: the history of the enlightenment, the progress we’ve made, and the enlightenment ideals that must be defended going forward. However, the meat of the book, and Pinker’s passion, is clearly the middle section, which is a thorough and data-based walk through fifteen areas where human lives are almost indistinguishably improved from just 10 generations ago, including health, peace, freedom, inequality, the environment, and happiness. Pinker’s enemies are “progressophobes” on both the right (the anti-science forces, the Trumpian politics of grievance) and left (New York Times-style liberal handwringing and catastrophizing). Both sides are prone to populism and a desire to return to an imagined utopian past. Pinker is successful in his main goal of thoroughly debunking that such a past ever existed.Enlightenment Now has a lot in common with Hans Rosling’s Factfulness, which I wrote about recently. Pinker is quite a bit longer and goes much deeper, so if you’re the type to ask for the data backing each claim, this might be the better book for you. I also thought Pinker was much more successful in grounding his celebration of human progress in a memorable framework.Both books suffer from a relentless optimism that can feel a bit strident at times. For Pinker, I thought this was most evident in his discussions of inequality and happiness, both of which felt a bit blithe to me. I think there is good reason to reject the most pessimistic takes on these: that more wealth doesn’t make people any happier or even that people are less happy these days, that inequality within a society is far more important than absolute means. Pinker does a good job making the case that inequality is not equivalent to poverty, and that “in some ways the world has become less equal, but in more ways the world’s people have become better off.” He makes a compelling argument that happiness is directly related to wealth, in particular using Stevenson & Wolfers studies. But these are not the same as proving “the irrelevance of inequality to happiness” or demonstrating that individual happiness is primarily driven by wealth. I thought these sections would be stronger if they didn’t reach quite so far.I agree with Pinker that reason, science, and humanism are critically important to human well-being globally, and these days it does feel a defense of them is needed. While I doubt that many who disagree with the thesis would even pick this book up, Pinker does make a similar point to Rosling that many of the most well-educated, including academics, are unaware of how much progress actually has been made through Enlightenment ideals. So perhaps there is hope that books like this could have a positive influence.From: https://medium.com/@msiliski/enlighte..."
248,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13941368-bakunin,4,"I usually wait a while to write a review of a book in order to digest all the important aspects of the work and this is certainly true in this case as well. Being somewhat of a libertarian with conservative leanings I found this book to be both illuminating as well as challenging. This book is Pinkers best attempt to defend the enlightenment; that is to say humanism, science and reason. He goes through many aspects quantitatively to prove his point - health, inequality, evironment, peace, safety, equal rights, quality of life etc - and all these things seem to be going in the right direction. Countries which are more democratic and more liberal are happier. This is essentially a more scientific defense of what Popper called ""the open society"". Although I find it refreshing to read a somewhat optimistic book in the midst of all the usual gloom one encounters in the daily press, I find myself in disagreement with Pinker. I agree with Pinker in that we are living the best possible time but what bothers me is the fact that I believe that the welfare state won't be able to sustain this growth (or progress if you will). Although Pinker has a certain classical liberal leaning, he is not very worried about the implications of an ever expanding welfare state: the destruction of the family, mass immigration, and the infantilization of citizens in the west. His liberal predilection is also shown by his apparent scorn of Trump and 'populism'. I suppose that this is where the rubber meets the road - I believe that communities are necessary and that the individual is not a tabula rasa. I also strongly reject the notion of an enlightened elite telling people how to better live their lives. While my values often may coincide with Pinkers, I believe in a slow and organic change in society, rather than a forced political one. Pinker by contrast scorns tribalist behavior and finds this to be reactionary; a force to be fought with a scientific mind. Although I have a certain buddhist leaning myself, I am slowly becoming more convinced of the need to be a person in modern society and the need therefore to retain certain elements of tribalism. Where to draw this line is however unclear. "
249,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75777506-tom-zacharski,2,"I picked ""Enlightenment Now"" after Bill Gates's recommendation. It's not every day that you hear someone like Gates recommend their favorite book of all time. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed. The premise of the book is that, as humanity, we are much better off nowadays than ever before in history. Pinker draws on many statistics, graphs, and facts to show that is indeed the reality. While I love that premise and couldn't agree more (we need more of those reminders in the age of 24h media) I found the language and general style a bit hard to read and unpleasant to a reader - it read a bit too much like a textbook and too often felt like going through well researched and academic in nature Powerpoint slides. The book could have easily been three times shorter and would drive the points home more effectively. Nonetheless, the points are important and if you've never read anything about how far we have come as humanity I do recommend the book. I recently saw ""The Final Year"" - a documentary about Barafh Obama's last year in office and how his foreign policy team operated during the time of a divisive, and later shocking, election. At one point Obama says that history does not follow a straight line, rather it zigs and zags, there's ups and downs, but it's our job to make sure the trend continues upward. And that trend is what the ""Enlightenment Now"" is all about."

There are also sections where it's nice to reread his thoughts, although most are straightforward enough that it's not necessary. His writing is clean & uncluttered. It follows a logical progression.There are 3 sections:1) Enlightenment2) Progress3) Reason, Science, & HumanismThe first two sections are great. I've read about the Age of Ignorance, its history, & its benefits before, but his is one of the best as he proves the benefit of the scientific method to mankind through some very telling statistics. I loved the section on how much wealth we now have comparatively. I've read comparisons about the cost of an hour of light, but it always impresses me. He shows how much less violence, starvation, & disease there is. So why do we think the world is in such danger? He thinks it's due mostly to brain bugs & loud extremists both on the left & right.The last section ""Reason, Science, & Humanism"" was preaching to the choir. It was long & boring at times. There was a lot of good information in it & while I agreed with him in general, he went over the top or underplayed several things. For instance, he seems to consider an existential threat as serious only if they'll kill off most people. He fails to mention how horrific a tragedy which abruptly killed 1% of our population would be (1% of 7 billion is 700 million!) or what the loss of an entire city could do to our society. IIRC, some have said it could take as little as losing 10% of the population to bring down our civilization since it is incredibly interconnected. Something like a nationwide outage of electric could be catastrophic even if it lasted a fairly short time. Cities only have a few days worth of food & places like LA rely on a lot of infrastructure. Millions are living in a desert, an area where the first settlement didn't make it.His thoughts on nuclear bombs were very simplistic & incomplete. Hindsight of what the Kremlin would have actually done during the Cold War based on records we're now reading is armchair quarterbacking at its worst. He also didn't get into the options of nuclear bombs like tactical nukes. I remember some talking heads discussing how great the tactical nuke option was going to be at one point. It was insane! Apparently he doesn't believe how close we were to annihilation.Worse, he dismissed the effect of the atomic bombs we did drop saying that the Japanese surrendered because the Russians were entering their area of the war. That's ridiculously simplistic, just one of many factors & I don't believe it was the deciding one. The Japanese were out of everything & the Allies were pushing them back in force. Kamikazes weren't their first choice as weapons, but born of desperation. In March, Tokyo was bombed by something like 300 planes - nothing like Dolittle's desperate raid of a few years before. It was a huge force with horrific results, but it was also understandable & they knew we couldn't afford it too often. In August, one plane dropped one bomb that was about as bad. A few days later, we repeated the trick. They didn't know the cost or how many more we had. How can anyone dismiss that?It's crazy hard to get fissionable materials, but they aren't the only nuclear threat. It's a lot easier to get radioactive waste & spread it around with conventional explosives. It doesn't take a genius & if it or a biological/chemical agent is put in the right place, someplace upwind. It could be devastating. Not an end of the world catastrophe, but up there with the Twin Towers. I don't think it's particularly likely, but everyone thought Clancy's novel, Debt of Honor (1994) was just unlikely fiction, too. If you haven't read it, a guy crashes a jet into Congress & pretty much wipes them all out. This was 7 years before 9/11, but airline security didn't change so his dismissive attitude towards terrorists seems a bit over done. Still, I generally agreed with him. We can be too anxious. Current airline security is a good example, but there are a lot of smart people trying to keep us safe. We're walking a tightrope between safety & losing our freedoms. Our anxiety only makes the latter more likely, so I'm glad of his perspective.Overall, it's a good book. If you're super religious or a big Trump supporter, you'll probably dislike the last section especially. Pinker beats on both sides of the aisle, but the anti-humanist & anti-science of the current administration is in front of us now, so he gives a lot of good reasons for his negative opinions.Highly recommended in any format, but do get the PDF with the audiobook. Very well narrated."

What is progress? You might think that the question is so subjective and culturally relative as to be forever unanswerable. In fact, it’s one of the easier questions to answer. Most people agree that life is better than death. Health is better than sickness. Sustenance is better than hunger. Abundance is better than poverty. Peace is better than war. Safety is better than danger. Freedom is better than tyranny. Equal rights are better than bigotry and discrimination. Literacy is better than illiteracy. Knowledge is better than ignorance. Intelligence is better than dull-wittedness. Happiness is better than misery. Opportunities to enjoy family, friends, culture, and nature are better than drudgery and monotony. All these things can be measured. If they have increased over time, that is progress. 
The subtitle of Enlightenment Now is: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, and as someone who has benefitted from all of these – in all of the ways enumerated in the opening quote – I don't know to what extent I needed the “case to be made” for these values. The difficulty I had is that while author Steven Pinker does define and defend each of these principles throughout the book, he is actually attempting to make the case for optimism – as though the entire world today has progressed in the direction of betterment (to greater or lesser degrees), as a direct result of Enlightenment thinkers, and as there isn't any problem facing us that can't be solved by doubling down on Enlightenment thinking and the advancement of science and technology, anyone who tends to pessimism (whether over the environment, existential angst, or the rise of populism and despotism) simply needs a long history lesson about all the ways in which things have gotten better and better. Pinker includes more than seventy graphs with pleasing curves (trending up or down over time, depending on whether they're tracking positive or negative metrics), he provides double, or even triple, digit footnotes for each chapter (assuring me that every statement he makes is backed by published sources), and with thirty fine-print pages of references at the end, I couldn't possibly track them all down in order to reach my own conclusions about the state of the world. The reader is repeatedly asked to take Dr. Pinker's word for it that everything is progressing well (towards a place of measurable betterment for humanity), and as I found myself often squirming with the uneasiness of not just wanting to take his word for it, and as I also found myself without the informational/philosophical background from which to dispute his arguments, I couldn't always follow where Pinker wanted to lead me; often as impatient with myself as with him. I'm glad I read this book – at least in an effort to understand what the big debates of our time might be – but I just don't have the knowledge base to properly respond to Pinker's arguments; three stars reflects my not taking a stand on this one.So, I'll make an aesthetic judgment: Pinker stretched my concentration with his frequent philosophical references to hermeneutics, dialectics, ontological this and that, but when he would descend to informal/hippie references to presumably lighten things up (many retirees are happy “seeing the national parks in a Winnebago, or dandling Vera, Chuck, and Dave in a cottage on the Isle of Wight”; drivers safely enjoy the pleasures of “seeing the USA in their Chevrolet, or just cruising down the streets, feeling out of sight, spending all their money on a Saturday night”), I found the writing forced, or worse, anachronistic. And I grew impatient with Pinker's smugly rhetorical strawman-punchline gags:
There is no law of complex systems that says that intelligent agents must turn into ruthless conquistadors. Indeed, we know of one highly advanced form of intelligence that evolved without this defect. They’re called women.
Or:
Of course, one can always imagine a Doomsday Computer that is malevolent, universally empowered, always on, and tamperproof. The way to deal with this threat is straightforward: don't build one.
Other ideas that made me squirm: Pinker stresses the need for rational thinking and the belief that the scientific method is the only way of measuring the world (using that, at a stroke, to dismiss human consciousness as a mere byproduct of evolution and the nonexistence of gods as an accepted fact). History progresses in one direction, and so long as we continue to embrace Enlightenment thinking and turn to science to solve our problems, there will be no environmental doomsday, no nuclear wars, no real terrorist threat to democracy, no Singularity (no “foom”). Pinker insists that science is politically bipartisan and he takes swipes at the anti-progressivism of the left (those who are reflexively anti-GMO, anti-vaccine, anti-nuclear) and the anti-intellectualism of the right (those who are creationists, anti-immigration, protectionist), and while that might make him seem a neutral party, Pinker never misses an opportunity to name President Trump as the anti-Enlightenment bogeyman who could reverse centuries of human progress. And since, as I pointed out, I don't feel qualified to confront Pinker on his facts, here is some of the professional response to Enlightenment Now (note: I chose to share reviews from left-slanting sources in order to prevent partisan fakenewsmanship):From the (officially bipartisan but purportedly leftwing) Australian public broadcaster, ABC –Pinker never seems to see the force of the question: How do we know that all this did not take place in spite of, rather than because of, the Enlightenment? In fact, he doesn't even pretend to go to the trouble of establishing a causal connection between his contentious version of the Enlightenment and the various improvements that he imagines follow in its wake. Post hoc, ergo propter hoc seems to be the operative principle. From New Statesman, a British newsmagazine that self-describes as having a “liberal, sceptical political position” –Judged as a contribution to thought, Enlightenment Now is embarrassingly feeble. With its primitive scientism and manga-style history of ideas, the book is a parody of Enlightenment thinking at its crudest. A more intellectually inquiring author would have conveyed something of the Enlightenment’s richness and diversity. Yet even if Pinker was capable of providing it, intellectual inquiry is not what his anxious flock demands. Only an anodyne, mythical Enlightenment can give them what they crave, which is relief from painful doubt.From The Globe & Mail, a decidedly progressive Canadian daily newspaper –
Pinker's gripe is largely aesthetic. A prominent egghead who writes and composes himself with Spock-like coldness and clarity, he seems annoyed at the frenzy (and so, irrationality) of ""editorialists,"" ""climate justice warriors,"" ""relativists,"" and the ""politically correct"" left. What Pinker never substantially considers is that such frenzy – whether deployed as a deliberate political tactic, or manifesting as the sputtering incoherence of the true believer – may help mobilize the spirit of change and progress; dams and ditches of passion that channel the turbulent tides of Enlightenment. 
And from one such “frenzied climate justice warrior” at The Guardian, the British daily that famously tilts left –
Pinker insults the Enlightenment principles he claims to defend. Could he have succumbed to the motivated reasoning these principles are supposed to suppress? If the environmental crisis cannot be so easily dismissed, it threatens his argument that life is steadily improving. What looks like a relentless enhancement in human welfare could emerge instead as an interlude between one form of deprivation and the next.
The bottom line: I slogged through this long read, encouraged by its optimism, but unconvinced by its argument. I was further annoyed by my own inability to articulate my increasingly negative response to Pinker's thesis, and recognise that as my own failing; I remain uncertain that I've adequately outlined my objections even with the addition of other reviewers' voices. Even so, I'm glad to have read this book and would recommend it to anyone interested in what “the eggheads” are talking about."
254,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5979619-boudewijn,3,"In this book, Steven Pinker wants to provide insight in the fruits of the Enlightenment and that the norms and values are still as important as everContrary to what you might believe, the world is in a much better shape than ever. Whether it is life expectancy, welfare, peace, democracy, knowledge or prosperity, there is not better moment to live than now.Most of the pages are dedicated with scores of statistics, all showing that things are going well. World life expectancy has doubled from 30 years (1800) to 71,4 years (2015). The world’s GDP has increased a 100 times and - despite the growing population - the number of people living in abject poverty is decreasing.But what about the challenges we’re facing today? The deplorable state of nature, extinctions and climate change? Yes, Steven Pinker acknowledges that these challenges exist, but where other relapse in doom scenario’s. Pinker advocates for a continuation of an optimal relation between (economic) progress and pollution. If humanity wants to survive, it needs to invest in progress itself: only after achieving a certain amount of welfare, people are willing to invest in (and sacrifice themselves for) a better environment. In other words, keep investing in the core values of the Enlightenment: rationalism, science and humanism. And yes, this includes nuclear energy, as a clean way of energy.In the last part of the book, Pinker delves into the current problems of the left and the right. The left thinks that the world is being plagued by inequality and the environment being endangered, the right think that his ‘culture’ is being destroyed by immigrations and minorities. Fact and figures that show that this is not the case, are being falsified or simply denied.The problem that I had with this book was its lack of nuance. He knows, or thinks he knows all, and does not refrain from his mantra that all is well, and will be well. There is no room for any considerations for those who - even today - might not be living their lives to their full capacity. Not because they don’t want to, but because they are simply kept from achieving it.

255,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48909861-dan-ust,4,"Overall a good book, though I believe Pinker overstates his case and is too narrowly focused on the Enlightenment itself — as if all progress were waiting for the 18th century to really start. This is strange given his earlier book, _The Better Angels of Our Nature_, where he documents the reduction in violence from the Stone Age on.He minimizes things like improved capabilities, while fine in themselves, can also breed greater risks. He does recognize this in the case of nuclear weapons. (One can argue that both ways: maybe nuclear deterrence has reduced or ended wars between major powers. But the devastation of one such weapon is certainly progress of a type many would question.)Also, he has what might best be called stylistic ticks. These wouldn’t be as bad in a brief talk, but became more vexing to me as I read the near 500 pages of the main text. (There are extensive footnotes worth mining too. I’ve read or skimmed a number of the works he cites.) By these I mean he seems to have to reword adages or quote songs and the like for somewhat comic effect. This works sometimes, but when it feels like every section must have one or two, it feels like padding in an already long work.I winced a little at his oversimplification of intellectual history, too, though I believe his trashing of Nietzsche is spot on. I winced further at his seeming to think the ruling class simply wants the best for everyone rather than it’s often resistant to progress and benefits from “gloom and doom” attitudes. (Politicians don’t run on the slogan that things are okay and getting better. Instead, election campaigns are morality plays where good is battling evil, where one side will redeem us and move is forward from the collapsing state we find ourselves in while the other wishes to push society over a cliff.)In many ways, too, Pinker’s work is an update of that of economist Julian Simon. One can argue that Pinker will have a greater impact because he’s not an economist and, despite my reservations above, is a much more accessible and wittier writer. (To be fair, it’s been a while since I’ve read Simon.)Ian Goldin also wrote a balanced review for Nature:https://www.nature.com/articles/d4158..."
256,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"This book was simply amazing. I've read the whole thing in less than two weeks. The material was very captivating, and the chapters in the book are well organized, allowing for natural breaks. Steven Pinker, the author, provides a rational and balanced view of the current state of humankind, how we got here, and where we're headed. He dives into vital topics directly and doesn't hold back or avoid anything. The book covers topics such as wealth, health, quality of life, society as a whole, climate change, education, and a lot more.The information shared is also backed up by real data which is quite refreshing. We're all surrounded with so much negativity from the mainstream news which can make the world seem like a terrible place to live in. And with this book, what I enjoyed was the more balanced presentation of the data without resorting to fear-mongering, which is so common these days with clickbait media.If you have any doubts, this book will open your eyes to the fact that we're all living in the best time for humankind since the beginning of our existence and things are getting better.As much as I enjoyed the optimistic viewpoint on certain topics in this book, I also like the fact that the author didn't exclude critical areas we as humans need to work on — one of those being climate change.There's very little doubt about the current situation with climate change and the urgency at which we need to operate to avoid a global disaster. The truth is, we all have to step up and do our part as this presents one of the biggest challenges for humankind yet.Overall, this book is a great read, and I highly recommend it. It covers so many important areas, and I'm glad I decided to read it. I have no doubts you'll enjoy it as much as I did."
257,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5196256-mindy,1,"I read this because Bill Gates highly recommended it, and because I felt I needed a more optimistic view of the progress of humanity. Why did I think Bill Gates’ reading list would hold any interest for me? This book is simply further evidence that all data can be manipulated to achieve a purpose. If you include yourself among the world’s wealthiest “citizens”, this is a great read to assuage any hint of privilege-related guilt you may feel. The extremely poor are in decline, and if the bulk of humanity is now simply poor, they should be content with their plight and thank their overlords from lifting them out of the squalor. I kept reading hoping for a redeeming moment. It never happened."
258,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"In 2011 Steven Pinker wrote a magnificent book, The Better Angels of our Nature, in which he showed – by using historical analysis, statistical methods and informed estimates – how the world has gotten safer (hence the subtitle of the book: The Decline of Violence). The gist of the book was that there have been continuous social reforms that have led to an environment in which our inner demons have fewer opportunities to surface and in which zero-sum games have been turned into positive-sum games. In 2017, Pinker followed up his 2011 work by extending his scientific method to the whole scale of human progress. In Enlightenment Now he wants to show us how the world not only got safer, but also became a much more pleasant place to live in – for almost all human beings that are born. Pinker wants to show us that this progress wasn’t inevitable: it was a conscious effort of human beings to start – for the first time in history – to apply reason to the goal of making the world a better place to live. This is important, since it shows us to not be complacent and to take all the gains for granted. Pinker tries to convince us readers that the Enlightenment values that drove this progress have to be remembered by and re-stated to each new generation.The book itself is divided into three parts; I will briefly summarize each part in the rest of this review.In part 1, Pinker describes how in the Enlightenment era people started to use reason to understand the world (science) and to distinguish right from wrong (ethics). No more witch hunts; no more mythologies; no more harsh punishments; etc. According to Pinker, mankind has to fight continuously against three natural entities: (1) entropy (the increasing of disorder), (2) evolution (the competition of all against all; zero-sum games), and (3) information (increasing our knowledge). In this fight, reason is the most important, and only, tool that we have to – temporarily – create a good place to live for ourselves. Pinker sees two contemporary threats to this ideal though: religion and populism (left- and rightwing). His goal of the rest of the book is hence; first to show that real progress has taken place; and next, to convince us that this progress was driven by Enlightenment values that have to be defended. So, in part 2 of the book Pinker applies the scientific method to analyze the different domains of human progress. He uses lots of graphs and he meticulously describes all the relevant scientific findings – just like he did in his 2011 book on the decline of violence. In short, people live longer; are healthier; are economically better off, even though inequality increases; the environment is (slowly) better off and the climate change fatalism is misguided (especially in light of all the technological advances); the world is more peaceful and safer than ever, while terrorism is a minor (insignificant) blip; democracy and equal rights are strongly instituted; and knowledge is readily accessible for masses of people and ever-progressing. In the closing chapters of part 2, Pinker also states that the newer generations are much happier, healthier and experience a much higher quality of life than earlier generations. Within generations this progress is also visible. The hailed existential threats to progress – technological enslavement and nuclear war – are serious issues but there really is no reason to be scared shitless: human beings, according to Pinker, are better and better equipped to turn zero-sum games into positive-sum games (i.e. turning existential threats into cooperated effort to ward off disaster). Pinker finishes part 2 by claiming that progress, even though contingent (i.e. depending on human choices), is a self-enhancing cycle: as the world is better off each year, countries will tend to cooperate more and more and living conditions of all human beings will tend to increase. Minor setbacks, such as the Trump presidency and the Brexit referendum, cannot stop the long-term trend of ever-increasing progress.After showing us how much the world has progressed, Pinker turns his book into an essay. In part 3 he makes a case for three Enlightenment values that are, according to him, essential to actively promote and continue the progress we have already made. The first of these values is reason, which is under increasing attack by generations of postmodernists (“objective reality doesn’t exist”, “all cultures are equal”, etc.) and populists (“the will of the people should be followed”, “we need a strong leader”, etc.). Next to these two ideologies, human beings suffer from biases and hence the media portray a picture of a world that is almost continuously on the brink of World War III. Pinker, essentially, advocates a more rational public discourse, in which fact checking and statistical reasoning trump Trumpism (pun intended).The second value Pinker advocates is science. In other words: trial and error. Not just to gain more knowledge and hence receive more control over our lives (by fighting diseases, natural disasters, etc.), but also to base our policies on. Politics, according to Pinker, should be more evidence-based and less ideology-driven. This is the old argument of piecemeal social engineering promoted by Karl Popper: changing policy in small steps; measuring and evaluating the results of each step; and adjusting where necessary.Pinker notices a trend in literary and cultural circles, especially due to scientifically illiterate self-proclaimed intellectuals, to blackball science and act like science is the root of all evil. The truth is that science is a-moral – in the sense that it doesn’t say whether we should build a-bombs, nuclear reactors for energy, or both, and in which situation – and that science offers us the possibility to better our lives. It is due to science that we live longer, healthier and wealthier.The third and last value that Pinker advocates is humanism. Humanism is the answer to the problem of the a-morality of science: it tells us what to do with all the knowledge, wealth and technological possibilities. Pinker uses the ethics of one of the founders of the Enlightenment, Spinoza. According to Spinoza, any human being that is governed by reason will wish for any other human the same things as they wish for themselves. This is a strong ethical imperative, and Pinker uses the rest of the chapter to state it more fully (in short: consequentialism) and to refute the two counter-narratives: religious morals (which are, according to Pinker, humanized by humanism – with the exception of Islam) and populism/nationalism (which are inspired by the ethics of Nietzsche’s Übermensch and heroism).All of the above is my try to summarize Pinker’s thoughts as honest and representative as possible. Of course this is practically impossible: the book is huge and Pinker is much nuanced on all of the themes mentioned. But: what to think of it all?First, I applaud Pinker for stating clearly how far we have come since the 16th century: how much better off human beings are in the 21st century world. As Pinker himself repeats, it is trendy to be a cultural pessimist. All this liberalism and progress has led to atomized societies and hedonistic, empty lives. It is also very fancy to be a fatalist, especially regarding the environment and climate. Pinker's book is a healthy antidote to all this doom-thinking and the masses of studies and graphs he uses to back up his arguments make cultural pessimism and climate fatalism hard to sustain.Second, I think Pinker is right in seeing humanism, reason and science as the driving forces behind the world we live in nowadays. It is only when reason is set aside – consciously or unconsciously – that progress halts and that we fall back on our primitive nature and zero-sum value systems. I think he is also right in describing the two major threats to the world as we know it: religious morality and populism (again, left- as well as rightwing). So in all this, Enlightenment Now is a terribly accurate and timely book.But I do disagree with some of Pinker’s observations, especially the ones on happiness and quality of life. I cannot help but reflect that Enlightenment Now is written by a Harvard professor whose life is spent on creative thinking and intellectual effort to understand the world. I don’t think many of us can share this luxury, and that for many of us leading ‘normal lives’ life isn’t as fulfilling or free as we wish. Pinker’s line of argument is (albeit simplified): younger generations suffer less from addictions; commit fewer suicides; suffer less from depression; etc.; hence, they are happier than earlier generations and have a higher quality of life. I don’t know if the amount of suicides and depressions says anything (or much) about the happiness of people. And another problem with this line of thinking – which really surfaces throughout the whole book – is that it generalizes over everyone. It is entirely possible that certain parts of the population are worse off, but that this negative effect is swamped by an exponential increase of happiness by the rest of the population. For example, due to globalization, the world is better off, and the poorest people and the poorest countries are the real gainers in health and wealth; yet the (lower) middle classes and lower classes in richer countries are really worse off than earlier generations – combined with an ever-increasing decline of social mobility. The same thing goes with people in vulnerable professions or in vulnerable life situations: handicapped people, sick people, old people, etc. In all developed countries we see an ever-increasing jungle of rules and regulations, to guarantee an equal treatment for all people in like situations. This sounds beautiful and noble, but it results in health care workers clocking five minutes for washing elderly people; treating schoolchildren as revenue and future tax payers; making people who depend on social welfare end up in mazes of bureaucracy; etc. Is this truly progress? (Of course, Pinker would counter: would they be better off in the nineteenth century?)My point is that statistics are useful to describe general trends and to understand what causes play a role. When we understand what factors make the world a better place to live in, we can apply more of the same potion. Understanding is fundamental. But scientific studies of subjects like happiness - even apart from all the methodological issues involved - are rather empty when we're dealing with our own personal lives and our loved ones around us. Stating, for example, that more people are better off and that poverty declines, is a rather meaningless statement when talking to someone who just lost his or her job because his or her employer moved to a developing country. Personally, I think the diffusion of liberalism, the results of equal rights movements (including feminism), and decades of migration have led to a diminishing social cohesion in Western societies – and between countries worldwide. This is, for example, illustrated by contemporary elections: a huge assembly of small political factions and an increasingly polarized climate. It is also illustrated by the popularity of identity politics, in which individuals base their personal identity on biological and cultural traits. Western societies have degraded into collections of individuals without much common ground. Hence, all the rules and regulations to enforce equality: people don’t trust each other anymore – or at least less than before. I cannot help but remark that in Sweden there are plans to make laws to make two adults consent to have sexual intercourse - as if the intricate and complex dealings in real life can be translated and enforced by abstract laws. The same applies to the laws against islamophobia that the Canadian parliament put into practice in 2017. This is symptomatic of societies lacking social cohesion and reciprocal trust and commitment.I think Pinker is over-optimistic when it comes to a better world. He does notice an increase in global and national inequality and declining social mobility, but he doesn’t see it as serious arguments against progress. Of course, from a macro-perspective, the world is better off and this is a good thing. But people don’t like grim futures and this can become very problematic in countries in which large swathes of the population have to give up health and wealth to transfer it to developing countries – something which is inevitable if the world economy continues the way it does now. I think the safe thing to say is that Enlightenment Now is a reliably optimistic book on how the world as a whole is much better off in 2018 than in 1618. The causes of this progress are humanism, reason and science. On a grand scale, Pinker’s book is an important reminder of the possibilities of human progress – if/when we set our minds to it we can do a lot to better our lives. Yet by zooming out, Pinker steers around the (equally important) question of a declining standard of life for individuals and particular social groups and a feeling of loss of social cohesion. Yet, these last points weren’t the goal of his book, so I shouldn’t end this review on such a sour note. It’s a very interesting and readable book: read it!"
259,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1139239-michael-austin,4,"Steven Pinker is a rare creature in the academic world: a liberal who is not a leftist. As a liberal he supports things like free speech, civil rights, democratic ideals, and a strong government that ensures safety, protects the environment, and redistributes some portion of income to support education, health care, infrastructure, and the reduction of poverty. As a non-leftist, he supports things like a democratic government and a capitalist economy that, while subject to government regulation and income redistribution, still functions as a free market. Like most of Pinker’s books, Enlightenment Now is big and filled with lots of data, but actually very tightly argued. The sequence of his argument goes something like this:1.	In the eighteenth century, European intellectuals produced a movement that we call “the Enlightenment” that was built on four interrelated principles: reason, science, humanism, and progress. They set in motion revolutions in government, science, and culture that has shaped the world ever since. 2.	The Enlightenment worked. Over the last two and a half centuries, nearly every measure of human flourishing has increased dramatically across the world. People alive today are better educated, healthier, richer, and safer than they have ever been at any time in history. Major diseases have been wiped out by vaccination, extreme poverty has been substantially reduced by global markets, and war and violence have decreased to their lowest levels in world history.3.	Since its beginning, the Enlightenment has had to contend with “counter-Enlightenment” narratives from both the left and the right. Counter-Enlightenment narratives are those that portray the world as getting worse, either because people are falling away from religious belief and values (the conservative counter-narrative), or because capitalism has enervated the world for its own profit and turned 99% of people into labor machines that feed its insatiable greed (the leftist counter-narrative). 4.	The work of the Enlightenment is not finished. There is still poverty, war, and injustice. There are still threats to safety and to the environment. We still have many, many problems to solve. But these problems are best solved by using the tools of the Enlightenment (reason, science, and humanism) rather than by reverting to counter-Enlightenment narratives such as religious fundamentalism or Marxism to address them. As one who is, like Pinker, a liberal but not a leftist, I find myself agreeing with almost everything in this over-arching argument. Sure I have specific quibbles with all kinds of stuff. Pinker is not content to show that most things are a little bit better. He wants to be more comprehensive than that and show that everything is a lot better. And in the process, he often stretches his argument beyond what can be reasonably proved. But even adjusting for some hyperbole, the data he presents is overwhelmingly persuasive—not just that life has gotten better in the world since the 18th century, but that it has improved dramatically in just the last 30 years. During this time, extreme poverty has fallen from 50% of the world to 10%, the number of people killed in wars has fallen by 200%, criminal violence has decreased dramatically, cars are safer, more countries are democratic, and income inequality has decreased in all but the most developed nations. It seems to me that there is no reasonable way to refute the proposition that the world today is more amenable to human flourishing than it has ever been.But there are a whole lot of unreasonable ways to refute this, and this, really, is the most important part of the book. Pinker identifies two key cognitive biases that causes many people to reject the Enlightenment narrative that the world is getting better and embrace one of several counter-Enlightenment narratives that insist that the world is getting worse.The first of these biases is the “availability heuristic.” We have a lot more access to information than we have ever had before, so we see more of the bad stuff than anybody ever has. Our Internet and social media feeds immediately show us acts of racism, police brutality, mass violence, civil strife, and even genocide. We see these with much greater frequency, and when we do, our minds tell us that they are happening with greater frequency, which is generally not the case. But don’t try to tell us that, because we probably won’t believe it.The more troubling factor in our tendency to see a world in decline is the confirmation bias, which simply means that we tend to see what confirms our beliefs and ignore what does not. And we are attracted to narratives of decline because they fit with so many ready-made world views. They are, in fact, an indispensable part of contemporary politics.“We are doing well, but we need to do better” is not a good political message. “We are in decline and need to make America great again” is. And herein lies the fundamental attraction to narratives that cannot be supported by reason or data. We want to believe that things are getting worse, because this is the best way to accomplish political and religious goals. These narratives create fear, and fear motivates us to vote, to donate to politicians, to attend Church, to donate to Churches, and to agitate for change. We can do this through reason and science, of course, but it doesn’t work as well. And this is probably Pinker’s most important point: we are in danger of losing much of the progress that we have made as a nation, and as a world, by rejecting the principles responsible for that progress and embracing narratives that emphasize tribalism, magical thinking, resentment, and unwarranted fear. In the United States, we are rolling back the government regulations that have kept us safe and improved our environment, and we currently have an administration that insists that global relations are a zero-sum game. Globally, people are rejecting the vaccines that wiped out diseases and attacking the advances in food technology that have dramatically reduced hunger and poverty. Countries that once embraced secularism and democracy are starting to turn to religious fundamentalism. We are abandoning things that work in favor of things that won’t. And this is very dangerous. It is possible to argue with almost everything that Pinker says in Enlightenment Now. But those arguments must also adopt Enlightenment principles: showing where his reason fails, providing better evidence, rejecting conclusions that he makes because they are not adequately supported. This kind of debate is necessary and proper.Unfortunately, this is not the debate that we are having. Across the political spectrum, the Enlightenment ideals that Pinker champions are being refuted from fundamentally illiberal and unenlightened positions with a strong interest in making the world seem like a fetid hell hole that is only a moment away from the apocalypse. These arguments are dangerous because they appeal to the kind of thinking that caused most of our problems in the first place."
260,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,5,"There is no one alive who writes with the mind-sweeping clarity and breadth of knowledge that Steven Pinker possesses. Though there are other works of his that are perhaps more revolutionary (The Blank Slate) or ambitious in their singular explanatory power (How the Mind Works), it is this latest volume of his that is his most timely and all-encompassing cerebral broom.If the idea of needing to defend Enlightenment values is mysterious to you at this point then I can only pity you your global-scale ignorance or apathy. In Pinker, that cause of defense has found its most able champion. Offering an incredible array of 75 statistical graphs that are properly contextualized and interpreted, he has produced such an incredibly coherent and well-argued line of thinking that has enough independent and objective fact to annoy partisans of both sides of the political/philosophical spectrum. Much of the work seems to follow-up on several of the arguments brought forth in his previous volume, ""The Better Angels of Our Nature."" Following a deft summary as to what Enlightenment ideals and practices are, Pinker proceeds to show just how they have benefited society and the world as a whole ever since, where they have come up short, and recommends several new usages of these ideas for future mutual benefit. Along the way he casts off so many misconceptions and anecdotal ""arguments"" against the Enlightenment, something long overdue in writings by contemporary intellectuals who - alarmingly and genuinely stupidly - have distanced themselves from these values. This is not done with flippant casuistry or mere rhetorical prolepsis but with relentless data and cogent, in-depth examination. Some telling and amusing samples from the work include:""If you extol reason, then what matters is the integrity of the thoughts, not the personalities of the thinkers.""""While a vision of world peace may have given John and Yoko some good songs, it is hopelessly naïve in the real world.""""However long it takes, we must not let the existence of cognitive and emotional biases or the spasms of irrationality in the political arena discourage us from the Enlightenment ideal of relentlessly pursuing reason and truth.""This is the book of the year, no question. No one has this diverse array of knowledge, no one marshals their facts better, and no one does so with the ease of language that Dr. Pinker presents across a work of 500+ pages. In closing I will let him sum up one of the major points of this monumental achievement: ""Remember your math: an anecdote is not a trend. Remember your history: the fact that something is bad today doesn't mean it was better in the past. Remember your philosophy: one cannot reason that there's no such thing as reason, or that something is true or good because God said it is. And remember your psychology: much of what we know isn't so, especially when our comrades know it too."""
261,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58890815-andrii-zakharov,5,"There are a lot of bad reviews of Steven Pinker's new book out there, mostly arguing against some of his particular points taken out of context, putting words in his mouth, falsely attributing some agenda to him, or simply twisting his words. But reading the book attentively, one can't help but notice how much thought went into Pinker's formulations, and how careful he is with what he is saying and showing. The one detailed review I can recommend which appreciates the precision and is not politically loaded is Scott Aaronson's: https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p....Here, I will only give my brief impression. First, I must admit that I found some chapters in the book stronger than others. This is to be expected of a work that attempts to cover the whole span of the human condition across history, and do so in an exclusively data-driven, empirical way. For some developments, there is just not enough good data available, and so some of the conjectures and estimates will necessarily be better supported than others. That said, taken as a whole, Enlightenment Now is an exceptional piece of popular scholarship, providing a most enjoyable review of all the relevant aspects of human life. Page after page, figure after figure, relentlessly hammering home the crucial point way too many of us are unaware of: the world and our lives in it are continually getting better, along almost every conceivable dimension. One could argue at length about the data in each and every chapter. One could rightly point out that some of it is one-sided, that his historical accounts are incomplete and some of the conclusions premature. But the sheer weight of evidence makes it impossible to deny the central points:* life has been, and is, getting better for ever more people in ever more places* it is happening as we create new knowledge and use it to gradually solve problems* problems are inevitable, new ones will always arise, but problems are also solvable, given the right knowledge* the best system we have to create new knowledge is science* continuing to gradually improve our institutions will continue to bring incremental progress* we are facing many dangers, some of them existential, which call for unprecedented global cooperation and knowledge production to overcome* the ideas outlined above are, sadly, time and again attacked by hostile ideologies from all sides of the political spectrum, and have to be defended if we are to continue our progress.These points were made very persuasively in the course of the book, and appear to me of paramount importance. Reading Enlightenment Now significantly shifted my worldview towards conditional future optimism, motivating to work very hard to sustain our amazing progress so far."
262,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"Pinker builds on his previous book The Better Angels of Our Nature to make a strong case for enlightenment values.His writing is excellent and always an absolute joy to read.He puts apparent contemporary reversals of progress in perspective. He defends humanism. He pulls no punches discussing religion. He weighs in on economics as key to those Better Angels. He wipes the floor with Friedrich Nietzsche and his intellectual heritage in fascism, Nazism, etc. He backs up everything with scientific evidence. Even if sometimes the interpretation comes off a bit forced, he's still working on solid ground throughout the book."
263,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,5,"Steven Pinker was one of the first writers to kindle my passion for scientific thinking. When I read 
The Blank Slate
 in 2011, it exposed me to a host of intellectual disciplines that my undergraduate training in philosophy had neglected––most notably evolutionary psychology, skepticism, and the empirical foundations of human nature. Nearly a decade later, I am thrilled not only to have another opportunity to journey through Pinker’s impressive mind, but also that his chosen message is rooted in data-driven, responsible optimism. Given the psychological and political difficulties of 2017, I was on the verge of thinking that such optimism was nothing more than shrugging in the face of inevitable doom. But Enlightenment Now turned my frown upside down, made me feel good about being human again, and restored much of my belief that humanity still has a bright future (or many possible bright futures) ahead.If I could rename this book without worrying about marketing, my chosen title would be: Everybody Calm the Fuck Down: The Case for Sanity, by Steven Pinker. At a moment in global and American history when many citizens feel like the sky is continually falling, Enlightenment Now provides a hard-nosed critique of our tendency to indulge our inner Chicken Littles. Instead of taking the in vogue route of mining for new reasons why human civilization is inherently dishonorable and teetering on the brink of destruction, Pinker argues the exact opposite. To make his case, Pinker demonstrates that the Enlightenment, the great intellectual movement that precipitated the rise of modernity, has been a rollicking success:""This book is my attempt to restate the ideals of the Enlightenment in the language and concepts of the 21st century. I will first lay out a framework for understanding the human condition informed by modern science––who we are, where we came from, what our challenges are, and how we can meet them. The bulk of the book is devoted to defending those ideals in a distinctively 21st-century way: with data. This evidence-based take on the Enlightenment project reveals that it was not a naïve hope. The Enlightenment has worked––perhaps the greatest story seldom told. And because this triumph is so unsung, the underlying ideals of reason, science, and humanism are unappreciated as well. Far from being an insipid consensus, these ideals are treated by today’s intellectuals with indifference, skepticism, and sometimes contempt. When properly appreciated, I will suggest, the ideals of the Enlightenment are in fact stirring, inspiring, noble––a reason to live."" (5-6, emphasis his)This passage reveals both the considerable strengths and non-negligible weaknesses of Pinker’s position. Since I agree with Pinker’s outlook and think this book represents a hugely valuable contribution to the modern moment, I’ll deal with the chinks in his armor first and follow with praise. First, Pinker’s characterization of the Enlightenment’s success as “the greatest story seldom told” is an overstatement. I’d like to say it’s an overstatement that isn’t repeated in the rest of the text, but that wouldn’t be an honest appraisal. It’s my feeling that the Enlightenment-rejecting “intellectuals” in Pinker’s crosshairs––frustrating and myopic as they may be––do not represent a majority opinion in America or anywhere else. In fact, as Pinker points out, they do not even represent a majority of intellectuals:""During the 20th century, the landscape of human knowledge was carved into professionalized duchies, and the growth of science (particularly the sciences of human nature) is often seen as an encroachment on territories that had been staked and enclosed by the academic humanities. It’s not that practitioners of the humanities themselves have this zero-sum mindset. Most artists show no signs of it…Nor is the anxiety expressed by the scholars who delve into the historical epochs, genres of art, systems of ideas, and other subject matter in the humanities, since a true scholar is receptive to ideas regardless of their origin. The defensive pugnacity belongs to a culture: Snow’s Second Culture of literary intellectuals, cultural critics, and erudite essayists."" (389-90, emphasis his)This Second Culture is Pinker’s true enemy, and while he does a good job of calling them out directly in the latter chapters, some of his earlier assertions belie the genuine nuances that bolster the rest of the text. For example, the opening sentences of a chapter called “Progressophobia” read thus: “Intellectuals hate progress. Intellectuals who call themselves progressive really hate progress” (39, emphasis his). Such sweeping statements needlessly open a path for critics to characterize Pinker as nothing more than a Panglossian apologist for modernity; sadly, this path will be well-trodden given how Pinker has been villainized by the Second Culture and its acolytes (this review  is a good example). Here we find the downside of Pinker’s iconoclastic nature, which is not only the source of his intellectual vitality and undeniable wit, but also his most significant vulnerability.My other worry about this book is that, despite Pinker’s repeated claims that the Enlightenment’s success is not a justification for complacency in the face of extant problems, it may nevertheless end up playing that role in cultural and political discussions, as well as in the hearts and minds of readers. Over and over, Enlightenment Now caused me to take a deep breath and remind myself that things aren’t so bad, which is terrific for my personal health and state of mind, but probably not the best way to get me into the proverbial trenches solving humanity’s most difficult challenges. Of course, one of Pinker’s central claims is that the best way to fight those battles is to eschew unnecessary excitation in favor of calm calculation and reasoned negotiation. But I still worry that readers like myself––privileged first-worlders for whom modernity is working just fine––may utilize this perspective to thicken our own socioeconomic and ideological bubbles instead of heeding Pinker’s call to action. The lesson here is that Enlightenment Now represents just one important perspective amongst others, and should not be treated as a comprehensive guide to the world’s present state. In other words, it’s like any other intellectual endeavor.Okay, now for the fun stuff! As ever, Pinker has crafted a book that is engaging, cleanly written, and packed with dense and fascinating thoughts. Since this is a book about progress, we should start with Pinker’s chosen definition:""What is progress? You might think that the question is so subjective and culturally relative as to be forever unanswerable. In fact, it’s one of the easier questions to answer. Most people agree that life is better than death. Abundance is better than poverty. Peace is better than war. Safety is better than danger. Freedom is better than tyranny. Equal rights are better than bigotry and discrimination. Literacy is better than illiteracy. Knowledge is better than ignorance. Intelligence is better than dull-wittedness. Happiness is better than misery. Opportunities to enjoy family, friends, culture, and nature are better than drudgery and monotony. All these things can be measured. If they have increased over time, that is progress."" (51)Pinker is not posturing when he claims that these indicators of progress can be measured. His commitment to empiricism runs much deeper than that of most public intellectuals, as evidenced by the 70+ graphs/charts and 100 pages of notes/references that accompany his superb argumentation. While he is well aware that data generation is a flawed human process (404), the raw power of evidentiary convergence becomes increasingly undeniable as Pinker’s explication of progress unfolds over about 300 pages.In my view, Pinker’s most important insight about progress is this: “It’s in the nature of progress that it erases its tracks, and its champions fixate on the remaining injustices and forget how far we have come” (215). This dynamic can make progress very difficult to identify and acknowledge, since even a world that is improving will always create new obstacles during the process of rendering old ones obsolete: “Progress cannot be monotonic because solutions to problems always create new problems. But progress can resume when the new problems are solved in their turn” (44). While it may seem simplistic to some readers, I think Pinker’s characterization of the world’s difficulties as mere problems to be solved is a critical and often-elided truth that we need to rediscover. In a cultural milieu where doubling down on embattled ideological positions and demonizing one’s opponents is routine, it becomes heroic to refocus one’s attention and energy on discovering the empirical nature of a problem and following the road to solutions wherever it may lead.Of the seventeen topics Pinker addresses in his discussion of progress, the one that most pleased me was his chapter on the environment. This is a topic that many big thinkers still neglect, even though climate change is perhaps the most ominous long-term threat to the continuance of human progress. Pinker takes up the climate problem with distinctive poise, showing how sentimental, anti-industrial positions on the political left and denialist positions on the right have both failed to provide a viable platform for global climate action. He advocates for “Ecomodernism,” a nascent field of study founded on three tenets: (1) some degree of pollution is unavoidable due to the entropic nature of the universe, (2) industrialization has generally been good for humanity, and (3) technology is the primary tool we should use to mitigate environmental damage without relinquishing the myriad benefits of modern life (123-4).While Second Culturists will surely write Pinker off as an obsequious technocrat beguiled by the corrupt comforts of elite capitalist culture, a sober assessment of Ecomodernism reveals it as the most reasonable and realizable approach for dealing with climate change. Pinker advocates for a combination of solutions, including decarbonization, alternative energies, dematerialization, and nuclear power––no silver bullets here. His recommendations, especially on the nuclear issue, pay no heed to the entrenched ideological positions of climate warriors or denialists, but rather follow the evidence wherever it leads. Climate change is serious and daunting, but panicking and using it as an excuse to upend the economic and institutional foundations of progress is foolish. This message is starkest in Pinker’s takedown of Naomi Klein’s position that the only way to address climate change is to raze contemporary capitalism and rebuild it with a much heavier emphasis on centrally-planned economies. His critique was especially salutary for me, given that I was completely seduced by Klein’s point of view when I read This Changes Everything back in 2014. I love an opportunity to update my opinions and reflect on the informational and perspectival limitations of my past selves.Instead of succumbing to the idea that humanity must repent for the great sin of modernity, Pinker instead demonstrates that we can approach this daunting challenge with a rational maturity:""It’s time to retire the morality play in which modern humans are a vile race of despoilers and plunderers who will hasten the apocalypse unless they undo the Industrial Revolution, renounce technology, and return to an ascetic harmony with nature. Instead, we can treat environmental protection as a problem to be solved: how can people live safe, comfortable, and stimulating lives with the least possible pollution and loss of natural habitats?"" (134)As it has always been, the solution is to press forward using the human wellsprings of creativity and innovation; it does no good to nostalgically pine for previous eras when life for average folks and even most elites was much worse than today.Also laudable is Pinker’s defense of rationality, which is endangered by political partisanship and religious/magical thinking. Pinker’s rejection of political partisanship, which he likens to sports fandom, is particularly valuable (359-60). He lays out a battery of research showing how ideologues bend over backwards to deny their opponents the benefit of the doubt, then ties it off with a much-needed reminder that progress is not owned by any individual or group, but is rather the collective result of countless actions and shifts over time that can come from even the most unlikely places:""It should not be surprising that the facts of human progress confound the major -isms. The ideologies are more than two centuries old and are based on mile-high visions such as whether humans are tragically flawed or infinitely malleable, and whether society is an organic whole or a collection of individuals. A real society comprises hundreds of millions of social beings, each with a trillion-synapse brain, who pursue their well-being while affecting the well-being of others in complex networks with massive positive and negative externalities, many of them historically unprecedented. It is bound to defy any simple narrative of what will happen under a given set of rules. A more rational approach is to treat societies as ongoing experiments and open-mindedly learn the best practices, whichever part of the spectrum they come from."" (365)All of us are inescapably embedded in Pinker’s “real society,” and our ability to intelligently acknowledge and navigate this messy reality can stave off madness and keep progress coming.Enlightenment Now closes with Pinker’s celebration of humanism––a strong message that rehabilitated my humanist loyalties, which took a hit when I read Yuval Noah Harari’s 
Homo Deus
 last year. I still wonder how humanism will stay relevant as we evolve into new transhuman and posthuman forms, but I’ve no doubt that Pinker’s perspective is the right one for the here and now:""The first step toward wisdom is the realization that the laws of the universe don’t care about you. The next is the realization that this does not imply that life is meaningless, because people care about you, and vice versa. You care about yourself, and you have a responsibility to respect the laws of the universe that keep you alive, so don’t squander your existence. Your loved ones care about you, and you have a responsibility not to orphan your children, widow your spouse, and shatter your parents. And anyone with a humanistic sensibility cares about you, not in the sense of feeling your pain––human empathy is too feeble to spread itself across billions of strangers––but in the sense of realizing that your existence is cosmically no less important than theirs, and that we all have a responsibility to use the laws of the universe to enhance the conditions in which we all can flourish.""

266,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3055905-nils,1,"Dr Pangloss lives! I’m unconvinced that the various Enlightenments (there actually were several distinct Enlightenments, though Pinker seems unaware of this), much as I love them, can really be credited for the huge increase in human material well-being that has taken place over the last couple of centuries. This turns out not to be a trivial critique, since Pinker’s argument that the Enlightenment is what “caused” the material improvement drives his conclusion that the main threat to sustaining that improvement comes from those who he alleges are undermining the Enlightenment, e.g. the so-called postmodernists. This in turn leads to Pinker’s bizarre suggestion that the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche represent a greater threat to our sustained material well-being than, say, Exxon-Mobil and the Koch brothers. Judge for yourself whether you find that plausible.In fact, the real underpinning the material gains of the last two centuries have been more institutional than ideational. This in turn implies that we must scrutinize the solidity of our institutional matrix if we want a real purchase of the sustainability of these gains. First, there have been numerous civilizations achieving marked improvement in the welfare and well-being of their populations – at least their upper classes. The Maya, the Romans, and several dynastic episodes of the Chinese achieved such gains. Of course, the gains that industrial modernity has achieved over the last quarter millennium outstrips all previous improvements. But taking the longer view, the gains of modernity are perhaps less impressive than they seem. Almost all those gains have taken place in the last quarter millennium, and 250 years, after all, isn’t that long of a run for a civilization. Other historical civilizations have sustained their gains for much longer. The Roman Empire’s eastern branch basked in cultural glory for a thousand years. And even though it’s usually meant pejoratively, it’s no coincidence that the word “byzantine” is a synonym for institutional complexity.Second, there are reasons to suspect that modernity’s run of material amelioration may be drawing to a close—and may even go into reverse. Broadly speaking these reasons can be divided in two. The first concern biophysical limits to growth. These are enduring arguments that the Breakthrough Institute has done much to illuminate and clarify, so suffice to say that, as a long term proposition, Malthus hasn’t yet been proven wrong, and climate change presents challenges of unprecedented scale that will only be addressed if there is sufficient collective political will to overcome collective action and free riding challenges. It’s at best unclear whether we have the global social capital to do so. Put another way: we live in an era of wicked problems.My own skepticism about whether humanity can overcome these challenges brings me to my fundamental critique of Pinker’s optimism: not only the sustainability of the gains of the last quarter millennium, but also the extensibility of these to larger sections of humanity, as well as the ability to address the growing headwinds posed by anthropogenic climate change depend crucially on a massive strengthening of our global institutional and governance infrastructure. From this perspective, all the indicators are sharply negative over the last fifty and especially the last ten years.For nearly fifty years, Gallup has run a series of polls asking Americans about their confidence in various institutions – universities, the media, business, political institutions, and so forth. While the data are noisy, the overall trendline is inexorably downwards. The decline in confidence is partly the result of sustained anti-institutional propaganda, which exists in both leftwing and rightwing versions. But as I have argued elsewhere, I believe the root cause of this declining trust is the objectively poor institutional performance and a lack of elite accountability. A general feature of late modernity is a declining faith in social authority of all sorts, as ever more individuated and autonomous polities become ever less willing to entrust political agents to do anything. The advent of Donald Trump is merely a symptom of both the failure and the rejection of institutions in the United States.Nor is this just an American phenomenon. The rise of populism across Europe likewise reflects distrust of institutions. The Brexit vote two years ago of course represented a direct rebuke to transnational institutions. More recently, the triumph in the Italian elections of the Five Start Movement, whose calling card was a rejection of political party infrastructure, signaled nothing if not a rejection of institutions. (It remains unclear whether the Movement can manage even a small city, let alone Italy as a whole.)With the United States in the grip of Trumpism and the European Union caught between shambolic national politics and collective dissolution, the primary hope for global leadership seems to be falling by default to the Chinese. Some people have argued that China is filling the institutional gap left by a receding Europe and the United States. Eric X. Li, for example, recently argued that Xi Jinping’s merging of Chinese state and party infrastructure makes sense given that “the party has developed into the most competent national political institution in the world today.” What this bold claim tacitly conceded is that, despite the huge successes the Chinese state has had in poverty reduction over the last 40 years, China’s existing institutions are inadequate to managing the bumpy course corrections that lie ahead if it is to sustain its gains.Even more worrying than the declining performance of global and national political institutions are the faltering institutional underpinnings of sustained technological innovation – innovation which everyone, optimists and pessimists alike, agrees is essential to any adequate plan for addressing the challenges posed by climate change. As Mariana Mazzucato has shown, state support for innovation and entrepreneurship has in fact been at the root of almost all major technological breakthroughs of the last 75 years. Specifically, much of this support has taken place through trillions of dollars of state funding for research universities. But universities today are under unprecedented assault. Variously accused of being hotbeds of leftist indoctrination, engines of neoliberal reproduction, or simply wastes of money, no one trusts universities anymore. (This is the real place where the “postmodernists” have something to answer for: they have both been a primary vector of critique of universities, in effect sawing at the branch they sit on, while at the same time provoking hysteria about the supposed insanity of the humanities, of which Pinker’s book is a characteristic example.) While it seems inconceivable that the United States in particular would flush away the linchpin of its technological, industrial, and soft power success, the cultural assault on universities today is unparalleled. Non-coincidentally, universities also face a funding crisis of unprecedented proportions, one that is hitting humanities departments first but which the STEM fields are unlikely to escape. All this threatens to cut the legs out from under the innovation engine that is critical to any effort to escape the grim climate reaper."
267,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna,4,"This is nonfiction and it covers a giant host of various topics, including politics, racism, war, etc. For as long as this audiobook was, I was never bored. The author moved effortlessly and quickly from topic to topic to topic. That style worked here. So the 4 stars is for the entertainment value that I was able to place on this. Now with all that said, it usually bothers me when the author slants all the info to fit his views and then completely glosses over other things that might deflate his defense. While this author did that (abundantly), I didn't find it offensive or annoying. He had some well placed humor to soften that reaction. "
268,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68472482-daniel,5,"This is the best book I have ever read which is something I’m not saying lightly. It makes you so optimistic about the state of human progress and it makes you truly appreciate how much progress we have made over the past couple of centuries. It is really mind-blowing. If you weren’t already, it will also make you very optimistic about the likeliness of this progress continuing in the future with the help of, among other things, technology and today’s widely available information resources.Pinker goes through a wide range of subjects from Life expectancy, Peace and Safety to Equal rights, Knowledge, Quality of life and Happiness. He backs it up with rigorous research and clearly shows how almost every relevant parameter is going in the right direction. The only two areas that as of now haven't shown clear-as-day improvements over time are Terrorism and Global warming. (Another area, which Pinker didn’t include in the book, that could be considered a blip in the otherwise steady drumbeat of progress, are the recent reports of increasing death rates among middle-aged Americans over the past decade.) Focusing on the bigger picture analysis that Pinker provides all throughout the book rather than the daily news and shorter-term trends, you get the true picture of how well humanity is doing.One fascinating example of this is what Pinker calls the consumer surplus. Think about the washing machine. It saves us 10h per week compared to 1920 and costs a few hundred dollars. Now, if you think about how much someone would have to pay you for you to give up your washing machine, the number is clearly not in the hundreds of dollars anymore. Many people in developed nations would say that there is no price that would make them give it up. So not only are we richer but many of the utilities (and other things) that we use everyday can be bought for almost nothing compared to their actual value to us. This wasn't true 50 and 100 years ago. Another example is that today the average American worker retires at 62. Hundred years ago the average American worker died at 51.Pinker thinks (and I agree) that the media is responsible for a large part of today’s unfounded, but in many parts of the Western world, prevailing pessimism. As he puts it “When voters are inches away from the news, optimism can seem naive.” He points out that if newspapers would have elected to report more good news, they could have run the headline ""Number of people in extreme poverty fell by 137,000 since yesterday"" every day for the past 25 years.The book is structured in such a way that you can easily read only one chapter that you find interesting and skip the rest. There is for example a very good chapter on the environment and climate change if you want to read up on that. I do think Pinker misses some of the big potential risks in his discussion on AI, for example advanced AI systems in the wrong hands. And I think you can safely skim through the final three chapters without missing too much of an otherwise wonderful book.As a side note, the reason I decided to read this book was Bill Gates' glowing review of it some time ago. As you can see, I wasn’t disappointed. In his review, Bill said that he read the book very slowly because he loved it so much, but that he thought “most people will find it a quick and accessible read.” Perhaps he wrote the review in the ensuing euphoria after having just finished the book because I can assure you of one thing: this book is a lot of things, an easy read for most people it is not (it’s all relative I guess). But it is enormously fun reading and often highly enlightening so it's well worth your time. A big thank you to Pinker for putting things in the right perspective and allowing readers to see the bigger picture so clearly."

270,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"In many ways, reading this book was similar to reading Pinker's book ""Better Angels of our Nature."" The theory of the book was straight-forward, the evidence was well-organized, and the insights from the data were presented clearly. The first drawback to reading this book is that it covers a lot of the same ground as ""Better Angels of our Nature."" The second drawback to this book is that...well, even if the conclusions of this book aren't common sense, to people who are roughly familiar with enlightenment ideals and are fairly well-read on current affairs, it sort of is common sense. That's a nice way of saying that there are few ideas in this book that will leave you awe-struck. That's not to see that Pinker isn't capable of writing such a book. I found ""The Blank Slate"" to be just such a book. That book remains one of my favorite books to this day. That is also the book I point to when I want to convince people what a great thinker Pinker is. Pinker's argument is straightforward and comes in the preface: ""I will present a different understanding of the world, grounded in fact and inspired by the ideals of the Enlightenment: reason, science, humanism, and progress. Enlightenment ideals, I hope to show, are timeless, but they have never been more relevant than they are right now."" (page 12). If Enlightenment ideas are timeless, then why do they need a defense? Pinker's answer: ""The ideals of the Enlightenment are products of human reason, but they always struggle with other strands of human nature: loyalty to tribe, deference to authority, magical thinking, the blaming of misfortune on evildoers"" (page 18). In many ways, ""Enlightenment Now"" is similar to ""Factfullness"" in its use of quantitative data to make the case that life is indeed getting better. Pinker's earlier book ""Better Angels of our Nature"" was also a book that relied heavily on quantitative data. However, by my recollection, that book did a better job of reflecting on how the numbers were arrived at. I think numeracy is an important skill, and too often it is easy to be wowed by numbers without realizing how they are produced and the difficulty of getting reliable numbers in certain contexts -- for example, the distant past and developing countries. My recollection of ""Better Angels"" is a few years removed, but I seem to remember Pinker doing a better job with educating readers on how numbers were arrived at. Having said that, I do think the graphs are presented in a useful and simple way. Often, the data comes in the form of time series line charts. I think the repeated use of these kinds of statistics is great for more casual readers who need to be convinced. Another drawback to this book is that it tends to ignore and short-change the possibility of cataclysmic blowups. The discussion of the disruptive power of AI is discussed briefly, but pales in seriousness to Yuval Harari's analysis in ""21 Lessons for the 21st Century."" The benefits of enlightenment are discussed abundantly, but Frankenstein monsters like mortgage-backed securities are barely mentioned. In addition, one of the most important trends of the 21st century, the explosion of debt is barely discussed. The looming debt crisis (or, I should say crises since we are talking about various kinds of debts, government, municipal, shadow banking, and private) as well as other potential crises with systemic implications -- climate change, the growing use of social media, the introduction of disruptive technologies -- are under-discussed in this book. And because these systemic crises are under-discussed, Pinker fails to deal with the mother of all questions about modernity. Does modernity increase the risk of catastrophic blow-ups? Since nuclear war, climate change, and contagious financial panics are the product in one way or another of modernity, science, and globalization, is there a likelihood that more potentially catastrophic phenomena could be birthed from them? And, if so, what can we do to prevent potential catastrophic blow-ups from occurring? Another way to think about the question is this way: In what ways is modern progress like a financial bubble? For me, a high point of the book was its discussion of tribal epistemology. I have read short articles on tribal thinking, but the review of the literature here was excellent. And for those who are searching for literature that discusses this topic, the book can make for an effective gateway. This was written in the Guardian about this book: ""More pertinently, the failed 2016 campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Remain demonstrated that, in the eyes of many people, “progress” simply meant more of the same. When people feel trapped and patronised by progress, then any alternative – even regress – will feel like freedom. Informing them that the policies of the past 40 years are still the best available starts to sound hopeless."" (Full review here: https://www.theguardian.com/books/201...)Perhaps that's another way of saying that technocratic modernity (complete with its wonky charts) can feel emotionally ungratifying. Instead of gradual improvements and progress by a thousand nudges, there is a part of the soul that yearns for liberation, heroism, and love. People like stories with heroes and villains. Enlightenment often sees the world in terms of mechanical and quasi-mechanical cause and effect relationships. Heroism seems less like heroism when it requires design and system-thinking rather than great sacrifices. Nassim Taleb, another writer whose work I admire, steeps his writing in decidedly non-modern ideas and sentiments -- his thinking perhaps is best described as classical and romantic. I believe anyone who reads this book ought to put it in conversation with some of Taleb's writing (one or two books is enough). I'm sure each of the authors would hate to hear it, but I'll say it anyway -- they are better read together than separately. The unabashed modernist/enlightenment thinker is better with a classical/romantic counterpart and vice versa. I will repeat this: People who are only familiar with Pinker for ""Better Angels"" and ""Enlightenment Now"" ought to read his earlier work ""Blank Slate."" That book, more than his more recent works, demonstrates that he is a true thinker and not simply a chart-jockey or dataphile. Overall, even if you do not need to be convinced of the merit of enlightenment ideas and ideals, this is a wonderful book to read. "
271,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,4,"If you're looking for a cure for the common pessimism, you might do much, much worse than to pick up this book. I've read or seen many other examples of the facts portrayed here, but Steven Pinker does a very admirable job of showing us, exactly, how much better the world is now compared to the one we had even a hundred years ago. It's not just time-saving devices or some outright reversals of ecological damage, but how lifespans, general IQ, overall poverty level, and even WAR has improved for the better for all. Not that war is ever really all that great, mind you, but few nations jump into it with quite as little reason or abandon as they used to.Pinker isn't saying that everything is peachy, of course, but the trend toward real positive progress is undeniable. This is, despite setbacks. And yes, we have many. But for every problem that exists, he makes a very good point that we have it in us to FIX our problems. It's not out of the question.Global Warming, for example, not only has possible temporary and minor fixes available, such as applying a metaphorical sunscreen to the atmosphere, but we have the means to do much more than cut our carbon footprint down to the bone. We have a history of moving on to different methods whenever resources of one type or another run out, too. Health and education are at an all-time high. What we don't have is our optimism. In fact, we have a very solid outlook that things are worse than ever. Terrorists are few in number and never accomplish their stated goals. They merely rouse the combined might of all the powers to quash them. Most of the first world countries have made a point of living by equality in the sexes and the trend is more of the same across the world. LGBT is already accepted on the same scale. Pinker attributes all our actual progress to the Enlightenment. The old standard of 19th-century thinking, where humanism reigns supreme. Look. I freely admit to being a humanist, myself. I LOVE the idea that we all should get along. That every life is valuable. That we should have a high fundamental basis for living for every man, woman, and child alive. It's so pervasive an idea that practically everyone shares it. It's like... OBVIOUS, right? And as far as I know, Steven Pinker is right. But he also makes a very cogent point about the need to be rational, to use science for what it is intended. Inquiry, truth-seeking. No matter what the result, the truth is much more important than any ideology. He uses this to encourage each and every one of us to see past the doomsayers and the demagogs. Again, I totally agree. Skepticism is not the same thing as pessimism. Almost everyone I know is a fundamentally decent person and we all want the same fundamental things.So why didn't I give this book a full five stars?Because he gives all the credit to humanism. Wishing does not make it so. He might be right, but let's face it: this might be what he, himself warned us about. Selection Bias.Even so, I love thinking about it and I totally recommend this book for anyone who is sick and tired of the news and wants someone with a lot of facts and good reasoning to pick them up off the ground, dust their shoulders, and tell them that we are, on the whole, doing pretty damn well for ourselves. You know, despite the actual problems. But then, we DO have it in ourselves to FIX THEM. :)"
272,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51602586-dominika,2,"I did not like this book.I would say that this book was middling for the majority of it. The idea of the book is that progress has already happened, and we shouldn't be as doom and gloom as we are. But for a man who emphasizes the use of data and critical thinking, he doesn't really read said data that well and some of his arguments are riddled with gaping holes. This was a book that was read at our book club (but I was the only person at that book club who read the book in its entirety) and one of the points was that you need to show that progress has been made in order to do more progress. I have mixed feelings: I feel as though that erases the issues that people are actually facing by trying to point out that ""oh but you won't die in the woods from an infection"". While it is nice that countries that were in extreme poverty 50 years ago are being lifted to the middle class, it won't matter to the person who is working 3 jobs at minimum wage so that they can support a family. We have a lot of great innovations in healthcare, but it doesn't matter when a person cannot take an ambulance because it will cost them $600. Some of the progress sections have rather weak arguments as well. The environment one was basically him saying that the system will fix itself (in terms of a capitalist system supporting renewable energy) and that we'll totally invent carbon capture technology. The happiness one also bugged me, because the data is just not consistent. But the section that really got my blood boiling was Science. First off, he tries putting his deregulation mindset against IRBs and says a really fucking insensitive thing about the Tuskegee Syphilis study (But black people worked on it and it's not like they were INFECTING people with Syphilis). And then the rest of it was a STEM circlejerk (Wah, why are these SOCIAL SCIENCES invading my medical research). I work in medical research and am working towards a masters in Epidemiology. We cannot live in our own bubbles, we must learn from different disciplines. Hard sciences bring data-driven analysis to every subject, but social sciences bring the ability to look at the whole picture. Humanities bring the ability to make these things appealing and also to think creatively, to gain inspiration. We need them all, and it's a shame that Pinker doesn't realize that.Oh boy, and I'm not even going to start on the Humanism section and his comments on Islam. Not only does he not see how Western Imperialism could have POSSIBLY encouraged a more patriarchal regime as opposed to just reading religious texts (Look at the south), he also is just full of double standards. Oh, and his arguement against Nietsche is that dictators read him. He doesn't seem to get the Nietsche is all about skepticism. I do really like the chapter on Ideas. While it isn't something that I haven't heard before, I liked the comment on how a lot of politics now isn't even about core fundamental beliefs, but about who's team is winning. The truth is, Pinker and I differ on some core ideologies. Pinker refutes Postmodern philosophy while I am very postmodern. We have some differing opinions on the amount of regulations things should get and whether systems will correct themselves. I understand that. I read Ayn Rand, and I felt as though more of the arguments were at least compelling (if not occassionally bat-shit crazy). I didn't feel the same way about Pinker.All of this isn't helped by how reading this book felt equivelent to eating raw almonds. It was bland, it was dense, Pinker repeated himself and would attempt some flowery tangent while utterly failing. My friend said he tried reading the book during his night shift job and then fell asleep, and then got the audiobook and fell asleep again. I know he's not trying to say that we shouldn't work hard to improve the world, but I don't particularly feel any inspiration from this book, particularly when the vast majority does try to read as a pat on the back in spite of his introduction. I felt like a majority of his arguments were flaccid with the occasionally toxic take, and this book in general was overbloated. "
273,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"In Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, Steven Pinker spends 550+ pages attempting to disavow you of any notion of ""the good ol' days"".And he IS pretty convincing. He's got stats and graphs and lots of evidence to bolster his case that we live in amazing times - that progress and Enlightenment-era ideals have lead to better conditions in almost every measurable sphere. And he's right. He spends some ink and time on why we feel the opposite so often - the world is a hell hole! - pointing towards psychological phenomena like the optimism gap, the availability heuristic, (leaning heavily on Kahneman and Tvorsky's work) and the tendency we all have to remember negative over positive.I didn't read his earlier book about the decline of violence, The Better Angels of our Nature, but this book looks like a more robust version of that one, with a broad focus to include public health, economics, climate change, nuclear weapons, and the timely discussion of authoritarian populism.It's not all roses and puppies, but there are many great things and amazing research that lead to more great things. That's a good thing to remember, and a clarion call to keep going with research and evidence-based activism. All in the name of progress and making things more equal."
274,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11654681-paul,3,"I'm a big fan of Pinker, but I can't say I really enjoyed this book. Impeccably written, as always, but I feel like some of the conclusions he draws from the data he cites are somewhat spurious. "
275,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47417894-laura-noggle,4,"This was an encouraging, uplifting look at many of the successes and bright spots that often get overlooked. However, it's clear things need to be taken with a large grain of salt. I admit, my initial five star rating was more out of the hopefulness associated with the book. Hopefulness that the world isn't really going to hell in a handbasket, and hopeful that the mass generalizations and questionable analysis of facts/statistics had a firm foundation. After reading Nassim Nicholas Taleb's multiple epic burns on Pinker in his book  Skin in the Game: The Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life, I had to reassess my star rating after I stopped laughing. Basically,  Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are, and  But What If We're Wrong? Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past. You can't trust anything or anyone! Fake news! Still, this book provides a sweeping view that is very much appreciated, if not 100% infallible. "

Let us rid ourselves of scientific illiteracy, shed our primitive intuitions, and abolish our hopeful apocalyptic superstitions. Let this book be the spotlight that removes the shadows of ignorance from our echo-chamber brains. Crime, war, and famine rates are lower than they’ve ever been. GMOs, fertilizers, and vaccines have and continue to save billions of lives. The global standard of living has never been higher. In virtually every measurable way, life is better for us than it has ever been for any generation of humanity before us. True, Donald Trump is the president of the United States and average global temperatures are increasing. But those problems have solutions. Reason, science, and humanism. Buy this book and take comfort in the life science has afforded us. Let us all recognize how wonderful life is and contribute to humanity’s continued progress."
277,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35-michael-siliski,4,"Recommended for anyone interested in a wake-up call about the progress made over the past few centuries.Enlightenment Now makes the case that the ideals of reason, science, and humanism have driven the greatest advances in the history of human civilization over the past few centuries. The book is divided into three parts: the history of the enlightenment, the progress we’ve made, and the enlightenment ideals that must be defended going forward. However, the meat of the book, and Pinker’s passion, is clearly the middle section, which is a thorough and data-based walk through fifteen areas where human lives are almost indistinguishably improved from just 10 generations ago, including health, peace, freedom, inequality, the environment, and happiness. Pinker’s enemies are “progressophobes” on both the right (the anti-science forces, the Trumpian politics of grievance) and left (New York Times-style liberal handwringing and catastrophizing). Both sides are prone to populism and a desire to return to an imagined utopian past. Pinker is successful in his main goal of thoroughly debunking that such a past ever existed.Enlightenment Now has a lot in common with Hans Rosling’s Factfulness, which I wrote about recently. Pinker is quite a bit longer and goes much deeper, so if you’re the type to ask for the data backing each claim, this might be the better book for you. I also thought Pinker was much more successful in grounding his celebration of human progress in a memorable framework.Both books suffer from a relentless optimism that can feel a bit strident at times. For Pinker, I thought this was most evident in his discussions of inequality and happiness, both of which felt a bit blithe to me. I think there is good reason to reject the most pessimistic takes on these: that more wealth doesn’t make people any happier or even that people are less happy these days, that inequality within a society is far more important than absolute means. Pinker does a good job making the case that inequality is not equivalent to poverty, and that “in some ways the world has become less equal, but in more ways the world’s people have become better off.” He makes a compelling argument that happiness is directly related to wealth, in particular using Stevenson & Wolfers studies. But these are not the same as proving “the irrelevance of inequality to happiness” or demonstrating that individual happiness is primarily driven by wealth. I thought these sections would be stronger if they didn’t reach quite so far.I agree with Pinker that reason, science, and humanism are critically important to human well-being globally, and these days it does feel a defense of them is needed. While I doubt that many who disagree with the thesis would even pick this book up, Pinker does make a similar point to Rosling that many of the most well-educated, including academics, are unaware of how much progress actually has been made through Enlightenment ideals. So perhaps there is hope that books like this could have a positive influence.From: https://medium.com/@msiliski/enlighte..."
278,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13941368-bakunin,4,"I usually wait a while to write a review of a book in order to digest all the important aspects of the work and this is certainly true in this case as well. Being somewhat of a libertarian with conservative leanings I found this book to be both illuminating as well as challenging. This book is Pinkers best attempt to defend the enlightenment; that is to say humanism, science and reason. He goes through many aspects quantitatively to prove his point - health, inequality, evironment, peace, safety, equal rights, quality of life etc - and all these things seem to be going in the right direction. Countries which are more democratic and more liberal are happier. This is essentially a more scientific defense of what Popper called ""the open society"". Although I find it refreshing to read a somewhat optimistic book in the midst of all the usual gloom one encounters in the daily press, I find myself in disagreement with Pinker. I agree with Pinker in that we are living the best possible time but what bothers me is the fact that I believe that the welfare state won't be able to sustain this growth (or progress if you will). Although Pinker has a certain classical liberal leaning, he is not very worried about the implications of an ever expanding welfare state: the destruction of the family, mass immigration, and the infantilization of citizens in the west. His liberal predilection is also shown by his apparent scorn of Trump and 'populism'. I suppose that this is where the rubber meets the road - I believe that communities are necessary and that the individual is not a tabula rasa. I also strongly reject the notion of an enlightened elite telling people how to better live their lives. While my values often may coincide with Pinkers, I believe in a slow and organic change in society, rather than a forced political one. Pinker by contrast scorns tribalist behavior and finds this to be reactionary; a force to be fought with a scientific mind. Although I have a certain buddhist leaning myself, I am slowly becoming more convinced of the need to be a person in modern society and the need therefore to retain certain elements of tribalism. Where to draw this line is however unclear. "
279,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75777506-tom-zacharski,2,"I picked ""Enlightenment Now"" after Bill Gates's recommendation. It's not every day that you hear someone like Gates recommend their favorite book of all time. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed. The premise of the book is that, as humanity, we are much better off nowadays than ever before in history. Pinker draws on many statistics, graphs, and facts to show that is indeed the reality. While I love that premise and couldn't agree more (we need more of those reminders in the age of 24h media) I found the language and general style a bit hard to read and unpleasant to a reader - it read a bit too much like a textbook and too often felt like going through well researched and academic in nature Powerpoint slides. The book could have easily been three times shorter and would drive the points home more effectively. Nonetheless, the points are important and if you've never read anything about how far we have come as humanity I do recommend the book. I recently saw ""The Final Year"" - a documentary about Barafh Obama's last year in office and how his foreign policy team operated during the time of a divisive, and later shocking, election. At one point Obama says that history does not follow a straight line, rather it zigs and zags, there's ups and downs, but it's our job to make sure the trend continues upward. And that trend is what the ""Enlightenment Now"" is all about."

Pinker was named one of Time Magazine’s 100 most influential people in the world in 2004 and his books are regularly featured in the best-selling lists. While the purpose of this book is commendable – to show with extensive use of data that we are living in the best of times – two reasons made me cringe while reading it. Firstly, the author completely misses the mark on the topic I have dedicated part of my professional life for the past 10+ years: climate change.

282,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"I listened to this as an audiobook & it was good, but he has a lot of graphs so quick reference to the PDF is a big plus. There are also sections where it's nice to reread his thoughts, although most are straightforward enough that it's not necessary. His writing is clean & uncluttered. It follows a logical progression.There are 3 sections:1) Enlightenment2) Progress3) Reason, Science, & HumanismThe first two sections are great. I've read about the Age of Ignorance, its history, & its benefits before, but his is one of the best as he proves the benefit of the scientific method to mankind through some very telling statistics. I loved the section on how much wealth we now have comparatively. I've read comparisons about the cost of an hour of light, but it always impresses me. He shows how much less violence, starvation, & disease there is. So why do we think the world is in such danger? He thinks it's due mostly to brain bugs & loud extremists both on the left & right.The last section ""Reason, Science, & Humanism"" was preaching to the choir. It was long & boring at times. There was a lot of good information in it & while I agreed with him in general, he went over the top or underplayed several things. For instance, he seems to consider an existential threat as serious only if they'll kill off most people. He fails to mention how horrific a tragedy which abruptly killed 1% of our population would be (1% of 7 billion is 700 million!) or what the loss of an entire city could do to our society. IIRC, some have said it could take as little as losing 10% of the population to bring down our civilization since it is incredibly interconnected. Something like a nationwide outage of electric could be catastrophic even if it lasted a fairly short time. Cities only have a few days worth of food & places like LA rely on a lot of infrastructure. Millions are living in a desert, an area where the first settlement didn't make it.His thoughts on nuclear bombs were very simplistic & incomplete. Hindsight of what the Kremlin would have actually done during the Cold War based on records we're now reading is armchair quarterbacking at its worst. He also didn't get into the options of nuclear bombs like tactical nukes. I remember some talking heads discussing how great the tactical nuke option was going to be at one point. It was insane! Apparently he doesn't believe how close we were to annihilation.Worse, he dismissed the effect of the atomic bombs we did drop saying that the Japanese surrendered because the Russians were entering their area of the war. That's ridiculously simplistic, just one of many factors & I don't believe it was the deciding one. The Japanese were out of everything & the Allies were pushing them back in force. Kamikazes weren't their first choice as weapons, but born of desperation. In March, Tokyo was bombed by something like 300 planes - nothing like Dolittle's desperate raid of a few years before. It was a huge force with horrific results, but it was also understandable & they knew we couldn't afford it too often. In August, one plane dropped one bomb that was about as bad. A few days later, we repeated the trick. They didn't know the cost or how many more we had. How can anyone dismiss that?It's crazy hard to get fissionable materials, but they aren't the only nuclear threat. It's a lot easier to get radioactive waste & spread it around with conventional explosives. It doesn't take a genius & if it or a biological/chemical agent is put in the right place, someplace upwind. It could be devastating. Not an end of the world catastrophe, but up there with the Twin Towers. I don't think it's particularly likely, but everyone thought Clancy's novel, Debt of Honor (1994) was just unlikely fiction, too. If you haven't read it, a guy crashes a jet into Congress & pretty much wipes them all out. This was 7 years before 9/11, but airline security didn't change so his dismissive attitude towards terrorists seems a bit over done. Still, I generally agreed with him. We can be too anxious. Current airline security is a good example, but there are a lot of smart people trying to keep us safe. We're walking a tightrope between safety & losing our freedoms. Our anxiety only makes the latter more likely, so I'm glad of his perspective.Overall, it's a good book. If you're super religious or a big Trump supporter, you'll probably dislike the last section especially. Pinker beats on both sides of the aisle, but the anti-humanist & anti-science of the current administration is in front of us now, so he gives a lot of good reasons for his negative opinions.Highly recommended in any format, but do get the PDF with the audiobook. Very well narrated."

What is progress? You might think that the question is so subjective and culturally relative as to be forever unanswerable. In fact, it’s one of the easier questions to answer. Most people agree that life is better than death. Health is better than sickness. Sustenance is better than hunger. Abundance is better than poverty. Peace is better than war. Safety is better than danger. Freedom is better than tyranny. Equal rights are better than bigotry and discrimination. Literacy is better than illiteracy. Knowledge is better than ignorance. Intelligence is better than dull-wittedness. Happiness is better than misery. Opportunities to enjoy family, friends, culture, and nature are better than drudgery and monotony. All these things can be measured. If they have increased over time, that is progress. 
The subtitle of Enlightenment Now is: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, and as someone who has benefitted from all of these – in all of the ways enumerated in the opening quote – I don't know to what extent I needed the “case to be made” for these values. The difficulty I had is that while author Steven Pinker does define and defend each of these principles throughout the book, he is actually attempting to make the case for optimism – as though the entire world today has progressed in the direction of betterment (to greater or lesser degrees), as a direct result of Enlightenment thinkers, and as there isn't any problem facing us that can't be solved by doubling down on Enlightenment thinking and the advancement of science and technology, anyone who tends to pessimism (whether over the environment, existential angst, or the rise of populism and despotism) simply needs a long history lesson about all the ways in which things have gotten better and better. Pinker includes more than seventy graphs with pleasing curves (trending up or down over time, depending on whether they're tracking positive or negative metrics), he provides double, or even triple, digit footnotes for each chapter (assuring me that every statement he makes is backed by published sources), and with thirty fine-print pages of references at the end, I couldn't possibly track them all down in order to reach my own conclusions about the state of the world. The reader is repeatedly asked to take Dr. Pinker's word for it that everything is progressing well (towards a place of measurable betterment for humanity), and as I found myself often squirming with the uneasiness of not just wanting to take his word for it, and as I also found myself without the informational/philosophical background from which to dispute his arguments, I couldn't always follow where Pinker wanted to lead me; often as impatient with myself as with him. I'm glad I read this book – at least in an effort to understand what the big debates of our time might be – but I just don't have the knowledge base to properly respond to Pinker's arguments; three stars reflects my not taking a stand on this one.So, I'll make an aesthetic judgment: Pinker stretched my concentration with his frequent philosophical references to hermeneutics, dialectics, ontological this and that, but when he would descend to informal/hippie references to presumably lighten things up (many retirees are happy “seeing the national parks in a Winnebago, or dandling Vera, Chuck, and Dave in a cottage on the Isle of Wight”; drivers safely enjoy the pleasures of “seeing the USA in their Chevrolet, or just cruising down the streets, feeling out of sight, spending all their money on a Saturday night”), I found the writing forced, or worse, anachronistic. And I grew impatient with Pinker's smugly rhetorical strawman-punchline gags:
There is no law of complex systems that says that intelligent agents must turn into ruthless conquistadors. Indeed, we know of one highly advanced form of intelligence that evolved without this defect. They’re called women.
Or:
Of course, one can always imagine a Doomsday Computer that is malevolent, universally empowered, always on, and tamperproof. The way to deal with this threat is straightforward: don't build one.
Other ideas that made me squirm: Pinker stresses the need for rational thinking and the belief that the scientific method is the only way of measuring the world (using that, at a stroke, to dismiss human consciousness as a mere byproduct of evolution and the nonexistence of gods as an accepted fact). History progresses in one direction, and so long as we continue to embrace Enlightenment thinking and turn to science to solve our problems, there will be no environmental doomsday, no nuclear wars, no real terrorist threat to democracy, no Singularity (no “foom”). Pinker insists that science is politically bipartisan and he takes swipes at the anti-progressivism of the left (those who are reflexively anti-GMO, anti-vaccine, anti-nuclear) and the anti-intellectualism of the right (those who are creationists, anti-immigration, protectionist), and while that might make him seem a neutral party, Pinker never misses an opportunity to name President Trump as the anti-Enlightenment bogeyman who could reverse centuries of human progress. And since, as I pointed out, I don't feel qualified to confront Pinker on his facts, here is some of the professional response to Enlightenment Now (note: I chose to share reviews from left-slanting sources in order to prevent partisan fakenewsmanship):From the (officially bipartisan but purportedly leftwing) Australian public broadcaster, ABC –Pinker never seems to see the force of the question: How do we know that all this did not take place in spite of, rather than because of, the Enlightenment? In fact, he doesn't even pretend to go to the trouble of establishing a causal connection between his contentious version of the Enlightenment and the various improvements that he imagines follow in its wake. Post hoc, ergo propter hoc seems to be the operative principle. From New Statesman, a British newsmagazine that self-describes as having a “liberal, sceptical political position” –Judged as a contribution to thought, Enlightenment Now is embarrassingly feeble. With its primitive scientism and manga-style history of ideas, the book is a parody of Enlightenment thinking at its crudest. A more intellectually inquiring author would have conveyed something of the Enlightenment’s richness and diversity. Yet even if Pinker was capable of providing it, intellectual inquiry is not what his anxious flock demands. Only an anodyne, mythical Enlightenment can give them what they crave, which is relief from painful doubt.From The Globe & Mail, a decidedly progressive Canadian daily newspaper –
Pinker's gripe is largely aesthetic. A prominent egghead who writes and composes himself with Spock-like coldness and clarity, he seems annoyed at the frenzy (and so, irrationality) of ""editorialists,"" ""climate justice warriors,"" ""relativists,"" and the ""politically correct"" left. What Pinker never substantially considers is that such frenzy – whether deployed as a deliberate political tactic, or manifesting as the sputtering incoherence of the true believer – may help mobilize the spirit of change and progress; dams and ditches of passion that channel the turbulent tides of Enlightenment. 
And from one such “frenzied climate justice warrior” at The Guardian, the British daily that famously tilts left –
Pinker insults the Enlightenment principles he claims to defend. Could he have succumbed to the motivated reasoning these principles are supposed to suppress? If the environmental crisis cannot be so easily dismissed, it threatens his argument that life is steadily improving. What looks like a relentless enhancement in human welfare could emerge instead as an interlude between one form of deprivation and the next.
The bottom line: I slogged through this long read, encouraged by its optimism, but unconvinced by its argument. I was further annoyed by my own inability to articulate my increasingly negative response to Pinker's thesis, and recognise that as my own failing; I remain uncertain that I've adequately outlined my objections even with the addition of other reviewers' voices. Even so, I'm glad to have read this book and would recommend it to anyone interested in what “the eggheads” are talking about."
284,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5979619-boudewijn,3,"In this book, Steven Pinker wants to provide insight in the fruits of the Enlightenment and that the norms and values are still as important as everContrary to what you might believe, the world is in a much better shape than ever. Whether it is life expectancy, welfare, peace, democracy, knowledge or prosperity, there is not better moment to live than now.Most of the pages are dedicated with scores of statistics, all showing that things are going well. World life expectancy has doubled from 30 years (1800) to 71,4 years (2015). The world’s GDP has increased a 100 times and - despite the growing population - the number of people living in abject poverty is decreasing.But what about the challenges we’re facing today? The deplorable state of nature, extinctions and climate change? Yes, Steven Pinker acknowledges that these challenges exist, but where other relapse in doom scenario’s. Pinker advocates for a continuation of an optimal relation between (economic) progress and pollution. If humanity wants to survive, it needs to invest in progress itself: only after achieving a certain amount of welfare, people are willing to invest in (and sacrifice themselves for) a better environment. In other words, keep investing in the core values of the Enlightenment: rationalism, science and humanism. And yes, this includes nuclear energy, as a clean way of energy.In the last part of the book, Pinker delves into the current problems of the left and the right. The left thinks that the world is being plagued by inequality and the environment being endangered, the right think that his ‘culture’ is being destroyed by immigrations and minorities. Fact and figures that show that this is not the case, are being falsified or simply denied.The problem that I had with this book was its lack of nuance. He knows, or thinks he knows all, and does not refrain from his mantra that all is well, and will be well. There is no room for any considerations for those who - even today - might not be living their lives to their full capacity. Not because they don’t want to, but because they are simply kept from achieving it.

285,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48909861-dan-ust,4,"Overall a good book, though I believe Pinker overstates his case and is too narrowly focused on the Enlightenment itself — as if all progress were waiting for the 18th century to really start. This is strange given his earlier book, _The Better Angels of Our Nature_, where he documents the reduction in violence from the Stone Age on.He minimizes things like improved capabilities, while fine in themselves, can also breed greater risks. He does recognize this in the case of nuclear weapons. (One can argue that both ways: maybe nuclear deterrence has reduced or ended wars between major powers. But the devastation of one such weapon is certainly progress of a type many would question.)Also, he has what might best be called stylistic ticks. These wouldn’t be as bad in a brief talk, but became more vexing to me as I read the near 500 pages of the main text. (There are extensive footnotes worth mining too. I’ve read or skimmed a number of the works he cites.) By these I mean he seems to have to reword adages or quote songs and the like for somewhat comic effect. This works sometimes, but when it feels like every section must have one or two, it feels like padding in an already long work.I winced a little at his oversimplification of intellectual history, too, though I believe his trashing of Nietzsche is spot on. I winced further at his seeming to think the ruling class simply wants the best for everyone rather than it’s often resistant to progress and benefits from “gloom and doom” attitudes. (Politicians don’t run on the slogan that things are okay and getting better. Instead, election campaigns are morality plays where good is battling evil, where one side will redeem us and move is forward from the collapsing state we find ourselves in while the other wishes to push society over a cliff.)In many ways, too, Pinker’s work is an update of that of economist Julian Simon. One can argue that Pinker will have a greater impact because he’s not an economist and, despite my reservations above, is a much more accessible and wittier writer. (To be fair, it’s been a while since I’ve read Simon.)Ian Goldin also wrote a balanced review for Nature:https://www.nature.com/articles/d4158..."
286,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"This book was simply amazing. I've read the whole thing in less than two weeks. The material was very captivating, and the chapters in the book are well organized, allowing for natural breaks. Steven Pinker, the author, provides a rational and balanced view of the current state of humankind, how we got here, and where we're headed. He dives into vital topics directly and doesn't hold back or avoid anything. The book covers topics such as wealth, health, quality of life, society as a whole, climate change, education, and a lot more.The information shared is also backed up by real data which is quite refreshing. We're all surrounded with so much negativity from the mainstream news which can make the world seem like a terrible place to live in. And with this book, what I enjoyed was the more balanced presentation of the data without resorting to fear-mongering, which is so common these days with clickbait media.If you have any doubts, this book will open your eyes to the fact that we're all living in the best time for humankind since the beginning of our existence and things are getting better.As much as I enjoyed the optimistic viewpoint on certain topics in this book, I also like the fact that the author didn't exclude critical areas we as humans need to work on — one of those being climate change.There's very little doubt about the current situation with climate change and the urgency at which we need to operate to avoid a global disaster. The truth is, we all have to step up and do our part as this presents one of the biggest challenges for humankind yet.Overall, this book is a great read, and I highly recommend it. It covers so many important areas, and I'm glad I decided to read it. I have no doubts you'll enjoy it as much as I did."
287,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5196256-mindy,1,"I read this because Bill Gates highly recommended it, and because I felt I needed a more optimistic view of the progress of humanity. Why did I think Bill Gates’ reading list would hold any interest for me? This book is simply further evidence that all data can be manipulated to achieve a purpose. If you include yourself among the world’s wealthiest “citizens”, this is a great read to assuage any hint of privilege-related guilt you may feel. The extremely poor are in decline, and if the bulk of humanity is now simply poor, they should be content with their plight and thank their overlords from lifting them out of the squalor. I kept reading hoping for a redeeming moment. It never happened."
288,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"In 2011 Steven Pinker wrote a magnificent book, The Better Angels of our Nature, in which he showed – by using historical analysis, statistical methods and informed estimates – how the world has gotten safer (hence the subtitle of the book: The Decline of Violence). The gist of the book was that there have been continuous social reforms that have led to an environment in which our inner demons have fewer opportunities to surface and in which zero-sum games have been turned into positive-sum games. In 2017, Pinker followed up his 2011 work by extending his scientific method to the whole scale of human progress. In Enlightenment Now he wants to show us how the world not only got safer, but also became a much more pleasant place to live in – for almost all human beings that are born. Pinker wants to show us that this progress wasn’t inevitable: it was a conscious effort of human beings to start – for the first time in history – to apply reason to the goal of making the world a better place to live. This is important, since it shows us to not be complacent and to take all the gains for granted. Pinker tries to convince us readers that the Enlightenment values that drove this progress have to be remembered by and re-stated to each new generation.The book itself is divided into three parts; I will briefly summarize each part in the rest of this review.In part 1, Pinker describes how in the Enlightenment era people started to use reason to understand the world (science) and to distinguish right from wrong (ethics). No more witch hunts; no more mythologies; no more harsh punishments; etc. According to Pinker, mankind has to fight continuously against three natural entities: (1) entropy (the increasing of disorder), (2) evolution (the competition of all against all; zero-sum games), and (3) information (increasing our knowledge). In this fight, reason is the most important, and only, tool that we have to – temporarily – create a good place to live for ourselves. Pinker sees two contemporary threats to this ideal though: religion and populism (left- and rightwing). His goal of the rest of the book is hence; first to show that real progress has taken place; and next, to convince us that this progress was driven by Enlightenment values that have to be defended. So, in part 2 of the book Pinker applies the scientific method to analyze the different domains of human progress. He uses lots of graphs and he meticulously describes all the relevant scientific findings – just like he did in his 2011 book on the decline of violence. In short, people live longer; are healthier; are economically better off, even though inequality increases; the environment is (slowly) better off and the climate change fatalism is misguided (especially in light of all the technological advances); the world is more peaceful and safer than ever, while terrorism is a minor (insignificant) blip; democracy and equal rights are strongly instituted; and knowledge is readily accessible for masses of people and ever-progressing. In the closing chapters of part 2, Pinker also states that the newer generations are much happier, healthier and experience a much higher quality of life than earlier generations. Within generations this progress is also visible. The hailed existential threats to progress – technological enslavement and nuclear war – are serious issues but there really is no reason to be scared shitless: human beings, according to Pinker, are better and better equipped to turn zero-sum games into positive-sum games (i.e. turning existential threats into cooperated effort to ward off disaster). Pinker finishes part 2 by claiming that progress, even though contingent (i.e. depending on human choices), is a self-enhancing cycle: as the world is better off each year, countries will tend to cooperate more and more and living conditions of all human beings will tend to increase. Minor setbacks, such as the Trump presidency and the Brexit referendum, cannot stop the long-term trend of ever-increasing progress.After showing us how much the world has progressed, Pinker turns his book into an essay. In part 3 he makes a case for three Enlightenment values that are, according to him, essential to actively promote and continue the progress we have already made. The first of these values is reason, which is under increasing attack by generations of postmodernists (“objective reality doesn’t exist”, “all cultures are equal”, etc.) and populists (“the will of the people should be followed”, “we need a strong leader”, etc.). Next to these two ideologies, human beings suffer from biases and hence the media portray a picture of a world that is almost continuously on the brink of World War III. Pinker, essentially, advocates a more rational public discourse, in which fact checking and statistical reasoning trump Trumpism (pun intended).The second value Pinker advocates is science. In other words: trial and error. Not just to gain more knowledge and hence receive more control over our lives (by fighting diseases, natural disasters, etc.), but also to base our policies on. Politics, according to Pinker, should be more evidence-based and less ideology-driven. This is the old argument of piecemeal social engineering promoted by Karl Popper: changing policy in small steps; measuring and evaluating the results of each step; and adjusting where necessary.Pinker notices a trend in literary and cultural circles, especially due to scientifically illiterate self-proclaimed intellectuals, to blackball science and act like science is the root of all evil. The truth is that science is a-moral – in the sense that it doesn’t say whether we should build a-bombs, nuclear reactors for energy, or both, and in which situation – and that science offers us the possibility to better our lives. It is due to science that we live longer, healthier and wealthier.The third and last value that Pinker advocates is humanism. Humanism is the answer to the problem of the a-morality of science: it tells us what to do with all the knowledge, wealth and technological possibilities. Pinker uses the ethics of one of the founders of the Enlightenment, Spinoza. According to Spinoza, any human being that is governed by reason will wish for any other human the same things as they wish for themselves. This is a strong ethical imperative, and Pinker uses the rest of the chapter to state it more fully (in short: consequentialism) and to refute the two counter-narratives: religious morals (which are, according to Pinker, humanized by humanism – with the exception of Islam) and populism/nationalism (which are inspired by the ethics of Nietzsche’s Übermensch and heroism).All of the above is my try to summarize Pinker’s thoughts as honest and representative as possible. Of course this is practically impossible: the book is huge and Pinker is much nuanced on all of the themes mentioned. But: what to think of it all?First, I applaud Pinker for stating clearly how far we have come since the 16th century: how much better off human beings are in the 21st century world. As Pinker himself repeats, it is trendy to be a cultural pessimist. All this liberalism and progress has led to atomized societies and hedonistic, empty lives. It is also very fancy to be a fatalist, especially regarding the environment and climate. Pinker's book is a healthy antidote to all this doom-thinking and the masses of studies and graphs he uses to back up his arguments make cultural pessimism and climate fatalism hard to sustain.Second, I think Pinker is right in seeing humanism, reason and science as the driving forces behind the world we live in nowadays. It is only when reason is set aside – consciously or unconsciously – that progress halts and that we fall back on our primitive nature and zero-sum value systems. I think he is also right in describing the two major threats to the world as we know it: religious morality and populism (again, left- as well as rightwing). So in all this, Enlightenment Now is a terribly accurate and timely book.But I do disagree with some of Pinker’s observations, especially the ones on happiness and quality of life. I cannot help but reflect that Enlightenment Now is written by a Harvard professor whose life is spent on creative thinking and intellectual effort to understand the world. I don’t think many of us can share this luxury, and that for many of us leading ‘normal lives’ life isn’t as fulfilling or free as we wish. Pinker’s line of argument is (albeit simplified): younger generations suffer less from addictions; commit fewer suicides; suffer less from depression; etc.; hence, they are happier than earlier generations and have a higher quality of life. I don’t know if the amount of suicides and depressions says anything (or much) about the happiness of people. And another problem with this line of thinking – which really surfaces throughout the whole book – is that it generalizes over everyone. It is entirely possible that certain parts of the population are worse off, but that this negative effect is swamped by an exponential increase of happiness by the rest of the population. For example, due to globalization, the world is better off, and the poorest people and the poorest countries are the real gainers in health and wealth; yet the (lower) middle classes and lower classes in richer countries are really worse off than earlier generations – combined with an ever-increasing decline of social mobility. The same thing goes with people in vulnerable professions or in vulnerable life situations: handicapped people, sick people, old people, etc. In all developed countries we see an ever-increasing jungle of rules and regulations, to guarantee an equal treatment for all people in like situations. This sounds beautiful and noble, but it results in health care workers clocking five minutes for washing elderly people; treating schoolchildren as revenue and future tax payers; making people who depend on social welfare end up in mazes of bureaucracy; etc. Is this truly progress? (Of course, Pinker would counter: would they be better off in the nineteenth century?)My point is that statistics are useful to describe general trends and to understand what causes play a role. When we understand what factors make the world a better place to live in, we can apply more of the same potion. Understanding is fundamental. But scientific studies of subjects like happiness - even apart from all the methodological issues involved - are rather empty when we're dealing with our own personal lives and our loved ones around us. Stating, for example, that more people are better off and that poverty declines, is a rather meaningless statement when talking to someone who just lost his or her job because his or her employer moved to a developing country. Personally, I think the diffusion of liberalism, the results of equal rights movements (including feminism), and decades of migration have led to a diminishing social cohesion in Western societies – and between countries worldwide. This is, for example, illustrated by contemporary elections: a huge assembly of small political factions and an increasingly polarized climate. It is also illustrated by the popularity of identity politics, in which individuals base their personal identity on biological and cultural traits. Western societies have degraded into collections of individuals without much common ground. Hence, all the rules and regulations to enforce equality: people don’t trust each other anymore – or at least less than before. I cannot help but remark that in Sweden there are plans to make laws to make two adults consent to have sexual intercourse - as if the intricate and complex dealings in real life can be translated and enforced by abstract laws. The same applies to the laws against islamophobia that the Canadian parliament put into practice in 2017. This is symptomatic of societies lacking social cohesion and reciprocal trust and commitment.I think Pinker is over-optimistic when it comes to a better world. He does notice an increase in global and national inequality and declining social mobility, but he doesn’t see it as serious arguments against progress. Of course, from a macro-perspective, the world is better off and this is a good thing. But people don’t like grim futures and this can become very problematic in countries in which large swathes of the population have to give up health and wealth to transfer it to developing countries – something which is inevitable if the world economy continues the way it does now. I think the safe thing to say is that Enlightenment Now is a reliably optimistic book on how the world as a whole is much better off in 2018 than in 1618. The causes of this progress are humanism, reason and science. On a grand scale, Pinker’s book is an important reminder of the possibilities of human progress – if/when we set our minds to it we can do a lot to better our lives. Yet by zooming out, Pinker steers around the (equally important) question of a declining standard of life for individuals and particular social groups and a feeling of loss of social cohesion. Yet, these last points weren’t the goal of his book, so I shouldn’t end this review on such a sour note. It’s a very interesting and readable book: read it!"
289,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1139239-michael-austin,4,"Steven Pinker is a rare creature in the academic world: a liberal who is not a leftist. As a liberal he supports things like free speech, civil rights, democratic ideals, and a strong government that ensures safety, protects the environment, and redistributes some portion of income to support education, health care, infrastructure, and the reduction of poverty. As a non-leftist, he supports things like a democratic government and a capitalist economy that, while subject to government regulation and income redistribution, still functions as a free market. Like most of Pinker’s books, Enlightenment Now is big and filled with lots of data, but actually very tightly argued. The sequence of his argument goes something like this:1.	In the eighteenth century, European intellectuals produced a movement that we call “the Enlightenment” that was built on four interrelated principles: reason, science, humanism, and progress. They set in motion revolutions in government, science, and culture that has shaped the world ever since. 2.	The Enlightenment worked. Over the last two and a half centuries, nearly every measure of human flourishing has increased dramatically across the world. People alive today are better educated, healthier, richer, and safer than they have ever been at any time in history. Major diseases have been wiped out by vaccination, extreme poverty has been substantially reduced by global markets, and war and violence have decreased to their lowest levels in world history.3.	Since its beginning, the Enlightenment has had to contend with “counter-Enlightenment” narratives from both the left and the right. Counter-Enlightenment narratives are those that portray the world as getting worse, either because people are falling away from religious belief and values (the conservative counter-narrative), or because capitalism has enervated the world for its own profit and turned 99% of people into labor machines that feed its insatiable greed (the leftist counter-narrative). 4.	The work of the Enlightenment is not finished. There is still poverty, war, and injustice. There are still threats to safety and to the environment. We still have many, many problems to solve. But these problems are best solved by using the tools of the Enlightenment (reason, science, and humanism) rather than by reverting to counter-Enlightenment narratives such as religious fundamentalism or Marxism to address them. As one who is, like Pinker, a liberal but not a leftist, I find myself agreeing with almost everything in this over-arching argument. Sure I have specific quibbles with all kinds of stuff. Pinker is not content to show that most things are a little bit better. He wants to be more comprehensive than that and show that everything is a lot better. And in the process, he often stretches his argument beyond what can be reasonably proved. But even adjusting for some hyperbole, the data he presents is overwhelmingly persuasive—not just that life has gotten better in the world since the 18th century, but that it has improved dramatically in just the last 30 years. During this time, extreme poverty has fallen from 50% of the world to 10%, the number of people killed in wars has fallen by 200%, criminal violence has decreased dramatically, cars are safer, more countries are democratic, and income inequality has decreased in all but the most developed nations. It seems to me that there is no reasonable way to refute the proposition that the world today is more amenable to human flourishing than it has ever been.But there are a whole lot of unreasonable ways to refute this, and this, really, is the most important part of the book. Pinker identifies two key cognitive biases that causes many people to reject the Enlightenment narrative that the world is getting better and embrace one of several counter-Enlightenment narratives that insist that the world is getting worse.The first of these biases is the “availability heuristic.” We have a lot more access to information than we have ever had before, so we see more of the bad stuff than anybody ever has. Our Internet and social media feeds immediately show us acts of racism, police brutality, mass violence, civil strife, and even genocide. We see these with much greater frequency, and when we do, our minds tell us that they are happening with greater frequency, which is generally not the case. But don’t try to tell us that, because we probably won’t believe it.The more troubling factor in our tendency to see a world in decline is the confirmation bias, which simply means that we tend to see what confirms our beliefs and ignore what does not. And we are attracted to narratives of decline because they fit with so many ready-made world views. They are, in fact, an indispensable part of contemporary politics.“We are doing well, but we need to do better” is not a good political message. “We are in decline and need to make America great again” is. And herein lies the fundamental attraction to narratives that cannot be supported by reason or data. We want to believe that things are getting worse, because this is the best way to accomplish political and religious goals. These narratives create fear, and fear motivates us to vote, to donate to politicians, to attend Church, to donate to Churches, and to agitate for change. We can do this through reason and science, of course, but it doesn’t work as well. And this is probably Pinker’s most important point: we are in danger of losing much of the progress that we have made as a nation, and as a world, by rejecting the principles responsible for that progress and embracing narratives that emphasize tribalism, magical thinking, resentment, and unwarranted fear. In the United States, we are rolling back the government regulations that have kept us safe and improved our environment, and we currently have an administration that insists that global relations are a zero-sum game. Globally, people are rejecting the vaccines that wiped out diseases and attacking the advances in food technology that have dramatically reduced hunger and poverty. Countries that once embraced secularism and democracy are starting to turn to religious fundamentalism. We are abandoning things that work in favor of things that won’t. And this is very dangerous. It is possible to argue with almost everything that Pinker says in Enlightenment Now. But those arguments must also adopt Enlightenment principles: showing where his reason fails, providing better evidence, rejecting conclusions that he makes because they are not adequately supported. This kind of debate is necessary and proper.Unfortunately, this is not the debate that we are having. Across the political spectrum, the Enlightenment ideals that Pinker champions are being refuted from fundamentally illiberal and unenlightened positions with a strong interest in making the world seem like a fetid hell hole that is only a moment away from the apocalypse. These arguments are dangerous because they appeal to the kind of thinking that caused most of our problems in the first place."
290,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,5,"There is no one alive who writes with the mind-sweeping clarity and breadth of knowledge that Steven Pinker possesses. Though there are other works of his that are perhaps more revolutionary (The Blank Slate) or ambitious in their singular explanatory power (How the Mind Works), it is this latest volume of his that is his most timely and all-encompassing cerebral broom.If the idea of needing to defend Enlightenment values is mysterious to you at this point then I can only pity you your global-scale ignorance or apathy. In Pinker, that cause of defense has found its most able champion. Offering an incredible array of 75 statistical graphs that are properly contextualized and interpreted, he has produced such an incredibly coherent and well-argued line of thinking that has enough independent and objective fact to annoy partisans of both sides of the political/philosophical spectrum. Much of the work seems to follow-up on several of the arguments brought forth in his previous volume, ""The Better Angels of Our Nature."" Following a deft summary as to what Enlightenment ideals and practices are, Pinker proceeds to show just how they have benefited society and the world as a whole ever since, where they have come up short, and recommends several new usages of these ideas for future mutual benefit. Along the way he casts off so many misconceptions and anecdotal ""arguments"" against the Enlightenment, something long overdue in writings by contemporary intellectuals who - alarmingly and genuinely stupidly - have distanced themselves from these values. This is not done with flippant casuistry or mere rhetorical prolepsis but with relentless data and cogent, in-depth examination. Some telling and amusing samples from the work include:""If you extol reason, then what matters is the integrity of the thoughts, not the personalities of the thinkers.""""While a vision of world peace may have given John and Yoko some good songs, it is hopelessly naïve in the real world.""""However long it takes, we must not let the existence of cognitive and emotional biases or the spasms of irrationality in the political arena discourage us from the Enlightenment ideal of relentlessly pursuing reason and truth.""This is the book of the year, no question. No one has this diverse array of knowledge, no one marshals their facts better, and no one does so with the ease of language that Dr. Pinker presents across a work of 500+ pages. In closing I will let him sum up one of the major points of this monumental achievement: ""Remember your math: an anecdote is not a trend. Remember your history: the fact that something is bad today doesn't mean it was better in the past. Remember your philosophy: one cannot reason that there's no such thing as reason, or that something is true or good because God said it is. And remember your psychology: much of what we know isn't so, especially when our comrades know it too."""

But reading the book attentively, one can't help but notice how much thought went into Pinker's formulations, and how careful he is with what he is saying and showing. The one detailed review I can recommend which appreciates the precision and is not politically loaded is Scott Aaronson's: https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p....Here, I will only give my brief impression. First, I must admit that I found some chapters in the book stronger than others. This is to be expected of a work that attempts to cover the whole span of the human condition across history, and do so in an exclusively data-driven, empirical way. For some developments, there is just not enough good data available, and so some of the conjectures and estimates will necessarily be better supported than others. That said, taken as a whole, Enlightenment Now is an exceptional piece of popular scholarship, providing a most enjoyable review of all the relevant aspects of human life. Page after page, figure after figure, relentlessly hammering home the crucial point way too many of us are unaware of: the world and our lives in it are continually getting better, along almost every conceivable dimension. One could argue at length about the data in each and every chapter. One could rightly point out that some of it is one-sided, that his historical accounts are incomplete and some of the conclusions premature. But the sheer weight of evidence makes it impossible to deny the central points:* life has been, and is, getting better for ever more people in ever more places* it is happening as we create new knowledge and use it to gradually solve problems* problems are inevitable, new ones will always arise, but problems are also solvable, given the right knowledge* the best system we have to create new knowledge is science* continuing to gradually improve our institutions will continue to bring incremental progress* we are facing many dangers, some of them existential, which call for unprecedented global cooperation and knowledge production to overcome* the ideas outlined above are, sadly, time and again attacked by hostile ideologies from all sides of the political spectrum, and have to be defended if we are to continue our progress.These points were made very persuasively in the course of the book, and appear to me of paramount importance. Reading Enlightenment Now significantly shifted my worldview towards conditional future optimism, motivating to work very hard to sustain our amazing progress so far."
292,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"Pinker builds on his previous book The Better Angels of Our Nature to make a strong case for enlightenment values.His writing is excellent and always an absolute joy to read.He puts apparent contemporary reversals of progress in perspective. He defends humanism. He pulls no punches discussing religion. He weighs in on economics as key to those Better Angels. He wipes the floor with Friedrich Nietzsche and his intellectual heritage in fascism, Nazism, etc. He backs up everything with scientific evidence. Even if sometimes the interpretation comes off a bit forced, he's still working on solid ground throughout the book."
293,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,5,"Steven Pinker was one of the first writers to kindle my passion for scientific thinking. When I read 
The Blank Slate
 in 2011, it exposed me to a host of intellectual disciplines that my undergraduate training in philosophy had neglected––most notably evolutionary psychology, skepticism, and the empirical foundations of human nature. Nearly a decade later, I am thrilled not only to have another opportunity to journey through Pinker’s impressive mind, but also that his chosen message is rooted in data-driven, responsible optimism. Given the psychological and political difficulties of 2017, I was on the verge of thinking that such optimism was nothing more than shrugging in the face of inevitable doom. But Enlightenment Now turned my frown upside down, made me feel good about being human again, and restored much of my belief that humanity still has a bright future (or many possible bright futures) ahead.If I could rename this book without worrying about marketing, my chosen title would be: Everybody Calm the Fuck Down: The Case for Sanity, by Steven Pinker. At a moment in global and American history when many citizens feel like the sky is continually falling, Enlightenment Now provides a hard-nosed critique of our tendency to indulge our inner Chicken Littles. Instead of taking the in vogue route of mining for new reasons why human civilization is inherently dishonorable and teetering on the brink of destruction, Pinker argues the exact opposite. To make his case, Pinker demonstrates that the Enlightenment, the great intellectual movement that precipitated the rise of modernity, has been a rollicking success:""This book is my attempt to restate the ideals of the Enlightenment in the language and concepts of the 21st century. I will first lay out a framework for understanding the human condition informed by modern science––who we are, where we came from, what our challenges are, and how we can meet them. The bulk of the book is devoted to defending those ideals in a distinctively 21st-century way: with data. This evidence-based take on the Enlightenment project reveals that it was not a naïve hope. The Enlightenment has worked––perhaps the greatest story seldom told. And because this triumph is so unsung, the underlying ideals of reason, science, and humanism are unappreciated as well. Far from being an insipid consensus, these ideals are treated by today’s intellectuals with indifference, skepticism, and sometimes contempt. When properly appreciated, I will suggest, the ideals of the Enlightenment are in fact stirring, inspiring, noble––a reason to live."" (5-6, emphasis his)This passage reveals both the considerable strengths and non-negligible weaknesses of Pinker’s position. Since I agree with Pinker’s outlook and think this book represents a hugely valuable contribution to the modern moment, I’ll deal with the chinks in his armor first and follow with praise. First, Pinker’s characterization of the Enlightenment’s success as “the greatest story seldom told” is an overstatement. I’d like to say it’s an overstatement that isn’t repeated in the rest of the text, but that wouldn’t be an honest appraisal. It’s my feeling that the Enlightenment-rejecting “intellectuals” in Pinker’s crosshairs––frustrating and myopic as they may be––do not represent a majority opinion in America or anywhere else. In fact, as Pinker points out, they do not even represent a majority of intellectuals:""During the 20th century, the landscape of human knowledge was carved into professionalized duchies, and the growth of science (particularly the sciences of human nature) is often seen as an encroachment on territories that had been staked and enclosed by the academic humanities. It’s not that practitioners of the humanities themselves have this zero-sum mindset. Most artists show no signs of it…Nor is the anxiety expressed by the scholars who delve into the historical epochs, genres of art, systems of ideas, and other subject matter in the humanities, since a true scholar is receptive to ideas regardless of their origin. The defensive pugnacity belongs to a culture: Snow’s Second Culture of literary intellectuals, cultural critics, and erudite essayists."" (389-90, emphasis his)This Second Culture is Pinker’s true enemy, and while he does a good job of calling them out directly in the latter chapters, some of his earlier assertions belie the genuine nuances that bolster the rest of the text. For example, the opening sentences of a chapter called “Progressophobia” read thus: “Intellectuals hate progress. Intellectuals who call themselves progressive really hate progress” (39, emphasis his). Such sweeping statements needlessly open a path for critics to characterize Pinker as nothing more than a Panglossian apologist for modernity; sadly, this path will be well-trodden given how Pinker has been villainized by the Second Culture and its acolytes (this review  is a good example). Here we find the downside of Pinker’s iconoclastic nature, which is not only the source of his intellectual vitality and undeniable wit, but also his most significant vulnerability.My other worry about this book is that, despite Pinker’s repeated claims that the Enlightenment’s success is not a justification for complacency in the face of extant problems, it may nevertheless end up playing that role in cultural and political discussions, as well as in the hearts and minds of readers. Over and over, Enlightenment Now caused me to take a deep breath and remind myself that things aren’t so bad, which is terrific for my personal health and state of mind, but probably not the best way to get me into the proverbial trenches solving humanity’s most difficult challenges. Of course, one of Pinker’s central claims is that the best way to fight those battles is to eschew unnecessary excitation in favor of calm calculation and reasoned negotiation. But I still worry that readers like myself––privileged first-worlders for whom modernity is working just fine––may utilize this perspective to thicken our own socioeconomic and ideological bubbles instead of heeding Pinker’s call to action. The lesson here is that Enlightenment Now represents just one important perspective amongst others, and should not be treated as a comprehensive guide to the world’s present state. In other words, it’s like any other intellectual endeavor.Okay, now for the fun stuff! As ever, Pinker has crafted a book that is engaging, cleanly written, and packed with dense and fascinating thoughts. Since this is a book about progress, we should start with Pinker’s chosen definition:""What is progress? You might think that the question is so subjective and culturally relative as to be forever unanswerable. In fact, it’s one of the easier questions to answer. Most people agree that life is better than death. Abundance is better than poverty. Peace is better than war. Safety is better than danger. Freedom is better than tyranny. Equal rights are better than bigotry and discrimination. Literacy is better than illiteracy. Knowledge is better than ignorance. Intelligence is better than dull-wittedness. Happiness is better than misery. Opportunities to enjoy family, friends, culture, and nature are better than drudgery and monotony. All these things can be measured. If they have increased over time, that is progress."" (51)Pinker is not posturing when he claims that these indicators of progress can be measured. His commitment to empiricism runs much deeper than that of most public intellectuals, as evidenced by the 70+ graphs/charts and 100 pages of notes/references that accompany his superb argumentation. While he is well aware that data generation is a flawed human process (404), the raw power of evidentiary convergence becomes increasingly undeniable as Pinker’s explication of progress unfolds over about 300 pages.In my view, Pinker’s most important insight about progress is this: “It’s in the nature of progress that it erases its tracks, and its champions fixate on the remaining injustices and forget how far we have come” (215). This dynamic can make progress very difficult to identify and acknowledge, since even a world that is improving will always create new obstacles during the process of rendering old ones obsolete: “Progress cannot be monotonic because solutions to problems always create new problems. But progress can resume when the new problems are solved in their turn” (44). While it may seem simplistic to some readers, I think Pinker’s characterization of the world’s difficulties as mere problems to be solved is a critical and often-elided truth that we need to rediscover. In a cultural milieu where doubling down on embattled ideological positions and demonizing one’s opponents is routine, it becomes heroic to refocus one’s attention and energy on discovering the empirical nature of a problem and following the road to solutions wherever it may lead.Of the seventeen topics Pinker addresses in his discussion of progress, the one that most pleased me was his chapter on the environment. This is a topic that many big thinkers still neglect, even though climate change is perhaps the most ominous long-term threat to the continuance of human progress. Pinker takes up the climate problem with distinctive poise, showing how sentimental, anti-industrial positions on the political left and denialist positions on the right have both failed to provide a viable platform for global climate action. He advocates for “Ecomodernism,” a nascent field of study founded on three tenets: (1) some degree of pollution is unavoidable due to the entropic nature of the universe, (2) industrialization has generally been good for humanity, and (3) technology is the primary tool we should use to mitigate environmental damage without relinquishing the myriad benefits of modern life (123-4).While Second Culturists will surely write Pinker off as an obsequious technocrat beguiled by the corrupt comforts of elite capitalist culture, a sober assessment of Ecomodernism reveals it as the most reasonable and realizable approach for dealing with climate change. Pinker advocates for a combination of solutions, including decarbonization, alternative energies, dematerialization, and nuclear power––no silver bullets here. His recommendations, especially on the nuclear issue, pay no heed to the entrenched ideological positions of climate warriors or denialists, but rather follow the evidence wherever it leads. Climate change is serious and daunting, but panicking and using it as an excuse to upend the economic and institutional foundations of progress is foolish. This message is starkest in Pinker’s takedown of Naomi Klein’s position that the only way to address climate change is to raze contemporary capitalism and rebuild it with a much heavier emphasis on centrally-planned economies. His critique was especially salutary for me, given that I was completely seduced by Klein’s point of view when I read This Changes Everything back in 2014. I love an opportunity to update my opinions and reflect on the informational and perspectival limitations of my past selves.Instead of succumbing to the idea that humanity must repent for the great sin of modernity, Pinker instead demonstrates that we can approach this daunting challenge with a rational maturity:""It’s time to retire the morality play in which modern humans are a vile race of despoilers and plunderers who will hasten the apocalypse unless they undo the Industrial Revolution, renounce technology, and return to an ascetic harmony with nature. Instead, we can treat environmental protection as a problem to be solved: how can people live safe, comfortable, and stimulating lives with the least possible pollution and loss of natural habitats?"" (134)As it has always been, the solution is to press forward using the human wellsprings of creativity and innovation; it does no good to nostalgically pine for previous eras when life for average folks and even most elites was much worse than today.Also laudable is Pinker’s defense of rationality, which is endangered by political partisanship and religious/magical thinking. Pinker’s rejection of political partisanship, which he likens to sports fandom, is particularly valuable (359-60). He lays out a battery of research showing how ideologues bend over backwards to deny their opponents the benefit of the doubt, then ties it off with a much-needed reminder that progress is not owned by any individual or group, but is rather the collective result of countless actions and shifts over time that can come from even the most unlikely places:""It should not be surprising that the facts of human progress confound the major -isms. The ideologies are more than two centuries old and are based on mile-high visions such as whether humans are tragically flawed or infinitely malleable, and whether society is an organic whole or a collection of individuals. A real society comprises hundreds of millions of social beings, each with a trillion-synapse brain, who pursue their well-being while affecting the well-being of others in complex networks with massive positive and negative externalities, many of them historically unprecedented. It is bound to defy any simple narrative of what will happen under a given set of rules. A more rational approach is to treat societies as ongoing experiments and open-mindedly learn the best practices, whichever part of the spectrum they come from."" (365)All of us are inescapably embedded in Pinker’s “real society,” and our ability to intelligently acknowledge and navigate this messy reality can stave off madness and keep progress coming.Enlightenment Now closes with Pinker’s celebration of humanism––a strong message that rehabilitated my humanist loyalties, which took a hit when I read Yuval Noah Harari’s 
Homo Deus
 last year. I still wonder how humanism will stay relevant as we evolve into new transhuman and posthuman forms, but I’ve no doubt that Pinker’s perspective is the right one for the here and now:""The first step toward wisdom is the realization that the laws of the universe don’t care about you. The next is the realization that this does not imply that life is meaningless, because people care about you, and vice versa. You care about yourself, and you have a responsibility to respect the laws of the universe that keep you alive, so don’t squander your existence. Your loved ones care about you, and you have a responsibility not to orphan your children, widow your spouse, and shatter your parents. And anyone with a humanistic sensibility cares about you, not in the sense of feeling your pain––human empathy is too feeble to spread itself across billions of strangers––but in the sense of realizing that your existence is cosmically no less important than theirs, and that we all have a responsibility to use the laws of the universe to enhance the conditions in which we all can flourish.""

296,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3055905-nils,1,"Dr Pangloss lives! I’m unconvinced that the various Enlightenments (there actually were several distinct Enlightenments, though Pinker seems unaware of this), much as I love them, can really be credited for the huge increase in human material well-being that has taken place over the last couple of centuries. This turns out not to be a trivial critique, since Pinker’s argument that the Enlightenment is what “caused” the material improvement drives his conclusion that the main threat to sustaining that improvement comes from those who he alleges are undermining the Enlightenment, e.g. the so-called postmodernists. This in turn leads to Pinker’s bizarre suggestion that the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche represent a greater threat to our sustained material well-being than, say, Exxon-Mobil and the Koch brothers. Judge for yourself whether you find that plausible.In fact, the real underpinning the material gains of the last two centuries have been more institutional than ideational. This in turn implies that we must scrutinize the solidity of our institutional matrix if we want a real purchase of the sustainability of these gains. First, there have been numerous civilizations achieving marked improvement in the welfare and well-being of their populations – at least their upper classes. The Maya, the Romans, and several dynastic episodes of the Chinese achieved such gains. Of course, the gains that industrial modernity has achieved over the last quarter millennium outstrips all previous improvements. But taking the longer view, the gains of modernity are perhaps less impressive than they seem. Almost all those gains have taken place in the last quarter millennium, and 250 years, after all, isn’t that long of a run for a civilization. Other historical civilizations have sustained their gains for much longer. The Roman Empire’s eastern branch basked in cultural glory for a thousand years. And even though it’s usually meant pejoratively, it’s no coincidence that the word “byzantine” is a synonym for institutional complexity.Second, there are reasons to suspect that modernity’s run of material amelioration may be drawing to a close—and may even go into reverse. Broadly speaking these reasons can be divided in two. The first concern biophysical limits to growth. These are enduring arguments that the Breakthrough Institute has done much to illuminate and clarify, so suffice to say that, as a long term proposition, Malthus hasn’t yet been proven wrong, and climate change presents challenges of unprecedented scale that will only be addressed if there is sufficient collective political will to overcome collective action and free riding challenges. It’s at best unclear whether we have the global social capital to do so. Put another way: we live in an era of wicked problems.My own skepticism about whether humanity can overcome these challenges brings me to my fundamental critique of Pinker’s optimism: not only the sustainability of the gains of the last quarter millennium, but also the extensibility of these to larger sections of humanity, as well as the ability to address the growing headwinds posed by anthropogenic climate change depend crucially on a massive strengthening of our global institutional and governance infrastructure. From this perspective, all the indicators are sharply negative over the last fifty and especially the last ten years.For nearly fifty years, Gallup has run a series of polls asking Americans about their confidence in various institutions – universities, the media, business, political institutions, and so forth. While the data are noisy, the overall trendline is inexorably downwards. The decline in confidence is partly the result of sustained anti-institutional propaganda, which exists in both leftwing and rightwing versions. But as I have argued elsewhere, I believe the root cause of this declining trust is the objectively poor institutional performance and a lack of elite accountability. A general feature of late modernity is a declining faith in social authority of all sorts, as ever more individuated and autonomous polities become ever less willing to entrust political agents to do anything. The advent of Donald Trump is merely a symptom of both the failure and the rejection of institutions in the United States.Nor is this just an American phenomenon. The rise of populism across Europe likewise reflects distrust of institutions. The Brexit vote two years ago of course represented a direct rebuke to transnational institutions. More recently, the triumph in the Italian elections of the Five Start Movement, whose calling card was a rejection of political party infrastructure, signaled nothing if not a rejection of institutions. (It remains unclear whether the Movement can manage even a small city, let alone Italy as a whole.)With the United States in the grip of Trumpism and the European Union caught between shambolic national politics and collective dissolution, the primary hope for global leadership seems to be falling by default to the Chinese. Some people have argued that China is filling the institutional gap left by a receding Europe and the United States. Eric X. Li, for example, recently argued that Xi Jinping’s merging of Chinese state and party infrastructure makes sense given that “the party has developed into the most competent national political institution in the world today.” What this bold claim tacitly conceded is that, despite the huge successes the Chinese state has had in poverty reduction over the last 40 years, China’s existing institutions are inadequate to managing the bumpy course corrections that lie ahead if it is to sustain its gains.Even more worrying than the declining performance of global and national political institutions are the faltering institutional underpinnings of sustained technological innovation – innovation which everyone, optimists and pessimists alike, agrees is essential to any adequate plan for addressing the challenges posed by climate change. As Mariana Mazzucato has shown, state support for innovation and entrepreneurship has in fact been at the root of almost all major technological breakthroughs of the last 75 years. Specifically, much of this support has taken place through trillions of dollars of state funding for research universities. But universities today are under unprecedented assault. Variously accused of being hotbeds of leftist indoctrination, engines of neoliberal reproduction, or simply wastes of money, no one trusts universities anymore. (This is the real place where the “postmodernists” have something to answer for: they have both been a primary vector of critique of universities, in effect sawing at the branch they sit on, while at the same time provoking hysteria about the supposed insanity of the humanities, of which Pinker’s book is a characteristic example.) While it seems inconceivable that the United States in particular would flush away the linchpin of its technological, industrial, and soft power success, the cultural assault on universities today is unparalleled. Non-coincidentally, universities also face a funding crisis of unprecedented proportions, one that is hitting humanities departments first but which the STEM fields are unlikely to escape. All this threatens to cut the legs out from under the innovation engine that is critical to any effort to escape the grim climate reaper."
297,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna,4,"This is nonfiction and it covers a giant host of various topics, including politics, racism, war, etc. For as long as this audiobook was, I was never bored. The author moved effortlessly and quickly from topic to topic to topic. That style worked here. So the 4 stars is for the entertainment value that I was able to place on this. Now with all that said, it usually bothers me when the author slants all the info to fit his views and then completely glosses over other things that might deflate his defense. While this author did that (abundantly), I didn't find it offensive or annoying. He had some well placed humor to soften that reaction. "
298,0525427570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68472482-daniel,5,"This is the best book I have ever read which is something I’m not saying lightly. It makes you so optimistic about the state of human progress and it makes you truly appreciate how much progress we have made over the past couple of centuries. It is really mind-blowing. If you weren’t already, it will also make you very optimistic about the likeliness of this progress continuing in the future with the help of, among other things, technology and today’s widely available information resources.Pinker goes through a wide range of subjects from Life expectancy, Peace and Safety to Equal rights, Knowledge, Quality of life and Happiness. He backs it up with rigorous research and clearly shows how almost every relevant parameter is going in the right direction. The only two areas that as of now haven't shown clear-as-day improvements over time are Terrorism and Global warming. (Another area, which Pinker didn’t include in the book, that could be considered a blip in the otherwise steady drumbeat of progress, are the recent reports of increasing death rates among middle-aged Americans over the past decade.) Focusing on the bigger picture analysis that Pinker provides all throughout the book rather than the daily news and shorter-term trends, you get the true picture of how well humanity is doing.One fascinating example of this is what Pinker calls the consumer surplus. Think about the washing machine. It saves us 10h per week compared to 1920 and costs a few hundred dollars. Now, if you think about how much someone would have to pay you for you to give up your washing machine, the number is clearly not in the hundreds of dollars anymore. Many people in developed nations would say that there is no price that would make them give it up. So not only are we richer but many of the utilities (and other things) that we use everyday can be bought for almost nothing compared to their actual value to us. This wasn't true 50 and 100 years ago. Another example is that today the average American worker retires at 62. Hundred years ago the average American worker died at 51.Pinker thinks (and I agree) that the media is responsible for a large part of today’s unfounded, but in many parts of the Western world, prevailing pessimism. As he puts it “When voters are inches away from the news, optimism can seem naive.” He points out that if newspapers would have elected to report more good news, they could have run the headline ""Number of people in extreme poverty fell by 137,000 since yesterday"" every day for the past 25 years.The book is structured in such a way that you can easily read only one chapter that you find interesting and skip the rest. There is for example a very good chapter on the environment and climate change if you want to read up on that. I do think Pinker misses some of the big potential risks in his discussion on AI, for example advanced AI systems in the wrong hands. And I think you can safely skim through the final three chapters without missing too much of an otherwise wonderful book.As a side note, the reason I decided to read this book was Bill Gates' glowing review of it some time ago. As you can see, I wasn’t disappointed. In his review, Bill said that he read the book very slowly because he loved it so much, but that he thought “most people will find it a quick and accessible read.” Perhaps he wrote the review in the ensuing euphoria after having just finished the book because I can assure you of one thing: this book is a lot of things, an easy read for most people it is not (it’s all relative I guess). But it is enormously fun reading and often highly enlightening so it's well worth your time. A big thank you to Pinker for putting things in the right perspective and allowing readers to see the bigger picture so clearly."
