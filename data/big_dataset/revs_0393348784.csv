0,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/521847-p,1,"I had to quit after 68 pages. Dennett apparently had a class of freshmen review this book - I wish he would have had a couple actual philosophers review it as well. If you have an understanding of philosophy and basic thinking tools, this book is not for you. If you already are an independent thinker, this book is not for you. If you are easily impressed by name-dropping and misleading examples, this book is for you.The book starts out poorly with way too much name-dropping and Dennett admitting that he heckles lecturers for fun. He has very basic ideas of ""thinking tools"" and then uses very complex examples with very limited context. In these examples he takes cheap shots at fellow philosophers, while not providing enough context to really be able to agree that Dennett is in the right. In chapter 1 he makes an innocuous yet unsound argument, and it is worth mentioning because it shows that he is very careless with his arguments throughout the book (or at least to page 68.) He states: ""Evolution works the same way: all the dumb mistakes tend to be invisible, so all we see is a stupendous string of triumphs. For instance, the vast majority - way over 90 percent - of all the creatures that have ever lived died childless, but not a single one of your ancestors suffered that fate.""So...the majority of creatures don't pass on their genes. Dennett calls that an illustrative example of how ALL dumb mistakes are invisible (er...""tend to be invisible"", whatever that means.) Who says that the 10 percent procreators aren't passing on dumb mistakes? Who says that sexual selection isn't selecting for ""dumb mistakes"" (ie. genes that make an animal more noticeable to predators, or genes that inhibit an animal to move swiftly.) His example is crude, and if the response is that ""dumb mistakes"" are ones that don't permit a creature to pass on its genes, then that just begs the question and proves nothing. The above example was just a red flag. Things start to get really bad in Sections 13-15. 13. Dennett provides us an example where four characters all come, via different paths, to ""believe that a Frenchman has committed murder in Trafalgar Square. He then adds that that proposition (""Frenchman committed murder in TS"") does not occur to them. Thus they all have the belief without formulating the proposition. Dennett makes an implicit assumption here that you actually can have a belief without formulating a proposition. An implicit assumption that becomes a painful assumption when he drives his point home that people generally believe: ""chairs are larger than shoes, that soup is liquid, that elephants don't fly."" If I ask you if you believe that 44 plus 88 is 132, would you say yes? Had you ever formulated that proposition before? Isn't it quite likely that you believed the proposition only after the deduction? Thus, when someone witnesses Jacque shooting Bill, and Bill dying, the belief that a ""murder"" took place may not happen until post-deduction, that is, until the proposition is actually formed. Or when you're asked, ""do elephants fly?"" you first think of an elephant and then deduct that it can't fly? Dennett has not shown that I actually believe elephants don't fly without ever articulating the proposition one way or another.14. ""What this intuition pump shows is that nobody can have just one belief."" Excuse me? Dennett, read a couple neuroscience books and then just take this section out. Even the pop psychology book Incognito should suffice. Even if Dennett's premises are sound (which at least one isn't), his conclusion isn't. His argument here is so poorly constructed I'm not even sure how to attack it. I think his argument goes like this: 1) Apparently inserting a false ""belief"" into Tom causes him to say something that he doesn't truly understand. 2) That shows that if we don't truly understand something, it isn't a true belief. 3) That shows that the only way to truly understand something is if it is coherent with other (sound) beliefs that one holds. 4) That shows that beliefs are thus supported by other beliefs. C) Therefore, ""nobody can have just one belief."" I'm lost on how he got ""beliefs MUST be supported by other beliefs"" from the proposition ""beliefs are supported by other beliefs."" Also, I would re-write proposition 3 as ""That shows that the only way to truly understand something is if it is NOT INCOHERENT with other (sound) beliefs."" Stated this way, Dennett proves absolutely nothing and wasted 3 pages. I can have a single belief, and no other beliefs, and that single belief is not incoherent with any other belief. It pains me that Dennett is making money off of this book.15. ""Daddy is a doctor."" This 1-page section did it in for me, I cannot continue this book. A little girl states the proposition ""daddy is a doctor."" 20 years later she makes the same proposition, only now she has a more sophisticated understanding of the words ""daddy"" and ""doctor."" Dennett writes, ""If understanding comes in degrees, as this example shows, then belief, which depends on understanding, must come in degrees as well, even for such mundane propositions as this.""No! I am not convinced! A five-year old girl who utters the proposition ""Daddy is a doctor"" can have a full 100% belief in that proposition. 20 years later she can make the proposition, with a more sophisticated understanding, and still have a full 100% belief. Dennett, how does the 5-year old ""fall short"" of a full belief? Does she know that ""daddy"" refers to the person who tucks her in at night? Does she know that this person helps sick people in exchange for money? Then WHERE IS SHE FALLING SHORT?!!?!??! Maybe with other arguments not in his book, I could be convinced that I'm wrong and Dennett is right - but his one page argument is far from convincing and far from sound. EDIT: I was so mad at Dennett that I didn't properly attack his argument. I will use an analogy: You have a lightbulb. At first, you can just turn a switch to turn the light on. But you get bored, and decide to make it more fun. You add a second mechanism - the switch needs to be flipped, and then you have to clap before the light goes on. You get bored again, and tweak it one more time: You have to turn the switch, then clap a specific pattern in order to turn the light on. No matter how sophisticated or complicated your INPUT might be, has absolutely no bearing on how sophisticated the OUTPUT might be. Any computer scientist or civil engineer could have told Dennett this. Conclusion: I can't take any more poor logic from someone who is so pompous, name-drops relentlessly, and criticizes other philosophers without providing sufficient context for the reader to actually evaluate the criticism."
1,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,3,"""Intuition pumps and other tools for thinking"" is a mixed bag of goods. Don’t let the title fool you: this books is less about ""thinking tools"" than it is about Daniel Dennet's favorite philosophical thought experiments. Dennet devotes a short and wanting section to general 'thinking tools' (think Okham’s razor), but otherwise spends the majority of your time laying out his personal ideas concerning evolution, meaning, mind, and free will.First, the pros: the subject matter is fascinating, and Dennet's treatment is unusually accessible. Most chapters consist of self-contained thought experiments, and the flanking discussions are written in simple, direct prose. And there are a couple of gems here. In ""Trapped in the Robot Control Room,"" Dennet convinces you that the mind doesn't enter this world as a 'blank slate.' In ""Mary the Color Scientist,"" he forcefully refutes a famous argument in support of qualia. In fact, the entire section about free will (and how it's not incompatible with determinism – a philosophical position called compatibilism) is really quite good.Unfortunately, as a whole, the book falls short. The writing never feels very tight –it's as if the book were written in one sitting, without the oversight of an editor. 'Braindump' isn't the right word, but it's the first word that comes to mind. And when your subject matter concerns such fuzzy and controversial topics such as meaning and consciousness and, this laziness is unforgivable. Additionally, Dennet often takes on a weird, personal, I-hate-this-philosopher-I'm-refuting tone that comes across as strikingly unprofessional, and generally made me feel pretty uncomfortable (""There is a good project for a student of rhetoric: combing through Gould’s huge body of publications and cataloging the different species of boom crutches [Dennet’s word for 'deplorable aids to obfuscation'] he exploited""). This disparaging tone is rather ironic, as it is completely at odds with Dennet’s own advocacy of 'Rapoport’s Rules' in chapter 3 – essentially, the idea that you should be as generous and charitable of your opponent's views as humanely possible.On the whole, I'm glad I read ""Intuition pumps."" At his best, Dennet is thoughtful and provocative. He doesn't hide behind complex philosophical jargon, and his passionate tone mostly refreshing. It's just a shame that he's kind of an ass, and that he seemingly pumped this book out without much post-processing. Give him an editor that will call him out for his shit, and we'll talk again. Until then – there's plenty of other fish in the sea.Fun quotes""[the layperson thinks:] 'I can’t change the past, but if indeterminism is true, I can change the future.' Nope. Change the future from what to what? From what it was going to be to what it is going to be? You can no more change the future than you can change the past. The concept is incoherent."" (391)""Can you conceive of string theory? … it is unintelligible  to be, but for that very reason, I wouldn't be willing to declare it inconceivable or impossible."" (289)""When other people start getting inquisitive, they find that 'God works in mysterious ways' is a convenient anti-thinking tool… I think we should stop treating this ‘pious’ observation as any kind of wisdom and recognize it as the transparently defensive propaganda it is."" (430)"
2,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13222064-eric-wurm,4,"If you've read other Dennett masterpieces, you come away thinking both that the man is a genius and that he's a genius that tends to ramble on. That is not the case in his latest work. He combines many of his previous ideas and some new thoughts into this volume of brief insightful chapters. Dennett covers a wide range of philosophy favorites including consciousness, free will, determinism, artificial life, evolution, and meaning. He gives the reader tools to use when thinking about complex problems. Some of these ideas include:- When does a robot become complex enough to become ""life""? If you gave a robot the tools that evolution uses, is it capable of evolution or merely following a program? Are you merely following a program? How would one know the difference?- If a tool takes on a new use, does it take on a new purpose? Is the old purpose gone? Was there ever a meaningful intrinsic purpose? - How many different creatures could be produced with a library of DNA genomes? These are a few of the questions that you'll contemplate as you navigate this mind-penetrating volume. It's written in the familiar Dennett style with plenty of quirky fabricated terms and odd scenarios that only a philosopher could conjure. It also delves deep into the science of evolution which Dennett never fails to mention. The author views this process of our origin as pertaining to every phenomenon that must be contemplated by our species, and so it does. For those with a shorter attention span, the chapters have been prepared succinctly but with all of the thoughtfulness of the author's longer tomes. If you feel that the unexamined life is not worth living, then this book will give you some new tools for that examination as well an entertaining look into the mind of one of the remaining philosophers that is always worth a read. Dennett doesn't disappoint.Disclaimer: This book was provided by the fine publisher W.W. Norton free of charge for the purpose of review through goodreads' ""First Reads"" program. Further disclaimer: Any publisher that sends me a quality book free of charge will be referred to as a ""fine publisher""."
3,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,4,"An intuition pump is a thought experiment or similar cognitive ""device"" designed to elicit answers to difficult philosophical problems. In --Intuition Pumps And Other Tools For Thinking-- Dennett uses his favorite intuition pumps to (sort of) dismantle difficult philosophical questions such as: evolution, meaning, mind, and free will.I avoided Dennett for a long time because he comes off as such a grumpy old dick in his lectures and Ted talks. I am pleasantly surprised to find that his writing is a lot of fun and quite accessible. Reading this book is like being invited into a cool (not creepy) old dudes garage. He's got all kinds of cleaver little home made gadgets laying around, and its fun as hell to sit there and watch him tinker. I'd give this book 5 (rather than 4) stars if the book didn't lose momentum in the third quarter. But it does. So out comes the 4 paddle. It's still a brilliant book by a brilliant guy. Well worth the investment."
4,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4,"I have enjoyed reading Dennett long before he became one of the four horsemen. I discovered him in the nineties and enjoyed his take on evolution and the mind-body problem as well as the problem of consciousness. He is a good writer and clear. He is also probably the least abrasive of the new atheists. He writes in an enjoyable way about deep topics in the philosophy of mind, evolution, and religion. I don't agree with him on consciousness. I think the hard problem can't be dissolved away as Dennett suggests but I also like engaging with his arguments. This book is a summation of his earlier works in a single volume digestible form. If you are not familiar with Dennett this would be a good book to start.Update 12/29/2019 Dennet is wordy no doubt but he wants to get his perspective understood and sometimes this can be overkill. Still, he does a good job of getting his views on life and consciousness across if the reader has patience. I think there is a lot to be gained by reading him if only not to get caught in a lot of intellectual traps that I for one often fall into."
5,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15294858-leo,2,"Reading this book is basically like reading Daniel Dennett in blog format.I read a lot of Dennett's work as an undergraduate and it had a fairly profound impact on me -- I think the collection ""The Mind's I"" that he edited with Douglas Hofstadter is essentially my atheist bible. I hadn't realized just how much of his work I had read -- almost nothing in this recent collection was new to me. I guess I hadn't realized (or had forgotten) that Dennett is a big fan of Sturgeon's Law (90% of everything is crap; it's like he's a Redditor) and I was unfamiliar with his advice to would-be philosophers (in short, don't get sucked into pointless debates that don't matter just to score points; ditto on him being a Redditor).Early in the book there is a section where he characterizes a number of mental tools and pitfalls. There are some oddly personal attacks on people like Stephen J Gould and Ned Block in this section. The whole enterprise of cataloging rhetorical moves and the like with cute names is pretty annoying, and the personal attacks actually undermine the project: ""I am a master of the mind who knows all the moves and all the missteps, and I'm going to name the missteps after particular people who used them in particular debates with me."" As a result of this Dennett comes across less as a brilliant guy who has thought deeply and successfully about some of the more challenging philosophical problems out there, and more as an asshole who takes things awfully personally for a guy who is always right."
6,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,3,"As clearly advertised on the front cover, this is a book about ""tools for thinking""—and, yes, the first 12 chapters, out of 77, are devoted precisely to that. In contrast, the remaining 65 chapters are summaries, in easy to consume bites, of most of the other books that Dennett has published during the last 20 or 30 years, on the topics of meaning and content, evolution, consciousness, and free will—each updated with relevant new results and references. As such, he presents, and effectively argues for, his own previously published ideas (with the updates). I don't think Dennett's motives here are selfish or disingenuous, rather, we have a major contemporary philosopher summing up his life's work, and pointing the way forward. For deepest understanding, it's better to read the compete original works (Consciousness Explained, Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life, etc). Hence the middling, but not bad, rating: this is mostly not new material but would serve well for those interested in an overview of Dennett's work."
7,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,2,"I liked this well enough. Dennett can write clearly and engagingly. But I never got over the nasty taste in my mouth induced by some really mean-spirited drive-by ad hominem assassination of someone I guess Dennett still holds a shiv for -- Stephen Jay Gould. The odd thing is that, on the issues in question, intellectually I would side with Dennett rather than Gould. But continuing to attack an opponent after the person in question is dead and in no position to mount a defence strikes me as being both unnecessarily shrill and betraying an unattractive insecurity of his own at some level. Anyway, if you can overlook the nastiness of the chapter attacking Gould (in which the arguments may have merit, but the tone is unforgivable and inappropriate), this is a pretty decent book.The last quarter of the book is the weakest, where his arguments linking consciousness and evolution simply fail to gel, in my opinion. But the rest of it is a pretty good read."
8,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11990014-alex-borghgraef,1," It's ironic that Dennett concludes his book with a chapter on why philosophy is still valuable, because halfway through it I was starting to toy with the idea that the world would be better off if philosophy departments all over it were shut down and its inhabitants told to find a real job :-) But first, a disclaimer: I am firmly in the positivist camp, Dan is basically preaching to the choir here. Only he's doing it badly. But wait! What's this about preaching? Isn't this book about thinking tools? Weeell...sorta, but no. The beginning is though, but even that he does badly. The intuition pump (thought experiment for us mere mortals) with tunable knobs was neat, though that's Hofstadters apparently. Occam's razor was a bit of a letdown, he treats it as a common sense rule of thumb and seems oblivious of the fact that it can be derived from Bayesian theory. There's his utterly childish refutation against Roger Penrose's theory (which is IMO both wrong and extremely interesting, and which I suspect Dennett doesn't really understand in the first place, given his stated aversion for quantum mechanics). Then there's the distasteful naming of a number of rhetoric tricks as 'Goulding', after the late SJ Gould. What the feud between Gould and the Dawkins clan was about is still beyond me, as it always seemed to be about technicalities, and I often wonder what real working evolutionary biologists think of the bitchfight between these two pop-sci prima donnas and their supporters. After that it quickly devolves into an overly long regurgitation of Dennett's well-known positions on evolution, consciousness and free will. Nothing against that, but it shouldn't be in this book. This is not a collection of thinking tools, this is a defense of his ideas. And again, if you ask me, not a very good one. The endless exposé on what is a computer? Conway's game of life, again? There's much more interesting things to say about these topics, and they can be said in a much shorter span as well.  I remember being impressed with Dennett a long time ago, maybe I've come too far since then, or maybe he's been stuck in the same arguments. It's much clearer to me now that his understanding of science itself is not as impressive as it seems, as for example his position on quantum mechanics, and his statement that he tried and failed to understand its mathematics (honestly, it's not that hard), seem to indicate. Which explains why his advocacy of science as a worldview often seems to do more damage than good. Hence my initial (and possibly overreacting) remark: philosophers of the world, get off your ass en get a real job dammit! Maybe do some actual science."
9,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5266448-lucas,5,"A very interesting book, though Dennett could certainly have stood to tighten up the prose and organize it better. I think the title also doesn't reflect the contents of the book very well. The book describes Dennett's theories of the philosophy of mind, using what he calls ""intuition pumps"". An intuition pump is basically a thought experiment, designed to poke/pump your intuitions about a topic, like Einstein's clock thought experiments or Searle's Chinese Room argument. I sort of dislike the term (I think thought experiment is a better and more standard term), but it's still a good book.I loved the parts involving the Chinese Room argument, an argument I've found unconvincing, but never quite been able to put my finger on why. Dennett ""turns the knobs"" on this experiment, pointing out a huge number of issues with it, notably that the description of the ""Chinese Room"" is deceptively simple. In order for a machine to succeed in passing the Turing test, it would require an enormous amount of code and an enormous number of instructions. Our intuitions fail on that scale: the argument is less convincing if it takes 20 years of laborious efforts to generate a single response. Simulating a brain or AI is a lot of *work*, and not work that humans are cut out for. His response to Searle's arguments against the ""systems response"" (that the human/room system is conscious, even if no individual part is) is also interesting. Imagine the Chinese room being taught differential equations by the interlocutor, and eventually it becomes proficient at them. Competence (if not consciousness) was created through the process, but it's clearly not in Searle's head. The competence has to be in the system.The sections on free will were more tedious. Dennett presents a very interesting thought experiment about three chess programs, all of which make use of pseudo-random decision making processes. He then proceeds to show how it's ""possible"" for a given program to have ""decided"" whether to castle (i.e. some form of agency), while for another program the move was ""impossible"". It's an interesting and very clever argument. But I don't find free will as conceived in the Judeo-Christian tradition to be a particularly compelling idea in the first place, especially as it relates to moral culpability. Rationality necessarily boxes in non-determinism, and ""free will"" without rationality is facile: if we have ""genuine agency"" that's not based on anything then it loses the ""will"" part, it's merely random. I think the most important lessons of the book are:- Don't let hidden complexity force you to think things are simpler than they are. Most arguments against the possibility of computers being conscious boil down to ""I can't conceive of a computer complex enough that it could be conscious. Look at these simple computers: they're clearly not conscious!"" Changes in the scale and complexity of processes can break our intuitions.- If an argument seems intuitively compelling, try to alter parts of it to see when causes it to become non-compelling or more compelling.- Causal explanations need to occur at the right level to be meaningful. There's a sense in which everything derives from physics, but a molecule-by-molecule or a transistor-by-transistor history of Big Blue's execution during a chess match can't really explain why Big Blue beat Kasparov. You need to go to a different descriptive level for that.From a religious/spiritual viewpoint, this was an important book to me. I have ""Saganism"" listed as my religion on Facebook, and it's only half joking. The discussion of agency and evolution clarifies why we exist: we are a designed solution to a problem (survival and reproduction), and our agency and intentions derive in a sense from the ""designer"" of natural selection. This matches well with my own intuitions about how my mind works. A lot of emotional drives clearly relate to survival and reproduction: sexual desire, the need to connect to other humans, enjoyment of food, etc. Without the supplier of our ""utility functions"", we'd be little more than dumb, inert intelligences with no problems to solve, nowhere to go. But with the ""intentionality"" imbued by evolution, we are goal-directed beings, built from smaller subsystems each of which has its own set of things it ""wants"", down to neurons which ""want"" to survive and connect, down to enzymes that ""want"" to build/repair, down to DNA that ""wants"" to reproduce. Some would look on this view and find it cold and devoid of meaning; I side with Darwin and Dennett ""There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."" I find the idea that I exist as part of this ongoing process inspiring: our ancestors have been the toughest, the smartest, the most able to love and care for their children, and down the line for billions of years. Forged by evolution, human life and human consciousness are an expression of a fundamental process of the universe. We've been elevated from inanimate matter into something capable of writing books about where meaning comes from."
10,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,4,This was a great primer to philosophy to the novice. Dennett uses some clever thinking tools to cut to the heart of some classic problems in philosophy. I especially liked his take-down of the idea that free will depends on non-determinism.
11,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10266236-paul-gibson,5,"This is a very interesting and clever book. Critics will complain the author has an agenda. Others will recognize this agenda as narrative. The author does an excellent job choosing intuition pumps to make his point while providing a narrative to tie it all altogether in a readable package. You don't have to believe it, you can simply regard it as information. But you could also re-frame your current beliefs by devaluing their truth while regarding them simply as information too. Throughout this book, the author leads us to conclusions but sometimes leaves it up to the reader to make the relevant connections for ourselves. His take on freewill is different than I've read before and I enjoyed it.So what is the narrative? When it comes to the complexities of human consciousness, Intelligent Design seems optional. We all are complex ""AI"" machines with billions of years of development and design behind us. All and all it's very interesting information."
12,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63447888-alfingen-dod-r,2,Didn't finish bc tons of unnecessary acerbic ad hominem attacks on Gould started to get very annoying. Superficial otherwise too.
13,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,2,"First off, the title is a misnomer -- a clickbait of sorts. The discussion on intuition pumps lasts 40 pages (more on that later). The rest of it is tearing apart often ridiculous (to me at least) philosophical positions other philosophers had such as insisting on consciousness and free will are a black and white thing (false dichotomy). For instance, here is one on ""understanding"", which is a center piece target of Dennett's criticism and is the so-called Chinese Room thought experiment.Here's the rundown, if you haven't heard of this: Someone (a non-clear-thinker, let's call him NCT) insists a strong AI doesn't have a mind like a human does. The logic is this: NCT himself does not speak Chinese but can be locked inside a room equipped with the English-version of the said AI software (complete with databases and scratch paper) and can in principle answer questions written in Chinese and fed into the room thus faking comprehension. Since NCT doesn't understand Chinese, the AI system doesn't either and thus it doesn't have a mind as we do. The analogy is clearly wrong because while NCT doesn't speak Chinese, the Chinese room practically does (unless you define ""speak"" so narrowly that only human being can ""speak"" a language - by definition.) NCT can make the point that the *hardware alone* (the counterpart of NCT in the room) doesn't speak Chinese or have a mind. Assuming my oversimplified argument here is clear, if you agree with NCT's position, then maybe reading this book can be helpful. If you agree that NCT is not a clear thinker then this book of Dennett's will be like preaching to the choir.Even if such logic problems are worth clarifying, this book is extremely verbose and digressive in my opinion. If I'm allowed a career stereotying joke: A newly appointed university president was amazed at the difference in funding requirement of different departments: the physicists needed billions of dollars for an accelerator; the mathematicians only needed paper, pencils, and a waste basket; heck the philosophy department doesn’t even need a waste basket.So back to the intuition pumps. What are they? They are a particular type of thought experiment: one that reduces the complexity to the bare minimum (which can be a good thing) and then, anybody can intuitively answer the question in an unambiguous manner (e.g., does NCT speak Chinese). Clearly, in the NCT example, the reason you can intuit is because important details get swept away. Other commonly misused intuition pumps include ""surely"" and ""rathering"". ""Surely"" is the act of prefacing a wrong statement with ""surely"" and pass it on as an obvious truism. (e.g., Surely only humans can have a mind). Rathering is to refute A because B is clearly the case (e.g., Donald Trump is not evil, rather he is stupid.)These are simply logic fallacies. The latter is called false dichotomy. There are webpages discussing the common ones. The book discussed a grand total of 12 pumps, 6 positive, 6 negatives. So what about the positive intuition pumps. Well, I hate to disappoint, but there is really just one, which is try to use ""reductio ad absurdum"". Others are some wise remarks that do not IMO count as thought experiment let alone intuition pumps (remember the latter is a special case of the former). Here is one example called Sturgeon's law. Science fiction writer Sturgeon agrees 90% of science fiction is crud. But 90% of anything is crud. So don't waste time hooting at the crap.Surely, I'm not hooting at the crap. Rather, I'm warning you of the relatively low density of intellectual wisdom."
14,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/426865-valerie,3,"Daniel C. Dennett cites himself a lot. Just sayin'.Right, so his thing is that free will and determinism are not incompatible. He's really big into non-incompatibles. the idea that you can predict the choice someone will make does not effect his ability to make that choice. So, its predictable that i would write this... but i still also made a choice to write it. i really hope he explains how this is so because i still don't get it. I had no idea this book would be so much about rhetoric, linquistics, etc. a delightful surprise as I love that stuff (for example, every time I malapropriate I cover with the declaration that ""I love malapropisms!"" because 1) it makes me look clever when I was looking dumb and 2) its true - I love the fact that I can use the wrong word for something and my intentionality/meaning is still conveyed intact - at least much of the time). I can't wait to apply his nasty little tools, like ""rathering"" to my own writing b/c I also agree with him in that there is often nothing more fun than realize how wrong you are - mistakes are such a juicy opportunity for growth.so far this book reminds me of Jonah Leher's ""How we decide."" (I still find myself wanting to champion him despite his unfortunate debacle - his writing was nice and clear and interesting and I still trust it in the main [self plagiarizing is nonsense, and I'm somehow not too bothered by the other stuff...])I still don't really understand where Dennett falls in the dualist/materialist etc camp (I know most assume he's a strict materialist, but the way he complains about being misunderstood..and at times seems to discuss the reality of qualia confuses me).. need to read more of him. I like this quote: ""Let's stipulate at the outset that there is a great deal of deplorable, stupid, second-rate stuff out there, of all sorts. Now, in order not to waste your time and try our patience, make sure you concentrate on the best stuff you can find, the flagship exexamples, extolled by the leaders of the field, the prize-winning entries, not the dregs."" I wonder if he'll discuss how people's tendency to do this is just 'cause they're insecure and it makes them feel good to tear apart weak scholarship or weak anything, really. probably he won't. speaking of , this is an angry statement. dennett is quite an angry man.still judging dennett's ability to write/speak clearly about complex stuff, so far, he's doing pretty well. I was having a conversation with Ariel the other day about how it's so annoying how people will write really convolutedly with lots of big words (or worse a bunch of terminology specific to your field [""word-dropping""]) and stuff to sound intelligent, and it can be, like, a lot of quantity and stuff, but she said something like - the more words you're using and the longer your sentences, likely the less you're actually saying. i think she probably quoted someone who said it better. but anyway, this is true also of novelists, she was probably thinking about healy's ""how i became a famous novelist""... everyone should just read and follow chicago's manual of style. k? thanks.another thing i was thinking about along the line of phonies is, like, i know it's a fine line between original ideas and copying and nothing new under the sun and all, but you know it when you see it? in that, it seems that often a person instead of being inspired by an idol in the same field to create someone of their own or copying their style in a way to express their own stuff - the best they can do is just copy the obvious mannerisms or personaility quirks or things unrelated to the particular craft really, you know a caricature, like someone puffing on a pipe and reading a book by the sea who actually hates to read, or someone who is all angry like dennett and thinks that's his ""persona"" or something and it's his duty to set the score with his ""philosopher"" friends as if he were a big wig within a community or something, because really, he just likes dennett's persona and wants desperately to believe that he is just like that....."

The title is a misnomer; it is not a handy guide to navigating your decisions in life, etc, or even a practical 80 steps to improving your mind. It is a series of short chapters of philosophical tidbits designed to introduce as much of Dennett's own nomenclature as possible to see what sticks (immortality!), and in the meantime showing how terribly misguided his fellow philosophers are, supported by lots of references to his own work. I've never read a book that references its own author so frequently. In general, it made my head hurt, and paralysed me from reading other things until I had stubbornly finished it. For which I hate it. Especially for taking advantage of my good nature and forcing me to slog through how computer programs work. Did I add I hated it? I've read other Dennett books, but I think I will stop now. He's clever, I get it."
16,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18370648-mishehu,5,"What a mind... Dennett is that rarest of beings: a philosopher who presents his ideas undumbed down, and with crystal clarity, for a lay readership. Not only does he respect his untrained readers, he genuinely strives to educate them and to spur their own deeper learning and inquiry. The long and the short is this: every time I finish one of his books, I am (I think) smarter than I was when I began. It's amazing how much food for thought Dennett packs between the covers of each, and how artfully he composes them. In addition to being a first-rate thinker, Dennett is a superb stylist. And so I say, of yet another Dennett title: I loved it! Here's hoping Dennett has many years of writing still to come."
17,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16443561-alex-shenton,2,"Summary: There's a lot of interesting stuff here if you can struggle through it and are prepared to put in some hard thinking time over it (which you should be, if you're reading a book on philosophy). It's like taking a journey which you have heard is arduous but rewarding. However in this case the journey is also uneven and sometimes tedious, and your companion won't stop playing a Spice Girls medley on the kazoo.In a bit more detail:First off, this is a hard book. It wants you to think and it wants you to do the exercises, in fact it needs you to do so to really understand what it's talking about. But what IS it talking about? What ARE intuition pumps? I've finished it but I'm still not sure I could tell you.The book is broken into lots of short chapters, and the first third of the book is a bit of a trudge, containing lots of common/familiar philosophical problems, and seemingly wandering about over them with little direction. There are some gems in there but nothing really new to me. The middle third turns largely to modelling computation and derives pretty much from first principles an almost-Turing-machine, which is is actually quite nicely done and was interesting to me but flatout stopped my wife reading as it descended into some very technical descriptions. A pity because (as someone already familiar with the field) I actually quite enjoyed this bit. The final third starts to talk about some more interesting and complex philosophical problems such as the theory of mind, and determinism and whether it is compatible with free will. This is occasionally heavy stuff but contains enough to keep me going through it, with some genuinely cute ideas and turns of phrase. Then it all ends a bit abruptly.All of the above would be worth three stars if it weren't for the author's style of writing. He writes as someone who is extremely condescending and convinced of their own brilliance, explaining it to the pitiful mortals while trying to pretend that he might be a bit like ""one of us"", despite not actually believing that of himself. It's trying, and annoying. He's clearly very smart and sometimes writes engaging prose, but after a few pages you just feel like you want to slap him. I don't think his communication style is particularly clear either, but that might be fine since the book seems to be aimed at a level a few steps above the usual pop-science type book.I wouldn't recommend it."
18,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5873460-james-p,3,"I won't plagiarize another reviewer by pointing any prospective reader of Dennett's book to Sturgeon's Law, but for those listening: consult Sturgeon's Law. 10% of this book is extremely interesting - which for a 500 page book can seem reasonable and tiring on the same plane. Cf. every book Dennett has ever written on consciousness if you want to avoid the hassle (it's the topic he has theorized on tenaciously during his 30-year career as a mainstream philosopher). You'll notice he conveniently cites himself far too often (even a forthcoming book at one point) or just lops chunks of his older writings into neat little paragraphs for you to digest. Therefore, this book is a summary mostly.His objectives seemed vague to me for a few reasons. First, there were often chapters that felt like narrative interludes where Dennett could discuss pure philosophical praxis. What was the point of these sporadic divisions?Second, the unceasing referrals to parts later in the book that build on earlier topics shows cohesion in the subject matter - an interconnectivity that Dennett himself seems to value. However, this does not lend itself to the most concise structuring of this particular philosophical monograph. Third, spending time debasing other philosophers, science, science AND philosophy, religion, religion and science, computers, argument-logic, and other intuition pumps (that, by the way, are not meant to be intuition pumps since most are OPTION B: ""Name Preservers"" [last chapter]) is tiresome and feels wayward from giving us thinking tools about thinking (meta-).Finally, Dennett gets by on giving us footnotes to arguments and tangible evidence that we need to go and access outside the text. Otherwise, I feel Dennett's own views are obfuscated and each new topic is introduced with critical reviewal and no apparent philosophical ""attempt"" at an aporetic stance by the end.Don't look down on me or other philosophy students, Dan. Don't throw us all under the bus too quickly or else you may find you'll have thrown out the proverbial baby with the bath-water, Dan. Don't talk cute to me, Dan, I deserve some formal prose in my philosophy reading. It hurts my feelings and I wasn't expecting a literal coup on my love of philosophy by reading your book, I just wanted to learn something new."
19,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3723739-josh,5,"Date first finished: 21 September 2013Date second finished: 19 January 2014This is an excellent book that gives a good introduction to some of the ways of doing philosophy. The first section has perhaps some of the most valuable advice for engaging with ideas and their proponents, and is something I will probably return to again and again to sharpen my tools for evaluating claims. The very first thing that Dennett encourages is for thinkers to make mistakes. It is important not to be afraid of making mistakes because it is by making mistakes that one is able learn more effectively. Another really interesting set of thinking tools are Rapoport's Rules and Sturgeon's Law. Rapoport's rules are as follows:1.) Restate the opponents position so fairly and so accurately that the opponent says, ""Thanks. I wish I had thought of putting it like that.""2.) Point out anywhere where you and the opponent are in agreement, especially if it is a point not widely held.3.) Note anything that you have learned from your opponent.4.) Only then can you offer anything by way of criticism. Sturgeon's Law is also a very interesting concept that says that as a general rule, 90% of everything is garbage. Even if it is the case that 90% of everything produced by any field is garbage, that does not mean one can dismiss the 10% that is quality work. Instead, it is important engage with that 10%, and use that as the standard of quality.The last thinking tool I will mention, which will hopefully make readers want to read the rest of the book, is something like a converse to Occam's razor, the law of parsimony that states that one should not multiple assumptions beyond necessity, that is, the simplest explanation is most often the best explanation. Converse to this idea is Occam's broom. Occam's broom is when someone making a claim sweeps inconvenient facts away as an attempt to make his/her case appear more sound than it actually is. As an example, Dennett brings up conspiracy theorists who are masters of wielding Occam's broom in order to make their claims of conspiracy fit the situation by either dismissing or overlooking important facts that would invalidate their cases. These are just some of the very interesting topics that are brought up in this book. I highly recommend it to everyone who has ever expressed a desire to sharpen their thinking. "
20,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7371054-andrew,4,"This introduces itself as a collection of tricks and tips for philosophical reasoning. What is an essay papering over a gap? What makes a good thought experiment? When faced with one of the classic philosopher's parables (the Chinese Room, the Duplicating Teleporter) how do you figure out whether it's leading your intuition in a useful direction or only distracting you from the point?(Some of these tips are nifty examples of ""turning the knobs"" on thought experiments, creating variants with different intuitive consequences. Others are simple rules of thumb: if a philosopher uses ""surely"" or ""arguably"" in a sentence, watch out!)After the introductory bits, Dennett starts applying these arguments to his standard topics: evolution, free will, and consciousness. He's still exercising arguments to see how well they stand up, but he's doing it as part of a pocket tour of these pet topics. Which is fine; there's been a lot of back-and-forth in the field since I read _Godel Escher Bach_ and it's good to keep up to date.Inevitably, there's a lot of ""my thought experiments are interesting and my opponents' are broken"". Dennett tries not to be a jerk about this -- he prefers to poke holes in his critics' certainties without claiming to be certain about his own beliefs -- but these *are* his topics, and he's opinionated. (Interest: I agree with Dennett's opinions about all this stuff.) For what it's worth, he's also assiduous about referencing both sides of each debate.I found the thing extremely readable. The book is organized in lots of tiny chapters, each focussing on one point or example of argument. If Dennett's previous books on consciousness and evolution seemed like unscalable walls of text, I'd recommend trying this one. If you're already a Dennett fan, this book will be a quick read with a few interesting updates on the familiar arguments."
21,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10979968-sarah,3,"Favorite sections include all/most of Section II: A Donzen General Thinking Tools - a clear set of tools to go out into the world with. ""Rather""|""Surely"" (ding!) And the following favorite chapters include: Murder in Trafalgar Square, Manifest Image and Scientific Image, The Intentional Stance, The Sorta Operator, The Library of Mendel: Vast and Vanishing, The Zombic Hunch, Zombies and Zimboes, and Heterophenomenology. Dennett is a writer that leads me to believe that I have some kind of adult/reading version of ADD. My ability to focus on what he's saying drops dramatically compared with other philosophy readings for some reason. This isn't to say that the writing is bad, I just know now to not read Dennett when I have a lot on my mind. The advice to philosophy students in the ending chapters is honest, and I think it is advice carefully given ...""[D]on't count on the validation of your fellow graduate students or your favorite professors to settle the issue [the issue about whether or not you're doing philosophy ""right"" or if it's the ""career for you.""] They all have vested interest in keeping the enterprise going. It's what they know how to do; it's what they are good at. This is a problem in other fields too, and it can be even harder to break out of. (...) My point is that you should not settle complacently into a seat on the bandwagon just because you have found some brilliant fellow travelers who find your work on the issue as unignorable as you find theirs. You may all be taking each other for a ride."" (p.422 - 424.)"
22,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536704-cid-medeiros,5,"Dennett collects in this book an interesting inventory of special thought experiments defined by him as intuition pumps. The definition he proposes goes along with what they really do to you: pump your intuition up. They kind guide your thinking towards the core of the subject matter dealt with.	However, as there are some badly designed thought experiments, this is also true for intuition pumps. Dennets explores the bad ones brilliantly. In some very famous cases, the bad ones hold such strong appeal to our intuition that you really need a professional and careful philosopher, such as Dennett, to show you the way out of it.	How Dennett manages to create good intuition pumps as well as spot the failures on the bad ones? I noticed Dennett's approach is very science-oriented making his work likely to belong to the Scientific Realism school of thinking, which is highly recommended if you are to do some thinking without fooling yourself with most of the world’s shenanigans.	So if you care about topics such as Evolution, Consciousness, Artificial Intelligence and Free Will this book falls into the category. It’s not such a heavy reading, as the author's writing is not loaded with jargon and he gets very entertainment at some points. No need to worry about getting bored to death."

I dunno... a textbook on critical thinking written from the perspective of a philosopher? A list of important human mental techniques that an ideal AI should contain?Something was just too folksy-abstract for me to really get into it. I liked Dennett's books Kinds of Minds: Towards an Understanding of Consciousness and Inside Jokes: Using Humor to Reverse-Engineer the Mind much better.But on my library's 2016 adult reading challenge I'm now down 2, 6 to go!"

He seemed to use the tools for thought, “intuition pumps” he calls them to make points about some of his favorite topics, such as, consciousness, artificial intelligence, evolution, and free will. I have to say that I disagreed with or had questions about some of what he wrote, which is a good thing to have, especially when reading philosophy. Unfortunately, I can't recall any at the time of writing this review. For the most part, the book was thought provoking and was enjoyable to read."

Pagine 458. 14,03 €images-amazon.comHo incontrato Dan più di 30 anni fa, e da allora ci siamo sempre frequentati, anche se a volte ci siamo persi di vista per lunghi periodi. Me l'aveva presentato Doug Hofstadter, ma poi siamo diventati amici indipendentemente da lui …Mi piacerebbe poterlo scrivere non soltanto metaforicamente, ma la realtà letterale è che – dopo avere letto Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid (non riesco a ricordare in quale anno, ma la mia copia è molto consunta ed è datata 1983) di Douglas R. Hofstadter, ed esserne rimasto folgorato (è certamente uno di quei libri che hanno contribuito più profondamente a cambiare il mio modo di pensare) – mi sono imbattuto in The Mind's I: Fantasies and Reflections on Self and Soul, di cui Hofstadter era autore insieme a Daniel C. Dennett, all'epoca a me del tutto sconosciuto. Anzi, se devo essere sincero (sì, lo so che sono liberissimo di non esserlo, è soltanto un modo di dire), dall'alto della mia spocchia eurocentrica ero molto diffidente rispetto alla possibilità che potessero esistere dei filosofi americani. Per Hofstadter era stato amore a prima vista, cresciuto libro dopo libro (Metamagical Themas: Questing For The Essence Of Mind And Pattern del 1985, anche se io ho l'edizione Penguin del 1986; Fluid Concepts And Creative Analogies: Computer Models Of The Fundamental Mechanisms Of Thought del 1995) fino allo struggente Le Ton Beau De Marot: In Praise of the Music of Language del 1997. Paradossalmente, questo amore prima incondizionato ha mostrato qualche incrinatura proprio da quando ho avuto occasione di conoscere Doug Hofstadter personalmente nel 2004: ma forse quella di nutrire dubbi è una caratteristica dell'amore maturo. Resta il fatto che I Am a Strange Loop del 2007 mi è piaciuto meno degli altri libri (ne ho scritto una recensione su questo blog, che trovate qui).Per Dennett le cose sono state molto diverse. A differenza di Hofstadter, Dennett non è un seduttore. Si concede con estrema riluttanza (sì, come il San Bernardo di cui scrive Snoopy).linkiesta.itPer anni, pur trovando interessanti i temi e le argomentazioni di Dennett, ho fatto molta fatica a leggerlo. Scriveva – se posso esprimermi così – da filosofo. Non pretendo mi crediate sulla parola. Facciamo così: riporto qui sotto l'inizio del primo capitolo di Brainstorms. Saggi filosofici sulla mente e la psicologia nella traduzione italiana edita da Adelphi, e voi giudicate da soli:In questo capitolo esaminerò il concetto di un sistema il cui comportamento può, almeno occasionalmente, essere spiegato e previsto attribuendogli credenze e desideri (e speranze, paure, intenzioni, impressioni, ecc.). Chiamerò tali sistemi sistemi intenzionali, e tali spiegazioni e previsioni spiegazioni e previsioni intenzionali, in virtù dell'intenzionalità delle espressioni tipiche usate per designare le credenze e i desideri (e le speranze, le paure, le intenzioni, le impressioni, ecc.).In passato, mi ostinavo a scrivere «intenzionale» con la I maiuscola ogni volta che intendevo usare la nozione di intenzionalità di Brentano, per distinguere questo termine tecnico da quello comune, per esempio, nell'espressione «una spinta intenzionale»; ma ora il termine tecnico è molto più usato, e poiché quasi tutti quelli che lo usano non sembrano preoccuparsi del rischio di confusione, ho deciso, con qualche trepidazione, di abbandonare questa eccentricità tipografica. Ma il lettore non iniziato si ritenga avvertito: «intenzionale» nel senso in cui appare qui non è il termine consueto della lingua ordinaria. Per me, come per molti autori contemporanei, l'intenzionalità è in primo luogo una caratteristica delle entità linguistiche – idiotismi, contesti – e per gli scopi che qui mi prefiggo basterà dire che un'espressione è intenzionale se la sostituzione di termini codesignativi non ne conserva la verità o se gli «oggetti» di queste espressioni non possono essere trattati nel modo usuale con i quantificatori. [pp. 37-38]Si potrebbe usare questo testo in un corso di scrittura per illustrare come non si scrive un testo per non addetti ai lavori: frasi lunghe, vocaboli inconsueti introdotti senza spiegarli (che cosa diavolo sono i termini codesignativi?), gergo specifico della disciplina. E, soprattutto, il malcelato disprezzo per il lettore non iniziato che deve essere avvertito; disprezzo rivelatore della circostanza che il lettore ideale sarebbe invece il lettore iniziato.Poi sono successe due cose che hanno del miracoloso. La prima è che, tutto d'un tratto, Dennett ha imparato a scrivere per un pubblico di non filosofi, per un pubblico cioè di persone di media cultura e con una bella voglia di imparare delle cose nuove: non dev'essere stato facile per lui e immagino abbia richiesto uno sforzo di volontà e l'acquisizione di tecniche e strumenti specifici. La seconda è che ha scritto anche lui un libro fondamentale, un altro di quei libri che hanno cambiato in modo permanente il mio modo di pensare: Consciousness Explained. Prima di leggerlo – durante le vacanze di natale del 1993-1994 a Roccamare, direi, dal momento che ho la seconda ristampa, 1993, dell'edizione Penguin, anche se il libro è del 1991 – ero pigramente convinto che quello della consciousness fosse un problema intrattabile, da lasciare alle elucubrazioni dei metafisici. Ricordo ancora l'emozione, la gioia, la sensazione di avere fatto una scoperta importante che quella lettura mi aveva lasciato. Ancora più delle argomentazioni di Dennett, che nel tempo si sono per lo più arricchite di significato e di elementi a sostegno, ma qualche volta si sono anche dimostrate sbagliate, è stato fare la scoperta, e raggiungere la convinzione, che non vi fosse nessun tema, nessuno, che non potesse e dovesse essere affrontato, e fruttuosamente, con i metodi e gli strumenti della scienza. Questa sensazione mi è rimasta dopo tutti questi anni, inseparabile da quelle vacanze di natale, dalle passeggiate in pineta con i miei figli (8 e 10 anni) e dagli esperimenti sulla tastiera (Bach, certamente; Wachet auf?).[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHhuyh...] * * *Quanto alle intuition pumps, penso di averle incontrate la prima volta – o, almeno, di essere stato per la prima volta consapevole del loro potenziale come strumento del pensiero – in un intervento di Daniel Dennett su Edge, il sito/blog (ante litteram) di John Brockman. Da allora le ho sempre usate nella mia prima lezione all'università, per cercare di stabilire un percorso intuitivo prima di procedere alle tradizionali (e pallose) spiegazioni deduttive, o come diavolo si chiamano. Ecco il testo che usavo:If you look at the history of philosophy, you see that all the great and influential stuff has been technically full of holes but utterly memorable and vivid. They are what I call “intuition pumps” — lovely thought experiments. Like Plato's cave, and Descartes's evil demon, and Hobbes' vision of the state of nature and the social contract, and even Kant'sidea of the categorical imperative. I don't know of any philosopher who thinks any one of those is a logically sound argument for anything. But they're wonderful imagination grabbers, jungle gyms for the imagination. They structure the way you think about a problem. These are the real legacy of the history of philosophy. A lot of philosophers haveforgotten that, but I like to make intuition pumps.[…]I coined the term ""intuition pump,"" and its first use was derogatory. […] I went on to say that intuition pumps are fine if they're used correctly, but they can also be misused. They're not arguments, they're stories. Instead of having a conclusion, they pump an intuition. They get you to say “Aha! Oh, I get it!”The idea of consciousness as a virtual machine is a nice intuition pump. It takes a while to set up, because a lot of the jargon of artificial intelligence and computer science is unfamiliar to philosophers or other people. But if you have the patience to set some of these ideas up, then you can say, “Hey! Try thinking about the idea that what we have inour heads is software. It's a virtual machine, in the same way that a word processor is a virtual machine.” Suddenly, bells start ringing, and people start seeing things from a slightly different perspective.[Dennett, Daniel C. “Intuition Pumps”. In: Brockman, John (ed.). The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution. New York: Simon & Schuster. 1995]* * *Quando la scorsa primavera ho saputo dell'uscita del nuovo libro di Dennett e ne ho letto il titolo mi sono detto: «Bene, questa volta Dennett ci propone la cassetta degli attrezzi del pensatore, o del filosofo che dir si voglia». Non mi sbagliavo. In effetti, proprio nel primo capitolo, Dennett spiega i suoi intenti in modo particolarmente chiaro (già che ci siete, per favore, notate quanta distanza ci sia tra il chiaro e godibile Dennett di adesso e quello che cercava un lettore iniziato!). Lasciamo a lui la parola (abbiate pazienza, ma questa lunga citazione e sintesi del capitolo introduttivo è necessaria; soprattutto per voi che non avete ancora letto il libro, se posso essere un po' paternalistico):Thinking is hard. Thinking about some problems is so hard it can make your head ache just thinking about thinking about them. My colleague the neuropsychologist Marcel Kinsbourne suggests that whenever we find thinking hard, it is because the stony path to truth is competing with seductive, easier paths that turn out to be dead ends. Most of the effort in thinking is a matter of resisting these temptations. [pos. Kindle 161][…]Some people, like von Neumann, are such natural geniuses that they can breeze through the toughest tangles; others are more plodding but are blessed with a heroic supply of “willpower” that helps them stay the course in their dogged pursuit of truth. Then there are the rest of us, not calculating prodigies and a little bit lazy, but still aspiring to understand whatever confronts us. What can we do? We can use thinking tools, by the dozens. These handy prosthetic imagination-extenders and focus-holders permit us to think reliably and even gracefully about really hard questions. This book is a collection of my favorite thinking tools. I will not just describe them; I intend to use them to move your mind gently through uncomfortable territory all the way to a quite radical vision of meaning, mind, and free will. We will begin with some tools that are simple and general, having applications to all sorts of topics. Some of these are familiar, but others have not been much noticed or discussed. Then I will introduce you to some tools that are for very special purposes indeed, designed to explode one specific seductive idea or another, clearing a way out of a deep rut that still traps and flummoxes experts. We will also encounter and dismantle a variety of bad thinking tools, misbegotten persuasion-devices that can lead you astray if you aren’t careful. Whether or not you arrive comfortably at my proposed destination – and decide to stay there with me – the journey will equip you with new ways of thinking about the topics, and thinking about thinking. [174-184][…]Like all artisans, a blacksmith needs tools, but – according to an old (indeed almost extinct) observation – blacksmiths are unique in that they make their own tools. Carpenters don’t make their saws and hammers, tailors don’t make their scissors and needles, and plumbers don’t make their wrenches, but blacksmiths can make their hammers, tongs, anvils, and chisels out of their raw material, iron. What about thinking tools? Who makes them? And what are they made of? Philosophers have made some of the best of them – out of nothing but ideas, useful structures of information. René Descartes gave us Cartesian coordinates, the x- and y-axes without which calculus – a thinking tool par excellence simultaneously invented by Isaac Newton and the philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz – would be almost unthinkable. Blaise Pascal gave us probability theory so we can easily calculate the odds of various wagers. The Reverend Thomas Bayes was also a talented mathematician, and he gave us Bayes’s theorem¸ the backbone of Bayesian statistical thinking. But most of the tools that feature in this book are simpler ones, not the precise, systematic machines of mathematics and science but the hand tools of the mind. Among them areLabels. Sometimes just creating a vivid name for something helps you keep track of it while you turn it around in your mind trying to understand it. Among the most useful labels, as we shall see, are warning labels or alarms, which alert us to likely sources of error.Examples. Some philosophers think that using examples in their work is, if not quite cheating, at least uncalled for –rather the way novelists shun illustrations in their novels. The novelists take pride in doing it all with words, and the philosophers take pride in doing it all with carefully crafted abstract generalizations presented in rigorous order, as close to mathematical proofs as they can muster. Good for them, but they can’t expect me to recommend their work to any but a few remarkable students. It’s just more difficult than it has to be.Analogies and metaphors. Mapping the features of one complex thing onto the features of another complex thing that you already (think you) understand is a famously powerful thinking tool, but it is so powerful that it often leads thinkers astray when their imaginations get captured by a treacherous analogy.Staging. You can shingle a roof, paint a house, or fix a chimney with the help of just a ladder, moving it and climbing, moving it and climbing, getting access to only a small part of the job at a time, but it’s often a lot easier in the end to take the time at the beginning to erect some sturdy staging that will allow you to move swiftly and safely around the whole project. Several of the most valuable thinking tools in this book are examples of staging that take some time to put in place but then permit a variety of problems to be tackled together – without all the ladder-moving.And, finally, the sort of thought experiments I have dubbed intuition pumps. [193-216][…]Other thought experiments are less rigorous but often just as effective: little stories designed to provoke a heartfelt, table-thumping intuition – “Yes, of course, it has to be so!” – about whatever thesis is being defended. I have called these intuition pumps. I coined the term in the first of my public critiques of philosopher John Searle’s famous Chinese Room thought experiment (Searle, 1980; Dennett, 1980), and some thinkers concluded I meant the term to be disparaging or dismissive. On the contrary, I love intuition pumps! That is, some intuition pumps are excellent, some are dubious, and only a few are downright deceptive. Intuition pumps have been a dominant force in philosophy for centuries. They are the philosophers’ version of Aesop’s fables, which have been recognized as wonderful thinking tools since before there were philosophers. If you ever studied philosophy in college, you were probably exposed to such classics as Plato’s cave, in The Republic, in which people are chained and can see only the shadows of real things cast on the cave wall; or his example, in Meno, of teaching geometry to the slave boy. Then there is Descartes’s evil demon, deceiving Descartes into believing in a world that was entirely illusory – the original Virtual Reality thought experiment – and Hobbes’s state of nature, in which life is nasty, brutish, and short. [227-235][…]This self-conscious wariness with which we should approach any intuition pump is itself an important tool for thinking, the philosophers’ favorite tactic: “going meta” – thinking about thinking, talking about talking, reasoning about reasoning. Meta-language is the language we use to talk about another language, and meta-ethics is a bird’s-eye view examination of ethical theories. [276][…]Some of the most powerful thinking tools are mathematical, but aside from mentioning them, I will not devote much space to them because this is a book celebrating the power of non-mathematical tools, informal tools, the tools of prose and poetry, if you like, a power that scientists often underestimate. [304][…]I have always figured that if I can’t explain something I’m doing to a group of bright undergraduates, I don’t really understand it myself, and that challenge has shaped everything I have written. [322: non proprio sempre e non proprio tutto quello che ha scritto, come abbiamo toccato con mano; ma perdoniamogliela, questa piccola innocente bugia][…]In the first section that follows, I present a dozen general, all-purpose tools, and then in subsequent sections I group the rest of the entries not by the type of tool but by the topic where the tool works best, turning first to the most fundamental philosophical topic – meaning, or content – followed by evolution, consciousness, and free will. A few of the tools I present are actual software, friendly devices that can do for your naked imagination what telescopes and microscopes can do for your naked eye.Along the way, I will also introduce some false friends, tools that blow smoke instead of shining light. [354]Ecco, il problema secondo me è tutto qui. Ho trovato la sezione dedicata agli all-purpose tools particolarmente azzeccata, e fedele al titolo del libro e al suo programma (è in effetti la seconda, A dozen general thinking tools, perché la prima Introduction: what is an intuition pump? è quella che ho appena riassunto). Poi è un progressivo calando, via via che l'attenzione si sposta dal tipo di strumento all'argomento al quale (secondo Dennett) quello strumento meglio si attaglia. Se sentite un po' di puzza di bruciato, è perché il trucco c'è: poiché si tratta di argomenti di cui Dennett ha già scritto a lungo in passato, si resta con il dubbio che ci sia un po' di riciclaggio e che alla fin fine a Dennett interessi soprattutto tornare sulle sue concezioni dell'evoluzione, della consciousness e del libero arbitrio.Giusto per la cronaca: personalmente ho trovato nel libro un gradiente negativo. Le sezioni sono (dopo la prima e la seconda, di cui abbiamo già citato il titolo):Tools for thinking about meaning or contentAn interlude about computersMore tools about meaningTools for thinking about evolutionTools for thinking about consciousnessTools for thinking about free willWhat is it like to be a philosopher? (questa sezione è proprio appiccicata lì e non c'entra nulla con tutto quello che viene detto prima; forse Dennett è pagato a righe come Dumas?)Use the tools. Try HarderWhat got left out."

28,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4369435-jay-kamaladasa,4,"Finally, a book worth reading and reviewing. The one thing that I dislike about the book is perhaps the long winded (but playful) narration that seems to be an overkill. Simple concepts that can be explained in a sentence or a paragraph goes on to be chapters. But since Dennett is a philosopher it's all forgiven. If you don't like this playful elongated writing style, and prefer concise and direct communication, it may ruin a perfectly good book. There are several things I found fascinating about the thinking tools. I won't list all of them, but there seems to be a few major points he tries to paint with stacking several intuition pumps together. And those messages are worth mentioning. 1.) There is no wonder tissue that makes us humans unique. We're simply chemical machines. The deliberate wanting to place a hidden mystery to the workings of the brain is merely an attempt at convincing ourselves that we are special. 2.) The meaning of life and the intentions that we have can probably never be deciphered. We Sorta know our inner programming, but really we don't. The only programming that makes sense is the narrative of the Selfish Gene. The one that wants to propagate itself towards the future by beating all the odd balls that the environment can throw at it. 2b.) Genetic Engineering is perhaps one of the most important things that humans have created. It's a revolution in evolution. 3.) Consciousness and Self are illusions, but effective and useful illusions. Kind of like the concept of a center of gravity or axis of rotation. There is no such physical thing as a center of gravity but having a concept of such a point makes the physical world easier to explain. 4.) There can be free will in an in-deterministic world. From all the things that Dennett describes in the book, this was news to me. And I loved the way he walked the reader through his thinking process. But I think beauty of this book is not necessarily in the conclusions but in the philosophical discussions that lead to the said conclusions. The thinking tools that are required to comprehend these truths are not necessarily straightforward. It requires sitting down, wrapping your head around intuitive concepts and then extending what you've learnt to other problems. That's where the book shines, and that's possibly why you should read it. "
29,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14628030-kelvin,3,"(NOTE: I received my copy of the book from the GoodReads giveaways.)Let me begin by saying that this is the first book that I have read by Mr Dennett. I hear him referenced from time to time in books, articles, or lectures (mostly in the area of the philosophy of religion). I wanted to read some of his work, and GoodReads was kind enough to help me with that.However, I am not sure that this would be the best book for someone to ""try out"" Mr Dennett's writing. The book is great, to be sure (the parts I understood anyhow). The thing is, from my point of view, this book seemed to fit somewhere in Mr Dennett's literary world. The work seemed to carry on a conversation that he may have started somewhere else, in another work. Not being familiar with his work, I may have misread it or I may have come in halfway. The book is nice though.Mr Dennett begins the book talking about how we think about things, some presuppositions and some basic cognitive tools. He then begins to get into some interesting thought experiments. There is a brief interlude on computers that lost me entirely, as I am computer illiterate. Then he gets into some more thought experiments and thinking tools/prods.Another thing that should be noted is that this is a work of academic philosophy. There are some technical terms and a certain kind of academic garb that Mr Dennett dresses his ideas in. I am not an academic philosopher, so some of it was lost on me I am sure. Reading this book is not like picking up Plato or some other literary kind of philosopher. There is some heavy lifting involved in reading the book. I had to re-read a thing or two. There are lots of interesting citations and interactions with other philosophers, living and dead, that give the book a very practical/useful feel to it. Mr Dennett give good examples and illustrations of how things can be put into practice. It was a challenging read for me. So, if you like academic philosophy or books about the theory of the mind then the book is worth your time. It was an interesting overview of the way Mr Dennett approaches the thinking process and (may?) serve one as a guide to how he conducts his scholarly writing."
30,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/521847-p,1,"I had to quit after 68 pages. Dennett apparently had a class of freshmen review this book - I wish he would have had a couple actual philosophers review it as well. If you have an understanding of philosophy and basic thinking tools, this book is not for you. If you already are an independent thinker, this book is not for you. If you are easily impressed by name-dropping and misleading examples, this book is for you.The book starts out poorly with way too much name-dropping and Dennett admitting that he heckles lecturers for fun. He has very basic ideas of ""thinking tools"" and then uses very complex examples with very limited context. In these examples he takes cheap shots at fellow philosophers, while not providing enough context to really be able to agree that Dennett is in the right. In chapter 1 he makes an innocuous yet unsound argument, and it is worth mentioning because it shows that he is very careless with his arguments throughout the book (or at least to page 68.) He states: ""Evolution works the same way: all the dumb mistakes tend to be invisible, so all we see is a stupendous string of triumphs. For instance, the vast majority - way over 90 percent - of all the creatures that have ever lived died childless, but not a single one of your ancestors suffered that fate.""So...the majority of creatures don't pass on their genes. Dennett calls that an illustrative example of how ALL dumb mistakes are invisible (er...""tend to be invisible"", whatever that means.) Who says that the 10 percent procreators aren't passing on dumb mistakes? Who says that sexual selection isn't selecting for ""dumb mistakes"" (ie. genes that make an animal more noticeable to predators, or genes that inhibit an animal to move swiftly.) His example is crude, and if the response is that ""dumb mistakes"" are ones that don't permit a creature to pass on its genes, then that just begs the question and proves nothing. The above example was just a red flag. Things start to get really bad in Sections 13-15. 13. Dennett provides us an example where four characters all come, via different paths, to ""believe that a Frenchman has committed murder in Trafalgar Square. He then adds that that proposition (""Frenchman committed murder in TS"") does not occur to them. Thus they all have the belief without formulating the proposition. Dennett makes an implicit assumption here that you actually can have a belief without formulating a proposition. An implicit assumption that becomes a painful assumption when he drives his point home that people generally believe: ""chairs are larger than shoes, that soup is liquid, that elephants don't fly."" If I ask you if you believe that 44 plus 88 is 132, would you say yes? Had you ever formulated that proposition before? Isn't it quite likely that you believed the proposition only after the deduction? Thus, when someone witnesses Jacque shooting Bill, and Bill dying, the belief that a ""murder"" took place may not happen until post-deduction, that is, until the proposition is actually formed. Or when you're asked, ""do elephants fly?"" you first think of an elephant and then deduct that it can't fly? Dennett has not shown that I actually believe elephants don't fly without ever articulating the proposition one way or another.14. ""What this intuition pump shows is that nobody can have just one belief."" Excuse me? Dennett, read a couple neuroscience books and then just take this section out. Even the pop psychology book Incognito should suffice. Even if Dennett's premises are sound (which at least one isn't), his conclusion isn't. His argument here is so poorly constructed I'm not even sure how to attack it. I think his argument goes like this: 1) Apparently inserting a false ""belief"" into Tom causes him to say something that he doesn't truly understand. 2) That shows that if we don't truly understand something, it isn't a true belief. 3) That shows that the only way to truly understand something is if it is coherent with other (sound) beliefs that one holds. 4) That shows that beliefs are thus supported by other beliefs. C) Therefore, ""nobody can have just one belief."" I'm lost on how he got ""beliefs MUST be supported by other beliefs"" from the proposition ""beliefs are supported by other beliefs."" Also, I would re-write proposition 3 as ""That shows that the only way to truly understand something is if it is NOT INCOHERENT with other (sound) beliefs."" Stated this way, Dennett proves absolutely nothing and wasted 3 pages. I can have a single belief, and no other beliefs, and that single belief is not incoherent with any other belief. It pains me that Dennett is making money off of this book.15. ""Daddy is a doctor."" This 1-page section did it in for me, I cannot continue this book. A little girl states the proposition ""daddy is a doctor."" 20 years later she makes the same proposition, only now she has a more sophisticated understanding of the words ""daddy"" and ""doctor."" Dennett writes, ""If understanding comes in degrees, as this example shows, then belief, which depends on understanding, must come in degrees as well, even for such mundane propositions as this.""No! I am not convinced! A five-year old girl who utters the proposition ""Daddy is a doctor"" can have a full 100% belief in that proposition. 20 years later she can make the proposition, with a more sophisticated understanding, and still have a full 100% belief. Dennett, how does the 5-year old ""fall short"" of a full belief? Does she know that ""daddy"" refers to the person who tucks her in at night? Does she know that this person helps sick people in exchange for money? Then WHERE IS SHE FALLING SHORT?!!?!??! Maybe with other arguments not in his book, I could be convinced that I'm wrong and Dennett is right - but his one page argument is far from convincing and far from sound. EDIT: I was so mad at Dennett that I didn't properly attack his argument. I will use an analogy: You have a lightbulb. At first, you can just turn a switch to turn the light on. But you get bored, and decide to make it more fun. You add a second mechanism - the switch needs to be flipped, and then you have to clap before the light goes on. You get bored again, and tweak it one more time: You have to turn the switch, then clap a specific pattern in order to turn the light on. No matter how sophisticated or complicated your INPUT might be, has absolutely no bearing on how sophisticated the OUTPUT might be. Any computer scientist or civil engineer could have told Dennett this. Conclusion: I can't take any more poor logic from someone who is so pompous, name-drops relentlessly, and criticizes other philosophers without providing sufficient context for the reader to actually evaluate the criticism."
31,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,3,"""Intuition pumps and other tools for thinking"" is a mixed bag of goods. Don’t let the title fool you: this books is less about ""thinking tools"" than it is about Daniel Dennet's favorite philosophical thought experiments. Dennet devotes a short and wanting section to general 'thinking tools' (think Okham’s razor), but otherwise spends the majority of your time laying out his personal ideas concerning evolution, meaning, mind, and free will.First, the pros: the subject matter is fascinating, and Dennet's treatment is unusually accessible. Most chapters consist of self-contained thought experiments, and the flanking discussions are written in simple, direct prose. And there are a couple of gems here. In ""Trapped in the Robot Control Room,"" Dennet convinces you that the mind doesn't enter this world as a 'blank slate.' In ""Mary the Color Scientist,"" he forcefully refutes a famous argument in support of qualia. In fact, the entire section about free will (and how it's not incompatible with determinism – a philosophical position called compatibilism) is really quite good.Unfortunately, as a whole, the book falls short. The writing never feels very tight –it's as if the book were written in one sitting, without the oversight of an editor. 'Braindump' isn't the right word, but it's the first word that comes to mind. And when your subject matter concerns such fuzzy and controversial topics such as meaning and consciousness and, this laziness is unforgivable. Additionally, Dennet often takes on a weird, personal, I-hate-this-philosopher-I'm-refuting tone that comes across as strikingly unprofessional, and generally made me feel pretty uncomfortable (""There is a good project for a student of rhetoric: combing through Gould’s huge body of publications and cataloging the different species of boom crutches [Dennet’s word for 'deplorable aids to obfuscation'] he exploited""). This disparaging tone is rather ironic, as it is completely at odds with Dennet’s own advocacy of 'Rapoport’s Rules' in chapter 3 – essentially, the idea that you should be as generous and charitable of your opponent's views as humanely possible.On the whole, I'm glad I read ""Intuition pumps."" At his best, Dennet is thoughtful and provocative. He doesn't hide behind complex philosophical jargon, and his passionate tone mostly refreshing. It's just a shame that he's kind of an ass, and that he seemingly pumped this book out without much post-processing. Give him an editor that will call him out for his shit, and we'll talk again. Until then – there's plenty of other fish in the sea.Fun quotes""[the layperson thinks:] 'I can’t change the past, but if indeterminism is true, I can change the future.' Nope. Change the future from what to what? From what it was going to be to what it is going to be? You can no more change the future than you can change the past. The concept is incoherent."" (391)""Can you conceive of string theory? … it is unintelligible  to be, but for that very reason, I wouldn't be willing to declare it inconceivable or impossible."" (289)""When other people start getting inquisitive, they find that 'God works in mysterious ways' is a convenient anti-thinking tool… I think we should stop treating this ‘pious’ observation as any kind of wisdom and recognize it as the transparently defensive propaganda it is."" (430)"
32,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13222064-eric-wurm,4,"If you've read other Dennett masterpieces, you come away thinking both that the man is a genius and that he's a genius that tends to ramble on. That is not the case in his latest work. He combines many of his previous ideas and some new thoughts into this volume of brief insightful chapters. Dennett covers a wide range of philosophy favorites including consciousness, free will, determinism, artificial life, evolution, and meaning. He gives the reader tools to use when thinking about complex problems. Some of these ideas include:- When does a robot become complex enough to become ""life""? If you gave a robot the tools that evolution uses, is it capable of evolution or merely following a program? Are you merely following a program? How would one know the difference?- If a tool takes on a new use, does it take on a new purpose? Is the old purpose gone? Was there ever a meaningful intrinsic purpose? - How many different creatures could be produced with a library of DNA genomes? These are a few of the questions that you'll contemplate as you navigate this mind-penetrating volume. It's written in the familiar Dennett style with plenty of quirky fabricated terms and odd scenarios that only a philosopher could conjure. It also delves deep into the science of evolution which Dennett never fails to mention. The author views this process of our origin as pertaining to every phenomenon that must be contemplated by our species, and so it does. For those with a shorter attention span, the chapters have been prepared succinctly but with all of the thoughtfulness of the author's longer tomes. If you feel that the unexamined life is not worth living, then this book will give you some new tools for that examination as well an entertaining look into the mind of one of the remaining philosophers that is always worth a read. Dennett doesn't disappoint.Disclaimer: This book was provided by the fine publisher W.W. Norton free of charge for the purpose of review through goodreads' ""First Reads"" program. Further disclaimer: Any publisher that sends me a quality book free of charge will be referred to as a ""fine publisher""."
33,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,4,"An intuition pump is a thought experiment or similar cognitive ""device"" designed to elicit answers to difficult philosophical problems. In --Intuition Pumps And Other Tools For Thinking-- Dennett uses his favorite intuition pumps to (sort of) dismantle difficult philosophical questions such as: evolution, meaning, mind, and free will.I avoided Dennett for a long time because he comes off as such a grumpy old dick in his lectures and Ted talks. I am pleasantly surprised to find that his writing is a lot of fun and quite accessible. Reading this book is like being invited into a cool (not creepy) old dudes garage. He's got all kinds of cleaver little home made gadgets laying around, and its fun as hell to sit there and watch him tinker. I'd give this book 5 (rather than 4) stars if the book didn't lose momentum in the third quarter. But it does. So out comes the 4 paddle. It's still a brilliant book by a brilliant guy. Well worth the investment."
34,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4,"I have enjoyed reading Dennett long before he became one of the four horsemen. I discovered him in the nineties and enjoyed his take on evolution and the mind-body problem as well as the problem of consciousness. He is a good writer and clear. He is also probably the least abrasive of the new atheists. He writes in an enjoyable way about deep topics in the philosophy of mind, evolution, and religion. I don't agree with him on consciousness. I think the hard problem can't be dissolved away as Dennett suggests but I also like engaging with his arguments. This book is a summation of his earlier works in a single volume digestible form. If you are not familiar with Dennett this would be a good book to start.Update 12/29/2019 Dennet is wordy no doubt but he wants to get his perspective understood and sometimes this can be overkill. Still, he does a good job of getting his views on life and consciousness across if the reader has patience. I think there is a lot to be gained by reading him if only not to get caught in a lot of intellectual traps that I for one often fall into."
35,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15294858-leo,2,"Reading this book is basically like reading Daniel Dennett in blog format.I read a lot of Dennett's work as an undergraduate and it had a fairly profound impact on me -- I think the collection ""The Mind's I"" that he edited with Douglas Hofstadter is essentially my atheist bible. I hadn't realized just how much of his work I had read -- almost nothing in this recent collection was new to me. I guess I hadn't realized (or had forgotten) that Dennett is a big fan of Sturgeon's Law (90% of everything is crap; it's like he's a Redditor) and I was unfamiliar with his advice to would-be philosophers (in short, don't get sucked into pointless debates that don't matter just to score points; ditto on him being a Redditor).Early in the book there is a section where he characterizes a number of mental tools and pitfalls. There are some oddly personal attacks on people like Stephen J Gould and Ned Block in this section. The whole enterprise of cataloging rhetorical moves and the like with cute names is pretty annoying, and the personal attacks actually undermine the project: ""I am a master of the mind who knows all the moves and all the missteps, and I'm going to name the missteps after particular people who used them in particular debates with me."" As a result of this Dennett comes across less as a brilliant guy who has thought deeply and successfully about some of the more challenging philosophical problems out there, and more as an asshole who takes things awfully personally for a guy who is always right."
36,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,3,"As clearly advertised on the front cover, this is a book about ""tools for thinking""—and, yes, the first 12 chapters, out of 77, are devoted precisely to that. In contrast, the remaining 65 chapters are summaries, in easy to consume bites, of most of the other books that Dennett has published during the last 20 or 30 years, on the topics of meaning and content, evolution, consciousness, and free will—each updated with relevant new results and references. As such, he presents, and effectively argues for, his own previously published ideas (with the updates). I don't think Dennett's motives here are selfish or disingenuous, rather, we have a major contemporary philosopher summing up his life's work, and pointing the way forward. For deepest understanding, it's better to read the compete original works (Consciousness Explained, Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life, etc). Hence the middling, but not bad, rating: this is mostly not new material but would serve well for those interested in an overview of Dennett's work."
37,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,2,"I liked this well enough. Dennett can write clearly and engagingly. But I never got over the nasty taste in my mouth induced by some really mean-spirited drive-by ad hominem assassination of someone I guess Dennett still holds a shiv for -- Stephen Jay Gould. The odd thing is that, on the issues in question, intellectually I would side with Dennett rather than Gould. But continuing to attack an opponent after the person in question is dead and in no position to mount a defence strikes me as being both unnecessarily shrill and betraying an unattractive insecurity of his own at some level. Anyway, if you can overlook the nastiness of the chapter attacking Gould (in which the arguments may have merit, but the tone is unforgivable and inappropriate), this is a pretty decent book.The last quarter of the book is the weakest, where his arguments linking consciousness and evolution simply fail to gel, in my opinion. But the rest of it is a pretty good read."
38,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11990014-alex-borghgraef,1," It's ironic that Dennett concludes his book with a chapter on why philosophy is still valuable, because halfway through it I was starting to toy with the idea that the world would be better off if philosophy departments all over it were shut down and its inhabitants told to find a real job :-) But first, a disclaimer: I am firmly in the positivist camp, Dan is basically preaching to the choir here. Only he's doing it badly. But wait! What's this about preaching? Isn't this book about thinking tools? Weeell...sorta, but no. The beginning is though, but even that he does badly. The intuition pump (thought experiment for us mere mortals) with tunable knobs was neat, though that's Hofstadters apparently. Occam's razor was a bit of a letdown, he treats it as a common sense rule of thumb and seems oblivious of the fact that it can be derived from Bayesian theory. There's his utterly childish refutation against Roger Penrose's theory (which is IMO both wrong and extremely interesting, and which I suspect Dennett doesn't really understand in the first place, given his stated aversion for quantum mechanics). Then there's the distasteful naming of a number of rhetoric tricks as 'Goulding', after the late SJ Gould. What the feud between Gould and the Dawkins clan was about is still beyond me, as it always seemed to be about technicalities, and I often wonder what real working evolutionary biologists think of the bitchfight between these two pop-sci prima donnas and their supporters. After that it quickly devolves into an overly long regurgitation of Dennett's well-known positions on evolution, consciousness and free will. Nothing against that, but it shouldn't be in this book. This is not a collection of thinking tools, this is a defense of his ideas. And again, if you ask me, not a very good one. The endless exposé on what is a computer? Conway's game of life, again? There's much more interesting things to say about these topics, and they can be said in a much shorter span as well.  I remember being impressed with Dennett a long time ago, maybe I've come too far since then, or maybe he's been stuck in the same arguments. It's much clearer to me now that his understanding of science itself is not as impressive as it seems, as for example his position on quantum mechanics, and his statement that he tried and failed to understand its mathematics (honestly, it's not that hard), seem to indicate. Which explains why his advocacy of science as a worldview often seems to do more damage than good. Hence my initial (and possibly overreacting) remark: philosophers of the world, get off your ass en get a real job dammit! Maybe do some actual science."
39,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5266448-lucas,5,"A very interesting book, though Dennett could certainly have stood to tighten up the prose and organize it better. I think the title also doesn't reflect the contents of the book very well. The book describes Dennett's theories of the philosophy of mind, using what he calls ""intuition pumps"". An intuition pump is basically a thought experiment, designed to poke/pump your intuitions about a topic, like Einstein's clock thought experiments or Searle's Chinese Room argument. I sort of dislike the term (I think thought experiment is a better and more standard term), but it's still a good book.I loved the parts involving the Chinese Room argument, an argument I've found unconvincing, but never quite been able to put my finger on why. Dennett ""turns the knobs"" on this experiment, pointing out a huge number of issues with it, notably that the description of the ""Chinese Room"" is deceptively simple. In order for a machine to succeed in passing the Turing test, it would require an enormous amount of code and an enormous number of instructions. Our intuitions fail on that scale: the argument is less convincing if it takes 20 years of laborious efforts to generate a single response. Simulating a brain or AI is a lot of *work*, and not work that humans are cut out for. His response to Searle's arguments against the ""systems response"" (that the human/room system is conscious, even if no individual part is) is also interesting. Imagine the Chinese room being taught differential equations by the interlocutor, and eventually it becomes proficient at them. Competence (if not consciousness) was created through the process, but it's clearly not in Searle's head. The competence has to be in the system.The sections on free will were more tedious. Dennett presents a very interesting thought experiment about three chess programs, all of which make use of pseudo-random decision making processes. He then proceeds to show how it's ""possible"" for a given program to have ""decided"" whether to castle (i.e. some form of agency), while for another program the move was ""impossible"". It's an interesting and very clever argument. But I don't find free will as conceived in the Judeo-Christian tradition to be a particularly compelling idea in the first place, especially as it relates to moral culpability. Rationality necessarily boxes in non-determinism, and ""free will"" without rationality is facile: if we have ""genuine agency"" that's not based on anything then it loses the ""will"" part, it's merely random. I think the most important lessons of the book are:- Don't let hidden complexity force you to think things are simpler than they are. Most arguments against the possibility of computers being conscious boil down to ""I can't conceive of a computer complex enough that it could be conscious. Look at these simple computers: they're clearly not conscious!"" Changes in the scale and complexity of processes can break our intuitions.- If an argument seems intuitively compelling, try to alter parts of it to see when causes it to become non-compelling or more compelling.- Causal explanations need to occur at the right level to be meaningful. There's a sense in which everything derives from physics, but a molecule-by-molecule or a transistor-by-transistor history of Big Blue's execution during a chess match can't really explain why Big Blue beat Kasparov. You need to go to a different descriptive level for that.From a religious/spiritual viewpoint, this was an important book to me. I have ""Saganism"" listed as my religion on Facebook, and it's only half joking. The discussion of agency and evolution clarifies why we exist: we are a designed solution to a problem (survival and reproduction), and our agency and intentions derive in a sense from the ""designer"" of natural selection. This matches well with my own intuitions about how my mind works. A lot of emotional drives clearly relate to survival and reproduction: sexual desire, the need to connect to other humans, enjoyment of food, etc. Without the supplier of our ""utility functions"", we'd be little more than dumb, inert intelligences with no problems to solve, nowhere to go. But with the ""intentionality"" imbued by evolution, we are goal-directed beings, built from smaller subsystems each of which has its own set of things it ""wants"", down to neurons which ""want"" to survive and connect, down to enzymes that ""want"" to build/repair, down to DNA that ""wants"" to reproduce. Some would look on this view and find it cold and devoid of meaning; I side with Darwin and Dennett ""There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."" I find the idea that I exist as part of this ongoing process inspiring: our ancestors have been the toughest, the smartest, the most able to love and care for their children, and down the line for billions of years. Forged by evolution, human life and human consciousness are an expression of a fundamental process of the universe. We've been elevated from inanimate matter into something capable of writing books about where meaning comes from."
40,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,4,This was a great primer to philosophy to the novice. Dennett uses some clever thinking tools to cut to the heart of some classic problems in philosophy. I especially liked his take-down of the idea that free will depends on non-determinism.
41,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10266236-paul-gibson,5,"This is a very interesting and clever book. Critics will complain the author has an agenda. Others will recognize this agenda as narrative. The author does an excellent job choosing intuition pumps to make his point while providing a narrative to tie it all altogether in a readable package. You don't have to believe it, you can simply regard it as information. But you could also re-frame your current beliefs by devaluing their truth while regarding them simply as information too. Throughout this book, the author leads us to conclusions but sometimes leaves it up to the reader to make the relevant connections for ourselves. His take on freewill is different than I've read before and I enjoyed it.So what is the narrative? When it comes to the complexities of human consciousness, Intelligent Design seems optional. We all are complex ""AI"" machines with billions of years of development and design behind us. All and all it's very interesting information."

43,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,2,"First off, the title is a misnomer -- a clickbait of sorts. The discussion on intuition pumps lasts 40 pages (more on that later). The rest of it is tearing apart often ridiculous (to me at least) philosophical positions other philosophers had such as insisting on consciousness and free will are a black and white thing (false dichotomy). For instance, here is one on ""understanding"", which is a center piece target of Dennett's criticism and is the so-called Chinese Room thought experiment.Here's the rundown, if you haven't heard of this: Someone (a non-clear-thinker, let's call him NCT) insists a strong AI doesn't have a mind like a human does. The logic is this: NCT himself does not speak Chinese but can be locked inside a room equipped with the English-version of the said AI software (complete with databases and scratch paper) and can in principle answer questions written in Chinese and fed into the room thus faking comprehension. Since NCT doesn't understand Chinese, the AI system doesn't either and thus it doesn't have a mind as we do. The analogy is clearly wrong because while NCT doesn't speak Chinese, the Chinese room practically does (unless you define ""speak"" so narrowly that only human being can ""speak"" a language - by definition.) NCT can make the point that the *hardware alone* (the counterpart of NCT in the room) doesn't speak Chinese or have a mind. Assuming my oversimplified argument here is clear, if you agree with NCT's position, then maybe reading this book can be helpful. If you agree that NCT is not a clear thinker then this book of Dennett's will be like preaching to the choir.Even if such logic problems are worth clarifying, this book is extremely verbose and digressive in my opinion. If I'm allowed a career stereotying joke: A newly appointed university president was amazed at the difference in funding requirement of different departments: the physicists needed billions of dollars for an accelerator; the mathematicians only needed paper, pencils, and a waste basket; heck the philosophy department doesn’t even need a waste basket.So back to the intuition pumps. What are they? They are a particular type of thought experiment: one that reduces the complexity to the bare minimum (which can be a good thing) and then, anybody can intuitively answer the question in an unambiguous manner (e.g., does NCT speak Chinese). Clearly, in the NCT example, the reason you can intuit is because important details get swept away. Other commonly misused intuition pumps include ""surely"" and ""rathering"". ""Surely"" is the act of prefacing a wrong statement with ""surely"" and pass it on as an obvious truism. (e.g., Surely only humans can have a mind). Rathering is to refute A because B is clearly the case (e.g., Donald Trump is not evil, rather he is stupid.)These are simply logic fallacies. The latter is called false dichotomy. There are webpages discussing the common ones. The book discussed a grand total of 12 pumps, 6 positive, 6 negatives. So what about the positive intuition pumps. Well, I hate to disappoint, but there is really just one, which is try to use ""reductio ad absurdum"". Others are some wise remarks that do not IMO count as thought experiment let alone intuition pumps (remember the latter is a special case of the former). Here is one example called Sturgeon's law. Science fiction writer Sturgeon agrees 90% of science fiction is crud. But 90% of anything is crud. So don't waste time hooting at the crap.Surely, I'm not hooting at the crap. Rather, I'm warning you of the relatively low density of intellectual wisdom."
44,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/426865-valerie,3,"Daniel C. Dennett cites himself a lot. Just sayin'.Right, so his thing is that free will and determinism are not incompatible. He's really big into non-incompatibles. the idea that you can predict the choice someone will make does not effect his ability to make that choice. So, its predictable that i would write this... but i still also made a choice to write it. i really hope he explains how this is so because i still don't get it. I had no idea this book would be so much about rhetoric, linquistics, etc. a delightful surprise as I love that stuff (for example, every time I malapropriate I cover with the declaration that ""I love malapropisms!"" because 1) it makes me look clever when I was looking dumb and 2) its true - I love the fact that I can use the wrong word for something and my intentionality/meaning is still conveyed intact - at least much of the time). I can't wait to apply his nasty little tools, like ""rathering"" to my own writing b/c I also agree with him in that there is often nothing more fun than realize how wrong you are - mistakes are such a juicy opportunity for growth.so far this book reminds me of Jonah Leher's ""How we decide."" (I still find myself wanting to champion him despite his unfortunate debacle - his writing was nice and clear and interesting and I still trust it in the main [self plagiarizing is nonsense, and I'm somehow not too bothered by the other stuff...])I still don't really understand where Dennett falls in the dualist/materialist etc camp (I know most assume he's a strict materialist, but the way he complains about being misunderstood..and at times seems to discuss the reality of qualia confuses me).. need to read more of him. I like this quote: ""Let's stipulate at the outset that there is a great deal of deplorable, stupid, second-rate stuff out there, of all sorts. Now, in order not to waste your time and try our patience, make sure you concentrate on the best stuff you can find, the flagship exexamples, extolled by the leaders of the field, the prize-winning entries, not the dregs."" I wonder if he'll discuss how people's tendency to do this is just 'cause they're insecure and it makes them feel good to tear apart weak scholarship or weak anything, really. probably he won't. speaking of , this is an angry statement. dennett is quite an angry man.still judging dennett's ability to write/speak clearly about complex stuff, so far, he's doing pretty well. I was having a conversation with Ariel the other day about how it's so annoying how people will write really convolutedly with lots of big words (or worse a bunch of terminology specific to your field [""word-dropping""]) and stuff to sound intelligent, and it can be, like, a lot of quantity and stuff, but she said something like - the more words you're using and the longer your sentences, likely the less you're actually saying. i think she probably quoted someone who said it better. but anyway, this is true also of novelists, she was probably thinking about healy's ""how i became a famous novelist""... everyone should just read and follow chicago's manual of style. k? thanks.another thing i was thinking about along the line of phonies is, like, i know it's a fine line between original ideas and copying and nothing new under the sun and all, but you know it when you see it? in that, it seems that often a person instead of being inspired by an idol in the same field to create someone of their own or copying their style in a way to express their own stuff - the best they can do is just copy the obvious mannerisms or personaility quirks or things unrelated to the particular craft really, you know a caricature, like someone puffing on a pipe and reading a book by the sea who actually hates to read, or someone who is all angry like dennett and thinks that's his ""persona"" or something and it's his duty to set the score with his ""philosopher"" friends as if he were a big wig within a community or something, because really, he just likes dennett's persona and wants desperately to believe that he is just like that....."

The title is a misnomer; it is not a handy guide to navigating your decisions in life, etc, or even a practical 80 steps to improving your mind. It is a series of short chapters of philosophical tidbits designed to introduce as much of Dennett's own nomenclature as possible to see what sticks (immortality!), and in the meantime showing how terribly misguided his fellow philosophers are, supported by lots of references to his own work. I've never read a book that references its own author so frequently. In general, it made my head hurt, and paralysed me from reading other things until I had stubbornly finished it. For which I hate it. Especially for taking advantage of my good nature and forcing me to slog through how computer programs work. Did I add I hated it? I've read other Dennett books, but I think I will stop now. He's clever, I get it."
46,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18370648-mishehu,5,"What a mind... Dennett is that rarest of beings: a philosopher who presents his ideas undumbed down, and with crystal clarity, for a lay readership. Not only does he respect his untrained readers, he genuinely strives to educate them and to spur their own deeper learning and inquiry. The long and the short is this: every time I finish one of his books, I am (I think) smarter than I was when I began. It's amazing how much food for thought Dennett packs between the covers of each, and how artfully he composes them. In addition to being a first-rate thinker, Dennett is a superb stylist. And so I say, of yet another Dennett title: I loved it! Here's hoping Dennett has many years of writing still to come."
47,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16443561-alex-shenton,2,"Summary: There's a lot of interesting stuff here if you can struggle through it and are prepared to put in some hard thinking time over it (which you should be, if you're reading a book on philosophy). It's like taking a journey which you have heard is arduous but rewarding. However in this case the journey is also uneven and sometimes tedious, and your companion won't stop playing a Spice Girls medley on the kazoo.In a bit more detail:First off, this is a hard book. It wants you to think and it wants you to do the exercises, in fact it needs you to do so to really understand what it's talking about. But what IS it talking about? What ARE intuition pumps? I've finished it but I'm still not sure I could tell you.The book is broken into lots of short chapters, and the first third of the book is a bit of a trudge, containing lots of common/familiar philosophical problems, and seemingly wandering about over them with little direction. There are some gems in there but nothing really new to me. The middle third turns largely to modelling computation and derives pretty much from first principles an almost-Turing-machine, which is is actually quite nicely done and was interesting to me but flatout stopped my wife reading as it descended into some very technical descriptions. A pity because (as someone already familiar with the field) I actually quite enjoyed this bit. The final third starts to talk about some more interesting and complex philosophical problems such as the theory of mind, and determinism and whether it is compatible with free will. This is occasionally heavy stuff but contains enough to keep me going through it, with some genuinely cute ideas and turns of phrase. Then it all ends a bit abruptly.All of the above would be worth three stars if it weren't for the author's style of writing. He writes as someone who is extremely condescending and convinced of their own brilliance, explaining it to the pitiful mortals while trying to pretend that he might be a bit like ""one of us"", despite not actually believing that of himself. It's trying, and annoying. He's clearly very smart and sometimes writes engaging prose, but after a few pages you just feel like you want to slap him. I don't think his communication style is particularly clear either, but that might be fine since the book seems to be aimed at a level a few steps above the usual pop-science type book.I wouldn't recommend it."
48,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5873460-james-p,3,"I won't plagiarize another reviewer by pointing any prospective reader of Dennett's book to Sturgeon's Law, but for those listening: consult Sturgeon's Law. 10% of this book is extremely interesting - which for a 500 page book can seem reasonable and tiring on the same plane. Cf. every book Dennett has ever written on consciousness if you want to avoid the hassle (it's the topic he has theorized on tenaciously during his 30-year career as a mainstream philosopher). You'll notice he conveniently cites himself far too often (even a forthcoming book at one point) or just lops chunks of his older writings into neat little paragraphs for you to digest. Therefore, this book is a summary mostly.His objectives seemed vague to me for a few reasons. First, there were often chapters that felt like narrative interludes where Dennett could discuss pure philosophical praxis. What was the point of these sporadic divisions?Second, the unceasing referrals to parts later in the book that build on earlier topics shows cohesion in the subject matter - an interconnectivity that Dennett himself seems to value. However, this does not lend itself to the most concise structuring of this particular philosophical monograph. Third, spending time debasing other philosophers, science, science AND philosophy, religion, religion and science, computers, argument-logic, and other intuition pumps (that, by the way, are not meant to be intuition pumps since most are OPTION B: ""Name Preservers"" [last chapter]) is tiresome and feels wayward from giving us thinking tools about thinking (meta-).Finally, Dennett gets by on giving us footnotes to arguments and tangible evidence that we need to go and access outside the text. Otherwise, I feel Dennett's own views are obfuscated and each new topic is introduced with critical reviewal and no apparent philosophical ""attempt"" at an aporetic stance by the end.Don't look down on me or other philosophy students, Dan. Don't throw us all under the bus too quickly or else you may find you'll have thrown out the proverbial baby with the bath-water, Dan. Don't talk cute to me, Dan, I deserve some formal prose in my philosophy reading. It hurts my feelings and I wasn't expecting a literal coup on my love of philosophy by reading your book, I just wanted to learn something new."
49,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3723739-josh,5,"Date first finished: 21 September 2013Date second finished: 19 January 2014This is an excellent book that gives a good introduction to some of the ways of doing philosophy. The first section has perhaps some of the most valuable advice for engaging with ideas and their proponents, and is something I will probably return to again and again to sharpen my tools for evaluating claims. The very first thing that Dennett encourages is for thinkers to make mistakes. It is important not to be afraid of making mistakes because it is by making mistakes that one is able learn more effectively. Another really interesting set of thinking tools are Rapoport's Rules and Sturgeon's Law. Rapoport's rules are as follows:1.) Restate the opponents position so fairly and so accurately that the opponent says, ""Thanks. I wish I had thought of putting it like that.""2.) Point out anywhere where you and the opponent are in agreement, especially if it is a point not widely held.3.) Note anything that you have learned from your opponent.4.) Only then can you offer anything by way of criticism. Sturgeon's Law is also a very interesting concept that says that as a general rule, 90% of everything is garbage. Even if it is the case that 90% of everything produced by any field is garbage, that does not mean one can dismiss the 10% that is quality work. Instead, it is important engage with that 10%, and use that as the standard of quality.The last thinking tool I will mention, which will hopefully make readers want to read the rest of the book, is something like a converse to Occam's razor, the law of parsimony that states that one should not multiple assumptions beyond necessity, that is, the simplest explanation is most often the best explanation. Converse to this idea is Occam's broom. Occam's broom is when someone making a claim sweeps inconvenient facts away as an attempt to make his/her case appear more sound than it actually is. As an example, Dennett brings up conspiracy theorists who are masters of wielding Occam's broom in order to make their claims of conspiracy fit the situation by either dismissing or overlooking important facts that would invalidate their cases. These are just some of the very interesting topics that are brought up in this book. I highly recommend it to everyone who has ever expressed a desire to sharpen their thinking. "
50,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7371054-andrew,4,"This introduces itself as a collection of tricks and tips for philosophical reasoning. What is an essay papering over a gap? What makes a good thought experiment? When faced with one of the classic philosopher's parables (the Chinese Room, the Duplicating Teleporter) how do you figure out whether it's leading your intuition in a useful direction or only distracting you from the point?(Some of these tips are nifty examples of ""turning the knobs"" on thought experiments, creating variants with different intuitive consequences. Others are simple rules of thumb: if a philosopher uses ""surely"" or ""arguably"" in a sentence, watch out!)After the introductory bits, Dennett starts applying these arguments to his standard topics: evolution, free will, and consciousness. He's still exercising arguments to see how well they stand up, but he's doing it as part of a pocket tour of these pet topics. Which is fine; there's been a lot of back-and-forth in the field since I read _Godel Escher Bach_ and it's good to keep up to date.Inevitably, there's a lot of ""my thought experiments are interesting and my opponents' are broken"". Dennett tries not to be a jerk about this -- he prefers to poke holes in his critics' certainties without claiming to be certain about his own beliefs -- but these *are* his topics, and he's opinionated. (Interest: I agree with Dennett's opinions about all this stuff.) For what it's worth, he's also assiduous about referencing both sides of each debate.I found the thing extremely readable. The book is organized in lots of tiny chapters, each focussing on one point or example of argument. If Dennett's previous books on consciousness and evolution seemed like unscalable walls of text, I'd recommend trying this one. If you're already a Dennett fan, this book will be a quick read with a few interesting updates on the familiar arguments."

Dennett is a writer that leads me to believe that I have some kind of adult/reading version of ADD. My ability to focus on what he's saying drops dramatically compared with other philosophy readings for some reason. This isn't to say that the writing is bad, I just know now to not read Dennett when I have a lot on my mind. The advice to philosophy students in the ending chapters is honest, and I think it is advice carefully given ...""[D]on't count on the validation of your fellow graduate students or your favorite professors to settle the issue [the issue about whether or not you're doing philosophy ""right"" or if it's the ""career for you.""] They all have vested interest in keeping the enterprise going. It's what they know how to do; it's what they are good at. This is a problem in other fields too, and it can be even harder to break out of. (...) My point is that you should not settle complacently into a seat on the bandwagon just because you have found some brilliant fellow travelers who find your work on the issue as unignorable as you find theirs. You may all be taking each other for a ride."" (p.422 - 424.)"
52,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536704-cid-medeiros,5,"Dennett collects in this book an interesting inventory of special thought experiments defined by him as intuition pumps. The definition he proposes goes along with what they really do to you: pump your intuition up. They kind guide your thinking towards the core of the subject matter dealt with.	However, as there are some badly designed thought experiments, this is also true for intuition pumps. Dennets explores the bad ones brilliantly. In some very famous cases, the bad ones hold such strong appeal to our intuition that you really need a professional and careful philosopher, such as Dennett, to show you the way out of it.	How Dennett manages to create good intuition pumps as well as spot the failures on the bad ones? I noticed Dennett's approach is very science-oriented making his work likely to belong to the Scientific Realism school of thinking, which is highly recommended if you are to do some thinking without fooling yourself with most of the world’s shenanigans.	So if you care about topics such as Evolution, Consciousness, Artificial Intelligence and Free Will this book falls into the category. It’s not such a heavy reading, as the author's writing is not loaded with jargon and he gets very entertainment at some points. No need to worry about getting bored to death."

Pagine 458. 14,03 €images-amazon.comHo incontrato Dan più di 30 anni fa, e da allora ci siamo sempre frequentati, anche se a volte ci siamo persi di vista per lunghi periodi. Me l'aveva presentato Doug Hofstadter, ma poi siamo diventati amici indipendentemente da lui …Mi piacerebbe poterlo scrivere non soltanto metaforicamente, ma la realtà letterale è che – dopo avere letto Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid (non riesco a ricordare in quale anno, ma la mia copia è molto consunta ed è datata 1983) di Douglas R. Hofstadter, ed esserne rimasto folgorato (è certamente uno di quei libri che hanno contribuito più profondamente a cambiare il mio modo di pensare) – mi sono imbattuto in The Mind's I: Fantasies and Reflections on Self and Soul, di cui Hofstadter era autore insieme a Daniel C. Dennett, all'epoca a me del tutto sconosciuto. Anzi, se devo essere sincero (sì, lo so che sono liberissimo di non esserlo, è soltanto un modo di dire), dall'alto della mia spocchia eurocentrica ero molto diffidente rispetto alla possibilità che potessero esistere dei filosofi americani. Per Hofstadter era stato amore a prima vista, cresciuto libro dopo libro (Metamagical Themas: Questing For The Essence Of Mind And Pattern del 1985, anche se io ho l'edizione Penguin del 1986; Fluid Concepts And Creative Analogies: Computer Models Of The Fundamental Mechanisms Of Thought del 1995) fino allo struggente Le Ton Beau De Marot: In Praise of the Music of Language del 1997. Paradossalmente, questo amore prima incondizionato ha mostrato qualche incrinatura proprio da quando ho avuto occasione di conoscere Doug Hofstadter personalmente nel 2004: ma forse quella di nutrire dubbi è una caratteristica dell'amore maturo. Resta il fatto che I Am a Strange Loop del 2007 mi è piaciuto meno degli altri libri (ne ho scritto una recensione su questo blog, che trovate qui).Per Dennett le cose sono state molto diverse. A differenza di Hofstadter, Dennett non è un seduttore. Si concede con estrema riluttanza (sì, come il San Bernardo di cui scrive Snoopy).linkiesta.itPer anni, pur trovando interessanti i temi e le argomentazioni di Dennett, ho fatto molta fatica a leggerlo. Scriveva – se posso esprimermi così – da filosofo. Non pretendo mi crediate sulla parola. Facciamo così: riporto qui sotto l'inizio del primo capitolo di Brainstorms. Saggi filosofici sulla mente e la psicologia nella traduzione italiana edita da Adelphi, e voi giudicate da soli:In questo capitolo esaminerò il concetto di un sistema il cui comportamento può, almeno occasionalmente, essere spiegato e previsto attribuendogli credenze e desideri (e speranze, paure, intenzioni, impressioni, ecc.). Chiamerò tali sistemi sistemi intenzionali, e tali spiegazioni e previsioni spiegazioni e previsioni intenzionali, in virtù dell'intenzionalità delle espressioni tipiche usate per designare le credenze e i desideri (e le speranze, le paure, le intenzioni, le impressioni, ecc.).In passato, mi ostinavo a scrivere «intenzionale» con la I maiuscola ogni volta che intendevo usare la nozione di intenzionalità di Brentano, per distinguere questo termine tecnico da quello comune, per esempio, nell'espressione «una spinta intenzionale»; ma ora il termine tecnico è molto più usato, e poiché quasi tutti quelli che lo usano non sembrano preoccuparsi del rischio di confusione, ho deciso, con qualche trepidazione, di abbandonare questa eccentricità tipografica. Ma il lettore non iniziato si ritenga avvertito: «intenzionale» nel senso in cui appare qui non è il termine consueto della lingua ordinaria. Per me, come per molti autori contemporanei, l'intenzionalità è in primo luogo una caratteristica delle entità linguistiche – idiotismi, contesti – e per gli scopi che qui mi prefiggo basterà dire che un'espressione è intenzionale se la sostituzione di termini codesignativi non ne conserva la verità o se gli «oggetti» di queste espressioni non possono essere trattati nel modo usuale con i quantificatori. [pp. 37-38]Si potrebbe usare questo testo in un corso di scrittura per illustrare come non si scrive un testo per non addetti ai lavori: frasi lunghe, vocaboli inconsueti introdotti senza spiegarli (che cosa diavolo sono i termini codesignativi?), gergo specifico della disciplina. E, soprattutto, il malcelato disprezzo per il lettore non iniziato che deve essere avvertito; disprezzo rivelatore della circostanza che il lettore ideale sarebbe invece il lettore iniziato.Poi sono successe due cose che hanno del miracoloso. La prima è che, tutto d'un tratto, Dennett ha imparato a scrivere per un pubblico di non filosofi, per un pubblico cioè di persone di media cultura e con una bella voglia di imparare delle cose nuove: non dev'essere stato facile per lui e immagino abbia richiesto uno sforzo di volontà e l'acquisizione di tecniche e strumenti specifici. La seconda è che ha scritto anche lui un libro fondamentale, un altro di quei libri che hanno cambiato in modo permanente il mio modo di pensare: Consciousness Explained. Prima di leggerlo – durante le vacanze di natale del 1993-1994 a Roccamare, direi, dal momento che ho la seconda ristampa, 1993, dell'edizione Penguin, anche se il libro è del 1991 – ero pigramente convinto che quello della consciousness fosse un problema intrattabile, da lasciare alle elucubrazioni dei metafisici. Ricordo ancora l'emozione, la gioia, la sensazione di avere fatto una scoperta importante che quella lettura mi aveva lasciato. Ancora più delle argomentazioni di Dennett, che nel tempo si sono per lo più arricchite di significato e di elementi a sostegno, ma qualche volta si sono anche dimostrate sbagliate, è stato fare la scoperta, e raggiungere la convinzione, che non vi fosse nessun tema, nessuno, che non potesse e dovesse essere affrontato, e fruttuosamente, con i metodi e gli strumenti della scienza. Questa sensazione mi è rimasta dopo tutti questi anni, inseparabile da quelle vacanze di natale, dalle passeggiate in pineta con i miei figli (8 e 10 anni) e dagli esperimenti sulla tastiera (Bach, certamente; Wachet auf?).[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHhuyh...] * * *Quanto alle intuition pumps, penso di averle incontrate la prima volta – o, almeno, di essere stato per la prima volta consapevole del loro potenziale come strumento del pensiero – in un intervento di Daniel Dennett su Edge, il sito/blog (ante litteram) di John Brockman. Da allora le ho sempre usate nella mia prima lezione all'università, per cercare di stabilire un percorso intuitivo prima di procedere alle tradizionali (e pallose) spiegazioni deduttive, o come diavolo si chiamano. Ecco il testo che usavo:If you look at the history of philosophy, you see that all the great and influential stuff has been technically full of holes but utterly memorable and vivid. They are what I call “intuition pumps” — lovely thought experiments. Like Plato's cave, and Descartes's evil demon, and Hobbes' vision of the state of nature and the social contract, and even Kant'sidea of the categorical imperative. I don't know of any philosopher who thinks any one of those is a logically sound argument for anything. But they're wonderful imagination grabbers, jungle gyms for the imagination. They structure the way you think about a problem. These are the real legacy of the history of philosophy. A lot of philosophers haveforgotten that, but I like to make intuition pumps.[…]I coined the term ""intuition pump,"" and its first use was derogatory. […] I went on to say that intuition pumps are fine if they're used correctly, but they can also be misused. They're not arguments, they're stories. Instead of having a conclusion, they pump an intuition. They get you to say “Aha! Oh, I get it!”The idea of consciousness as a virtual machine is a nice intuition pump. It takes a while to set up, because a lot of the jargon of artificial intelligence and computer science is unfamiliar to philosophers or other people. But if you have the patience to set some of these ideas up, then you can say, “Hey! Try thinking about the idea that what we have inour heads is software. It's a virtual machine, in the same way that a word processor is a virtual machine.” Suddenly, bells start ringing, and people start seeing things from a slightly different perspective.[Dennett, Daniel C. “Intuition Pumps”. In: Brockman, John (ed.). The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution. New York: Simon & Schuster. 1995]* * *Quando la scorsa primavera ho saputo dell'uscita del nuovo libro di Dennett e ne ho letto il titolo mi sono detto: «Bene, questa volta Dennett ci propone la cassetta degli attrezzi del pensatore, o del filosofo che dir si voglia». Non mi sbagliavo. In effetti, proprio nel primo capitolo, Dennett spiega i suoi intenti in modo particolarmente chiaro (già che ci siete, per favore, notate quanta distanza ci sia tra il chiaro e godibile Dennett di adesso e quello che cercava un lettore iniziato!). Lasciamo a lui la parola (abbiate pazienza, ma questa lunga citazione e sintesi del capitolo introduttivo è necessaria; soprattutto per voi che non avete ancora letto il libro, se posso essere un po' paternalistico):Thinking is hard. Thinking about some problems is so hard it can make your head ache just thinking about thinking about them. My colleague the neuropsychologist Marcel Kinsbourne suggests that whenever we find thinking hard, it is because the stony path to truth is competing with seductive, easier paths that turn out to be dead ends. Most of the effort in thinking is a matter of resisting these temptations. [pos. Kindle 161][…]Some people, like von Neumann, are such natural geniuses that they can breeze through the toughest tangles; others are more plodding but are blessed with a heroic supply of “willpower” that helps them stay the course in their dogged pursuit of truth. Then there are the rest of us, not calculating prodigies and a little bit lazy, but still aspiring to understand whatever confronts us. What can we do? We can use thinking tools, by the dozens. These handy prosthetic imagination-extenders and focus-holders permit us to think reliably and even gracefully about really hard questions. This book is a collection of my favorite thinking tools. I will not just describe them; I intend to use them to move your mind gently through uncomfortable territory all the way to a quite radical vision of meaning, mind, and free will. We will begin with some tools that are simple and general, having applications to all sorts of topics. Some of these are familiar, but others have not been much noticed or discussed. Then I will introduce you to some tools that are for very special purposes indeed, designed to explode one specific seductive idea or another, clearing a way out of a deep rut that still traps and flummoxes experts. We will also encounter and dismantle a variety of bad thinking tools, misbegotten persuasion-devices that can lead you astray if you aren’t careful. Whether or not you arrive comfortably at my proposed destination – and decide to stay there with me – the journey will equip you with new ways of thinking about the topics, and thinking about thinking. [174-184][…]Like all artisans, a blacksmith needs tools, but – according to an old (indeed almost extinct) observation – blacksmiths are unique in that they make their own tools. Carpenters don’t make their saws and hammers, tailors don’t make their scissors and needles, and plumbers don’t make their wrenches, but blacksmiths can make their hammers, tongs, anvils, and chisels out of their raw material, iron. What about thinking tools? Who makes them? And what are they made of? Philosophers have made some of the best of them – out of nothing but ideas, useful structures of information. René Descartes gave us Cartesian coordinates, the x- and y-axes without which calculus – a thinking tool par excellence simultaneously invented by Isaac Newton and the philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz – would be almost unthinkable. Blaise Pascal gave us probability theory so we can easily calculate the odds of various wagers. The Reverend Thomas Bayes was also a talented mathematician, and he gave us Bayes’s theorem¸ the backbone of Bayesian statistical thinking. But most of the tools that feature in this book are simpler ones, not the precise, systematic machines of mathematics and science but the hand tools of the mind. Among them areLabels. Sometimes just creating a vivid name for something helps you keep track of it while you turn it around in your mind trying to understand it. Among the most useful labels, as we shall see, are warning labels or alarms, which alert us to likely sources of error.Examples. Some philosophers think that using examples in their work is, if not quite cheating, at least uncalled for –rather the way novelists shun illustrations in their novels. The novelists take pride in doing it all with words, and the philosophers take pride in doing it all with carefully crafted abstract generalizations presented in rigorous order, as close to mathematical proofs as they can muster. Good for them, but they can’t expect me to recommend their work to any but a few remarkable students. It’s just more difficult than it has to be.Analogies and metaphors. Mapping the features of one complex thing onto the features of another complex thing that you already (think you) understand is a famously powerful thinking tool, but it is so powerful that it often leads thinkers astray when their imaginations get captured by a treacherous analogy.Staging. You can shingle a roof, paint a house, or fix a chimney with the help of just a ladder, moving it and climbing, moving it and climbing, getting access to only a small part of the job at a time, but it’s often a lot easier in the end to take the time at the beginning to erect some sturdy staging that will allow you to move swiftly and safely around the whole project. Several of the most valuable thinking tools in this book are examples of staging that take some time to put in place but then permit a variety of problems to be tackled together – without all the ladder-moving.And, finally, the sort of thought experiments I have dubbed intuition pumps. [193-216][…]Other thought experiments are less rigorous but often just as effective: little stories designed to provoke a heartfelt, table-thumping intuition – “Yes, of course, it has to be so!” – about whatever thesis is being defended. I have called these intuition pumps. I coined the term in the first of my public critiques of philosopher John Searle’s famous Chinese Room thought experiment (Searle, 1980; Dennett, 1980), and some thinkers concluded I meant the term to be disparaging or dismissive. On the contrary, I love intuition pumps! That is, some intuition pumps are excellent, some are dubious, and only a few are downright deceptive. Intuition pumps have been a dominant force in philosophy for centuries. They are the philosophers’ version of Aesop’s fables, which have been recognized as wonderful thinking tools since before there were philosophers. If you ever studied philosophy in college, you were probably exposed to such classics as Plato’s cave, in The Republic, in which people are chained and can see only the shadows of real things cast on the cave wall; or his example, in Meno, of teaching geometry to the slave boy. Then there is Descartes’s evil demon, deceiving Descartes into believing in a world that was entirely illusory – the original Virtual Reality thought experiment – and Hobbes’s state of nature, in which life is nasty, brutish, and short. [227-235][…]This self-conscious wariness with which we should approach any intuition pump is itself an important tool for thinking, the philosophers’ favorite tactic: “going meta” – thinking about thinking, talking about talking, reasoning about reasoning. Meta-language is the language we use to talk about another language, and meta-ethics is a bird’s-eye view examination of ethical theories. [276][…]Some of the most powerful thinking tools are mathematical, but aside from mentioning them, I will not devote much space to them because this is a book celebrating the power of non-mathematical tools, informal tools, the tools of prose and poetry, if you like, a power that scientists often underestimate. [304][…]I have always figured that if I can’t explain something I’m doing to a group of bright undergraduates, I don’t really understand it myself, and that challenge has shaped everything I have written. [322: non proprio sempre e non proprio tutto quello che ha scritto, come abbiamo toccato con mano; ma perdoniamogliela, questa piccola innocente bugia][…]In the first section that follows, I present a dozen general, all-purpose tools, and then in subsequent sections I group the rest of the entries not by the type of tool but by the topic where the tool works best, turning first to the most fundamental philosophical topic – meaning, or content – followed by evolution, consciousness, and free will. A few of the tools I present are actual software, friendly devices that can do for your naked imagination what telescopes and microscopes can do for your naked eye.Along the way, I will also introduce some false friends, tools that blow smoke instead of shining light. [354]Ecco, il problema secondo me è tutto qui. Ho trovato la sezione dedicata agli all-purpose tools particolarmente azzeccata, e fedele al titolo del libro e al suo programma (è in effetti la seconda, A dozen general thinking tools, perché la prima Introduction: what is an intuition pump? è quella che ho appena riassunto). Poi è un progressivo calando, via via che l'attenzione si sposta dal tipo di strumento all'argomento al quale (secondo Dennett) quello strumento meglio si attaglia. Se sentite un po' di puzza di bruciato, è perché il trucco c'è: poiché si tratta di argomenti di cui Dennett ha già scritto a lungo in passato, si resta con il dubbio che ci sia un po' di riciclaggio e che alla fin fine a Dennett interessi soprattutto tornare sulle sue concezioni dell'evoluzione, della consciousness e del libero arbitrio.Giusto per la cronaca: personalmente ho trovato nel libro un gradiente negativo. Le sezioni sono (dopo la prima e la seconda, di cui abbiamo già citato il titolo):Tools for thinking about meaning or contentAn interlude about computersMore tools about meaningTools for thinking about evolutionTools for thinking about consciousnessTools for thinking about free willWhat is it like to be a philosopher? (questa sezione è proprio appiccicata lì e non c'entra nulla con tutto quello che viene detto prima; forse Dennett è pagato a righe come Dumas?)Use the tools. Try HarderWhat got left out."

58,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4369435-jay-kamaladasa,4,"Finally, a book worth reading and reviewing. The one thing that I dislike about the book is perhaps the long winded (but playful) narration that seems to be an overkill. Simple concepts that can be explained in a sentence or a paragraph goes on to be chapters. But since Dennett is a philosopher it's all forgiven. If you don't like this playful elongated writing style, and prefer concise and direct communication, it may ruin a perfectly good book. There are several things I found fascinating about the thinking tools. I won't list all of them, but there seems to be a few major points he tries to paint with stacking several intuition pumps together. And those messages are worth mentioning. 1.) There is no wonder tissue that makes us humans unique. We're simply chemical machines. The deliberate wanting to place a hidden mystery to the workings of the brain is merely an attempt at convincing ourselves that we are special. 2.) The meaning of life and the intentions that we have can probably never be deciphered. We Sorta know our inner programming, but really we don't. The only programming that makes sense is the narrative of the Selfish Gene. The one that wants to propagate itself towards the future by beating all the odd balls that the environment can throw at it. 2b.) Genetic Engineering is perhaps one of the most important things that humans have created. It's a revolution in evolution. 3.) Consciousness and Self are illusions, but effective and useful illusions. Kind of like the concept of a center of gravity or axis of rotation. There is no such physical thing as a center of gravity but having a concept of such a point makes the physical world easier to explain. 4.) There can be free will in an in-deterministic world. From all the things that Dennett describes in the book, this was news to me. And I loved the way he walked the reader through his thinking process. But I think beauty of this book is not necessarily in the conclusions but in the philosophical discussions that lead to the said conclusions. The thinking tools that are required to comprehend these truths are not necessarily straightforward. It requires sitting down, wrapping your head around intuitive concepts and then extending what you've learnt to other problems. That's where the book shines, and that's possibly why you should read it. "
59,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14628030-kelvin,3,"(NOTE: I received my copy of the book from the GoodReads giveaways.)Let me begin by saying that this is the first book that I have read by Mr Dennett. I hear him referenced from time to time in books, articles, or lectures (mostly in the area of the philosophy of religion). I wanted to read some of his work, and GoodReads was kind enough to help me with that.However, I am not sure that this would be the best book for someone to ""try out"" Mr Dennett's writing. The book is great, to be sure (the parts I understood anyhow). The thing is, from my point of view, this book seemed to fit somewhere in Mr Dennett's literary world. The work seemed to carry on a conversation that he may have started somewhere else, in another work. Not being familiar with his work, I may have misread it or I may have come in halfway. The book is nice though.Mr Dennett begins the book talking about how we think about things, some presuppositions and some basic cognitive tools. He then begins to get into some interesting thought experiments. There is a brief interlude on computers that lost me entirely, as I am computer illiterate. Then he gets into some more thought experiments and thinking tools/prods.Another thing that should be noted is that this is a work of academic philosophy. There are some technical terms and a certain kind of academic garb that Mr Dennett dresses his ideas in. I am not an academic philosopher, so some of it was lost on me I am sure. Reading this book is not like picking up Plato or some other literary kind of philosopher. There is some heavy lifting involved in reading the book. I had to re-read a thing or two. There are lots of interesting citations and interactions with other philosophers, living and dead, that give the book a very practical/useful feel to it. Mr Dennett give good examples and illustrations of how things can be put into practice. It was a challenging read for me. So, if you like academic philosophy or books about the theory of the mind then the book is worth your time. It was an interesting overview of the way Mr Dennett approaches the thinking process and (may?) serve one as a guide to how he conducts his scholarly writing."
60,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39894105-nestor-leal,3,"This book title was a little misguiding. I like thought experiments which are called intuition pumps in here. Turns out only a few pages are dedicated to these thinking tools then they are applied to the concepts of consciousness, free will, determinism, evolution and the mind. I like to think and philosophize about these things too but the book should have been named otherwise. Some chapters are boring to people (like me) who already know binary code, assembler language and in general how computers work. On the other hand these chapters will help the untrained to learn how they work. At the end, understanding how computers work will help you understand how many things in nature are computer like, ie. our body cells.At times it seemed like this is a good philosophy companion book to The Selfish Gene which is mostly science. There are many references to Richard Dawkins’ work and even to the game theory used in his book. In fact, Dennett states that science and philosophy should go hand in hand, to which I agree, so it makes sense. I didn’t like the arrogant tone of Daniel Dennett and how the criticizes other philosophers. Still it is an ok book.I liked his idea of making good mistakes. Learning about our mistakes is always good for improvement. Mistakes, when understood correctly, help us advance even further. This is not new but mostly nobody likes to be pointed out their mistakes except when they accept and acknowledge this will greatly help them. Still it’s better to make big mistakes than stupid mistakes.Well, reading this book seemed like a good idea at the time!"
61,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,4,"This book reads more like a science book than a philosophy book. The author, a philosopher, uses the tools of philosophy to fill in the blanks about how we proceed with science.The book starts off by how we sometimes can be mislead by 'intuition pumps"", thought experiments, and how we should correctly use them. He sets up the listener in how to think about problems and then delves into some big problems, such as design within the universe and what does it mean, and what is consciousness and how to think about it.The author is a philosopher but is much more interested in understanding the scientific method as opposed to the meaning of words.I've listened to most of the science books audible has available and a book like this helps me see beyond just the science but also how to think about the science.This author had a theme throughout this whole book. That the start of all understanding first comes about by realizing the role of evolution in the design of all non-trivial systems.I will read more of this author's work. P.S. I did end up reading more of this author's work, and it made me disappointed in this book, because he copies most of this book from his other books. I like this book, but it turns out to be redundant if you've read his other work. "
62,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5078550-robert-bor,4,"Daniel Dennett's work is not usually within my range of interest. I find the abstract nature of philosophy and it sometimes outlandish discussions to be uninteresting. However, this work is surely an exception. It takes together two aspects which interest me a lot, computer programming and evolution theory. Meaning, consciousness and free will are attacked using various utilities (called intuition pumps) which help thinking about the problems. Useless utilities (called crutch booms) are systematically destroyed. Mr Dennett relentlessly works towards (stopping just short of saying it) showing how the human mind is a beautiful and well-designed (yes, design can be used again, although it is design-without-a-designer) series of systems that all take care of their own and together form complex, conscious, free-willing systems, such as our minds. Note that Mr Dennett nowhere says this is actually the case, but between the lines, this looks to be the winner he is betting on. Mr Dennett also uses this book both as a means to reinforce real or perceived victories against philosophical enemies. I don't really get those, but it's probably part of the in-crowd show."
63,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51893517-meisterkleister,5,"'You can't do much carpentry with your bare hands, and you can't do much thinking with your bare brain.''The aim of philosophy, abstractly formulated, is to understand how things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the broadest possible sense of the term.'The solutions to the most difficult questions in existence, about the universe, life, meaning, free will and consciousness are not intuitive. If they were, we would've figured them out long ago. Daniel Dennett's book offers a plethora of Thinking Tools drawn from computer science, biology and many other realms which, like the apps on your phone, give you the power to do more things better - to think difficults thoughts more easily, and even tackle the most difficult questions about meaning and consciousness. It's designed to change your way of thinking and to nudge you out of some ultimately wrong intuitions you may hold. It is basically a summary of his life's work.I think Dennett's toolkit, which is made out of many thought experiments ('Intuition Pumps') and more, is extremely useful for any aspiring thinker, whether you agree with him or not."
64,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2780292-tadas-talaikis,4,"Nice addition to demonology of mind. Not five, because it's not one theme related and barely scratches the top of the iceberg, unlike, for example Consciousness Explained. I've got an idea about ""demons"", whether they're politburo or just switching (probably both*) from that book, was easy to get, because I deal with computers daemons almost every day.""I am"" is different each morning, depends either on politburo votes (like Google's Pagerank algorithm :-D) of mind demons who will act as ""I"", or some random or pseudo-random switch between (with a consequence like, ""I woke up one morning and found everything changed"",...). Oversimplified, in reality a bit different, but interesting to dig into ""own"" ""self"". Overwork can lead to something Mr. Robot related, when you can't distinguish which demon did what and when :-DP.S. Book isn't really about just that."
65,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9837180-steve-bell,5,"I was going to rate 4 stars because I felt vaguely unsatisfied; then I realized I just hadn't taken the time to work through all the exercises. I resisted actually stretching my grasp of the tools for thinking about thinking. And for thinking about free will, evolution, and other topics I love thinking about but that I think I already am good at thinking about. But ya know, Prof. Dennett is the champ at pumping intuition. 5 stars for the champ. I suppose this is not as entertaining as, say, Darwin's Dangerous Idea or Breaking the Spell. Learning to use new tools, I realize, is a little uncomfortable at times. How could it not be so?"
66,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4826004-kirsten,3,"Whew, got in a little bit over my head with this one. It got three stars because I liked it - what I understood of it, that is. He covers a lot of challenging topics - evolution, consciousness, free will, and so on, subjects I find fascinating - and even though he does his best to make it accessible to non-philosophers, I still think I needed more foundational philosophy knowledge than I actually have to get the most out of it. The chapters were mercifully short, many just 3-5 pages, and I know that was probably the only reason I got through it at all. "
67,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5707216-erik,4,"Although it starts with some basic ""tools for thinking"", this book is really about meaning and consciousness. The ""intuition pumps"" are all tailored to thinking about those topics, and there isn't a lot of general advice on creating thinking tools for other topics.That said, this is a great book about meaning and consciousness. It will make you reconsider what it means to be human, which is really useful if you have to deal with a lot of humans day-to-day."
68,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5926316-jose,5,"This book has made me love philosophy once again, there isn't a lot of stuff that's new, most of these intuition pumps are discussed in earlier works, but the explanations are lucid, clear and interesting.

Rare is it that after putting down a piece of non-fiction do I want to immediately start again from the beginning.But I'm going to give it some time to sink in, and then maybe I'll take it up again.Here are my notes:Going meta or semantic ascent - moving from communication about a subject to communication about communication about that subject. - p9""Philosophy--in every field of inquiry--is what you have to do until you figure out what questions you should have been asking in the first place."" - p20""If you attempt to make sense of the world of ideas and meanings, free will and morality, art and science and even philosophy without a sound and quite detailed knowledge of evolution, you have one hand tied behind your back."" - p21Become a ""connoisseur of your own mistakes"" - p22""Evolution works the same way: all the dumb mistakes tend to be invisible, so all we see is a stupendous string of triumphs."" - p26Rapoport's rules for criticism:1. Re-express other's views2. List points of agreement3. Mention anything learned from other4. Rebut or criticizeFolk psychology: our innate ability to interpret the acts and intentions of other agents (a skill that autistics lack, for example)Manifest image (how the world appears to us, i.e. trees and people and rocks) and scientific image (how the world actually is, i.e. molecules and quarks and atoms, etc) - p69 Intentional stance: ""the strategy of interpreting the behavior of an entity (person, animal, artifact, or whatever) by treating it as if it were a rational agent who governed its 'choice' of 'action' by a 'consideration' of its 'beliefs' and 'desires.'"" - p78Three main stances: physical, design, and intentionalThe sorta operator - an example of Darwin's gradualism. Brilliant example of ""anti-essentialism"". - p96Brainese, or the ""Language of Thought"" - tantalizing idea that the brain comes pre-programmed with its own processing language. - p104Look up Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage""Decrement-or-branch is the key to the power of the register machine. It is the only instruction that allows the computer to ""notice"" (sorta notice) anything in the world and use what it notices to guide its next step. [...] conditional branching is the key to the power of all stored-program computers"" - p123Evolution of a program - p1267 secrets of the computer: (p109)1. Competence without comprehension - no need to comprehend an action to execute it effectively2. What a number in a register stands fit depends on the program composed (contextual semantics)3. Since numbers in registers can stand for anything, a register can, in principle, be designed to ""notice"" anything, to ""discriminate"" any pattern or feature that can be associated with a number or number of numbers (unbound pattern awareness)4. Since a number can stand for anything, a number can stand for an instruction or address5. All possible programs can be given a unique number as a name, which can then be treated as a list of instructions to be executed by a Universal machine 6. All the improvements in computers since Turing invented his imaginary paper-tape machines are simply ways of making then faster7. There are no more secrets! No wonder tissue or unknown physical laws - ""you know that if you succeed in getting a computer program to model some phenomenon, there are no causes at work in the model other than the causes that are composed of all the arithmetical operations."" - p131Diff btwn Von Neumann and register machine: register can operate on any register, VN does all work in the Accumulator and then copies to memory. But VN also has more hard-wired operations (add, subt, etc). - p129Virtual machine - ""what you get when you impose a particular pattern of instructions (more literally, dispositions) on a real machine that has lots of plasticity--interacting parts that can be in many different states."" - p134 In a broad sense, virtual machines include OSs, language runtimes, and programs. Each is a more specific and higher-level machine than the real machine they are all built upon.Parallel btwn cascade of virtual machines and the cascade of homunculi - p138Algorithm - word comes from C9 Persian mathematician Mûusâ al-Khowârizm, defined as fixed procedure with predictable outcomes. Turing, Gödel, and Alonzo Church fixed current understanding in the 1930s. - p141Original intention vs derived intention: how do we know where the origin of intention lies? Giant robot intuition pump addresses this question. - p166Excellent summary of theory of meaning on p197-198:""And what are the verdicts of this long section on meaning? A mixture of pessimism and optimism. Meaning isn't going to turn out to be a simple property that maps easily onto brains, and we're not going to find ""deeper"" facts anywhere that just settle the question of what a sentence, or a thought, or a belief really means. The best we can do–and it is quite good enough–is to find and anchor (apparently) best interpretations of all the physical-stance (and design-stance) data we have. If we can find one solution to a Quinian quandary about meaning, we have almost certainly found the solution–in the sense that we may be confident that no better solution lies undiscovered. As the two-bitser's move to Panama showed, meaning is always relative to a context of function, and there need be no original intentionality beyond the intentionality of our (sorta) selfish genes, which derive their sorta intentionality from the functional context of evolution by natural selection, instead of from an Intelligent Designer playing the role of our rich client ordering a giant robot. And the intuition pump about the two black boxes shows that the intentional stance, with all its tolerance of sorta beliefs and their ilk, is not optional if you want to understand and explain many of the causal regularities in the world.Our investigations into these issues are greatly enhanced, here in the twenty-first century, by the fact that, for the first time, we have ways of thinking rigorously and vigorously about mechanisms with trillions of moving parts–parts that work in unmysterious ways. Thanks to Turing, we can at least dimly see a path now, from brute uncomprehending matter (the physical stance) via a cascade of rearrangements (the design stance, and sorta meanings) to an appreciation of ourselves as paradigmatic believers, knowers, understanders (simplified by the intentional stance as intentional systems).""Darwin's theory of evolution unites meaning with matter: ""On one side, we have the world of our mods and their meanings [...] On the other side, we have galaxies ceaselessly wheeling, planets falling pointlessly into their orbits, lifeless chemical mechanisms doing what their physics ordains, all without purpose or reason. Then Darwin comes along and shows us how the former arises from the latter, creating meaning as it goes, a bubble-up vision of the birth of importance to overthrow the trickle-down vision of tradition."" - p201Library of Mendel / Library of Babel: set of all possible permutations of DNA base-pairs / characters in the Roman alphabet. Useful analogy between words and genes to think about the vastness of possibilities. - p205Similarity between genes and words or subroutines. ""Most of the genome is more like he dictionary of words available for writing the book of instructions [...] The difference between a person and a mouse comes out of the different orders in which the genes, drawn from that shared mammalian vocabulary, are deployed, the different places in the body where this is happening and its timing."" - p214 genes are like tools in a software toolbox, and they build upon each other (mammal on top if fish on top of animal etc)Design Space: the space of all possible designs. - p220Excellent argument for including language of design in talking about evolution on p222. ""Why shrink from the pedagogical task of showing that there can be design without a designer? [...] The biosphere is utterly saturated with design, with purpose, with reasons. What I call the design stance predicts and explains features throughout the living world using the same assumptions that works so well when we are reverse engineering artifacts made by (somewhat) intelligent human designers."" - p222Thought: can we make a comparison between the generation of ideas and the generation of species? We feel selfishly attached to our ideas, and assign much judgement to the failure or success of ideas. But can we assign the same judgement to the failure or success of a species? No room for objective evaluation when process of design takes such a meandering path and success is usually derived from one barely intentional attempt in an endless stream of barely intentional attempts.Skyhooks vs cranes:""a skyhook is a 'mind-first' force or power or process, an exception to the principle that all design, and apparent design, is ultimately the result of mindless, motiveless mechanicity. A crane, in contrast, is a subprocess, or a special feature of a design process that can be demonstrated to permit the local speeding up of the basic, slow process of natural selection, and that can be demonstrated to be itself the preductable (or retrospectively explicable) product of the basic process."" - p228Free-floating rationales: ""the reasons uncovered by evolution before they were ever expressed or represented by human investigators or any other minds"" - p235""Gaudí had reasons for the shapes he ordered created; there are reasons for the shapes created by the termites, but the termites don't have those reasons."" - p235Speaking of the conundrum of distinguishing the point at which non-mammals became mammals: ""We should quell our desire to draw lines. We don't need to draw lines."" - p241""So, as a general rule, consider ignoring the philosophers' demand for an essence, a defining feature, a 'truth-maker'. It typically--not always--starts a wild goose chase that may be diverting but is only moderately illuminating at best."" - p241Cycles: sometimes doing the same thing over and over again, gradually producing a different result is possible - p252Exaptation: ""the reuse of an existing structure for a new function."" - p257A thinko is like a typo, but for semantic errors rather than syntactic ones. Eg forgetting to declare a local variable; calling a building ""homely"". - p261Better to think of DNA as information, not medium. Could theoretically transfer the sequence to bits, or paper, or musical notes, and it would still represent the same unmanifest being. - p271On memes: ""We should be prepared to find cultural replicators that are not beneficial but that manage to thrive nonetheless. [...] Memes are informational symbionts, and like the mutualist symbionts by the trillions that also inhabit us, we couldn't live without them, but that doesn't mean they are all our friends."" - p276Avoiding the trap of thinking about consciousness as a Cartesian Theater, of seeing it as the most central or highest mental phenomenon: ""consciousness is not a medium, like television, into which information can get transduced or recorded, and there is no place in the brain where 'it all comes together' for the appreciation of some Central Witness..."" - p281Diff btwn imagination and conception (at least according to Descartes): imagination is limited by our physical awareness; conception is a property of ""pure mind"" and thus open to a wider design space. - p289Recursive self-representation: having higher-order information states that monitor other internal states, which are in turn monitored, and so on. - p290Qualia: worth exploring more. What is it exactly? Does it even exist?""Is a self the sort of thing--a thing 'made of information'--that can be teleported without loss?"" - p332Heterophenomenology: an example of staging, ""the study of first person phenomena from the third-person point of view of objective science"" - p342Richard Feynman's favorite question to ask of a presenter: ""can you give me a re""If you can't make a hard problem relatively simple, you are probably not going about it the right way. Simplification is not just for beginners."" - p359On Conway and his intent behind the Game of Life: ""What is the minimal complexity required for a self-reproducing thing?"" - p366Inert historical fact: ""any fact about a perfectly ordinary arrangement of matter in the world at some point in the past that is no longer discernible, a fact that has left no footprints at all in the world today."" - p378On determinism vs indeterminism: ""The philosopher David Wiggins (1973, p. 54) once wrote of the 'cosmic unfairness' of determinism, but what our intuition pump about the computer chess tournament shows is the equal 'cosmic unfairness' of indeterminism. B is 'at the mercy of' its random-number generator or its pseudo-random-number generator."" ... ""If determinism is true, I can't change the future, and if determinism is false, I can't change the future. So it follows that I can't change the future."" - p391The Faustian Bargain question fir philosophers: would you rather make some stunning discovery, bestowing a new Truth upon the thankful world, or would you rather propose a theory so original that it generates centuries of valuable controversy, even though it turns out to be mostly wrong? - p412""Since at least a large part of philosophy's task, in my vision of the discipline, consists in negotiating the traffic back and forth between the manifest and scientific images, it is a good idea for philosophers to analyze what they are up against in the way of folk assumptions before launching into their theory-building and theory-criticizing."" - p415 in other words, adopt the stance of ethnographers: suspend judgement and assume that the subjects' beliefs are right before conducting analysis.Donald Herb's dictum: ""If it isn't worth doing, it isn't worth doing well."" - p421Advice to budding philosophers: ""try to avoid committing your precious formative years to a research agenda with a short shelf life. Philosophical fads quickly go extinct, and there may be some truth to the rule of thumb: the hotter the topic, the sooner it will burn out."" - p421John Austin's introduction to a lecture on philosophy: ""It is not unusual for an audience at a lecture to include some who prefer things to be important, and to them now, in case there are any such present, there is owed a peroration."" - p423""Respect the philosopher you are reading b asking yourself, about every sentence and paragraph, 'Do I believe this, and if not, why not?'"" - p426""Even schoolchildren have little difficulty conceiving of DNA today, and it's not because they are more brilliant than Bateson was. It's because in the last century we have devised and refined the thinking tools that make it a snap."" - p429""Conceiving of something new is hard work, not just a matter of framing some idea in your mind, giving it a quick once-over and then endorsing it. What is inconceivable to us now may prove to be obviously conceivable when we've done some more work on it."" - p430"
72,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9310150-quiver,5,"Dennett courts controversy in a number of places by calling out his colleagues for being inaccurate or a little to lax with their methods of thought. His is also excessively wordy, to the point where I occasionally believed a short, single paragraph would get his idea across much better. I appreciate the examples and the historical anecdotes, though they really should have been optional whenever not directly crucial for transmitting the gist of the intuition pump.Despite all of the above, Dennet's book is trove of useful starting points. They really are starting points however: the intuition pumps are general tools that the reader needs to mull over, adopt and adapt, before slowly applying to life and academic thinking. And it's hard work, if you want to do it seriously—I've tried and it's paid off, a little. The main message is this: if you are interested in improving the sharpness of your mental edge, Dennett's book will indicate a few of the segments where you're being obtuse (dictionary meanings 1 and 3 intended). So the book won't even show you all the segments, let alone how to really sharpen them. But that's why you then go and read other books that will. It's always about climbing one rung at a time; Dennett's is an excellent rung. For that I recommend it to most people. Five stars."
73,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"In this book, Daniel Dennett covers a bit of everything he has studied: evolution / consciousness / free will / meaning / AI. I agree with another reviewer who says, ""reading this book is basically like reading Daniel Dennett in blog format."" Unlike the reviewer, I have less problem with it. Perhaps it's because I am more like a casual reader than a student in philosophy. Each intuition pump (thought experiment) discussed is relatively independent of each other, making the book friendly to a reader who reads in fragmented time. Dennett does not demonstrate ""turning all the knobs to examine a thought experiment"" in every chapter. But when he does the trick, it is often enjoyable and inspirational. To make use of this method myself, however, may require lots of practice. A few chapters I like the most and will probably re-read in the future: 	• Trapped in the Robot Control Room	• The Seven Secrets of Computer Power Revealed (on register machine) 	• Noise in the Virtual Hotel	• Mary the Color Scientist	• Dennet's intepreation of Conway's Game of Life	• The Boys from Brazil"
74,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82594046-lou-sills,4,"Prolly one of the most difficult books I have ever read. Thought experiments, ways of thinking and discerning that for me were like putting on jogging clothes made of steel and yet reads like worrysome commonsense. Funny, quirky, irreverent and sometimes downright snobbish."
75,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,5,"This book is misleadingly titled  - it should be called Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking like Daniel Dennett. But no harm done.Having previously only heard of Daniel Dennett in context of his status as one of the four horsemen of the New Atheism movement, I picked up this book from Kinokuniya blind - expecting it to be a general sort of empirically-minded self-improvement book for honing your thinking techniques. Instead, I got a thinly-veiled overview of Dennett's various philosophical positions over meaning, consciousness, complexity, and free will, which are explained using such thinking tools as Dennett recommends that the reader cultivate. The subtext being that if the reader were only to apply the correct thinking tools, she would naturally reach the same, or similar, conclusions, that Dennett has.The central thinking tool in the box is really the intuition pump, a kind of thinking experiment cunningly worded and framed to get the reader to come to a desired conclusion by appealing to his or her intuitions. The term was coined by Dennett and many examples are prominently featured in this book, given such whimsically memorable names as the Curse of the Cauliflower and the Zombic Hunch. A famous example of an intuition pump (and one Dennett savages) is the Chinese Room experiment - in which one imagines a man using a set of algorithmic translation rules to translate Chinese questions into English in order to answer them. However, at no point in this process does the man actually understand the inputs - he merely acts upon them based on a set of instructions. The point of this thought experiment is to pump the intuition that - like the man in the Chinese room - computers that use algorithms to process data do not truly understand them - ergo, consciousness (i.e. understanding) cannot arise out of a set of algorithms designed to simulate its functions.The intuition pump is really a double edged sword, however, and can be used to both illuminate and mislead. This is because intuition pumps are by their very nature abstractions of philosophical problems - they simplify conditions to make it easier to think about a thing - and in some cases, to think about a thing the way the creator intended. Dennett tells us to interrogate intuition pumps by turning the knobs - in other words, changing some of the conditions or assumptions of the intuition pump and seeing if the same intuitions are pumped out. Even as Dennett presents his own intuition pumps, he also deconstructs pumps that have been devised by others. He calls misleading intuition pumps boom crutches, deliberately malappriopriating (see what I did there?) the nautical term for these anti-thinking tools that are designed to shut down thinking.Ultimately, however, after a few short chapters laying out his toolbox, Dennett begins the methodical quest of introducing the reader to his brand of philosophical thought. Dennett's positions on various matters - cognition, free will, consciousness - can be boiled down to the idea that these ideas - held by some philosophers to reside in the sacred space of epistemological inscrutability- can actually be explained with a mundane scientific approach. The hard questions are procedurally hard - but not unsolvable using scientific inquiry. In plain language, it simply means that things like consciousness or free will can be explained or described in the framework of material reality, and there is no need to posit some imagined higher substrate of reality - such as positing that consciousness manifests beyond the physical mind - in order to understand such phenomena.It's hard to distill Dennett's ideas into one paragraph, but an example of this approach is Dennett's deconstruction of the Chinese Room. That thought experiment holds that consciousness cannot manifest out of algorithms, which are ostensibly what the mind, in Dennett's model of cognition, uses - i.e. strong, conscious AI is not possible. Dennett's dictum, on the other hand, is that software, sufficiently advanced (and operating on a sufficiently complex hardware stratum like the brain), approximates consciousness to such a level of fidelity that it is indistinguishable from consciousness, and in fact, is consciousness, and in actual fact is precisely what consciousness is in reality.Think about the idea of the philosophical zombie - a being that acts and talks so like a human being that it is indistinguishable from one, except that it has no internal world, no consciousness - and elevate it to the idea of the zimboe - another philosophical creature that simulates second-order beliefs that it is a conscious thinking being, when it actually isn't. A zimboe looks, acts, and feels - or thinks it feels - like a real human being - but it doesn't actually think anything. Dennett's argument is that the zimboe is the logical outcropping of the idea that there can be p-zombies that approximate human complexity, but at that level of fidelity it would be impossible for a zimboe to be distinguished from a human being, by any means. Rather than posit some ethereal essence of consciousness, Dennett argues, why not just eliminate the need for that as-yet-undiscovered substrate and go straight to the Occam's-Razor solution - that the zimboe concept is incoherent because a sufficiently complex bundle of computational processes - i.e. the zimboe - already possesses, by dint of its mental complexity, consciousness?Back to the Chinese Room - Dennett's point is that the flaw of the intuition pump is that it doesn't specify how complex the algorithms operated upon by the man must be to make it so that the questioners who are asking the questions in Chinese are satisfied that the answers they get are from a thinking entity. Dennett's intuition is that they would have to be astoundingly complex - more complex than would be possible for one man and a pencil to analyse in any reasonable time horizon. As such, the Chinese Room thought experiment is bust because it fails to account for the possibility that the set of algorithmic instructions would only be physically possible to operationalise on a substrate capable enough to elevate it to a level in which it could be described to ""understand"" its instructions - which could approximate something like consciousness.Dennett applies this same set of thinking tools to different fields - thinking about meaning, evolution, free will. In each case Dennett purports to banish the veil of mysticism that some drape over seemingly intractable problems, and shows that they are really resolvable with the application of tried-and-true thinking methods. Another interesting example is Dennett's stance on free will. Dennett is really a compatibilist - he holds that free will is compatible with determinism. How? Simple - the kind of philosophically ideal free will that some imagine we must possess to rightly be called free is an incoherent concept. Barring quantum indeterminacy, at some level the rules of physics determine the course of the universe - that is determinism. However, reality is so complex that the kind of ""free will"" some would characterise as being required to be truly free is not required to make meaningful decisions. Dennett characterises the difference as being between a sufficiently advanced pseudo-random number generator (one that generates a random list of numbers using a series of step by step algorithms) and a ""true"" random number generator. Sufficiently advanced, there is no compelling reason to choose the latter, unless you plan to play chess with an omniscient God that can predict your every move. But who needs, or wants, that kind of ideal freedom? Free will is not a binary - it is a spectrum, and what free will we have is sufficient for our purposes down to the subatomic level.I've gone off on a bit of a tangent here - but I should be somewhat embarrassed to admit that Dennett gives voice to some of my own intuitions about mind, consciousness, and free will. I find myself agreeing with him to a very large and almost embarrassing extent. Far from being accused of being overly impressionistic, however, I should caveat that the irony of my reading experience of Dennett's tome is that I didn't glean my philosophical insights from his intuition pumps, but really from how my own intuitions corroborated with his conclusions. Dennett, here, was in effect preaching to the choir. And even more ironic was that I came away with a sneaking suspicion that his intuition pumps were simply not especially effective in conveying the point in  a watertight manner. But I suppose that is a suspicion that fosters itself. Intuition pumps are by nature unwieldy thinking tools - ripe for abuse or misuse, abstracted in ways that cloud judgment, with too many hypotheticals and variables. Are Dennett's own pumps immune to this kind of thing? Probably not. He has an easier job of it though - his positions are fundamentally more parsimonious - after all, he is arguing from the standpoint of ""possibility"" - which requires less epistemological certainty than to declare a thing ""impossible"". It is possible to conceive of consciousness, evolution and free will in terms of physical laws, and this is how it is possible to conceive of them. They may be the wrong models - perhaps consciousness does exist as a floaty-substrate, by Dennett's own admission. But Dennett doesn't have to show that his model is correct - he just has to show that it is possible to think of them as being grounded in empirics. His critics often have to show that a thing is impossible to characterize in terms of physical reality - which requires some boom crutch-y sleight of hand and other such mental breakdancing. It is impossible that consciousness is rooted in the physical world - here is inductive proof in the form of a hypothetical! Forgive me if I don't find that particularly convincing.But I ramble. Dennett's book can describe all these jumbled thoughts better than I can. Go read it, regardless of your metaphysical inclinations. I think you'll probably get something out of it. At the very least, the chance to turn some of Dennett's knobs at his invitation.I give this book: 4.5 out of 5 Sphexes"
76,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92557747-fi,3,"Not going to lie, this had been a slow read for me. The main reason is the brief misalignment of expectation at the beginning. When I saw ""over 70 tools to help you think better"", the image of a list of bite-size fun facts came to mind. Certainly it was not going to be.Daniel C Dennett is one of the most active, serious, provocative and original philosophers in the English speaking world today. So no, his work is not child's play. In Intuition Pumps, he introduced a range of thought experiments, then gradually piled on new and more complex layers. Some were for supporting his views in topics like Thinking and Meaning; some were used to confront other thinkers on topics such as Religion and Free Will.I paused many many times to break down the ideas, to try to understand and to apply them in my world. How can I find holes in which argument at what time... And it had proven to be very difficult. What I did, therefore, like a school girl, was to memorize the gist of the 77 ideas, hoping I can retrieve and use them some day. I am sure that's not how this book should be read.Part IX ""What is it like to be a Philosopher?"" is my favourite. Liking something, appreciating and studying something is completely different from actually making, doing and living it. And he quoted psychologist David Hebb's rule when he discussed where a philosopher should focus his/her energy:“If it isn’t worth doing, it isn’t worth doing well.”I think this applies to every facet of life.You should read it if▫️You want to learn a set of tools that can improve your critical thinking skills▫️You want an intro on topics like consciousness, meaning, free will, evolution & AI▫️You want an intro on Dennett's view on the above, with high conviction"
77,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2704424-nick-klagge,3,"A very interesting book, but one that I think is not quite sure what it wants to be (to take the ""intentional stance"").Dennett is a philosopher who I know about mostly through his work with Doug Hofstadter, a writer who I really like (""Godel Escher Bach,"" ""Surfaces and Essences""). They have quite similar outlooks, I think--a multidisciplinary approach that takes an interest in what fields like computer science and evolutionary biology can tell us about the nature of the mind, consciousness, and free will.The publisher describes the book as ""offer[ing] seventy-seven of Dennett's most successful 'imagination-extenders and focus-holders' meant to guide you through some of life's most treacherous subject matter: evolution, meaning, mind, and free will."" I think this captures the ambiguity of the book: is it about the tools (the eponymous pumps), or about the subject matter? Dennett would certainly call my question out as an example of ""rathering"" (presentation of a false dichotomy), but I guess my feeling is that the book puts enough focus on each that there is not a fully satisfactory treatment of either. Perhaps the book best serves as entree to Dennett's work--which I think it did well for me.I ended up most interested in his assertions about free will. I have read enough of Hofstadter to be more or less already on board with his (their) views on evolution and consciousness, such as the rejection of the conclusion of Searle's ""Chinese room"" thought experiment. But his views on free will (briefly, that it is compatible with a deterministic universe) are new to me and feel like they are legitimate but also feel like they will take some time to wrap my head around--and the book wasn't long enough for a sufficient treatment.For me, the best intuition that came out of the book is as follows: many philosophical arguments are ultimately ""arguments from incredulity"" (the Chinese room, Jackson's ""What Mary Didn't Know""), and that this is not a trustworthy form of argument. In particular, human intuition is very poorly equipped to handle scales out of the bounds of our normal experience. In each of the examples I gave above, Dennett talks about the crucial role that ""lack of imagination"" plays--Searle's experiment plays down the extreme complexity and multi-layeredness of what would have to be going on by talking about ""scraps of paper,"" and Jackson's argument relies on our inability to understand what it would really mean to acquire ""all possible observational information about visual processing of color."" For Dennett, asking if we can conceive of something is a deceptively difficult challenge--it seems like a question you should be able to answer by simple introspection, but really it requires a lot of work and thinking-tools. If you say you ""can't conceive of"" something, Dennett is likely to say that you aren't working hard enough at it. In the book, Dennett spends a great deal of time talking about Borges' ""Library of Babel,"" and working through different ways of thinking about exactly what type of entity it implies--it's not enough to ""glom together"" the concepts of ""library"" and ""really big,"" because the scale is so far beyond our direct experience of ""big"" that it is really something else altogether.This is why Dennett and Hofstadter get so much mileage out of issues surrounding computing. In a sense, computing operates at scales that are ""inconceivable"" to humans, but on the other hand, it is something that his readers are intimately familiar with. It is this cognitive dissonance that ends up being philosophically productive. It seems ""inconceivable"" to us that a Turing machine made of squares of toilet paper and rocks could, given enough time, run ""Grand Theft Auto,"" but we can also intellectually understand that that is in fact the case."
78,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62274863-phoenix,4,"Danny's Wonderful Tool BoxProfessor and philosopher Dennett starts off with the wonderful project of describing a set of techniques for productive reasoning in philosophy, and presumably in other fields as well. Calling them ""intuition pumps"", they are what physicists ""gedanken"" (thought) experiments which can be tweaked by changing a limited number parameters which Dennet likens to twisting a few ""knobs"". The opposite of a pump is called a ""boom crutch"", which are analogies to be avoided. Intuition pumps can move us forward, boom crutches leave us spinning in circles. In order to keep it simple he disciplined his material by giving it in the form of a course to a group of first year university students, so we are essentially his second class.The project starts off very well. The first section covers about a dozen different concepts such as the value of Trial and Error (fail rapidly and learn from mistakes), Reductio ad Absurdum, Anatol Rapoport's rules for successful criticism, Sturgeon's Law (90% of everything is crap ), joosting (look at problems by ""jumping out of the system"", ie: what would happen if one abandoned phlogiston, or what would a Martian think of this problem), rathering (sliding past a false dichotomy), answering rhetorical questions as the answer may surprise, Occam's Razor, Occam's Broom (watch out for sweeping inconsistencies under the rug), the ""sorta"" operator ( a recommendation against using unnecessary precision) and my favourite, deepidity - a child's neologism for ideas that sound deep (""love"" is just a word) but either is or is not. Dennet seems to approach it as a boom crutch, akin to stupidity, but maybe it can be productive of ideas as well.He then continues with several illustrating scenarios, many of which have to do with the nature of consciousness, for example contrasting the inner and outer reality of what we see, and what do we mean when we ascribe purpose to animals (sphexishness), systems and inanimate objects. Quite a few discussions centre around zombies, robots, replicants and Chinese rooms - if they pass as humans should we truly say that they have an inner life.However the project suddenly runs off the rails about 100 pages in with a 50 page discussion of Turing machines (which, if you've had it before, he invites you to skip) where he urges the reader to hand simulate a computation. How very 80s! Later on even Conway's Game of Life reappears. This is old material that doesn't tell us much about thought and could have been summarized in much less time. And then he does it again in with longer segments on Borges Infinite Library, comparing it to DNA and then evolution. All very nice but it's like listening to your favorite uncle droning on about the old country and not really why we've come to the party.So while promising at first, it does disappoint by being a bit long winded. There are some good nuggets here and there such as the impossible metaphor of a sky hook, the parable of analyzing the behaviour of black boxes, the role of knowledge in fairness of lotteries where the winning ticket is decided before or after the tickets have been sold and ""qualias"" - emotional gestalts associated with colours or objects; tidbits as to why locust population explosions favour prime number intervals and the quasi-myth of ""sphexishness"".In summary, it's good at the beginning and beats the averages of Sturgeon's Law, don't be afraid to judiciously skim. A fine toothed rating for me would be 3.7, but of course your mileage may vary."

At that time, I didn't bother to buy the book, but when a friend said that she bought a copy, I was interested to borrow it and read it to know why that professor really liked this book.My first (and consistent) impression is that if I knew Dennett in real life, we wouldn't go along. We have a very different approach to the way we communicate that I Did Not Understand Most of His Points. The impatient me two months ago, while reading this book, would be furious and think that he was a prime example of male ego who liked to namedrop and mumble about things people don't understand just to sound smart. Today, I give him benefit of the doubt.Listen, I might be dumb, but that doesn't mean I can't learn. I was not a bright student in the Physics class when I was in high school, but I understood Stephen Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" because Hawking is a great communicator and he must've gone a long way to ensuring readers understand what he wrote. Dennett has a very different way of communicating. Example: he never gives a definition of what he discusses, so for those of you who are new to philosophy, good luck guessing what determinism is and why he writes several chapters about examples on compatibilism (the view that determinism and free will might be compatible, not contradictory) before explicitly writing that he is a compatibilist (and even so he doesn't explain what it is. I was lucky because I knew the topics he discusses beforehand).One of the materials that bothers me so much is when he thinks it's mindboggling if a human is unknowingly put into another planet that resembles Earth in every aspect except the way they call a horse. He then questions: so, if she sees an animal resembling horse on that planet but is not a horse, is it actually a horse?This is absolutely ridiculous to me. I think he could've discussed it from philosophy of language point of view, given, you know, that language is social construct so nothing is actually a word? Language is a consensus so if that woman sees a horse-like specimen but is not called a horse.... it's not a horse because the communities don't agree that it's called a horse? I'm so confused as to what kind of critical thinking he intends to arouse here.Don't get me started with the whole chapters about computers either. They were insufferable. I only understood several bits but I didn't get the whole gist (I asked myself ""so what?"" so often).One thing that drove me to not give a complete 1 star rating is his analysis on free will and determinism, and he successfully distinguishes the determinism question from moral responsibility inquiry. Perhaps that was the only new thing I learned from reading the book aside from thinking ""Yep I've known this before"" or ""What the hell does this even mean?""(edit: rating down from 3 to 2 because apparently 3 means ""liked it"" and I did not like it so...)"
80,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16074924-dan-smith,3,"This book missells itself, and has its flaws, but it's worth reading if only to encourage the reader to turn a critical eye on Dennett's own arguments.Let's get one thing out of the way, an Intuition Pump is a thought experiment as far as I can see, and giving it another label (something Dennett's denigrates in other thought experiments - see his relabelling of Mr Puppet as Captain Autonomy) changes nothing other than the rhetoric. It's all a case of My Pump Pumps Harder Than Yours, and it's a bit cheap.And another thing: this in no way contains ""70 ways to make you think better"". A few generic philosophical tools at the start are fine, but the rest are specific thought experiments to prove or disprove a point, or deconstructions of another philosopher's argument. It's a quality set of disparate points, coalescing around meaning, evolution, free will and consciousness.There's a lot of begging the question going on here - the Puppet / Autonomy label a case in point: Dennett correctly identifies the unsubtle characterisation of a person in a free-will thought experiment, but then seeks to prove his case by doing just the same. His central thesis is also curiously void at heart: I get his analysis of ever more complex ""thinking"" machines and how they could be equated to our own brains, with comparable levels of thought. But all it does is set up a comparison: why make the jump and say they must be the same? Why does this tell us anything about what consciousness is? It might do, but it can't get further than saying ""I've shown you a similar system, a computer, which has the same theoretical structure as your brain. We can't see the consciousness in my example, so... you see...? *pump pump* There! I have explained consciousness!""The thing is, I get everything he says and I sorta (to borrow his convenient fuzzy phrase) agree. But I end up not thinking he's really solved anything.He also has a frustrating habit of falling into the same rhetorical tricks as ones he painstakingly and smugly criticises others for using. For example, he spends a while constructing and example of humans constructing robots to house their cryogenic bodies, giving those robots instructions and degrees of autonomy. Fun. He then declares ""but what I have shown you is no different to genes using our bodies to replicate!"" Really? I see some parallels, and they're sorta similar, but so?It's like trying to nail down jelly. Yes, I see what you've shown me, but every time you get close to a key issue, you sorta wobble, sorta allow the nail in, and then sorta ignore it.This may be the key problem with all this sorta comparisons and thought experiments. If you're minded to agree, you see the example and agree with it. If you disagree, you'll either pick it apart (if you can) or say that it's all. All well as far as it goes but it doesn't *prove* the point.I did like his ""anything you can do, I can do meta. I can do many thing meta than you"" line. Alas, this only inspired me to think of e whole thing as this: A Metaphor? Yes, fine, but what's a meta *for*?"
81,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30039874-ap,3,"I did not finish this book (read about 2/3).Interesting, but I could do with a condensed version. I don't feel like I missed the main gist, but the details were not absorbed. It is well written, and if I had followed it and finished it, I probably would rate it higher.The book is about thinking about how we think, and tools that we can use to help (or also boomcrutches, which hinder) those processes.I got lost at the end of Part I, when it got super computery. The evolution discussions of Part II were interesting, but I got lost in that, too, before it finished. In the final part, I was lost from the get-go. The main points I have so far- Break assumptions and logics down to their most basic components, to find flaws or inconsistencies.- Making mistakes is the best way to learn. Embrace it.- Everything is dependent on context. There is no hidden or deeper meanings to things.- The original intention of nearly everything is survival.- Be aware of your emotional attachments to ideas.Some useful tools: - be fair, point out pros and cons of others work, demonstrate what you learned from it before you criticize it. - don't waste time critiquing mediocrity. - simple is best. - know the system so you can step outside of it to subvert it. - remember that brains can have little in common, but still have similar intentions. Even similar intentions will use data very differently. - There is no common structure in the huamn brain that funnels in ""meaning."" Good points in the book: - Meaning is not inherent or tangible. It is stored in the brain, but not like data.  - Folk psychology - the most important patterns in our images -- gives us a foundation to interpret the word around us. It is culturally dependent, not genetic. It is the way we tend to pattern and interpret, based on how others around us do it. - There is no wonder tissue in our brains -- stop looking for top-down approaches to explain humans, consciousness, etc. We are not magical miracles. We are bottom-up, mechanical processes that internetwork in growing webs of complexity to create the people and cultures around us. - Evolution challenges the top-down approach, with unintelligent, aimless design (bent only on survival).Some boomcrutches: - inconvenient facts are conveniently swept away/ignored. - using false dichotomies to make it seem like there are only two alternatives. - set up exagerated strawman of someone's argument, then refute that as if it was their real argument. - subtle inclusion of irrelevent things to weaken their argument. - using words or phrases that sound deep but are vague or trivial. - be wary when someone uses the word ""surely"" or asks a rhetorical question in their argument."
82,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11254454-arensb,4,"An intuition pump, in Dennett's sense, is an analogy or metaphor that helps us to think about a harder problem.For instance imagine a whimsical jailer who goes around while the prisoners are asleep, and unlocks all the doors and leaves them that way for a few hours. Are the prisoners free to escape? The idea is not so much to answer this particular question, but to play with it and use it to help us analyze a more complex problem.In Intuition Pumps, Dennett introduces several dozen such intuition pumps and other mental tools, as well as some pitfalls (e.g., the seductive analogy that misleads us into accepting the wrong conclusion), forming a good introduction to philosophy for the interested amateur.He does concentrate on three areas: evolution, consciousness, and free will. Make of this what you will: he might be flogging his personal interests, or he might just be trying to avoid mistakes by presenting students with examples from the areas he knows best. I tend to lean toward the latter, but if you're bored silly by the very idea of discussions on free will, you may want to just skip Chapter VIII.All in all, this book is a good and lucid introduction to philosophy, including why it matters, and why even lay people can and should engage in it: when done correctly, and not just as an exercise in navel-gazing with five-dollar words, it's basically a way of thinking straight, and avoid reasoning errors.ETA: The section on computing and Turing machines is at best inaccurate and at worst misleading. The central message, that modern computers don't do anything that a Turing machine couldn't do, is correct. Yes, virtual machines are a real, and even useful, thing. And yes, a Turing machine can run a virtual version of your desktop PC and do everything it does, albeit at a ridiculously low speed.I think Dennett confuses virtualization with abstraction. Virtualization is the process of making one computer behave like another one. For instance, if you wanted to play your old Apple II games, you could set up a virtual Apple II on your desktop PC. That is, a program on your PC would pretend to be an Apple II, so that that virtual Apple II could run your old games.Abstraction, on the other hand, is, roughly, the process of hiding the low-level details from the programmer, who can ignore the small stuff and get on with making the program do what she really wants. As time goes on, more and more things are considered low-level.To hear Dennett explain it, though, you might think that programmers pile virtual machine upon virtual machine, rather than abstraction upon abstraction."
83,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10974082-christine,2,"Finished! Let me show you what I learned from this book. Take the sentence, ""I finished it."" In this sentence, finished is defined as ""I visually examined each page, including preface, introduction, and appendix but excluding sources, bibliography, and the majority of the index."" Note that there is nothing in this definition about comprehension, or understanding. That is because for one definition of ""finished"" (the definition I have chosen to use in this book review), the focus is on completion without concerns about understanding, knowledge, or the ability to disseminate the information received to others of similar (or any) level of knowledge. With me so far? Yes? I'm impressed. No? That's about how I felt for this entire book. Originally I purchased this book on a whim because I loved the phrase ""intuition pumps"" and thought it would have helpful tools for more articulate discussions in debates. And it does, but only if you're a philosopher. Dennett writes about philosophical debates on the nature of consciousness, free will, and meaning but with examples so abstract and metaphysical they'd be almost impossible to use in a conversation with laymen. That's not a bad thing, but judging from this book there's a huge gap between an interested layman and the entry level philosophy student this book is aimed at. I thought I was a reasonably well educated layman. I thought I would be able to make the stretch to entry level student. I could not. There were still a great many things I enjoyed. The concept of intuition pumps (61), the discussion of Occam's Razor(38) and Occam's Broom(40), Boom Crutches(48), learning about register machines(109). Although I still don't understand how a register machine could be useful as a thinking tool, unless maybe it's to internalize the process of reducing a particular activity down to its most basic operations to see if you could get a simple machine (or a cascade of simple machines) to perform the same job, without understanding it or even knowing what they are doing? Dennet holds that often what we assume is irreducible complexity could actually be performed (albeit more slowly) by sufficient layers of the most basic computers (loosely paraphrased from p 139). That's an interesting, terrifying idea. Terrifying because now I can't argue that we aren't all zombies, or robots. This book left me with more questions than answers, and more confusion than when I started reading it. I guess that's a good thing? I don't regret reading it, but only now that it's over. "
84,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,3,"Dennett enumerates some ``tools for thinking'', elaborates on some intuition pumps (a term he coined in 1980 which I guess is legitimate), explains why some apparent intuition pumps are counterproductive (and are instead what he calls ``boom crutches''), and applies the whole thing, inevitably, to philosophy of the mind.If Dennett's book broadly fall into two categories—moderately compelling pop sci that's basically solid but just wrong enough to annoy every reader in at least one way (Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Breaking the Spell), and intensely boring philosophy wank (Consciousness Explained, most of the rest)—Intuition Pumps &c. straddles the boundary. Parts of it are fair enough, but a lot of it is given over to tedious bullshit, a lot of which exemplifies why I feel philosophers are a waste of space: almost all of the thought experiments he finds so daunting turn out to be meaningless or trivial, and though career philosophers can arguably be forgiven for failing to recognise a thought experiment as meaningless (philosophy departments wouldn't exist if they couldn't), failing to recognise trivial ones is prety damned embarrassing for someone who's made this sort of thing his career for literally almost twice as long as I've existed.†Also, his position on free will is still basically wrong-headed, though it isn't more so than most things that have been written on the subject. He's clearly approaching a more sensible position, but at the pace he's going he'll be dead before he gets there.That said, the bits that are fair enough are, indeed, fair enough, and he manages to pull off aspects on which I expected a much worse performance (there's an entire set of chapters on computers and AI (proper CS AI, not philosophy AI), for example) surprisingly well. If every philosopher were only as bad as Dan Dennett, I wouldn't be nearly as bitter about their existence.(I also really appreciate that Gould is brought up as three instances of doing it wrong. Too many people Americans hold him in high regard, and it needs to stop.)---† I don't intend to stoop to their level and get into particulars here; most people who read my reviews know me well enough that I hope they'll give me some credit and accept that I'm not likely to be full of shit. If you end up reading Intuition Pumps and want to discuss any of it, feel free to contact me."
85,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11446002-dan,4,"Daniel Dennett is so committed to approachable philosophy one of his primary pillars is the use of interested laypeople as ""decoys"" in philisophical debate, so that philosophers are forced to explain their assumptions and the parameters of their ideas more rigorously. Consequently, his book is quite approachable to interested folks outside of philosophy.Dennett is also among the ""Four Horsemen of New Atheism"" so if that's going to irritate the hell out of you, definitely give this book a pass.I'll see if any of the thinking tools Dennett prescribes prove useful to me, and adjust to a 3 star or 5 star accordingly, if warranted. Initially, I think they will be useful. Taken together, the tools tend to emphasize the practical application over theoretical purity. Dennett very quickly gives up on/dismisses some of the big questions that excite people, such as ""Why is there something rather than nothing?"" (which he calls a pseudo-problem unworthy of inquiry). Philosophical ""qualia"" and ""zombies"" also get heaps of scorn from him. For him, the notion of ""free will"" that is used in courts should be enough for us: people never act independently from their context, but usually act with enough autonomy to be held accountable for those actions.Emblematic of his reliance on working-definitions and practical application is his repeated (sometimes tiresomely) use of the adjective ""sorta"". To him, getting into definitional arguments about the absolute limits of self, freedom, word definitions almost instantly become trivial as they search for fine distinctions that simply don't exist. Instead, just say someone is ""sorta"" thinking or ""sorta"" independent and move on.Finally, Dennett overflows with enthusiasm for both the evolutionary model and for computing. The evolutionary section of the book seemed useful and central to his main points but the extensive chapters on computing, including workbook-style programming problems to solve in a simple, theoretical model of a computer perplexed me. They seemed long and indulgent and I kept waiting for them to become relevant to the rest of the book. I never felt like they did.Overall, a worthwhile read, so long as I can remember some of his pumps and the ideas I had in response to them."

If you have some patience, you'll finish with clearer ways to examine and express your own thoughts -- or, at least, that's how I felt.There are some admittedly shocking jumps in difficulty. More than once I found myself, after twenty pages of lucid explanations, coming across a paragraph I had to read five times just to make certain I had understood it... and even then I wouldn't have bet money on it. This is the kind of book that will make you feel confident one moment and absurdly out of your depth the next. When you're jumping from physics, biology, computer science and cognitive psychology, that may just be the nature of the beast, but it fortunately never feels as though Dennett is being an obscurantist. He values lucidity, and by the end of this thing I was grateful.Dennett manages to glide from one mind-bending mystery to another and address each with wit, clarity, and frightening intelligence. It's impressive that a man so fiercely bright can keep his work from being too intimidating: his tone is that of a kindly uncle, guiding you with patience through some of the most difficult conundrums your brain can handle.While this was sometimes dense to the point that it hurt my head, if you find any of the topics interesting you'll be missing out on a feast for your brain if you don't give Intuition Pumps a shot."
87,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,3,"On the back of a very uninspiring month, following two really inspired months, I wanted a book that might reliably be jumper cables for my brain. A collection of thought experiments and ways of thinking to think about thinking, seemed beyond perfect. It wasn’t. It did get me thinking about why it wasn’t though. What are the qualities of something that is thought-provoking? At one extreme, I might argue everything and nothing is thought provoking, and all provocation is in the thought of the thinker. I’m uninspired in general, this didn’t inspire me. I was inspired in general, everything inspired me, especially the James Gleick books. At the other extreme, I have no role, and the content has objective thought-provoking qualities. If this is even partially true, where do those qualities lie? I was provoked by very few of these intuition pumps, some were novel thought experiments that I haven’t come across before. Some were literal about the knobs available to be turned one by one to reveal the underlying dependence of the pump. Some revealed that I might just have a bias against the phrasing, intuition pump, exemplified by the use in this unfortunate sentence ‘engage in mutual intuition pumping’. Mostly I was underwhelmed by my experience. It didn’t get me ‘thinking elegantly about hard questions’, as much as it told me how Daniel Dennett thinks elegantly about hard questions, with most chapters seeming to me how Frank Johnson’s colorblind Mary thought experiment seemed to DD, an answer writ large on the front of the envelope, having nothing to open up and discover, because it’s anyway just an empty envelope. It’s interesting to consider the strong possibility that, having pointed this out in Frank Johnson’s experiment, DD took immense pains not to fall into the same trap of experiment construction, placing most of the resultant emptiness squarely on the shoulders of dumb readers like myself. I’ll have more evidence once I go back to another James Gleick book immediately and compare my mental processes. NotesWhat separates ignorance from willful subterfuge? Take the chapter on Gould, and his use of ‘rathering’ to create false dichotomies. I find myself doing that all the time, not because I’m trying to fabricate polarization, but because I haven’t realized that the apparent dichotomy collapses under many subtle conditions. Rapaport Laws: How to criticize an idea. First rephrase it in a way that the other person appreciates as complete and accurate yet new. Then point out agreements. Then point out things you can borrow to make your own idea stronger. Only then criticize. Occam’s Broom: Only experts can figure out what evidence has been left out, as opposed to what’s been presented. That’s why conspiracy theories are so compelling, sweeping all inconvenient data under the carpet, where normal people won’t spot the omissions. Sturgeon’s Law: 90% of everything is garbage. Criticizing something for being bad is a terrible idea, because 90% of everything is bad. Focus on what’s good. Rathering: Create false dichotomies saying evolution does not proceed by X, rather by Y, when in case these 2 are not mutually exclusive, while you make it sound that wayPeople use ‘surely’ at the edge of their knowledge, or things they take for granted and are hoping you do too.Is understanding your psychology like the comments that coders put on source code, meant to understand the code but not at all affecting how the computer reads and executes it.‘Slippery Slope’ is often just a moat disguised as slippery slope. The line between two opposites is often thin, that makes us uncomfortable, so we create a buffer zone around it, razor wire, moat, and say the first foot into that buffer zone leads to a slippery slope. ‘Spontaneous intrusion’ the effect that we have, smells, shadows, weights etc that a virtual rendition has to meticulously add after creating our basic shapes. Nonfunctional noise, shed dust, leave wake, causes vibrations etc. Why do we need this when creating AI? Collisions induce creativityMemes needn’t increase fitness of host.

B: select winner, sell tickets. Have I sold losing tickets purposely? Ultimately they are the same thing, as long as I don’t know which is winner, every person has an equal chance of winning? True statements from history that cannot be proved, like Caesar thought of salad on June 1st. Godel? Similarly, must be true that Sherlock has or has not a mole on shoulder, but can’t be proved. Faustian bargains: 1) Solve problem once and for all laying it to rest, or complex work that will be debated for long time? Scientists pick A, Philosophers picked B. 2) Uncontroversial right thing, like Calculus/DNA Helix (Crick, but Linus P would’ve got there too), or very controversial hotly-discussed mostly wrong thing like Lamarck, Cartesian duality etc. Chomsky’s syntactical structures, while mostly wrong, birthed many descendent correct theories that have nothing to do with it, like hummingbird having nothing to do with dinosaurs. Was Chomsky wrong?Sophisticated naive auto-anthropology: start with axioms of folk beliefs held by me known to be false, try to resolve contradictions (like siphons, pipettes etc).

Leaves cricket on threshold, goes in checks burrow, comes back out and drags it in. If the cricket is moved a little by malevolent biologist, it will bring it back to threshold, go back in and check burrow again. Does this over and over, never remembering that it has already checked the burrow. Later found that many don't, it's not some universal phenomena. Still, interesting parallels to be found. "
88,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/445677-scott,5,"At this point, it has been nearly 25 years since I read Douglas Hofstadter and Daniel Dennett's anthology, ""The Mind's I,"" as part of a philosophy class on artificial intelligence at the University of Pittsburgh. One of the most-enduring essays in that volume was Dennett's ""Where am I?"", a tour-de-force of a thought experiment that became a cultural referent, the ""brain in a vat"" controlling a body containing a substitute brain via radio waves. Dennett would refer to such a construction as an ""intuition pump,"" a contrived situation created to test the reader's thoughts and assumptions about an idea. Each of his ""intuition pumps"" has ""knobs,"" or circumstances and details, that can be adjusted and changed so that the reader can explore the idea as much (or, as little) as desired. This volume collects many of Dennett's best intuition pumps from across his long and fruitful career as a philosopher. Often Dennett's exposition is new, and his writing is remarkably free from undue resorts to the sophisticated/abstruse language of academic philosophy. However, the simplicity and clarity of his writing to the lay person does not detract from the deep exploration of ideas on what it means to know something, can a computer be intelligent and think like us, the difficulties people have conceiving of evolution, and why evolution makes sense, what it means to be conscious, and do we ultimately have free will (and does it matter?). He also concludes with a few brief notes about the practice of philosophy, and encouragement (and cautionary tales) for those who might consider a career in the field.The intuition pumps presented are brief; many can be easily read in under 30 minutes time. However, each one of them can be re-read and explored in considerable detail, and many academic careers have been fruitfully spent working through the implications of these topics, attempting to find challenges and refutations to and support for these arguments. Highly recommended for all who have an interest in thinking about thinking and have at least a casual curiosity about philosophy."
89,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82933807-donald-thomann,3,"Intuition Pumps does what it claims to do in the title: Give you a number of thinking tools that you can apply across a wide variety of topics. It falls short, though, in two major ways, which really affected my enjoyment of the book overall compared to other books that in effect do the same thing. The first is that a lot of the chapters don't mix or follow one another particularly well, and at times this just comes off like a series of blog posts. As a result the whole thing feels pretty disjointed and without any kind of central, unifying theme. The sections break down roughly to logical philosophy, evolutionary biology, consciousness, etc. but the subject categories feel mostly artificial. Which brings me to the second, more important point...These are all fairly standard tools in any advanced thinker's tool kit, and invaluable tools to a noob like myself just beginning to dive into these topics. However, the tools seem so abstracted and disjointed that it becomes hard to understand how to apply them in real situations. Let's say you know very little about automobiles, carpentry and plumbing. If you entered a garage where all the tools required for these three professions were available to you, wall to wall, floor to ceiling, you'd have everything you needed to build some stuff. However, you wouldn't have the raw materials needed to actually build anything, nor would you have the knowledge of how to use the tools or apply them properly even if you did. That's how this book felt to me. It's too basic for advanced thinkers and too abstracted and removed from practical application to be useful to an amateur. Dennett throws you a bunch of nuts and bolts and wrenches and belt sanders and crimpers and clamps without giving you the instruction manual with the image of the final product and the exploded view. All that said, I think this would be a perfect read as a companion to more concrete reading material on any of these subjects, or as a massive textbook where each tool could be applied more extensively."
90,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39894105-nestor-leal,3,"This book title was a little misguiding. I like thought experiments which are called intuition pumps in here. Turns out only a few pages are dedicated to these thinking tools then they are applied to the concepts of consciousness, free will, determinism, evolution and the mind. I like to think and philosophize about these things too but the book should have been named otherwise. Some chapters are boring to people (like me) who already know binary code, assembler language and in general how computers work. On the other hand these chapters will help the untrained to learn how they work. At the end, understanding how computers work will help you understand how many things in nature are computer like, ie. our body cells.At times it seemed like this is a good philosophy companion book to The Selfish Gene which is mostly science. There are many references to Richard Dawkins’ work and even to the game theory used in his book. In fact, Dennett states that science and philosophy should go hand in hand, to which I agree, so it makes sense. I didn’t like the arrogant tone of Daniel Dennett and how the criticizes other philosophers. Still it is an ok book.I liked his idea of making good mistakes. Learning about our mistakes is always good for improvement. Mistakes, when understood correctly, help us advance even further. This is not new but mostly nobody likes to be pointed out their mistakes except when they accept and acknowledge this will greatly help them. Still it’s better to make big mistakes than stupid mistakes.Well, reading this book seemed like a good idea at the time!"

The author, a philosopher, uses the tools of philosophy to fill in the blanks about how we proceed with science.The book starts off by how we sometimes can be mislead by 'intuition pumps"", thought experiments, and how we should correctly use them. He sets up the listener in how to think about problems and then delves into some big problems, such as design within the universe and what does it mean, and what is consciousness and how to think about it.The author is a philosopher but is much more interested in understanding the scientific method as opposed to the meaning of words.I've listened to most of the science books audible has available and a book like this helps me see beyond just the science but also how to think about the science.This author had a theme throughout this whole book. That the start of all understanding first comes about by realizing the role of evolution in the design of all non-trivial systems.I will read more of this author's work. P.S. I did end up reading more of this author's work, and it made me disappointed in this book, because he copies most of this book from his other books.

92,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5078550-robert-bor,4,"Daniel Dennett's work is not usually within my range of interest. I find the abstract nature of philosophy and it sometimes outlandish discussions to be uninteresting. However, this work is surely an exception. It takes together two aspects which interest me a lot, computer programming and evolution theory. Meaning, consciousness and free will are attacked using various utilities (called intuition pumps) which help thinking about the problems. Useless utilities (called crutch booms) are systematically destroyed. Mr Dennett relentlessly works towards (stopping just short of saying it) showing how the human mind is a beautiful and well-designed (yes, design can be used again, although it is design-without-a-designer) series of systems that all take care of their own and together form complex, conscious, free-willing systems, such as our minds. Note that Mr Dennett nowhere says this is actually the case, but between the lines, this looks to be the winner he is betting on. Mr Dennett also uses this book both as a means to reinforce real or perceived victories against philosophical enemies. I don't really get those, but it's probably part of the in-crowd show."

If they were, we would've figured them out long ago. Daniel Dennett's book offers a plethora of Thinking Tools drawn from computer science, biology and many other realms which, like the apps on your phone, give you the power to do more things better - to think difficults thoughts more easily, and even tackle the most difficult questions about meaning and consciousness. It's designed to change your way of thinking and to nudge you out of some ultimately wrong intuitions you may hold. It is basically a summary of his life's work.I think Dennett's toolkit, which is made out of many thought experiments ('Intuition Pumps') and more, is extremely useful for any aspiring thinker, whether you agree with him or not."

Giant robot intuition pump addresses this question. - p166Excellent summary of theory of meaning on p197-198:""And what are the verdicts of this long section on meaning? A mixture of pessimism and optimism. Meaning isn't going to turn out to be a simple property that maps easily onto brains, and we're not going to find ""deeper"" facts anywhere that just settle the question of what a sentence, or a thought, or a belief really means. The best we can do–and it is quite good enough–is to find and anchor (apparently) best interpretations of all the physical-stance (and design-stance) data we have. If we can find one solution to a Quinian quandary about meaning, we have almost certainly found the solution–in the sense that we may be confident that no better solution lies undiscovered. As the two-bitser's move to Panama showed, meaning is always relative to a context of function, and there need be no original intentionality beyond the intentionality of our (sorta) selfish genes, which derive their sorta intentionality from the functional context of evolution by natural selection, instead of from an Intelligent Designer playing the role of our rich client ordering a giant robot. And the intuition pump about the two black boxes shows that the intentional stance, with all its tolerance of sorta beliefs and their ilk, is not optional if you want to understand and explain many of the causal regularities in the world.Our investigations into these issues are greatly enhanced, here in the twenty-first century, by the fact that, for the first time, we have ways of thinking rigorously and vigorously about mechanisms with trillions of moving parts–parts that work in unmysterious ways. Thanks to Turing, we can at least dimly see a path now, from brute uncomprehending matter (the physical stance) via a cascade of rearrangements (the design stance, and sorta meanings) to an appreciation of ourselves as paradigmatic believers, knowers, understanders (simplified by the intentional stance as intentional systems).""Darwin's theory of evolution unites meaning with matter: ""On one side, we have the world of our mods and their meanings [...] On the other side, we have galaxies ceaselessly wheeling, planets falling pointlessly into their orbits, lifeless chemical mechanisms doing what their physics ordains, all without purpose or reason.

102,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9310150-quiver,5,"Dennett courts controversy in a number of places by calling out his colleagues for being inaccurate or a little to lax with their methods of thought. His is also excessively wordy, to the point where I occasionally believed a short, single paragraph would get his idea across much better. I appreciate the examples and the historical anecdotes, though they really should have been optional whenever not directly crucial for transmitting the gist of the intuition pump.Despite all of the above, Dennet's book is trove of useful starting points. They really are starting points however: the intuition pumps are general tools that the reader needs to mull over, adopt and adapt, before slowly applying to life and academic thinking. And it's hard work, if you want to do it seriously—I've tried and it's paid off, a little. The main message is this: if you are interested in improving the sharpness of your mental edge, Dennett's book will indicate a few of the segments where you're being obtuse (dictionary meanings 1 and 3 intended). So the book won't even show you all the segments, let alone how to really sharpen them. But that's why you then go and read other books that will. It's always about climbing one rung at a time; Dennett's is an excellent rung. For that I recommend it to most people. Five stars."
103,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"In this book, Daniel Dennett covers a bit of everything he has studied: evolution / consciousness / free will / meaning / AI. I agree with another reviewer who says, ""reading this book is basically like reading Daniel Dennett in blog format."" Unlike the reviewer, I have less problem with it. Perhaps it's because I am more like a casual reader than a student in philosophy. Each intuition pump (thought experiment) discussed is relatively independent of each other, making the book friendly to a reader who reads in fragmented time. Dennett does not demonstrate ""turning all the knobs to examine a thought experiment"" in every chapter. But when he does the trick, it is often enjoyable and inspirational. To make use of this method myself, however, may require lots of practice. A few chapters I like the most and will probably re-read in the future: 	• Trapped in the Robot Control Room	• The Seven Secrets of Computer Power Revealed (on register machine) 	• Noise in the Virtual Hotel	• Mary the Color Scientist	• Dennet's intepreation of Conway's Game of Life	• The Boys from Brazil"

105,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,5,"This book is misleadingly titled  - it should be called Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking like Daniel Dennett. But no harm done.Having previously only heard of Daniel Dennett in context of his status as one of the four horsemen of the New Atheism movement, I picked up this book from Kinokuniya blind - expecting it to be a general sort of empirically-minded self-improvement book for honing your thinking techniques. Instead, I got a thinly-veiled overview of Dennett's various philosophical positions over meaning, consciousness, complexity, and free will, which are explained using such thinking tools as Dennett recommends that the reader cultivate. The subtext being that if the reader were only to apply the correct thinking tools, she would naturally reach the same, or similar, conclusions, that Dennett has.The central thinking tool in the box is really the intuition pump, a kind of thinking experiment cunningly worded and framed to get the reader to come to a desired conclusion by appealing to his or her intuitions. The term was coined by Dennett and many examples are prominently featured in this book, given such whimsically memorable names as the Curse of the Cauliflower and the Zombic Hunch. A famous example of an intuition pump (and one Dennett savages) is the Chinese Room experiment - in which one imagines a man using a set of algorithmic translation rules to translate Chinese questions into English in order to answer them. However, at no point in this process does the man actually understand the inputs - he merely acts upon them based on a set of instructions. The point of this thought experiment is to pump the intuition that - like the man in the Chinese room - computers that use algorithms to process data do not truly understand them - ergo, consciousness (i.e. understanding) cannot arise out of a set of algorithms designed to simulate its functions.The intuition pump is really a double edged sword, however, and can be used to both illuminate and mislead. This is because intuition pumps are by their very nature abstractions of philosophical problems - they simplify conditions to make it easier to think about a thing - and in some cases, to think about a thing the way the creator intended. Dennett tells us to interrogate intuition pumps by turning the knobs - in other words, changing some of the conditions or assumptions of the intuition pump and seeing if the same intuitions are pumped out. Even as Dennett presents his own intuition pumps, he also deconstructs pumps that have been devised by others. He calls misleading intuition pumps boom crutches, deliberately malappriopriating (see what I did there?) the nautical term for these anti-thinking tools that are designed to shut down thinking.Ultimately, however, after a few short chapters laying out his toolbox, Dennett begins the methodical quest of introducing the reader to his brand of philosophical thought. Dennett's positions on various matters - cognition, free will, consciousness - can be boiled down to the idea that these ideas - held by some philosophers to reside in the sacred space of epistemological inscrutability- can actually be explained with a mundane scientific approach. The hard questions are procedurally hard - but not unsolvable using scientific inquiry. In plain language, it simply means that things like consciousness or free will can be explained or described in the framework of material reality, and there is no need to posit some imagined higher substrate of reality - such as positing that consciousness manifests beyond the physical mind - in order to understand such phenomena.It's hard to distill Dennett's ideas into one paragraph, but an example of this approach is Dennett's deconstruction of the Chinese Room. That thought experiment holds that consciousness cannot manifest out of algorithms, which are ostensibly what the mind, in Dennett's model of cognition, uses - i.e. strong, conscious AI is not possible. Dennett's dictum, on the other hand, is that software, sufficiently advanced (and operating on a sufficiently complex hardware stratum like the brain), approximates consciousness to such a level of fidelity that it is indistinguishable from consciousness, and in fact, is consciousness, and in actual fact is precisely what consciousness is in reality.Think about the idea of the philosophical zombie - a being that acts and talks so like a human being that it is indistinguishable from one, except that it has no internal world, no consciousness - and elevate it to the idea of the zimboe - another philosophical creature that simulates second-order beliefs that it is a conscious thinking being, when it actually isn't. A zimboe looks, acts, and feels - or thinks it feels - like a real human being - but it doesn't actually think anything. Dennett's argument is that the zimboe is the logical outcropping of the idea that there can be p-zombies that approximate human complexity, but at that level of fidelity it would be impossible for a zimboe to be distinguished from a human being, by any means. Rather than posit some ethereal essence of consciousness, Dennett argues, why not just eliminate the need for that as-yet-undiscovered substrate and go straight to the Occam's-Razor solution - that the zimboe concept is incoherent because a sufficiently complex bundle of computational processes - i.e. the zimboe - already possesses, by dint of its mental complexity, consciousness?Back to the Chinese Room - Dennett's point is that the flaw of the intuition pump is that it doesn't specify how complex the algorithms operated upon by the man must be to make it so that the questioners who are asking the questions in Chinese are satisfied that the answers they get are from a thinking entity. Dennett's intuition is that they would have to be astoundingly complex - more complex than would be possible for one man and a pencil to analyse in any reasonable time horizon. As such, the Chinese Room thought experiment is bust because it fails to account for the possibility that the set of algorithmic instructions would only be physically possible to operationalise on a substrate capable enough to elevate it to a level in which it could be described to ""understand"" its instructions - which could approximate something like consciousness.Dennett applies this same set of thinking tools to different fields - thinking about meaning, evolution, free will. In each case Dennett purports to banish the veil of mysticism that some drape over seemingly intractable problems, and shows that they are really resolvable with the application of tried-and-true thinking methods. Another interesting example is Dennett's stance on free will. Dennett is really a compatibilist - he holds that free will is compatible with determinism. How? Simple - the kind of philosophically ideal free will that some imagine we must possess to rightly be called free is an incoherent concept. Barring quantum indeterminacy, at some level the rules of physics determine the course of the universe - that is determinism. However, reality is so complex that the kind of ""free will"" some would characterise as being required to be truly free is not required to make meaningful decisions. Dennett characterises the difference as being between a sufficiently advanced pseudo-random number generator (one that generates a random list of numbers using a series of step by step algorithms) and a ""true"" random number generator. Sufficiently advanced, there is no compelling reason to choose the latter, unless you plan to play chess with an omniscient God that can predict your every move. But who needs, or wants, that kind of ideal freedom? Free will is not a binary - it is a spectrum, and what free will we have is sufficient for our purposes down to the subatomic level.I've gone off on a bit of a tangent here - but I should be somewhat embarrassed to admit that Dennett gives voice to some of my own intuitions about mind, consciousness, and free will. I find myself agreeing with him to a very large and almost embarrassing extent. Far from being accused of being overly impressionistic, however, I should caveat that the irony of my reading experience of Dennett's tome is that I didn't glean my philosophical insights from his intuition pumps, but really from how my own intuitions corroborated with his conclusions. Dennett, here, was in effect preaching to the choir. And even more ironic was that I came away with a sneaking suspicion that his intuition pumps were simply not especially effective in conveying the point in  a watertight manner. But I suppose that is a suspicion that fosters itself. Intuition pumps are by nature unwieldy thinking tools - ripe for abuse or misuse, abstracted in ways that cloud judgment, with too many hypotheticals and variables. Are Dennett's own pumps immune to this kind of thing? Probably not. He has an easier job of it though - his positions are fundamentally more parsimonious - after all, he is arguing from the standpoint of ""possibility"" - which requires less epistemological certainty than to declare a thing ""impossible"". It is possible to conceive of consciousness, evolution and free will in terms of physical laws, and this is how it is possible to conceive of them. They may be the wrong models - perhaps consciousness does exist as a floaty-substrate, by Dennett's own admission. But Dennett doesn't have to show that his model is correct - he just has to show that it is possible to think of them as being grounded in empirics. His critics often have to show that a thing is impossible to characterize in terms of physical reality - which requires some boom crutch-y sleight of hand and other such mental breakdancing. It is impossible that consciousness is rooted in the physical world - here is inductive proof in the form of a hypothetical! Forgive me if I don't find that particularly convincing.But I ramble. Dennett's book can describe all these jumbled thoughts better than I can. Go read it, regardless of your metaphysical inclinations. I think you'll probably get something out of it. At the very least, the chance to turn some of Dennett's knobs at his invitation.I give this book: 4.5 out of 5 Sphexes"

When I saw ""over 70 tools to help you think better"", the image of a list of bite-size fun facts came to mind. Certainly it was not going to be.Daniel C Dennett is one of the most active, serious, provocative and original philosophers in the English speaking world today. So no, his work is not child's play. In Intuition Pumps, he introduced a range of thought experiments, then gradually piled on new and more complex layers. Some were for supporting his views in topics like Thinking and Meaning; some were used to confront other thinkers on topics such as Religion and Free Will.I paused many many times to break down the ideas, to try to understand and to apply them in my world. How can I find holes in which argument at what time... And it had proven to be very difficult. What I did, therefore, like a school girl, was to memorize the gist of the 77 ideas, hoping I can retrieve and use them some day. I am sure that's not how this book should be read.Part IX ""What is it like to be a Philosopher?"" is my favourite. Liking something, appreciating and studying something is completely different from actually making, doing and living it. And he quoted psychologist David Hebb's rule when he discussed where a philosopher should focus his/her energy:“If it isn’t worth doing, it isn’t worth doing well.”I think this applies to every facet of life.You should read it if▫️You want to learn a set of tools that can improve your critical thinking skills▫️You want an intro on topics like consciousness, meaning, free will, evolution & AI▫️You want an intro on Dennett's view on the above, with high conviction"
107,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2704424-nick-klagge,3,"A very interesting book, but one that I think is not quite sure what it wants to be (to take the ""intentional stance"").Dennett is a philosopher who I know about mostly through his work with Doug Hofstadter, a writer who I really like (""Godel Escher Bach,"" ""Surfaces and Essences""). They have quite similar outlooks, I think--a multidisciplinary approach that takes an interest in what fields like computer science and evolutionary biology can tell us about the nature of the mind, consciousness, and free will.The publisher describes the book as ""offer[ing] seventy-seven of Dennett's most successful 'imagination-extenders and focus-holders' meant to guide you through some of life's most treacherous subject matter: evolution, meaning, mind, and free will."" I think this captures the ambiguity of the book: is it about the tools (the eponymous pumps), or about the subject matter? Dennett would certainly call my question out as an example of ""rathering"" (presentation of a false dichotomy), but I guess my feeling is that the book puts enough focus on each that there is not a fully satisfactory treatment of either. Perhaps the book best serves as entree to Dennett's work--which I think it did well for me.I ended up most interested in his assertions about free will. I have read enough of Hofstadter to be more or less already on board with his (their) views on evolution and consciousness, such as the rejection of the conclusion of Searle's ""Chinese room"" thought experiment. But his views on free will (briefly, that it is compatible with a deterministic universe) are new to me and feel like they are legitimate but also feel like they will take some time to wrap my head around--and the book wasn't long enough for a sufficient treatment.For me, the best intuition that came out of the book is as follows: many philosophical arguments are ultimately ""arguments from incredulity"" (the Chinese room, Jackson's ""What Mary Didn't Know""), and that this is not a trustworthy form of argument. In particular, human intuition is very poorly equipped to handle scales out of the bounds of our normal experience. In each of the examples I gave above, Dennett talks about the crucial role that ""lack of imagination"" plays--Searle's experiment plays down the extreme complexity and multi-layeredness of what would have to be going on by talking about ""scraps of paper,"" and Jackson's argument relies on our inability to understand what it would really mean to acquire ""all possible observational information about visual processing of color."" For Dennett, asking if we can conceive of something is a deceptively difficult challenge--it seems like a question you should be able to answer by simple introspection, but really it requires a lot of work and thinking-tools. If you say you ""can't conceive of"" something, Dennett is likely to say that you aren't working hard enough at it. In the book, Dennett spends a great deal of time talking about Borges' ""Library of Babel,"" and working through different ways of thinking about exactly what type of entity it implies--it's not enough to ""glom together"" the concepts of ""library"" and ""really big,"" because the scale is so far beyond our direct experience of ""big"" that it is really something else altogether.This is why Dennett and Hofstadter get so much mileage out of issues surrounding computing. In a sense, computing operates at scales that are ""inconceivable"" to humans, but on the other hand, it is something that his readers are intimately familiar with. It is this cognitive dissonance that ends up being philosophically productive. It seems ""inconceivable"" to us that a Turing machine made of squares of toilet paper and rocks could, given enough time, run ""Grand Theft Auto,"" but we can also intellectually understand that that is in fact the case."
108,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62274863-phoenix,4,"Danny's Wonderful Tool BoxProfessor and philosopher Dennett starts off with the wonderful project of describing a set of techniques for productive reasoning in philosophy, and presumably in other fields as well. Calling them ""intuition pumps"", they are what physicists ""gedanken"" (thought) experiments which can be tweaked by changing a limited number parameters which Dennet likens to twisting a few ""knobs"". The opposite of a pump is called a ""boom crutch"", which are analogies to be avoided. Intuition pumps can move us forward, boom crutches leave us spinning in circles. In order to keep it simple he disciplined his material by giving it in the form of a course to a group of first year university students, so we are essentially his second class.The project starts off very well. The first section covers about a dozen different concepts such as the value of Trial and Error (fail rapidly and learn from mistakes), Reductio ad Absurdum, Anatol Rapoport's rules for successful criticism, Sturgeon's Law (90% of everything is crap ), joosting (look at problems by ""jumping out of the system"", ie: what would happen if one abandoned phlogiston, or what would a Martian think of this problem), rathering (sliding past a false dichotomy), answering rhetorical questions as the answer may surprise, Occam's Razor, Occam's Broom (watch out for sweeping inconsistencies under the rug), the ""sorta"" operator ( a recommendation against using unnecessary precision) and my favourite, deepidity - a child's neologism for ideas that sound deep (""love"" is just a word) but either is or is not. Dennet seems to approach it as a boom crutch, akin to stupidity, but maybe it can be productive of ideas as well.He then continues with several illustrating scenarios, many of which have to do with the nature of consciousness, for example contrasting the inner and outer reality of what we see, and what do we mean when we ascribe purpose to animals (sphexishness), systems and inanimate objects. Quite a few discussions centre around zombies, robots, replicants and Chinese rooms - if they pass as humans should we truly say that they have an inner life.However the project suddenly runs off the rails about 100 pages in with a 50 page discussion of Turing machines (which, if you've had it before, he invites you to skip) where he urges the reader to hand simulate a computation. How very 80s! Later on even Conway's Game of Life reappears. This is old material that doesn't tell us much about thought and could have been summarized in much less time. And then he does it again in with longer segments on Borges Infinite Library, comparing it to DNA and then evolution. All very nice but it's like listening to your favorite uncle droning on about the old country and not really why we've come to the party.So while promising at first, it does disappoint by being a bit long winded. There are some good nuggets here and there such as the impossible metaphor of a sky hook, the parable of analyzing the behaviour of black boxes, the role of knowledge in fairness of lotteries where the winning ticket is decided before or after the tickets have been sold and ""qualias"" - emotional gestalts associated with colours or objects; tidbits as to why locust population explosions favour prime number intervals and the quasi-myth of ""sphexishness"".In summary, it's good at the beginning and beats the averages of Sturgeon's Law, don't be afraid to judiciously skim. A fine toothed rating for me would be 3.7, but of course your mileage may vary."
109,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5956720-anastasia-sijabat,2,"Reading this book was a wild ride.I was at first compelled to read the book because I remember taking a Science Fiction and Philosophy module when I was an undergrad and the professor raved about this book. At that time, I didn't bother to buy the book, but when a friend said that she bought a copy, I was interested to borrow it and read it to know why that professor really liked this book.My first (and consistent) impression is that if I knew Dennett in real life, we wouldn't go along. We have a very different approach to the way we communicate that I Did Not Understand Most of His Points. The impatient me two months ago, while reading this book, would be furious and think that he was a prime example of male ego who liked to namedrop and mumble about things people don't understand just to sound smart. Today, I give him benefit of the doubt.Listen, I might be dumb, but that doesn't mean I can't learn. I was not a bright student in the Physics class when I was in high school, but I understood Stephen Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" because Hawking is a great communicator and he must've gone a long way to ensuring readers understand what he wrote. Dennett has a very different way of communicating. Example: he never gives a definition of what he discusses, so for those of you who are new to philosophy, good luck guessing what determinism is and why he writes several chapters about examples on compatibilism (the view that determinism and free will might be compatible, not contradictory) before explicitly writing that he is a compatibilist (and even so he doesn't explain what it is. I was lucky because I knew the topics he discusses beforehand).One of the materials that bothers me so much is when he thinks it's mindboggling if a human is unknowingly put into another planet that resembles Earth in every aspect except the way they call a horse. He then questions: so, if she sees an animal resembling horse on that planet but is not a horse, is it actually a horse?This is absolutely ridiculous to me. I think he could've discussed it from philosophy of language point of view, given, you know, that language is social construct so nothing is actually a word? Language is a consensus so if that woman sees a horse-like specimen but is not called a horse.... it's not a horse because the communities don't agree that it's called a horse? I'm so confused as to what kind of critical thinking he intends to arouse here.Don't get me started with the whole chapters about computers either. They were insufferable. I only understood several bits but I didn't get the whole gist (I asked myself ""so what?"" so often).One thing that drove me to not give a complete 1 star rating is his analysis on free will and determinism, and he successfully distinguishes the determinism question from moral responsibility inquiry. Perhaps that was the only new thing I learned from reading the book aside from thinking ""Yep I've known this before"" or ""What the hell does this even mean?""(edit: rating down from 3 to 2 because apparently 3 means ""liked it"" and I did not like it so...)"
110,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16074924-dan-smith,3,"This book missells itself, and has its flaws, but it's worth reading if only to encourage the reader to turn a critical eye on Dennett's own arguments.Let's get one thing out of the way, an Intuition Pump is a thought experiment as far as I can see, and giving it another label (something Dennett's denigrates in other thought experiments - see his relabelling of Mr Puppet as Captain Autonomy) changes nothing other than the rhetoric. It's all a case of My Pump Pumps Harder Than Yours, and it's a bit cheap.And another thing: this in no way contains ""70 ways to make you think better"". A few generic philosophical tools at the start are fine, but the rest are specific thought experiments to prove or disprove a point, or deconstructions of another philosopher's argument. It's a quality set of disparate points, coalescing around meaning, evolution, free will and consciousness.There's a lot of begging the question going on here - the Puppet / Autonomy label a case in point: Dennett correctly identifies the unsubtle characterisation of a person in a free-will thought experiment, but then seeks to prove his case by doing just the same. His central thesis is also curiously void at heart: I get his analysis of ever more complex ""thinking"" machines and how they could be equated to our own brains, with comparable levels of thought. But all it does is set up a comparison: why make the jump and say they must be the same? Why does this tell us anything about what consciousness is? It might do, but it can't get further than saying ""I've shown you a similar system, a computer, which has the same theoretical structure as your brain. We can't see the consciousness in my example, so... you see...? *pump pump* There! I have explained consciousness!""The thing is, I get everything he says and I sorta (to borrow his convenient fuzzy phrase) agree. But I end up not thinking he's really solved anything.He also has a frustrating habit of falling into the same rhetorical tricks as ones he painstakingly and smugly criticises others for using. For example, he spends a while constructing and example of humans constructing robots to house their cryogenic bodies, giving those robots instructions and degrees of autonomy. Fun. He then declares ""but what I have shown you is no different to genes using our bodies to replicate!"" Really? I see some parallels, and they're sorta similar, but so?It's like trying to nail down jelly. Yes, I see what you've shown me, but every time you get close to a key issue, you sorta wobble, sorta allow the nail in, and then sorta ignore it.This may be the key problem with all this sorta comparisons and thought experiments. If you're minded to agree, you see the example and agree with it. If you disagree, you'll either pick it apart (if you can) or say that it's all. All well as far as it goes but it doesn't *prove* the point.I did like his ""anything you can do, I can do meta. I can do many thing meta than you"" line. Alas, this only inspired me to think of e whole thing as this: A Metaphor? Yes, fine, but what's a meta *for*?"
111,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30039874-ap,3,"I did not finish this book (read about 2/3).Interesting, but I could do with a condensed version. I don't feel like I missed the main gist, but the details were not absorbed. It is well written, and if I had followed it and finished it, I probably would rate it higher.The book is about thinking about how we think, and tools that we can use to help (or also boomcrutches, which hinder) those processes.I got lost at the end of Part I, when it got super computery. The evolution discussions of Part II were interesting, but I got lost in that, too, before it finished. In the final part, I was lost from the get-go. The main points I have so far- Break assumptions and logics down to their most basic components, to find flaws or inconsistencies.- Making mistakes is the best way to learn. Embrace it.- Everything is dependent on context. There is no hidden or deeper meanings to things.- The original intention of nearly everything is survival.- Be aware of your emotional attachments to ideas.Some useful tools: - be fair, point out pros and cons of others work, demonstrate what you learned from it before you criticize it. - don't waste time critiquing mediocrity. - simple is best. - know the system so you can step outside of it to subvert it. - remember that brains can have little in common, but still have similar intentions. Even similar intentions will use data very differently. - There is no common structure in the huamn brain that funnels in ""meaning."" Good points in the book: - Meaning is not inherent or tangible. It is stored in the brain, but not like data.  - Folk psychology - the most important patterns in our images -- gives us a foundation to interpret the word around us. It is culturally dependent, not genetic. It is the way we tend to pattern and interpret, based on how others around us do it. - There is no wonder tissue in our brains -- stop looking for top-down approaches to explain humans, consciousness, etc. We are not magical miracles. We are bottom-up, mechanical processes that internetwork in growing webs of complexity to create the people and cultures around us. - Evolution challenges the top-down approach, with unintelligent, aimless design (bent only on survival).Some boomcrutches: - inconvenient facts are conveniently swept away/ignored. - using false dichotomies to make it seem like there are only two alternatives. - set up exagerated strawman of someone's argument, then refute that as if it was their real argument. - subtle inclusion of irrelevent things to weaken their argument. - using words or phrases that sound deep but are vague or trivial. - be wary when someone uses the word ""surely"" or asks a rhetorical question in their argument."
112,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11254454-arensb,4,"An intuition pump, in Dennett's sense, is an analogy or metaphor that helps us to think about a harder problem.For instance imagine a whimsical jailer who goes around while the prisoners are asleep, and unlocks all the doors and leaves them that way for a few hours. Are the prisoners free to escape? The idea is not so much to answer this particular question, but to play with it and use it to help us analyze a more complex problem.In Intuition Pumps, Dennett introduces several dozen such intuition pumps and other mental tools, as well as some pitfalls (e.g., the seductive analogy that misleads us into accepting the wrong conclusion), forming a good introduction to philosophy for the interested amateur.He does concentrate on three areas: evolution, consciousness, and free will. Make of this what you will: he might be flogging his personal interests, or he might just be trying to avoid mistakes by presenting students with examples from the areas he knows best. I tend to lean toward the latter, but if you're bored silly by the very idea of discussions on free will, you may want to just skip Chapter VIII.All in all, this book is a good and lucid introduction to philosophy, including why it matters, and why even lay people can and should engage in it: when done correctly, and not just as an exercise in navel-gazing with five-dollar words, it's basically a way of thinking straight, and avoid reasoning errors.ETA: The section on computing and Turing machines is at best inaccurate and at worst misleading. The central message, that modern computers don't do anything that a Turing machine couldn't do, is correct. Yes, virtual machines are a real, and even useful, thing. And yes, a Turing machine can run a virtual version of your desktop PC and do everything it does, albeit at a ridiculously low speed.I think Dennett confuses virtualization with abstraction. Virtualization is the process of making one computer behave like another one. For instance, if you wanted to play your old Apple II games, you could set up a virtual Apple II on your desktop PC. That is, a program on your PC would pretend to be an Apple II, so that that virtual Apple II could run your old games.Abstraction, on the other hand, is, roughly, the process of hiding the low-level details from the programmer, who can ignore the small stuff and get on with making the program do what she really wants. As time goes on, more and more things are considered low-level.To hear Dennett explain it, though, you might think that programmers pile virtual machine upon virtual machine, rather than abstraction upon abstraction."
113,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10974082-christine,2,"Finished! Let me show you what I learned from this book. Take the sentence, ""I finished it."" In this sentence, finished is defined as ""I visually examined each page, including preface, introduction, and appendix but excluding sources, bibliography, and the majority of the index."" Note that there is nothing in this definition about comprehension, or understanding. That is because for one definition of ""finished"" (the definition I have chosen to use in this book review), the focus is on completion without concerns about understanding, knowledge, or the ability to disseminate the information received to others of similar (or any) level of knowledge. With me so far? Yes? I'm impressed. No? That's about how I felt for this entire book. Originally I purchased this book on a whim because I loved the phrase ""intuition pumps"" and thought it would have helpful tools for more articulate discussions in debates. And it does, but only if you're a philosopher. Dennett writes about philosophical debates on the nature of consciousness, free will, and meaning but with examples so abstract and metaphysical they'd be almost impossible to use in a conversation with laymen. That's not a bad thing, but judging from this book there's a huge gap between an interested layman and the entry level philosophy student this book is aimed at. I thought I was a reasonably well educated layman. I thought I would be able to make the stretch to entry level student. I could not. There were still a great many things I enjoyed. The concept of intuition pumps (61), the discussion of Occam's Razor(38) and Occam's Broom(40), Boom Crutches(48), learning about register machines(109). Although I still don't understand how a register machine could be useful as a thinking tool, unless maybe it's to internalize the process of reducing a particular activity down to its most basic operations to see if you could get a simple machine (or a cascade of simple machines) to perform the same job, without understanding it or even knowing what they are doing? Dennet holds that often what we assume is irreducible complexity could actually be performed (albeit more slowly) by sufficient layers of the most basic computers (loosely paraphrased from p 139). That's an interesting, terrifying idea. Terrifying because now I can't argue that we aren't all zombies, or robots. This book left me with more questions than answers, and more confusion than when I started reading it. I guess that's a good thing? I don't regret reading it, but only now that it's over. "
114,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,3,"Dennett enumerates some ``tools for thinking'', elaborates on some intuition pumps (a term he coined in 1980 which I guess is legitimate), explains why some apparent intuition pumps are counterproductive (and are instead what he calls ``boom crutches''), and applies the whole thing, inevitably, to philosophy of the mind.If Dennett's book broadly fall into two categories—moderately compelling pop sci that's basically solid but just wrong enough to annoy every reader in at least one way (Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Breaking the Spell), and intensely boring philosophy wank (Consciousness Explained, most of the rest)—Intuition Pumps &c. straddles the boundary. Parts of it are fair enough, but a lot of it is given over to tedious bullshit, a lot of which exemplifies why I feel philosophers are a waste of space: almost all of the thought experiments he finds so daunting turn out to be meaningless or trivial, and though career philosophers can arguably be forgiven for failing to recognise a thought experiment as meaningless (philosophy departments wouldn't exist if they couldn't), failing to recognise trivial ones is prety damned embarrassing for someone who's made this sort of thing his career for literally almost twice as long as I've existed.†Also, his position on free will is still basically wrong-headed, though it isn't more so than most things that have been written on the subject. He's clearly approaching a more sensible position, but at the pace he's going he'll be dead before he gets there.That said, the bits that are fair enough are, indeed, fair enough, and he manages to pull off aspects on which I expected a much worse performance (there's an entire set of chapters on computers and AI (proper CS AI, not philosophy AI), for example) surprisingly well. If every philosopher were only as bad as Dan Dennett, I wouldn't be nearly as bitter about their existence.(I also really appreciate that Gould is brought up as three instances of doing it wrong. Too many people Americans hold him in high regard, and it needs to stop.)---† I don't intend to stoop to their level and get into particulars here; most people who read my reviews know me well enough that I hope they'll give me some credit and accept that I'm not likely to be full of shit.

115,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11446002-dan,4,"Daniel Dennett is so committed to approachable philosophy one of his primary pillars is the use of interested laypeople as ""decoys"" in philisophical debate, so that philosophers are forced to explain their assumptions and the parameters of their ideas more rigorously. Consequently, his book is quite approachable to interested folks outside of philosophy.Dennett is also among the ""Four Horsemen of New Atheism"" so if that's going to irritate the hell out of you, definitely give this book a pass.I'll see if any of the thinking tools Dennett prescribes prove useful to me, and adjust to a 3 star or 5 star accordingly, if warranted. Initially, I think they will be useful. Taken together, the tools tend to emphasize the practical application over theoretical purity. Dennett very quickly gives up on/dismisses some of the big questions that excite people, such as ""Why is there something rather than nothing?"" (which he calls a pseudo-problem unworthy of inquiry). Philosophical ""qualia"" and ""zombies"" also get heaps of scorn from him. For him, the notion of ""free will"" that is used in courts should be enough for us: people never act independently from their context, but usually act with enough autonomy to be held accountable for those actions.Emblematic of his reliance on working-definitions and practical application is his repeated (sometimes tiresomely) use of the adjective ""sorta"". To him, getting into definitional arguments about the absolute limits of self, freedom, word definitions almost instantly become trivial as they search for fine distinctions that simply don't exist. Instead, just say someone is ""sorta"" thinking or ""sorta"" independent and move on.Finally, Dennett overflows with enthusiasm for both the evolutionary model and for computing. The evolutionary section of the book seemed useful and central to his main points but the extensive chapters on computing, including workbook-style programming problems to solve in a simple, theoretical model of a computer perplexed me. They seemed long and indulgent and I kept waiting for them to become relevant to the rest of the book. I never felt like they did.Overall, a worthwhile read, so long as I can remember some of his pumps and the ideas I had in response to them."

More than once I found myself, after twenty pages of lucid explanations, coming across a paragraph I had to read five times just to make certain I had understood it... and even then I wouldn't have bet money on it. This is the kind of book that will make you feel confident one moment and absurdly out of your depth the next. When you're jumping from physics, biology, computer science and cognitive psychology, that may just be the nature of the beast, but it fortunately never feels as though Dennett is being an obscurantist. He values lucidity, and by the end of this thing I was grateful.Dennett manages to glide from one mind-bending mystery to another and address each with wit, clarity, and frightening intelligence. It's impressive that a man so fiercely bright can keep his work from being too intimidating: his tone is that of a kindly uncle, guiding you with patience through some of the most difficult conundrums your brain can handle.While this was sometimes dense to the point that it hurt my head, if you find any of the topics interesting you'll be missing out on a feast for your brain if you don't give Intuition Pumps a shot."
117,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,3,"On the back of a very uninspiring month, following two really inspired months, I wanted a book that might reliably be jumper cables for my brain. A collection of thought experiments and ways of thinking to think about thinking, seemed beyond perfect. It wasn’t. It did get me thinking about why it wasn’t though. What are the qualities of something that is thought-provoking? At one extreme, I might argue everything and nothing is thought provoking, and all provocation is in the thought of the thinker. I’m uninspired in general, this didn’t inspire me. I was inspired in general, everything inspired me, especially the James Gleick books. At the other extreme, I have no role, and the content has objective thought-provoking qualities. If this is even partially true, where do those qualities lie? I was provoked by very few of these intuition pumps, some were novel thought experiments that I haven’t come across before. Some were literal about the knobs available to be turned one by one to reveal the underlying dependence of the pump. Some revealed that I might just have a bias against the phrasing, intuition pump, exemplified by the use in this unfortunate sentence ‘engage in mutual intuition pumping’. Mostly I was underwhelmed by my experience. It didn’t get me ‘thinking elegantly about hard questions’, as much as it told me how Daniel Dennett thinks elegantly about hard questions, with most chapters seeming to me how Frank Johnson’s colorblind Mary thought experiment seemed to DD, an answer writ large on the front of the envelope, having nothing to open up and discover, because it’s anyway just an empty envelope. It’s interesting to consider the strong possibility that, having pointed this out in Frank Johnson’s experiment, DD took immense pains not to fall into the same trap of experiment construction, placing most of the resultant emptiness squarely on the shoulders of dumb readers like myself. I’ll have more evidence once I go back to another James Gleick book immediately and compare my mental processes. NotesWhat separates ignorance from willful subterfuge? Take the chapter on Gould, and his use of ‘rathering’ to create false dichotomies.

That’s why conspiracy theories are so compelling, sweeping all inconvenient data under the carpet, where normal people won’t spot the omissions. Sturgeon’s Law: 90% of everything is garbage. Criticizing something for being bad is a terrible idea, because 90% of everything is bad. Focus on what’s good. Rathering: Create false dichotomies saying evolution does not proceed by X, rather by Y, when in case these 2 are not mutually exclusive, while you make it sound that wayPeople use ‘surely’ at the edge of their knowledge, or things they take for granted and are hoping you do too.Is understanding your psychology like the comments that coders put on source code, meant to understand the code but not at all affecting how the computer reads and executes it.‘Slippery Slope’ is often just a moat disguised as slippery slope.

118,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/445677-scott,5,"At this point, it has been nearly 25 years since I read Douglas Hofstadter and Daniel Dennett's anthology, ""The Mind's I,"" as part of a philosophy class on artificial intelligence at the University of Pittsburgh. One of the most-enduring essays in that volume was Dennett's ""Where am I?"", a tour-de-force of a thought experiment that became a cultural referent, the ""brain in a vat"" controlling a body containing a substitute brain via radio waves. Dennett would refer to such a construction as an ""intuition pump,"" a contrived situation created to test the reader's thoughts and assumptions about an idea. Each of his ""intuition pumps"" has ""knobs,"" or circumstances and details, that can be adjusted and changed so that the reader can explore the idea as much (or, as little) as desired. This volume collects many of Dennett's best intuition pumps from across his long and fruitful career as a philosopher. Often Dennett's exposition is new, and his writing is remarkably free from undue resorts to the sophisticated/abstruse language of academic philosophy. However, the simplicity and clarity of his writing to the lay person does not detract from the deep exploration of ideas on what it means to know something, can a computer be intelligent and think like us, the difficulties people have conceiving of evolution, and why evolution makes sense, what it means to be conscious, and do we ultimately have free will (and does it matter?). He also concludes with a few brief notes about the practice of philosophy, and encouragement (and cautionary tales) for those who might consider a career in the field.The intuition pumps presented are brief; many can be easily read in under 30 minutes time. However, each one of them can be re-read and explored in considerable detail, and many academic careers have been fruitfully spent working through the implications of these topics, attempting to find challenges and refutations to and support for these arguments. Highly recommended for all who have an interest in thinking about thinking and have at least a casual curiosity about philosophy."
119,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82933807-donald-thomann,3,"Intuition Pumps does what it claims to do in the title: Give you a number of thinking tools that you can apply across a wide variety of topics. It falls short, though, in two major ways, which really affected my enjoyment of the book overall compared to other books that in effect do the same thing. The first is that a lot of the chapters don't mix or follow one another particularly well, and at times this just comes off like a series of blog posts. As a result the whole thing feels pretty disjointed and without any kind of central, unifying theme. The sections break down roughly to logical philosophy, evolutionary biology, consciousness, etc. but the subject categories feel mostly artificial. Which brings me to the second, more important point...These are all fairly standard tools in any advanced thinker's tool kit, and invaluable tools to a noob like myself just beginning to dive into these topics. However, the tools seem so abstracted and disjointed that it becomes hard to understand how to apply them in real situations. Let's say you know very little about automobiles, carpentry and plumbing. If you entered a garage where all the tools required for these three professions were available to you, wall to wall, floor to ceiling, you'd have everything you needed to build some stuff. However, you wouldn't have the raw materials needed to actually build anything, nor would you have the knowledge of how to use the tools or apply them properly even if you did. That's how this book felt to me. It's too basic for advanced thinkers and too abstracted and removed from practical application to be useful to an amateur. Dennett throws you a bunch of nuts and bolts and wrenches and belt sanders and crimpers and clamps without giving you the instruction manual with the image of the final product and the exploded view. All that said, I think this would be a perfect read as a companion to more concrete reading material on any of these subjects, or as a massive textbook where each tool could be applied more extensively."
120,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39894105-nestor-leal,3,"This book title was a little misguiding. I like thought experiments which are called intuition pumps in here. Turns out only a few pages are dedicated to these thinking tools then they are applied to the concepts of consciousness, free will, determinism, evolution and the mind. I like to think and philosophize about these things too but the book should have been named otherwise. Some chapters are boring to people (like me) who already know binary code, assembler language and in general how computers work. On the other hand these chapters will help the untrained to learn how they work. At the end, understanding how computers work will help you understand how many things in nature are computer like, ie. our body cells.At times it seemed like this is a good philosophy companion book to The Selfish Gene which is mostly science. There are many references to Richard Dawkins’ work and even to the game theory used in his book. In fact, Dennett states that science and philosophy should go hand in hand, to which I agree, so it makes sense. I didn’t like the arrogant tone of Daniel Dennett and how the criticizes other philosophers. Still it is an ok book.I liked his idea of making good mistakes. Learning about our mistakes is always good for improvement. Mistakes, when understood correctly, help us advance even further. This is not new but mostly nobody likes to be pointed out their mistakes except when they accept and acknowledge this will greatly help them. Still it’s better to make big mistakes than stupid mistakes.Well, reading this book seemed like a good idea at the time!"

The author, a philosopher, uses the tools of philosophy to fill in the blanks about how we proceed with science.The book starts off by how we sometimes can be mislead by 'intuition pumps"", thought experiments, and how we should correctly use them. He sets up the listener in how to think about problems and then delves into some big problems, such as design within the universe and what does it mean, and what is consciousness and how to think about it.The author is a philosopher but is much more interested in understanding the scientific method as opposed to the meaning of words.I've listened to most of the science books audible has available and a book like this helps me see beyond just the science but also how to think about the science.This author had a theme throughout this whole book. That the start of all understanding first comes about by realizing the role of evolution in the design of all non-trivial systems.I will read more of this author's work. P.S. I did end up reading more of this author's work, and it made me disappointed in this book, because he copies most of this book from his other books. I like this book, but it turns out to be redundant if you've read his other work. "
122,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5078550-robert-bor,4,"Daniel Dennett's work is not usually within my range of interest. I find the abstract nature of philosophy and it sometimes outlandish discussions to be uninteresting. However, this work is surely an exception. It takes together two aspects which interest me a lot, computer programming and evolution theory. Meaning, consciousness and free will are attacked using various utilities (called intuition pumps) which help thinking about the problems. Useless utilities (called crutch booms) are systematically destroyed. Mr Dennett relentlessly works towards (stopping just short of saying it) showing how the human mind is a beautiful and well-designed (yes, design can be used again, although it is design-without-a-designer) series of systems that all take care of their own and together form complex, conscious, free-willing systems, such as our minds. Note that Mr Dennett nowhere says this is actually the case, but between the lines, this looks to be the winner he is betting on. Mr Dennett also uses this book both as a means to reinforce real or perceived victories against philosophical enemies. I don't really get those, but it's probably part of the in-crowd show."

If they were, we would've figured them out long ago. Daniel Dennett's book offers a plethora of Thinking Tools drawn from computer science, biology and many other realms which, like the apps on your phone, give you the power to do more things better - to think difficults thoughts more easily, and even tackle the most difficult questions about meaning and consciousness. It's designed to change your way of thinking and to nudge you out of some ultimately wrong intuitions you may hold. It is basically a summary of his life's work.I think Dennett's toolkit, which is made out of many thought experiments ('Intuition Pumps') and more, is extremely useful for any aspiring thinker, whether you agree with him or not."

But ya know, Prof. Dennett is the champ at pumping intuition. 5 stars for the champ. I suppose this is not as entertaining as, say, Darwin's Dangerous Idea or Breaking the Spell.

Giant robot intuition pump addresses this question. - p166Excellent summary of theory of meaning on p197-198:""And what are the verdicts of this long section on meaning? A mixture of pessimism and optimism. Meaning isn't going to turn out to be a simple property that maps easily onto brains, and we're not going to find ""deeper"" facts anywhere that just settle the question of what a sentence, or a thought, or a belief really means. The best we can do–and it is quite good enough–is to find and anchor (apparently) best interpretations of all the physical-stance (and design-stance) data we have. If we can find one solution to a Quinian quandary about meaning, we have almost certainly found the solution–in the sense that we may be confident that no better solution lies undiscovered. As the two-bitser's move to Panama showed, meaning is always relative to a context of function, and there need be no original intentionality beyond the intentionality of our (sorta) selfish genes, which derive their sorta intentionality from the functional context of evolution by natural selection, instead of from an Intelligent Designer playing the role of our rich client ordering a giant robot. And the intuition pump about the two black boxes shows that the intentional stance, with all its tolerance of sorta beliefs and their ilk, is not optional if you want to understand and explain many of the causal regularities in the world.Our investigations into these issues are greatly enhanced, here in the twenty-first century, by the fact that, for the first time, we have ways of thinking rigorously and vigorously about mechanisms with trillions of moving parts–parts that work in unmysterious ways. Thanks to Turing, we can at least dimly see a path now, from brute uncomprehending matter (the physical stance) via a cascade of rearrangements (the design stance, and sorta meanings) to an appreciation of ourselves as paradigmatic believers, knowers, understanders (simplified by the intentional stance as intentional systems).""Darwin's theory of evolution unites meaning with matter: ""On one side, we have the world of our mods and their meanings [...] On the other side, we have galaxies ceaselessly wheeling, planets falling pointlessly into their orbits, lifeless chemical mechanisms doing what their physics ordains, all without purpose or reason. Then Darwin comes along and shows us how the former arises from the latter, creating meaning as it goes, a bubble-up vision of the birth of importance to overthrow the trickle-down vision of tradition."" - p201Library of Mendel / Library of Babel: set of all possible permutations of DNA base-pairs / characters in the Roman alphabet.

""Why shrink from the pedagogical task of showing that there can be design without a designer? [...] The biosphere is utterly saturated with design, with purpose, with reasons.

132,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9310150-quiver,5,"Dennett courts controversy in a number of places by calling out his colleagues for being inaccurate or a little to lax with their methods of thought. His is also excessively wordy, to the point where I occasionally believed a short, single paragraph would get his idea across much better. I appreciate the examples and the historical anecdotes, though they really should have been optional whenever not directly crucial for transmitting the gist of the intuition pump.Despite all of the above, Dennet's book is trove of useful starting points. They really are starting points however: the intuition pumps are general tools that the reader needs to mull over, adopt and adapt, before slowly applying to life and academic thinking. And it's hard work, if you want to do it seriously—I've tried and it's paid off, a little. The main message is this: if you are interested in improving the sharpness of your mental edge, Dennett's book will indicate a few of the segments where you're being obtuse (dictionary meanings 1 and 3 intended). So the book won't even show you all the segments, let alone how to really sharpen them. But that's why you then go and read other books that will. It's always about climbing one rung at a time; Dennett's is an excellent rung. For that I recommend it to most people. Five stars."
133,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"In this book, Daniel Dennett covers a bit of everything he has studied: evolution / consciousness / free will / meaning / AI. I agree with another reviewer who says, ""reading this book is basically like reading Daniel Dennett in blog format."" Unlike the reviewer, I have less problem with it. Perhaps it's because I am more like a casual reader than a student in philosophy. Each intuition pump (thought experiment) discussed is relatively independent of each other, making the book friendly to a reader who reads in fragmented time. Dennett does not demonstrate ""turning all the knobs to examine a thought experiment"" in every chapter. But when he does the trick, it is often enjoyable and inspirational. To make use of this method myself, however, may require lots of practice. A few chapters I like the most and will probably re-read in the future: 	• Trapped in the Robot Control Room	• The Seven Secrets of Computer Power Revealed (on register machine) 	• Noise in the Virtual Hotel	• Mary the Color Scientist	• Dennet's intepreation of Conway's Game of Life	• The Boys from Brazil"

135,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,5,"This book is misleadingly titled  - it should be called Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking like Daniel Dennett. But no harm done.Having previously only heard of Daniel Dennett in context of his status as one of the four horsemen of the New Atheism movement, I picked up this book from Kinokuniya blind - expecting it to be a general sort of empirically-minded self-improvement book for honing your thinking techniques. Instead, I got a thinly-veiled overview of Dennett's various philosophical positions over meaning, consciousness, complexity, and free will, which are explained using such thinking tools as Dennett recommends that the reader cultivate. The subtext being that if the reader were only to apply the correct thinking tools, she would naturally reach the same, or similar, conclusions, that Dennett has.The central thinking tool in the box is really the intuition pump, a kind of thinking experiment cunningly worded and framed to get the reader to come to a desired conclusion by appealing to his or her intuitions. The term was coined by Dennett and many examples are prominently featured in this book, given such whimsically memorable names as the Curse of the Cauliflower and the Zombic Hunch. A famous example of an intuition pump (and one Dennett savages) is the Chinese Room experiment - in which one imagines a man using a set of algorithmic translation rules to translate Chinese questions into English in order to answer them. However, at no point in this process does the man actually understand the inputs - he merely acts upon them based on a set of instructions. The point of this thought experiment is to pump the intuition that - like the man in the Chinese room - computers that use algorithms to process data do not truly understand them - ergo, consciousness (i.e. understanding) cannot arise out of a set of algorithms designed to simulate its functions.The intuition pump is really a double edged sword, however, and can be used to both illuminate and mislead. This is because intuition pumps are by their very nature abstractions of philosophical problems - they simplify conditions to make it easier to think about a thing - and in some cases, to think about a thing the way the creator intended. Dennett tells us to interrogate intuition pumps by turning the knobs - in other words, changing some of the conditions or assumptions of the intuition pump and seeing if the same intuitions are pumped out. Even as Dennett presents his own intuition pumps, he also deconstructs pumps that have been devised by others. He calls misleading intuition pumps boom crutches, deliberately malappriopriating (see what I did there?) the nautical term for these anti-thinking tools that are designed to shut down thinking.Ultimately, however, after a few short chapters laying out his toolbox, Dennett begins the methodical quest of introducing the reader to his brand of philosophical thought. Dennett's positions on various matters - cognition, free will, consciousness - can be boiled down to the idea that these ideas - held by some philosophers to reside in the sacred space of epistemological inscrutability- can actually be explained with a mundane scientific approach. The hard questions are procedurally hard - but not unsolvable using scientific inquiry. In plain language, it simply means that things like consciousness or free will can be explained or described in the framework of material reality, and there is no need to posit some imagined higher substrate of reality - such as positing that consciousness manifests beyond the physical mind - in order to understand such phenomena.It's hard to distill Dennett's ideas into one paragraph, but an example of this approach is Dennett's deconstruction of the Chinese Room. That thought experiment holds that consciousness cannot manifest out of algorithms, which are ostensibly what the mind, in Dennett's model of cognition, uses - i.e. strong, conscious AI is not possible. Dennett's dictum, on the other hand, is that software, sufficiently advanced (and operating on a sufficiently complex hardware stratum like the brain), approximates consciousness to such a level of fidelity that it is indistinguishable from consciousness, and in fact, is consciousness, and in actual fact is precisely what consciousness is in reality.Think about the idea of the philosophical zombie - a being that acts and talks so like a human being that it is indistinguishable from one, except that it has no internal world, no consciousness - and elevate it to the idea of the zimboe - another philosophical creature that simulates second-order beliefs that it is a conscious thinking being, when it actually isn't. A zimboe looks, acts, and feels - or thinks it feels - like a real human being - but it doesn't actually think anything. Dennett's argument is that the zimboe is the logical outcropping of the idea that there can be p-zombies that approximate human complexity, but at that level of fidelity it would be impossible for a zimboe to be distinguished from a human being, by any means. Rather than posit some ethereal essence of consciousness, Dennett argues, why not just eliminate the need for that as-yet-undiscovered substrate and go straight to the Occam's-Razor solution - that the zimboe concept is incoherent because a sufficiently complex bundle of computational processes - i.e. the zimboe - already possesses, by dint of its mental complexity, consciousness?Back to the Chinese Room - Dennett's point is that the flaw of the intuition pump is that it doesn't specify how complex the algorithms operated upon by the man must be to make it so that the questioners who are asking the questions in Chinese are satisfied that the answers they get are from a thinking entity. Dennett's intuition is that they would have to be astoundingly complex - more complex than would be possible for one man and a pencil to analyse in any reasonable time horizon. As such, the Chinese Room thought experiment is bust because it fails to account for the possibility that the set of algorithmic instructions would only be physically possible to operationalise on a substrate capable enough to elevate it to a level in which it could be described to ""understand"" its instructions - which could approximate something like consciousness.Dennett applies this same set of thinking tools to different fields - thinking about meaning, evolution, free will. In each case Dennett purports to banish the veil of mysticism that some drape over seemingly intractable problems, and shows that they are really resolvable with the application of tried-and-true thinking methods. Another interesting example is Dennett's stance on free will. Dennett is really a compatibilist - he holds that free will is compatible with determinism. How? Simple - the kind of philosophically ideal free will that some imagine we must possess to rightly be called free is an incoherent concept. Barring quantum indeterminacy, at some level the rules of physics determine the course of the universe - that is determinism. However, reality is so complex that the kind of ""free will"" some would characterise as being required to be truly free is not required to make meaningful decisions. Dennett characterises the difference as being between a sufficiently advanced pseudo-random number generator (one that generates a random list of numbers using a series of step by step algorithms) and a ""true"" random number generator. Sufficiently advanced, there is no compelling reason to choose the latter, unless you plan to play chess with an omniscient God that can predict your every move. But who needs, or wants, that kind of ideal freedom? Free will is not a binary - it is a spectrum, and what free will we have is sufficient for our purposes down to the subatomic level.I've gone off on a bit of a tangent here - but I should be somewhat embarrassed to admit that Dennett gives voice to some of my own intuitions about mind, consciousness, and free will. I find myself agreeing with him to a very large and almost embarrassing extent. Far from being accused of being overly impressionistic, however, I should caveat that the irony of my reading experience of Dennett's tome is that I didn't glean my philosophical insights from his intuition pumps, but really from how my own intuitions corroborated with his conclusions. Dennett, here, was in effect preaching to the choir. And even more ironic was that I came away with a sneaking suspicion that his intuition pumps were simply not especially effective in conveying the point in  a watertight manner. But I suppose that is a suspicion that fosters itself. Intuition pumps are by nature unwieldy thinking tools - ripe for abuse or misuse, abstracted in ways that cloud judgment, with too many hypotheticals and variables. Are Dennett's own pumps immune to this kind of thing? Probably not. He has an easier job of it though - his positions are fundamentally more parsimonious - after all, he is arguing from the standpoint of ""possibility"" - which requires less epistemological certainty than to declare a thing ""impossible"". It is possible to conceive of consciousness, evolution and free will in terms of physical laws, and this is how it is possible to conceive of them. They may be the wrong models - perhaps consciousness does exist as a floaty-substrate, by Dennett's own admission. But Dennett doesn't have to show that his model is correct - he just has to show that it is possible to think of them as being grounded in empirics. His critics often have to show that a thing is impossible to characterize in terms of physical reality - which requires some boom crutch-y sleight of hand and other such mental breakdancing. It is impossible that consciousness is rooted in the physical world - here is inductive proof in the form of a hypothetical! Forgive me if I don't find that particularly convincing.But I ramble. Dennett's book can describe all these jumbled thoughts better than I can. Go read it, regardless of your metaphysical inclinations. I think you'll probably get something out of it. At the very least, the chance to turn some of Dennett's knobs at his invitation.I give this book: 4.5 out of 5 Sphexes"
136,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92557747-fi,3,"Not going to lie, this had been a slow read for me. The main reason is the brief misalignment of expectation at the beginning. When I saw ""over 70 tools to help you think better"", the image of a list of bite-size fun facts came to mind. Certainly it was not going to be.Daniel C Dennett is one of the most active, serious, provocative and original philosophers in the English speaking world today. So no, his work is not child's play. In Intuition Pumps, he introduced a range of thought experiments, then gradually piled on new and more complex layers. Some were for supporting his views in topics like Thinking and Meaning; some were used to confront other thinkers on topics such as Religion and Free Will.I paused many many times to break down the ideas, to try to understand and to apply them in my world. How can I find holes in which argument at what time... And it had proven to be very difficult. What I did, therefore, like a school girl, was to memorize the gist of the 77 ideas, hoping I can retrieve and use them some day. I am sure that's not how this book should be read.Part IX ""What is it like to be a Philosopher?"" is my favourite. Liking something, appreciating and studying something is completely different from actually making, doing and living it. And he quoted psychologist David Hebb's rule when he discussed where a philosopher should focus his/her energy:“If it isn’t worth doing, it isn’t worth doing well.”I think this applies to every facet of life.You should read it if▫️You want to learn a set of tools that can improve your critical thinking skills▫️You want an intro on topics like consciousness, meaning, free will, evolution & AI▫️You want an intro on Dennett's view on the above, with high conviction"
137,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2704424-nick-klagge,3,"A very interesting book, but one that I think is not quite sure what it wants to be (to take the ""intentional stance"").Dennett is a philosopher who I know about mostly through his work with Doug Hofstadter, a writer who I really like (""Godel Escher Bach,"" ""Surfaces and Essences""). They have quite similar outlooks, I think--a multidisciplinary approach that takes an interest in what fields like computer science and evolutionary biology can tell us about the nature of the mind, consciousness, and free will.The publisher describes the book as ""offer[ing] seventy-seven of Dennett's most successful 'imagination-extenders and focus-holders' meant to guide you through some of life's most treacherous subject matter: evolution, meaning, mind, and free will."" I think this captures the ambiguity of the book: is it about the tools (the eponymous pumps), or about the subject matter? Dennett would certainly call my question out as an example of ""rathering"" (presentation of a false dichotomy), but I guess my feeling is that the book puts enough focus on each that there is not a fully satisfactory treatment of either. Perhaps the book best serves as entree to Dennett's work--which I think it did well for me.I ended up most interested in his assertions about free will. I have read enough of Hofstadter to be more or less already on board with his (their) views on evolution and consciousness, such as the rejection of the conclusion of Searle's ""Chinese room"" thought experiment. But his views on free will (briefly, that it is compatible with a deterministic universe) are new to me and feel like they are legitimate but also feel like they will take some time to wrap my head around--and the book wasn't long enough for a sufficient treatment.For me, the best intuition that came out of the book is as follows: many philosophical arguments are ultimately ""arguments from incredulity"" (the Chinese room, Jackson's ""What Mary Didn't Know""), and that this is not a trustworthy form of argument. In particular, human intuition is very poorly equipped to handle scales out of the bounds of our normal experience. In each of the examples I gave above, Dennett talks about the crucial role that ""lack of imagination"" plays--Searle's experiment plays down the extreme complexity and multi-layeredness of what would have to be going on by talking about ""scraps of paper,"" and Jackson's argument relies on our inability to understand what it would really mean to acquire ""all possible observational information about visual processing of color."" For Dennett, asking if we can conceive of something is a deceptively difficult challenge--it seems like a question you should be able to answer by simple introspection, but really it requires a lot of work and thinking-tools. If you say you ""can't conceive of"" something, Dennett is likely to say that you aren't working hard enough at it. In the book, Dennett spends a great deal of time talking about Borges' ""Library of Babel,"" and working through different ways of thinking about exactly what type of entity it implies--it's not enough to ""glom together"" the concepts of ""library"" and ""really big,"" because the scale is so far beyond our direct experience of ""big"" that it is really something else altogether.This is why Dennett and Hofstadter get so much mileage out of issues surrounding computing. In a sense, computing operates at scales that are ""inconceivable"" to humans, but on the other hand, it is something that his readers are intimately familiar with. It is this cognitive dissonance that ends up being philosophically productive. It seems ""inconceivable"" to us that a Turing machine made of squares of toilet paper and rocks could, given enough time, run ""Grand Theft Auto,"" but we can also intellectually understand that that is in fact the case."
138,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62274863-phoenix,4,"Danny's Wonderful Tool BoxProfessor and philosopher Dennett starts off with the wonderful project of describing a set of techniques for productive reasoning in philosophy, and presumably in other fields as well. Calling them ""intuition pumps"", they are what physicists ""gedanken"" (thought) experiments which can be tweaked by changing a limited number parameters which Dennet likens to twisting a few ""knobs"". The opposite of a pump is called a ""boom crutch"", which are analogies to be avoided. Intuition pumps can move us forward, boom crutches leave us spinning in circles. In order to keep it simple he disciplined his material by giving it in the form of a course to a group of first year university students, so we are essentially his second class.The project starts off very well. The first section covers about a dozen different concepts such as the value of Trial and Error (fail rapidly and learn from mistakes), Reductio ad Absurdum, Anatol Rapoport's rules for successful criticism, Sturgeon's Law (90% of everything is crap ), joosting (look at problems by ""jumping out of the system"", ie: what would happen if one abandoned phlogiston, or what would a Martian think of this problem), rathering (sliding past a false dichotomy), answering rhetorical questions as the answer may surprise, Occam's Razor, Occam's Broom (watch out for sweeping inconsistencies under the rug), the ""sorta"" operator ( a recommendation against using unnecessary precision) and my favourite, deepidity - a child's neologism for ideas that sound deep (""love"" is just a word) but either is or is not. Dennet seems to approach it as a boom crutch, akin to stupidity, but maybe it can be productive of ideas as well.He then continues with several illustrating scenarios, many of which have to do with the nature of consciousness, for example contrasting the inner and outer reality of what we see, and what do we mean when we ascribe purpose to animals (sphexishness), systems and inanimate objects. Quite a few discussions centre around zombies, robots, replicants and Chinese rooms - if they pass as humans should we truly say that they have an inner life.However the project suddenly runs off the rails about 100 pages in with a 50 page discussion of Turing machines (which, if you've had it before, he invites you to skip) where he urges the reader to hand simulate a computation. How very 80s! Later on even Conway's Game of Life reappears. This is old material that doesn't tell us much about thought and could have been summarized in much less time. And then he does it again in with longer segments on Borges Infinite Library, comparing it to DNA and then evolution. All very nice but it's like listening to your favorite uncle droning on about the old country and not really why we've come to the party.So while promising at first, it does disappoint by being a bit long winded. There are some good nuggets here and there such as the impossible metaphor of a sky hook, the parable of analyzing the behaviour of black boxes, the role of knowledge in fairness of lotteries where the winning ticket is decided before or after the tickets have been sold and ""qualias"" - emotional gestalts associated with colours or objects; tidbits as to why locust population explosions favour prime number intervals and the quasi-myth of ""sphexishness"".In summary, it's good at the beginning and beats the averages of Sturgeon's Law, don't be afraid to judiciously skim. A fine toothed rating for me would be 3.7, but of course your mileage may vary."
139,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5956720-anastasia-sijabat,2,"Reading this book was a wild ride.I was at first compelled to read the book because I remember taking a Science Fiction and Philosophy module when I was an undergrad and the professor raved about this book. At that time, I didn't bother to buy the book, but when a friend said that she bought a copy, I was interested to borrow it and read it to know why that professor really liked this book.My first (and consistent) impression is that if I knew Dennett in real life, we wouldn't go along. We have a very different approach to the way we communicate that I Did Not Understand Most of His Points. The impatient me two months ago, while reading this book, would be furious and think that he was a prime example of male ego who liked to namedrop and mumble about things people don't understand just to sound smart. Today, I give him benefit of the doubt.Listen, I might be dumb, but that doesn't mean I can't learn. I was not a bright student in the Physics class when I was in high school, but I understood Stephen Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" because Hawking is a great communicator and he must've gone a long way to ensuring readers understand what he wrote. Dennett has a very different way of communicating. Example: he never gives a definition of what he discusses, so for those of you who are new to philosophy, good luck guessing what determinism is and why he writes several chapters about examples on compatibilism (the view that determinism and free will might be compatible, not contradictory) before explicitly writing that he is a compatibilist (and even so he doesn't explain what it is. I was lucky because I knew the topics he discusses beforehand).One of the materials that bothers me so much is when he thinks it's mindboggling if a human is unknowingly put into another planet that resembles Earth in every aspect except the way they call a horse. He then questions: so, if she sees an animal resembling horse on that planet but is not a horse, is it actually a horse?This is absolutely ridiculous to me. I think he could've discussed it from philosophy of language point of view, given, you know, that language is social construct so nothing is actually a word? Language is a consensus so if that woman sees a horse-like specimen but is not called a horse.... it's not a horse because the communities don't agree that it's called a horse? I'm so confused as to what kind of critical thinking he intends to arouse here.Don't get me started with the whole chapters about computers either. They were insufferable. I only understood several bits but I didn't get the whole gist (I asked myself ""so what?"" so often).One thing that drove me to not give a complete 1 star rating is his analysis on free will and determinism, and he successfully distinguishes the determinism question from moral responsibility inquiry. Perhaps that was the only new thing I learned from reading the book aside from thinking ""Yep I've known this before"" or ""What the hell does this even mean?""(edit: rating down from 3 to 2 because apparently 3 means ""liked it"" and I did not like it so...)"
140,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16074924-dan-smith,3,"This book missells itself, and has its flaws, but it's worth reading if only to encourage the reader to turn a critical eye on Dennett's own arguments.Let's get one thing out of the way, an Intuition Pump is a thought experiment as far as I can see, and giving it another label (something Dennett's denigrates in other thought experiments - see his relabelling of Mr Puppet as Captain Autonomy) changes nothing other than the rhetoric. It's all a case of My Pump Pumps Harder Than Yours, and it's a bit cheap.And another thing: this in no way contains ""70 ways to make you think better"". A few generic philosophical tools at the start are fine, but the rest are specific thought experiments to prove or disprove a point, or deconstructions of another philosopher's argument. It's a quality set of disparate points, coalescing around meaning, evolution, free will and consciousness.There's a lot of begging the question going on here - the Puppet / Autonomy label a case in point: Dennett correctly identifies the unsubtle characterisation of a person in a free-will thought experiment, but then seeks to prove his case by doing just the same. His central thesis is also curiously void at heart: I get his analysis of ever more complex ""thinking"" machines and how they could be equated to our own brains, with comparable levels of thought. But all it does is set up a comparison: why make the jump and say they must be the same? Why does this tell us anything about what consciousness is? It might do, but it can't get further than saying ""I've shown you a similar system, a computer, which has the same theoretical structure as your brain. We can't see the consciousness in my example, so... you see...? *pump pump* There! I have explained consciousness!""The thing is, I get everything he says and I sorta (to borrow his convenient fuzzy phrase) agree. But I end up not thinking he's really solved anything.He also has a frustrating habit of falling into the same rhetorical tricks as ones he painstakingly and smugly criticises others for using. For example, he spends a while constructing and example of humans constructing robots to house their cryogenic bodies, giving those robots instructions and degrees of autonomy. Fun. He then declares ""but what I have shown you is no different to genes using our bodies to replicate!"" Really? I see some parallels, and they're sorta similar, but so?It's like trying to nail down jelly. Yes, I see what you've shown me, but every time you get close to a key issue, you sorta wobble, sorta allow the nail in, and then sorta ignore it.This may be the key problem with all this sorta comparisons and thought experiments. If you're minded to agree, you see the example and agree with it. If you disagree, you'll either pick it apart (if you can) or say that it's all. All well as far as it goes but it doesn't *prove* the point.I did like his ""anything you can do, I can do meta. I can do many thing meta than you"" line. Alas, this only inspired me to think of e whole thing as this: A Metaphor? Yes, fine, but what's a meta *for*?"
141,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30039874-ap,3,"I did not finish this book (read about 2/3).Interesting, but I could do with a condensed version. I don't feel like I missed the main gist, but the details were not absorbed. It is well written, and if I had followed it and finished it, I probably would rate it higher.The book is about thinking about how we think, and tools that we can use to help (or also boomcrutches, which hinder) those processes.I got lost at the end of Part I, when it got super computery. The evolution discussions of Part II were interesting, but I got lost in that, too, before it finished. In the final part, I was lost from the get-go. The main points I have so far- Break assumptions and logics down to their most basic components, to find flaws or inconsistencies.- Making mistakes is the best way to learn. Embrace it.- Everything is dependent on context. There is no hidden or deeper meanings to things.- The original intention of nearly everything is survival.- Be aware of your emotional attachments to ideas.Some useful tools: - be fair, point out pros and cons of others work, demonstrate what you learned from it before you criticize it. - don't waste time critiquing mediocrity. - simple is best. - know the system so you can step outside of it to subvert it. - remember that brains can have little in common, but still have similar intentions. Even similar intentions will use data very differently. - There is no common structure in the huamn brain that funnels in ""meaning."" Good points in the book: - Meaning is not inherent or tangible. It is stored in the brain, but not like data.  - Folk psychology - the most important patterns in our images -- gives us a foundation to interpret the word around us. It is culturally dependent, not genetic. It is the way we tend to pattern and interpret, based on how others around us do it. - There is no wonder tissue in our brains -- stop looking for top-down approaches to explain humans, consciousness, etc. We are not magical miracles. We are bottom-up, mechanical processes that internetwork in growing webs of complexity to create the people and cultures around us. - Evolution challenges the top-down approach, with unintelligent, aimless design (bent only on survival).Some boomcrutches: - inconvenient facts are conveniently swept away/ignored. - using false dichotomies to make it seem like there are only two alternatives. - set up exagerated strawman of someone's argument, then refute that as if it was their real argument. - subtle inclusion of irrelevent things to weaken their argument. - using words or phrases that sound deep but are vague or trivial. - be wary when someone uses the word ""surely"" or asks a rhetorical question in their argument."
142,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11254454-arensb,4,"An intuition pump, in Dennett's sense, is an analogy or metaphor that helps us to think about a harder problem.For instance imagine a whimsical jailer who goes around while the prisoners are asleep, and unlocks all the doors and leaves them that way for a few hours. Are the prisoners free to escape? The idea is not so much to answer this particular question, but to play with it and use it to help us analyze a more complex problem.In Intuition Pumps, Dennett introduces several dozen such intuition pumps and other mental tools, as well as some pitfalls (e.g., the seductive analogy that misleads us into accepting the wrong conclusion), forming a good introduction to philosophy for the interested amateur.He does concentrate on three areas: evolution, consciousness, and free will. Make of this what you will: he might be flogging his personal interests, or he might just be trying to avoid mistakes by presenting students with examples from the areas he knows best. I tend to lean toward the latter, but if you're bored silly by the very idea of discussions on free will, you may want to just skip Chapter VIII.All in all, this book is a good and lucid introduction to philosophy, including why it matters, and why even lay people can and should engage in it: when done correctly, and not just as an exercise in navel-gazing with five-dollar words, it's basically a way of thinking straight, and avoid reasoning errors.ETA: The section on computing and Turing machines is at best inaccurate and at worst misleading. The central message, that modern computers don't do anything that a Turing machine couldn't do, is correct. Yes, virtual machines are a real, and even useful, thing. And yes, a Turing machine can run a virtual version of your desktop PC and do everything it does, albeit at a ridiculously low speed.I think Dennett confuses virtualization with abstraction. Virtualization is the process of making one computer behave like another one. For instance, if you wanted to play your old Apple II games, you could set up a virtual Apple II on your desktop PC. That is, a program on your PC would pretend to be an Apple II, so that that virtual Apple II could run your old games.Abstraction, on the other hand, is, roughly, the process of hiding the low-level details from the programmer, who can ignore the small stuff and get on with making the program do what she really wants. As time goes on, more and more things are considered low-level.To hear Dennett explain it, though, you might think that programmers pile virtual machine upon virtual machine, rather than abstraction upon abstraction."

In this sentence, finished is defined as ""I visually examined each page, including preface, introduction, and appendix but excluding sources, bibliography, and the majority of the index."" Note that there is nothing in this definition about comprehension, or understanding. That is because for one definition of ""finished"" (the definition I have chosen to use in this book review), the focus is on completion without concerns about understanding, knowledge, or the ability to disseminate the information received to others of similar (or any) level of knowledge. With me so far? Yes? I'm impressed. No? That's about how I felt for this entire book. Originally I purchased this book on a whim because I loved the phrase ""intuition pumps"" and thought it would have helpful tools for more articulate discussions in debates. And it does, but only if you're a philosopher. Dennett writes about philosophical debates on the nature of consciousness, free will, and meaning but with examples so abstract and metaphysical they'd be almost impossible to use in a conversation with laymen. That's not a bad thing, but judging from this book there's a huge gap between an interested layman and the entry level philosophy student this book is aimed at. I thought I was a reasonably well educated layman. I thought I would be able to make the stretch to entry level student. I could not. There were still a great many things I enjoyed. The concept of intuition pumps (61), the discussion of Occam's Razor(38) and Occam's Broom(40), Boom Crutches(48), learning about register machines(109). Although I still don't understand how a register machine could be useful as a thinking tool, unless maybe it's to internalize the process of reducing a particular activity down to its most basic operations to see if you could get a simple machine (or a cascade of simple machines) to perform the same job, without understanding it or even knowing what they are doing? Dennet holds that often what we assume is irreducible complexity could actually be performed (albeit more slowly) by sufficient layers of the most basic computers (loosely paraphrased from p 139). That's an interesting, terrifying idea. Terrifying because now I can't argue that we aren't all zombies, or robots. This book left me with more questions than answers, and more confusion than when I started reading it. I guess that's a good thing? I don't regret reading it, but only now that it's over. "
144,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,3,"Dennett enumerates some ``tools for thinking'', elaborates on some intuition pumps (a term he coined in 1980 which I guess is legitimate), explains why some apparent intuition pumps are counterproductive (and are instead what he calls ``boom crutches''), and applies the whole thing, inevitably, to philosophy of the mind.If Dennett's book broadly fall into two categories—moderately compelling pop sci that's basically solid but just wrong enough to annoy every reader in at least one way (Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Breaking the Spell), and intensely boring philosophy wank (Consciousness Explained, most of the rest)—Intuition Pumps &c. straddles the boundary. Parts of it are fair enough, but a lot of it is given over to tedious bullshit, a lot of which exemplifies why I feel philosophers are a waste of space: almost all of the thought experiments he finds so daunting turn out to be meaningless or trivial, and though career philosophers can arguably be forgiven for failing to recognise a thought experiment as meaningless (philosophy departments wouldn't exist if they couldn't), failing to recognise trivial ones is prety damned embarrassing for someone who's made this sort of thing his career for literally almost twice as long as I've existed.†Also, his position on free will is still basically wrong-headed, though it isn't more so than most things that have been written on the subject. He's clearly approaching a more sensible position, but at the pace he's going he'll be dead before he gets there.That said, the bits that are fair enough are, indeed, fair enough, and he manages to pull off aspects on which I expected a much worse performance (there's an entire set of chapters on computers and AI (proper CS AI, not philosophy AI), for example) surprisingly well. If every philosopher were only as bad as Dan Dennett, I wouldn't be nearly as bitter about their existence.(I also really appreciate that Gould is brought up as three instances of doing it wrong. Too many people Americans hold him in high regard, and it needs to stop.)---† I don't intend to stoop to their level and get into particulars here; most people who read my reviews know me well enough that I hope they'll give me some credit and accept that I'm not likely to be full of shit. If you end up reading Intuition Pumps and want to discuss any of it, feel free to contact me."
145,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11446002-dan,4,"Daniel Dennett is so committed to approachable philosophy one of his primary pillars is the use of interested laypeople as ""decoys"" in philisophical debate, so that philosophers are forced to explain their assumptions and the parameters of their ideas more rigorously. Consequently, his book is quite approachable to interested folks outside of philosophy.Dennett is also among the ""Four Horsemen of New Atheism"" so if that's going to irritate the hell out of you, definitely give this book a pass.I'll see if any of the thinking tools Dennett prescribes prove useful to me, and adjust to a 3 star or 5 star accordingly, if warranted. Initially, I think they will be useful. Taken together, the tools tend to emphasize the practical application over theoretical purity. Dennett very quickly gives up on/dismisses some of the big questions that excite people, such as ""Why is there something rather than nothing?"" (which he calls a pseudo-problem unworthy of inquiry). Philosophical ""qualia"" and ""zombies"" also get heaps of scorn from him. For him, the notion of ""free will"" that is used in courts should be enough for us: people never act independently from their context, but usually act with enough autonomy to be held accountable for those actions.Emblematic of his reliance on working-definitions and practical application is his repeated (sometimes tiresomely) use of the adjective ""sorta"". To him, getting into definitional arguments about the absolute limits of self, freedom, word definitions almost instantly become trivial as they search for fine distinctions that simply don't exist. Instead, just say someone is ""sorta"" thinking or ""sorta"" independent and move on.Finally, Dennett overflows with enthusiasm for both the evolutionary model and for computing. The evolutionary section of the book seemed useful and central to his main points but the extensive chapters on computing, including workbook-style programming problems to solve in a simple, theoretical model of a computer perplexed me. They seemed long and indulgent and I kept waiting for them to become relevant to the rest of the book. I never felt like they did.Overall, a worthwhile read, so long as I can remember some of his pumps and the ideas I had in response to them."

If you have some patience, you'll finish with clearer ways to examine and express your own thoughts -- or, at least, that's how I felt.There are some admittedly shocking jumps in difficulty. More than once I found myself, after twenty pages of lucid explanations, coming across a paragraph I had to read five times just to make certain I had understood it... and even then I wouldn't have bet money on it. This is the kind of book that will make you feel confident one moment and absurdly out of your depth the next. When you're jumping from physics, biology, computer science and cognitive psychology, that may just be the nature of the beast, but it fortunately never feels as though Dennett is being an obscurantist. He values lucidity, and by the end of this thing I was grateful.Dennett manages to glide from one mind-bending mystery to another and address each with wit, clarity, and frightening intelligence. It's impressive that a man so fiercely bright can keep his work from being too intimidating: his tone is that of a kindly uncle, guiding you with patience through some of the most difficult conundrums your brain can handle.While this was sometimes dense to the point that it hurt my head, if you find any of the topics interesting you'll be missing out on a feast for your brain if you don't give Intuition Pumps a shot."
147,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,3,"On the back of a very uninspiring month, following two really inspired months, I wanted a book that might reliably be jumper cables for my brain. A collection of thought experiments and ways of thinking to think about thinking, seemed beyond perfect. It wasn’t. It did get me thinking about why it wasn’t though. What are the qualities of something that is thought-provoking? At one extreme, I might argue everything and nothing is thought provoking, and all provocation is in the thought of the thinker. I’m uninspired in general, this didn’t inspire me. I was inspired in general, everything inspired me, especially the James Gleick books. At the other extreme, I have no role, and the content has objective thought-provoking qualities. If this is even partially true, where do those qualities lie? I was provoked by very few of these intuition pumps, some were novel thought experiments that I haven’t come across before. Some were literal about the knobs available to be turned one by one to reveal the underlying dependence of the pump. Some revealed that I might just have a bias against the phrasing, intuition pump, exemplified by the use in this unfortunate sentence ‘engage in mutual intuition pumping’. Mostly I was underwhelmed by my experience. It didn’t get me ‘thinking elegantly about hard questions’, as much as it told me how Daniel Dennett thinks elegantly about hard questions, with most chapters seeming to me how Frank Johnson’s colorblind Mary thought experiment seemed to DD, an answer writ large on the front of the envelope, having nothing to open up and discover, because it’s anyway just an empty envelope. It’s interesting to consider the strong possibility that, having pointed this out in Frank Johnson’s experiment, DD took immense pains not to fall into the same trap of experiment construction, placing most of the resultant emptiness squarely on the shoulders of dumb readers like myself. I’ll have more evidence once I go back to another James Gleick book immediately and compare my mental processes. NotesWhat separates ignorance from willful subterfuge? Take the chapter on Gould, and his use of ‘rathering’ to create false dichotomies. I find myself doing that all the time, not because I’m trying to fabricate polarization, but because I haven’t realized that the apparent dichotomy collapses under many subtle conditions. Rapaport Laws: How to criticize an idea. First rephrase it in a way that the other person appreciates as complete and accurate yet new. Then point out agreements. Then point out things you can borrow to make your own idea stronger. Only then criticize. Occam’s Broom: Only experts can figure out what evidence has been left out, as opposed to what’s been presented. That’s why conspiracy theories are so compelling, sweeping all inconvenient data under the carpet, where normal people won’t spot the omissions. Sturgeon’s Law: 90% of everything is garbage. Criticizing something for being bad is a terrible idea, because 90% of everything is bad. Focus on what’s good. Rathering: Create false dichotomies saying evolution does not proceed by X, rather by Y, when in case these 2 are not mutually exclusive, while you make it sound that wayPeople use ‘surely’ at the edge of their knowledge, or things they take for granted and are hoping you do too.Is understanding your psychology like the comments that coders put on source code, meant to understand the code but not at all affecting how the computer reads and executes it.‘Slippery Slope’ is often just a moat disguised as slippery slope. The line between two opposites is often thin, that makes us uncomfortable, so we create a buffer zone around it, razor wire, moat, and say the first foot into that buffer zone leads to a slippery slope. ‘Spontaneous intrusion’ the effect that we have, smells, shadows, weights etc that a virtual rendition has to meticulously add after creating our basic shapes. Nonfunctional noise, shed dust, leave wake, causes vibrations etc. Why do we need this when creating AI? Collisions induce creativityMemes needn’t increase fitness of host. Religion must be good for something because it’s everywhere? Some things are just good for themselves.Planiverse, more elegant version of FlatlandRock Paper Scissors, winning strategy is true randomness. How to achieve it without a random number generator?Evolution has given us practical unpredictability, burden of proof should be on those who say that free will requires total unpredictability. Conway Game Of Life: Since physics of this world are clear, it’s deterministic and can chart out entire future given a certain start position. But the past isn’t possible, there are too many possible states for each preceding step that quickly snowballs into infinite combos.Lottery A: sell tickets, then select winner. Fair? B: select winner, sell tickets. Have I sold losing tickets purposely? Ultimately they are the same thing, as long as I don’t know which is winner, every person has an equal chance of winning? True statements from history that cannot be proved, like Caesar thought of salad on June 1st. Godel? Similarly, must be true that Sherlock has or has not a mole on shoulder, but can’t be proved. Faustian bargains: 1) Solve problem once and for all laying it to rest, or complex work that will be debated for long time? Scientists pick A, Philosophers picked B. 2) Uncontroversial right thing, like Calculus/DNA Helix (Crick, but Linus P would’ve got there too), or very controversial hotly-discussed mostly wrong thing like Lamarck, Cartesian duality etc. Chomsky’s syntactical structures, while mostly wrong, birthed many descendent correct theories that have nothing to do with it, like hummingbird having nothing to do with dinosaurs. Was Chomsky wrong?Sophisticated naive auto-anthropology: start with axioms of folk beliefs held by me known to be false, try to resolve contradictions (like siphons, pipettes etc). Naive naive auto-anthropology, start with axioms trying to get to an objective truth.

Leaves cricket on threshold, goes in checks burrow, comes back out and drags it in. If the cricket is moved a little by malevolent biologist, it will bring it back to threshold, go back in and check burrow again. Does this over and over, never remembering that it has already checked the burrow. Later found that many don't, it's not some universal phenomena. Still, interesting parallels to be found. "
148,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/445677-scott,5,"At this point, it has been nearly 25 years since I read Douglas Hofstadter and Daniel Dennett's anthology, ""The Mind's I,"" as part of a philosophy class on artificial intelligence at the University of Pittsburgh. One of the most-enduring essays in that volume was Dennett's ""Where am I?"", a tour-de-force of a thought experiment that became a cultural referent, the ""brain in a vat"" controlling a body containing a substitute brain via radio waves. Dennett would refer to such a construction as an ""intuition pump,"" a contrived situation created to test the reader's thoughts and assumptions about an idea. Each of his ""intuition pumps"" has ""knobs,"" or circumstances and details, that can be adjusted and changed so that the reader can explore the idea as much (or, as little) as desired. This volume collects many of Dennett's best intuition pumps from across his long and fruitful career as a philosopher. Often Dennett's exposition is new, and his writing is remarkably free from undue resorts to the sophisticated/abstruse language of academic philosophy. However, the simplicity and clarity of his writing to the lay person does not detract from the deep exploration of ideas on what it means to know something, can a computer be intelligent and think like us, the difficulties people have conceiving of evolution, and why evolution makes sense, what it means to be conscious, and do we ultimately have free will (and does it matter?). He also concludes with a few brief notes about the practice of philosophy, and encouragement (and cautionary tales) for those who might consider a career in the field.The intuition pumps presented are brief; many can be easily read in under 30 minutes time. However, each one of them can be re-read and explored in considerable detail, and many academic careers have been fruitfully spent working through the implications of these topics, attempting to find challenges and refutations to and support for these arguments. Highly recommended for all who have an interest in thinking about thinking and have at least a casual curiosity about philosophy."
149,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82933807-donald-thomann,3,"Intuition Pumps does what it claims to do in the title: Give you a number of thinking tools that you can apply across a wide variety of topics. It falls short, though, in two major ways, which really affected my enjoyment of the book overall compared to other books that in effect do the same thing. The first is that a lot of the chapters don't mix or follow one another particularly well, and at times this just comes off like a series of blog posts. As a result the whole thing feels pretty disjointed and without any kind of central, unifying theme. The sections break down roughly to logical philosophy, evolutionary biology, consciousness, etc. but the subject categories feel mostly artificial. Which brings me to the second, more important point...These are all fairly standard tools in any advanced thinker's tool kit, and invaluable tools to a noob like myself just beginning to dive into these topics. However, the tools seem so abstracted and disjointed that it becomes hard to understand how to apply them in real situations. Let's say you know very little about automobiles, carpentry and plumbing. If you entered a garage where all the tools required for these three professions were available to you, wall to wall, floor to ceiling, you'd have everything you needed to build some stuff. However, you wouldn't have the raw materials needed to actually build anything, nor would you have the knowledge of how to use the tools or apply them properly even if you did. That's how this book felt to me. It's too basic for advanced thinkers and too abstracted and removed from practical application to be useful to an amateur. Dennett throws you a bunch of nuts and bolts and wrenches and belt sanders and crimpers and clamps without giving you the instruction manual with the image of the final product and the exploded view. All that said, I think this would be a perfect read as a companion to more concrete reading material on any of these subjects, or as a massive textbook where each tool could be applied more extensively."
150,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39894105-nestor-leal,3,"This book title was a little misguiding. I like thought experiments which are called intuition pumps in here. Turns out only a few pages are dedicated to these thinking tools then they are applied to the concepts of consciousness, free will, determinism, evolution and the mind. I like to think and philosophize about these things too but the book should have been named otherwise. Some chapters are boring to people (like me) who already know binary code, assembler language and in general how computers work. On the other hand these chapters will help the untrained to learn how they work. At the end, understanding how computers work will help you understand how many things in nature are computer like, ie. our body cells.At times it seemed like this is a good philosophy companion book to The Selfish Gene which is mostly science. There are many references to Richard Dawkins’ work and even to the game theory used in his book. In fact, Dennett states that science and philosophy should go hand in hand, to which I agree, so it makes sense. I didn’t like the arrogant tone of Daniel Dennett and how the criticizes other philosophers. Still it is an ok book.I liked his idea of making good mistakes. Learning about our mistakes is always good for improvement. Mistakes, when understood correctly, help us advance even further. This is not new but mostly nobody likes to be pointed out their mistakes except when they accept and acknowledge this will greatly help them. Still it’s better to make big mistakes than stupid mistakes.Well, reading this book seemed like a good idea at the time!"

The author, a philosopher, uses the tools of philosophy to fill in the blanks about how we proceed with science.The book starts off by how we sometimes can be mislead by 'intuition pumps"", thought experiments, and how we should correctly use them. He sets up the listener in how to think about problems and then delves into some big problems, such as design within the universe and what does it mean, and what is consciousness and how to think about it.The author is a philosopher but is much more interested in understanding the scientific method as opposed to the meaning of words.I've listened to most of the science books audible has available and a book like this helps me see beyond just the science but also how to think about the science.This author had a theme throughout this whole book. That the start of all understanding first comes about by realizing the role of evolution in the design of all non-trivial systems.I will read more of this author's work. P.S. I did end up reading more of this author's work, and it made me disappointed in this book, because he copies most of this book from his other books.

152,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5078550-robert-bor,4,"Daniel Dennett's work is not usually within my range of interest. I find the abstract nature of philosophy and it sometimes outlandish discussions to be uninteresting. However, this work is surely an exception. It takes together two aspects which interest me a lot, computer programming and evolution theory. Meaning, consciousness and free will are attacked using various utilities (called intuition pumps) which help thinking about the problems. Useless utilities (called crutch booms) are systematically destroyed. Mr Dennett relentlessly works towards (stopping just short of saying it) showing how the human mind is a beautiful and well-designed (yes, design can be used again, although it is design-without-a-designer) series of systems that all take care of their own and together form complex, conscious, free-willing systems, such as our minds. Note that Mr Dennett nowhere says this is actually the case, but between the lines, this looks to be the winner he is betting on. Mr Dennett also uses this book both as a means to reinforce real or perceived victories against philosophical enemies. I don't really get those, but it's probably part of the in-crowd show."

If they were, we would've figured them out long ago. Daniel Dennett's book offers a plethora of Thinking Tools drawn from computer science, biology and many other realms which, like the apps on your phone, give you the power to do more things better - to think difficults thoughts more easily, and even tackle the most difficult questions about meaning and consciousness. It's designed to change your way of thinking and to nudge you out of some ultimately wrong intuitions you may hold.

Giant robot intuition pump addresses this question. - p166Excellent summary of theory of meaning on p197-198:""And what are the verdicts of this long section on meaning? A mixture of pessimism and optimism. Meaning isn't going to turn out to be a simple property that maps easily onto brains, and we're not going to find ""deeper"" facts anywhere that just settle the question of what a sentence, or a thought, or a belief really means. The best we can do–and it is quite good enough–is to find and anchor (apparently) best interpretations of all the physical-stance (and design-stance) data we have. If we can find one solution to a Quinian quandary about meaning, we have almost certainly found the solution–in the sense that we may be confident that no better solution lies undiscovered. As the two-bitser's move to Panama showed, meaning is always relative to a context of function, and there need be no original intentionality beyond the intentionality of our (sorta) selfish genes, which derive their sorta intentionality from the functional context of evolution by natural selection, instead of from an Intelligent Designer playing the role of our rich client ordering a giant robot. And the intuition pump about the two black boxes shows that the intentional stance, with all its tolerance of sorta beliefs and their ilk, is not optional if you want to understand and explain many of the causal regularities in the world.Our investigations into these issues are greatly enhanced, here in the twenty-first century, by the fact that, for the first time, we have ways of thinking rigorously and vigorously about mechanisms with trillions of moving parts–parts that work in unmysterious ways. Thanks to Turing, we can at least dimly see a path now, from brute uncomprehending matter (the physical stance) via a cascade of rearrangements (the design stance, and sorta meanings) to an appreciation of ourselves as paradigmatic believers, knowers, understanders (simplified by the intentional stance as intentional systems).""Darwin's theory of evolution unites meaning with matter: ""On one side, we have the world of our mods and their meanings [...] On the other side, we have galaxies ceaselessly wheeling, planets falling pointlessly into their orbits, lifeless chemical mechanisms doing what their physics ordains, all without purpose or reason. Then Darwin comes along and shows us how the former arises from the latter, creating meaning as it goes, a bubble-up vision of the birth of importance to overthrow the trickle-down vision of tradition."" - p201Library of Mendel / Library of Babel: set of all possible permutations of DNA base-pairs / characters in the Roman alphabet.

162,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9310150-quiver,5,"Dennett courts controversy in a number of places by calling out his colleagues for being inaccurate or a little to lax with their methods of thought. His is also excessively wordy, to the point where I occasionally believed a short, single paragraph would get his idea across much better. I appreciate the examples and the historical anecdotes, though they really should have been optional whenever not directly crucial for transmitting the gist of the intuition pump.Despite all of the above, Dennet's book is trove of useful starting points. They really are starting points however: the intuition pumps are general tools that the reader needs to mull over, adopt and adapt, before slowly applying to life and academic thinking. And it's hard work, if you want to do it seriously—I've tried and it's paid off, a little. The main message is this: if you are interested in improving the sharpness of your mental edge, Dennett's book will indicate a few of the segments where you're being obtuse (dictionary meanings 1 and 3 intended). So the book won't even show you all the segments, let alone how to really sharpen them. But that's why you then go and read other books that will. It's always about climbing one rung at a time; Dennett's is an excellent rung. For that I recommend it to most people. Five stars."
163,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"In this book, Daniel Dennett covers a bit of everything he has studied: evolution / consciousness / free will / meaning / AI. I agree with another reviewer who says, ""reading this book is basically like reading Daniel Dennett in blog format."" Unlike the reviewer, I have less problem with it. Perhaps it's because I am more like a casual reader than a student in philosophy. Each intuition pump (thought experiment) discussed is relatively independent of each other, making the book friendly to a reader who reads in fragmented time. Dennett does not demonstrate ""turning all the knobs to examine a thought experiment"" in every chapter. But when he does the trick, it is often enjoyable and inspirational. To make use of this method myself, however, may require lots of practice. A few chapters I like the most and will probably re-read in the future: 	• Trapped in the Robot Control Room	• The Seven Secrets of Computer Power Revealed (on register machine) 	• Noise in the Virtual Hotel	• Mary the Color Scientist	• Dennet's intepreation of Conway's Game of Life	• The Boys from Brazil"

165,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,5,"This book is misleadingly titled  - it should be called Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking like Daniel Dennett. But no harm done.Having previously only heard of Daniel Dennett in context of his status as one of the four horsemen of the New Atheism movement, I picked up this book from Kinokuniya blind - expecting it to be a general sort of empirically-minded self-improvement book for honing your thinking techniques. Instead, I got a thinly-veiled overview of Dennett's various philosophical positions over meaning, consciousness, complexity, and free will, which are explained using such thinking tools as Dennett recommends that the reader cultivate. The subtext being that if the reader were only to apply the correct thinking tools, she would naturally reach the same, or similar, conclusions, that Dennett has.The central thinking tool in the box is really the intuition pump, a kind of thinking experiment cunningly worded and framed to get the reader to come to a desired conclusion by appealing to his or her intuitions. The term was coined by Dennett and many examples are prominently featured in this book, given such whimsically memorable names as the Curse of the Cauliflower and the Zombic Hunch. A famous example of an intuition pump (and one Dennett savages) is the Chinese Room experiment - in which one imagines a man using a set of algorithmic translation rules to translate Chinese questions into English in order to answer them. However, at no point in this process does the man actually understand the inputs - he merely acts upon them based on a set of instructions. The point of this thought experiment is to pump the intuition that - like the man in the Chinese room - computers that use algorithms to process data do not truly understand them - ergo, consciousness (i.e. understanding) cannot arise out of a set of algorithms designed to simulate its functions.The intuition pump is really a double edged sword, however, and can be used to both illuminate and mislead. This is because intuition pumps are by their very nature abstractions of philosophical problems - they simplify conditions to make it easier to think about a thing - and in some cases, to think about a thing the way the creator intended. Dennett tells us to interrogate intuition pumps by turning the knobs - in other words, changing some of the conditions or assumptions of the intuition pump and seeing if the same intuitions are pumped out. Even as Dennett presents his own intuition pumps, he also deconstructs pumps that have been devised by others. He calls misleading intuition pumps boom crutches, deliberately malappriopriating (see what I did there?) the nautical term for these anti-thinking tools that are designed to shut down thinking.Ultimately, however, after a few short chapters laying out his toolbox, Dennett begins the methodical quest of introducing the reader to his brand of philosophical thought. Dennett's positions on various matters - cognition, free will, consciousness - can be boiled down to the idea that these ideas - held by some philosophers to reside in the sacred space of epistemological inscrutability- can actually be explained with a mundane scientific approach. The hard questions are procedurally hard - but not unsolvable using scientific inquiry. In plain language, it simply means that things like consciousness or free will can be explained or described in the framework of material reality, and there is no need to posit some imagined higher substrate of reality - such as positing that consciousness manifests beyond the physical mind - in order to understand such phenomena.It's hard to distill Dennett's ideas into one paragraph, but an example of this approach is Dennett's deconstruction of the Chinese Room. That thought experiment holds that consciousness cannot manifest out of algorithms, which are ostensibly what the mind, in Dennett's model of cognition, uses - i.e. strong, conscious AI is not possible. Dennett's dictum, on the other hand, is that software, sufficiently advanced (and operating on a sufficiently complex hardware stratum like the brain), approximates consciousness to such a level of fidelity that it is indistinguishable from consciousness, and in fact, is consciousness, and in actual fact is precisely what consciousness is in reality.Think about the idea of the philosophical zombie - a being that acts and talks so like a human being that it is indistinguishable from one, except that it has no internal world, no consciousness - and elevate it to the idea of the zimboe - another philosophical creature that simulates second-order beliefs that it is a conscious thinking being, when it actually isn't. A zimboe looks, acts, and feels - or thinks it feels - like a real human being - but it doesn't actually think anything. Dennett's argument is that the zimboe is the logical outcropping of the idea that there can be p-zombies that approximate human complexity, but at that level of fidelity it would be impossible for a zimboe to be distinguished from a human being, by any means. Rather than posit some ethereal essence of consciousness, Dennett argues, why not just eliminate the need for that as-yet-undiscovered substrate and go straight to the Occam's-Razor solution - that the zimboe concept is incoherent because a sufficiently complex bundle of computational processes - i.e. the zimboe - already possesses, by dint of its mental complexity, consciousness?Back to the Chinese Room - Dennett's point is that the flaw of the intuition pump is that it doesn't specify how complex the algorithms operated upon by the man must be to make it so that the questioners who are asking the questions in Chinese are satisfied that the answers they get are from a thinking entity. Dennett's intuition is that they would have to be astoundingly complex - more complex than would be possible for one man and a pencil to analyse in any reasonable time horizon. As such, the Chinese Room thought experiment is bust because it fails to account for the possibility that the set of algorithmic instructions would only be physically possible to operationalise on a substrate capable enough to elevate it to a level in which it could be described to ""understand"" its instructions - which could approximate something like consciousness.Dennett applies this same set of thinking tools to different fields - thinking about meaning, evolution, free will. In each case Dennett purports to banish the veil of mysticism that some drape over seemingly intractable problems, and shows that they are really resolvable with the application of tried-and-true thinking methods. Another interesting example is Dennett's stance on free will. Dennett is really a compatibilist - he holds that free will is compatible with determinism. How? Simple - the kind of philosophically ideal free will that some imagine we must possess to rightly be called free is an incoherent concept. Barring quantum indeterminacy, at some level the rules of physics determine the course of the universe - that is determinism. However, reality is so complex that the kind of ""free will"" some would characterise as being required to be truly free is not required to make meaningful decisions. Dennett characterises the difference as being between a sufficiently advanced pseudo-random number generator (one that generates a random list of numbers using a series of step by step algorithms) and a ""true"" random number generator. Sufficiently advanced, there is no compelling reason to choose the latter, unless you plan to play chess with an omniscient God that can predict your every move. But who needs, or wants, that kind of ideal freedom? Free will is not a binary - it is a spectrum, and what free will we have is sufficient for our purposes down to the subatomic level.I've gone off on a bit of a tangent here - but I should be somewhat embarrassed to admit that Dennett gives voice to some of my own intuitions about mind, consciousness, and free will. I find myself agreeing with him to a very large and almost embarrassing extent. Far from being accused of being overly impressionistic, however, I should caveat that the irony of my reading experience of Dennett's tome is that I didn't glean my philosophical insights from his intuition pumps, but really from how my own intuitions corroborated with his conclusions. Dennett, here, was in effect preaching to the choir. And even more ironic was that I came away with a sneaking suspicion that his intuition pumps were simply not especially effective in conveying the point in  a watertight manner. But I suppose that is a suspicion that fosters itself. Intuition pumps are by nature unwieldy thinking tools - ripe for abuse or misuse, abstracted in ways that cloud judgment, with too many hypotheticals and variables. Are Dennett's own pumps immune to this kind of thing? Probably not. He has an easier job of it though - his positions are fundamentally more parsimonious - after all, he is arguing from the standpoint of ""possibility"" - which requires less epistemological certainty than to declare a thing ""impossible"". It is possible to conceive of consciousness, evolution and free will in terms of physical laws, and this is how it is possible to conceive of them. They may be the wrong models - perhaps consciousness does exist as a floaty-substrate, by Dennett's own admission. But Dennett doesn't have to show that his model is correct - he just has to show that it is possible to think of them as being grounded in empirics. His critics often have to show that a thing is impossible to characterize in terms of physical reality - which requires some boom crutch-y sleight of hand and other such mental breakdancing. It is impossible that consciousness is rooted in the physical world - here is inductive proof in the form of a hypothetical! Forgive me if I don't find that particularly convincing.But I ramble. Dennett's book can describe all these jumbled thoughts better than I can. Go read it, regardless of your metaphysical inclinations. I think you'll probably get something out of it. At the very least, the chance to turn some of Dennett's knobs at his invitation.I give this book: 4.5 out of 5 Sphexes"
166,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92557747-fi,3,"Not going to lie, this had been a slow read for me. The main reason is the brief misalignment of expectation at the beginning. When I saw ""over 70 tools to help you think better"", the image of a list of bite-size fun facts came to mind. Certainly it was not going to be.Daniel C Dennett is one of the most active, serious, provocative and original philosophers in the English speaking world today. So no, his work is not child's play. In Intuition Pumps, he introduced a range of thought experiments, then gradually piled on new and more complex layers. Some were for supporting his views in topics like Thinking and Meaning; some were used to confront other thinkers on topics such as Religion and Free Will.I paused many many times to break down the ideas, to try to understand and to apply them in my world. How can I find holes in which argument at what time... And it had proven to be very difficult. What I did, therefore, like a school girl, was to memorize the gist of the 77 ideas, hoping I can retrieve and use them some day. I am sure that's not how this book should be read.Part IX ""What is it like to be a Philosopher?"" is my favourite. Liking something, appreciating and studying something is completely different from actually making, doing and living it. And he quoted psychologist David Hebb's rule when he discussed where a philosopher should focus his/her energy:“If it isn’t worth doing, it isn’t worth doing well.”I think this applies to every facet of life.You should read it if▫️You want to learn a set of tools that can improve your critical thinking skills▫️You want an intro on topics like consciousness, meaning, free will, evolution & AI▫️You want an intro on Dennett's view on the above, with high conviction"
167,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2704424-nick-klagge,3,"A very interesting book, but one that I think is not quite sure what it wants to be (to take the ""intentional stance"").Dennett is a philosopher who I know about mostly through his work with Doug Hofstadter, a writer who I really like (""Godel Escher Bach,"" ""Surfaces and Essences""). They have quite similar outlooks, I think--a multidisciplinary approach that takes an interest in what fields like computer science and evolutionary biology can tell us about the nature of the mind, consciousness, and free will.The publisher describes the book as ""offer[ing] seventy-seven of Dennett's most successful 'imagination-extenders and focus-holders' meant to guide you through some of life's most treacherous subject matter: evolution, meaning, mind, and free will."" I think this captures the ambiguity of the book: is it about the tools (the eponymous pumps), or about the subject matter? Dennett would certainly call my question out as an example of ""rathering"" (presentation of a false dichotomy), but I guess my feeling is that the book puts enough focus on each that there is not a fully satisfactory treatment of either. Perhaps the book best serves as entree to Dennett's work--which I think it did well for me.I ended up most interested in his assertions about free will. I have read enough of Hofstadter to be more or less already on board with his (their) views on evolution and consciousness, such as the rejection of the conclusion of Searle's ""Chinese room"" thought experiment. But his views on free will (briefly, that it is compatible with a deterministic universe) are new to me and feel like they are legitimate but also feel like they will take some time to wrap my head around--and the book wasn't long enough for a sufficient treatment.For me, the best intuition that came out of the book is as follows: many philosophical arguments are ultimately ""arguments from incredulity"" (the Chinese room, Jackson's ""What Mary Didn't Know""), and that this is not a trustworthy form of argument. In particular, human intuition is very poorly equipped to handle scales out of the bounds of our normal experience. In each of the examples I gave above, Dennett talks about the crucial role that ""lack of imagination"" plays--Searle's experiment plays down the extreme complexity and multi-layeredness of what would have to be going on by talking about ""scraps of paper,"" and Jackson's argument relies on our inability to understand what it would really mean to acquire ""all possible observational information about visual processing of color."" For Dennett, asking if we can conceive of something is a deceptively difficult challenge--it seems like a question you should be able to answer by simple introspection, but really it requires a lot of work and thinking-tools. If you say you ""can't conceive of"" something, Dennett is likely to say that you aren't working hard enough at it. In the book, Dennett spends a great deal of time talking about Borges' ""Library of Babel,"" and working through different ways of thinking about exactly what type of entity it implies--it's not enough to ""glom together"" the concepts of ""library"" and ""really big,"" because the scale is so far beyond our direct experience of ""big"" that it is really something else altogether.This is why Dennett and Hofstadter get so much mileage out of issues surrounding computing. In a sense, computing operates at scales that are ""inconceivable"" to humans, but on the other hand, it is something that his readers are intimately familiar with. It is this cognitive dissonance that ends up being philosophically productive. It seems ""inconceivable"" to us that a Turing machine made of squares of toilet paper and rocks could, given enough time, run ""Grand Theft Auto,"" but we can also intellectually understand that that is in fact the case."
168,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62274863-phoenix,4,"Danny's Wonderful Tool BoxProfessor and philosopher Dennett starts off with the wonderful project of describing a set of techniques for productive reasoning in philosophy, and presumably in other fields as well. Calling them ""intuition pumps"", they are what physicists ""gedanken"" (thought) experiments which can be tweaked by changing a limited number parameters which Dennet likens to twisting a few ""knobs"". The opposite of a pump is called a ""boom crutch"", which are analogies to be avoided. Intuition pumps can move us forward, boom crutches leave us spinning in circles. In order to keep it simple he disciplined his material by giving it in the form of a course to a group of first year university students, so we are essentially his second class.The project starts off very well. The first section covers about a dozen different concepts such as the value of Trial and Error (fail rapidly and learn from mistakes), Reductio ad Absurdum, Anatol Rapoport's rules for successful criticism, Sturgeon's Law (90% of everything is crap ), joosting (look at problems by ""jumping out of the system"", ie: what would happen if one abandoned phlogiston, or what would a Martian think of this problem), rathering (sliding past a false dichotomy), answering rhetorical questions as the answer may surprise, Occam's Razor, Occam's Broom (watch out for sweeping inconsistencies under the rug), the ""sorta"" operator ( a recommendation against using unnecessary precision) and my favourite, deepidity - a child's neologism for ideas that sound deep (""love"" is just a word) but either is or is not. Dennet seems to approach it as a boom crutch, akin to stupidity, but maybe it can be productive of ideas as well.He then continues with several illustrating scenarios, many of which have to do with the nature of consciousness, for example contrasting the inner and outer reality of what we see, and what do we mean when we ascribe purpose to animals (sphexishness), systems and inanimate objects. Quite a few discussions centre around zombies, robots, replicants and Chinese rooms - if they pass as humans should we truly say that they have an inner life.However the project suddenly runs off the rails about 100 pages in with a 50 page discussion of Turing machines (which, if you've had it before, he invites you to skip) where he urges the reader to hand simulate a computation. How very 80s! Later on even Conway's Game of Life reappears. This is old material that doesn't tell us much about thought and could have been summarized in much less time. And then he does it again in with longer segments on Borges Infinite Library, comparing it to DNA and then evolution. All very nice but it's like listening to your favorite uncle droning on about the old country and not really why we've come to the party.So while promising at first, it does disappoint by being a bit long winded. There are some good nuggets here and there such as the impossible metaphor of a sky hook, the parable of analyzing the behaviour of black boxes, the role of knowledge in fairness of lotteries where the winning ticket is decided before or after the tickets have been sold and ""qualias"" - emotional gestalts associated with colours or objects; tidbits as to why locust population explosions favour prime number intervals and the quasi-myth of ""sphexishness"".In summary, it's good at the beginning and beats the averages of Sturgeon's Law, don't be afraid to judiciously skim. A fine toothed rating for me would be 3.7, but of course your mileage may vary."

At that time, I didn't bother to buy the book, but when a friend said that she bought a copy, I was interested to borrow it and read it to know why that professor really liked this book.My first (and consistent) impression is that if I knew Dennett in real life, we wouldn't go along. We have a very different approach to the way we communicate that I Did Not Understand Most of His Points. The impatient me two months ago, while reading this book, would be furious and think that he was a prime example of male ego who liked to namedrop and mumble about things people don't understand just to sound smart. Today, I give him benefit of the doubt.Listen, I might be dumb, but that doesn't mean I can't learn. I was not a bright student in the Physics class when I was in high school, but I understood Stephen Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" because Hawking is a great communicator and he must've gone a long way to ensuring readers understand what he wrote. Dennett has a very different way of communicating. Example: he never gives a definition of what he discusses, so for those of you who are new to philosophy, good luck guessing what determinism is and why he writes several chapters about examples on compatibilism (the view that determinism and free will might be compatible, not contradictory) before explicitly writing that he is a compatibilist (and even so he doesn't explain what it is. I was lucky because I knew the topics he discusses beforehand).One of the materials that bothers me so much is when he thinks it's mindboggling if a human is unknowingly put into another planet that resembles Earth in every aspect except the way they call a horse. He then questions: so, if she sees an animal resembling horse on that planet but is not a horse, is it actually a horse?This is absolutely ridiculous to me. I think he could've discussed it from philosophy of language point of view, given, you know, that language is social construct so nothing is actually a word? Language is a consensus so if that woman sees a horse-like specimen but is not called a horse.... it's not a horse because the communities don't agree that it's called a horse? I'm so confused as to what kind of critical thinking he intends to arouse here.Don't get me started with the whole chapters about computers either. They were insufferable. I only understood several bits but I didn't get the whole gist (I asked myself ""so what?"" so often).One thing that drove me to not give a complete 1 star rating is his analysis on free will and determinism, and he successfully distinguishes the determinism question from moral responsibility inquiry. Perhaps that was the only new thing I learned from reading the book aside from thinking ""Yep I've known this before"" or ""What the hell does this even mean?""(edit: rating down from 3 to 2 because apparently 3 means ""liked it"" and I did not like it so...)"
170,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16074924-dan-smith,3,"This book missells itself, and has its flaws, but it's worth reading if only to encourage the reader to turn a critical eye on Dennett's own arguments.Let's get one thing out of the way, an Intuition Pump is a thought experiment as far as I can see, and giving it another label (something Dennett's denigrates in other thought experiments - see his relabelling of Mr Puppet as Captain Autonomy) changes nothing other than the rhetoric. It's all a case of My Pump Pumps Harder Than Yours, and it's a bit cheap.And another thing: this in no way contains ""70 ways to make you think better"". A few generic philosophical tools at the start are fine, but the rest are specific thought experiments to prove or disprove a point, or deconstructions of another philosopher's argument. It's a quality set of disparate points, coalescing around meaning, evolution, free will and consciousness.There's a lot of begging the question going on here - the Puppet / Autonomy label a case in point: Dennett correctly identifies the unsubtle characterisation of a person in a free-will thought experiment, but then seeks to prove his case by doing just the same. His central thesis is also curiously void at heart: I get his analysis of ever more complex ""thinking"" machines and how they could be equated to our own brains, with comparable levels of thought. But all it does is set up a comparison: why make the jump and say they must be the same? Why does this tell us anything about what consciousness is? It might do, but it can't get further than saying ""I've shown you a similar system, a computer, which has the same theoretical structure as your brain. We can't see the consciousness in my example, so... you see...? *pump pump* There! I have explained consciousness!""The thing is, I get everything he says and I sorta (to borrow his convenient fuzzy phrase) agree. But I end up not thinking he's really solved anything.He also has a frustrating habit of falling into the same rhetorical tricks as ones he painstakingly and smugly criticises others for using. For example, he spends a while constructing and example of humans constructing robots to house their cryogenic bodies, giving those robots instructions and degrees of autonomy. Fun. He then declares ""but what I have shown you is no different to genes using our bodies to replicate!"" Really? I see some parallels, and they're sorta similar, but so?It's like trying to nail down jelly. Yes, I see what you've shown me, but every time you get close to a key issue, you sorta wobble, sorta allow the nail in, and then sorta ignore it.This may be the key problem with all this sorta comparisons and thought experiments. If you're minded to agree, you see the example and agree with it. If you disagree, you'll either pick it apart (if you can) or say that it's all. All well as far as it goes but it doesn't *prove* the point.I did like his ""anything you can do, I can do meta. I can do many thing meta than you"" line. Alas, this only inspired me to think of e whole thing as this: A Metaphor? Yes, fine, but what's a meta *for*?"
171,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30039874-ap,3,"I did not finish this book (read about 2/3).Interesting, but I could do with a condensed version. I don't feel like I missed the main gist, but the details were not absorbed. It is well written, and if I had followed it and finished it, I probably would rate it higher.The book is about thinking about how we think, and tools that we can use to help (or also boomcrutches, which hinder) those processes.I got lost at the end of Part I, when it got super computery. The evolution discussions of Part II were interesting, but I got lost in that, too, before it finished. In the final part, I was lost from the get-go. The main points I have so far- Break assumptions and logics down to their most basic components, to find flaws or inconsistencies.- Making mistakes is the best way to learn. Embrace it.- Everything is dependent on context. There is no hidden or deeper meanings to things.- The original intention of nearly everything is survival.- Be aware of your emotional attachments to ideas.Some useful tools: - be fair, point out pros and cons of others work, demonstrate what you learned from it before you criticize it. - don't waste time critiquing mediocrity. - simple is best. - know the system so you can step outside of it to subvert it. - remember that brains can have little in common, but still have similar intentions. Even similar intentions will use data very differently. - There is no common structure in the huamn brain that funnels in ""meaning."" Good points in the book: - Meaning is not inherent or tangible. It is stored in the brain, but not like data.  - Folk psychology - the most important patterns in our images -- gives us a foundation to interpret the word around us. It is culturally dependent, not genetic. It is the way we tend to pattern and interpret, based on how others around us do it. - There is no wonder tissue in our brains -- stop looking for top-down approaches to explain humans, consciousness, etc. We are not magical miracles. We are bottom-up, mechanical processes that internetwork in growing webs of complexity to create the people and cultures around us. - Evolution challenges the top-down approach, with unintelligent, aimless design (bent only on survival).Some boomcrutches: - inconvenient facts are conveniently swept away/ignored. - using false dichotomies to make it seem like there are only two alternatives. - set up exagerated strawman of someone's argument, then refute that as if it was their real argument. - subtle inclusion of irrelevent things to weaken their argument. - using words or phrases that sound deep but are vague or trivial. - be wary when someone uses the word ""surely"" or asks a rhetorical question in their argument."
172,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11254454-arensb,4,"An intuition pump, in Dennett's sense, is an analogy or metaphor that helps us to think about a harder problem.For instance imagine a whimsical jailer who goes around while the prisoners are asleep, and unlocks all the doors and leaves them that way for a few hours. Are the prisoners free to escape? The idea is not so much to answer this particular question, but to play with it and use it to help us analyze a more complex problem.In Intuition Pumps, Dennett introduces several dozen such intuition pumps and other mental tools, as well as some pitfalls (e.g., the seductive analogy that misleads us into accepting the wrong conclusion), forming a good introduction to philosophy for the interested amateur.He does concentrate on three areas: evolution, consciousness, and free will. Make of this what you will: he might be flogging his personal interests, or he might just be trying to avoid mistakes by presenting students with examples from the areas he knows best. I tend to lean toward the latter, but if you're bored silly by the very idea of discussions on free will, you may want to just skip Chapter VIII.All in all, this book is a good and lucid introduction to philosophy, including why it matters, and why even lay people can and should engage in it: when done correctly, and not just as an exercise in navel-gazing with five-dollar words, it's basically a way of thinking straight, and avoid reasoning errors.ETA: The section on computing and Turing machines is at best inaccurate and at worst misleading. The central message, that modern computers don't do anything that a Turing machine couldn't do, is correct. Yes, virtual machines are a real, and even useful, thing. And yes, a Turing machine can run a virtual version of your desktop PC and do everything it does, albeit at a ridiculously low speed.I think Dennett confuses virtualization with abstraction. Virtualization is the process of making one computer behave like another one. For instance, if you wanted to play your old Apple II games, you could set up a virtual Apple II on your desktop PC. That is, a program on your PC would pretend to be an Apple II, so that that virtual Apple II could run your old games.Abstraction, on the other hand, is, roughly, the process of hiding the low-level details from the programmer, who can ignore the small stuff and get on with making the program do what she really wants. As time goes on, more and more things are considered low-level.To hear Dennett explain it, though, you might think that programmers pile virtual machine upon virtual machine, rather than abstraction upon abstraction."
173,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10974082-christine,2,"Finished! Let me show you what I learned from this book. Take the sentence, ""I finished it."" In this sentence, finished is defined as ""I visually examined each page, including preface, introduction, and appendix but excluding sources, bibliography, and the majority of the index."" Note that there is nothing in this definition about comprehension, or understanding. That is because for one definition of ""finished"" (the definition I have chosen to use in this book review), the focus is on completion without concerns about understanding, knowledge, or the ability to disseminate the information received to others of similar (or any) level of knowledge. With me so far? Yes? I'm impressed. No? That's about how I felt for this entire book. Originally I purchased this book on a whim because I loved the phrase ""intuition pumps"" and thought it would have helpful tools for more articulate discussions in debates. And it does, but only if you're a philosopher. Dennett writes about philosophical debates on the nature of consciousness, free will, and meaning but with examples so abstract and metaphysical they'd be almost impossible to use in a conversation with laymen. That's not a bad thing, but judging from this book there's a huge gap between an interested layman and the entry level philosophy student this book is aimed at. I thought I was a reasonably well educated layman. I thought I would be able to make the stretch to entry level student. I could not. There were still a great many things I enjoyed. The concept of intuition pumps (61), the discussion of Occam's Razor(38) and Occam's Broom(40), Boom Crutches(48), learning about register machines(109). Although I still don't understand how a register machine could be useful as a thinking tool, unless maybe it's to internalize the process of reducing a particular activity down to its most basic operations to see if you could get a simple machine (or a cascade of simple machines) to perform the same job, without understanding it or even knowing what they are doing? Dennet holds that often what we assume is irreducible complexity could actually be performed (albeit more slowly) by sufficient layers of the most basic computers (loosely paraphrased from p 139). That's an interesting, terrifying idea. Terrifying because now I can't argue that we aren't all zombies, or robots. This book left me with more questions than answers, and more confusion than when I started reading it. I guess that's a good thing? I don't regret reading it, but only now that it's over. "
174,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,3,"Dennett enumerates some ``tools for thinking'', elaborates on some intuition pumps (a term he coined in 1980 which I guess is legitimate), explains why some apparent intuition pumps are counterproductive (and are instead what he calls ``boom crutches''), and applies the whole thing, inevitably, to philosophy of the mind.If Dennett's book broadly fall into two categories—moderately compelling pop sci that's basically solid but just wrong enough to annoy every reader in at least one way (Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Breaking the Spell), and intensely boring philosophy wank (Consciousness Explained, most of the rest)—Intuition Pumps &c. straddles the boundary. Parts of it are fair enough, but a lot of it is given over to tedious bullshit, a lot of which exemplifies why I feel philosophers are a waste of space: almost all of the thought experiments he finds so daunting turn out to be meaningless or trivial, and though career philosophers can arguably be forgiven for failing to recognise a thought experiment as meaningless (philosophy departments wouldn't exist if they couldn't), failing to recognise trivial ones is prety damned embarrassing for someone who's made this sort of thing his career for literally almost twice as long as I've existed.†Also, his position on free will is still basically wrong-headed, though it isn't more so than most things that have been written on the subject. He's clearly approaching a more sensible position, but at the pace he's going he'll be dead before he gets there.That said, the bits that are fair enough are, indeed, fair enough, and he manages to pull off aspects on which I expected a much worse performance (there's an entire set of chapters on computers and AI (proper CS AI, not philosophy AI), for example) surprisingly well. If every philosopher were only as bad as Dan Dennett, I wouldn't be nearly as bitter about their existence.(I also really appreciate that Gould is brought up as three instances of doing it wrong. Too many people Americans hold him in high regard, and it needs to stop.)---† I don't intend to stoop to their level and get into particulars here; most people who read my reviews know me well enough that I hope they'll give me some credit and accept that I'm not likely to be full of shit.

175,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11446002-dan,4,"Daniel Dennett is so committed to approachable philosophy one of his primary pillars is the use of interested laypeople as ""decoys"" in philisophical debate, so that philosophers are forced to explain their assumptions and the parameters of their ideas more rigorously. Consequently, his book is quite approachable to interested folks outside of philosophy.Dennett is also among the ""Four Horsemen of New Atheism"" so if that's going to irritate the hell out of you, definitely give this book a pass.I'll see if any of the thinking tools Dennett prescribes prove useful to me, and adjust to a 3 star or 5 star accordingly, if warranted. Initially, I think they will be useful. Taken together, the tools tend to emphasize the practical application over theoretical purity. Dennett very quickly gives up on/dismisses some of the big questions that excite people, such as ""Why is there something rather than nothing?"" (which he calls a pseudo-problem unworthy of inquiry). Philosophical ""qualia"" and ""zombies"" also get heaps of scorn from him. For him, the notion of ""free will"" that is used in courts should be enough for us: people never act independently from their context, but usually act with enough autonomy to be held accountable for those actions.Emblematic of his reliance on working-definitions and practical application is his repeated (sometimes tiresomely) use of the adjective ""sorta"". To him, getting into definitional arguments about the absolute limits of self, freedom, word definitions almost instantly become trivial as they search for fine distinctions that simply don't exist. Instead, just say someone is ""sorta"" thinking or ""sorta"" independent and move on.Finally, Dennett overflows with enthusiasm for both the evolutionary model and for computing. The evolutionary section of the book seemed useful and central to his main points but the extensive chapters on computing, including workbook-style programming problems to solve in a simple, theoretical model of a computer perplexed me. They seemed long and indulgent and I kept waiting for them to become relevant to the rest of the book. I never felt like they did.Overall, a worthwhile read, so long as I can remember some of his pumps and the ideas I had in response to them."

If you have some patience, you'll finish with clearer ways to examine and express your own thoughts -- or, at least, that's how I felt.There are some admittedly shocking jumps in difficulty. More than once I found myself, after twenty pages of lucid explanations, coming across a paragraph I had to read five times just to make certain I had understood it... and even then I wouldn't have bet money on it. This is the kind of book that will make you feel confident one moment and absurdly out of your depth the next. When you're jumping from physics, biology, computer science and cognitive psychology, that may just be the nature of the beast, but it fortunately never feels as though Dennett is being an obscurantist. He values lucidity, and by the end of this thing I was grateful.Dennett manages to glide from one mind-bending mystery to another and address each with wit, clarity, and frightening intelligence. It's impressive that a man so fiercely bright can keep his work from being too intimidating: his tone is that of a kindly uncle, guiding you with patience through some of the most difficult conundrums your brain can handle.While this was sometimes dense to the point that it hurt my head, if you find any of the topics interesting you'll be missing out on a feast for your brain if you don't give Intuition Pumps a shot."
177,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,3,"On the back of a very uninspiring month, following two really inspired months, I wanted a book that might reliably be jumper cables for my brain. A collection of thought experiments and ways of thinking to think about thinking, seemed beyond perfect. It wasn’t. It did get me thinking about why it wasn’t though. What are the qualities of something that is thought-provoking? At one extreme, I might argue everything and nothing is thought provoking, and all provocation is in the thought of the thinker. I’m uninspired in general, this didn’t inspire me. I was inspired in general, everything inspired me, especially the James Gleick books. At the other extreme, I have no role, and the content has objective thought-provoking qualities. If this is even partially true, where do those qualities lie? I was provoked by very few of these intuition pumps, some were novel thought experiments that I haven’t come across before. Some were literal about the knobs available to be turned one by one to reveal the underlying dependence of the pump. Some revealed that I might just have a bias against the phrasing, intuition pump, exemplified by the use in this unfortunate sentence ‘engage in mutual intuition pumping’. Mostly I was underwhelmed by my experience. It didn’t get me ‘thinking elegantly about hard questions’, as much as it told me how Daniel Dennett thinks elegantly about hard questions, with most chapters seeming to me how Frank Johnson’s colorblind Mary thought experiment seemed to DD, an answer writ large on the front of the envelope, having nothing to open up and discover, because it’s anyway just an empty envelope. It’s interesting to consider the strong possibility that, having pointed this out in Frank Johnson’s experiment, DD took immense pains not to fall into the same trap of experiment construction, placing most of the resultant emptiness squarely on the shoulders of dumb readers like myself. I’ll have more evidence once I go back to another James Gleick book immediately and compare my mental processes. NotesWhat separates ignorance from willful subterfuge? Take the chapter on Gould, and his use of ‘rathering’ to create false dichotomies. I find myself doing that all the time, not because I’m trying to fabricate polarization, but because I haven’t realized that the apparent dichotomy collapses under many subtle conditions. Rapaport Laws: How to criticize an idea. First rephrase it in a way that the other person appreciates as complete and accurate yet new. Then point out agreements. Then point out things you can borrow to make your own idea stronger. Only then criticize. Occam’s Broom: Only experts can figure out what evidence has been left out, as opposed to what’s been presented. That’s why conspiracy theories are so compelling, sweeping all inconvenient data under the carpet, where normal people won’t spot the omissions. Sturgeon’s Law: 90% of everything is garbage. Criticizing something for being bad is a terrible idea, because 90% of everything is bad. Focus on what’s good. Rathering: Create false dichotomies saying evolution does not proceed by X, rather by Y, when in case these 2 are not mutually exclusive, while you make it sound that wayPeople use ‘surely’ at the edge of their knowledge, or things they take for granted and are hoping you do too.Is understanding your psychology like the comments that coders put on source code, meant to understand the code but not at all affecting how the computer reads and executes it.‘Slippery Slope’ is often just a moat disguised as slippery slope. The line between two opposites is often thin, that makes us uncomfortable, so we create a buffer zone around it, razor wire, moat, and say the first foot into that buffer zone leads to a slippery slope. ‘Spontaneous intrusion’ the effect that we have, smells, shadows, weights etc that a virtual rendition has to meticulously add after creating our basic shapes. Nonfunctional noise, shed dust, leave wake, causes vibrations etc. Why do we need this when creating AI? Collisions induce creativityMemes needn’t increase fitness of host. Religion must be good for something because it’s everywhere? Some things are just good for themselves.Planiverse, more elegant version of FlatlandRock Paper Scissors, winning strategy is true randomness.

B: select winner, sell tickets. Have I sold losing tickets purposely? Ultimately they are the same thing, as long as I don’t know which is winner, every person has an equal chance of winning? True statements from history that cannot be proved, like Caesar thought of salad on June 1st. Godel? Similarly, must be true that Sherlock has or has not a mole on shoulder, but can’t be proved. Faustian bargains: 1) Solve problem once and for all laying it to rest, or complex work that will be debated for long time? Scientists pick A, Philosophers picked B. 2) Uncontroversial right thing, like Calculus/DNA Helix (Crick, but Linus P would’ve got there too), or very controversial hotly-discussed mostly wrong thing like Lamarck, Cartesian duality etc. Chomsky’s syntactical structures, while mostly wrong, birthed many descendent correct theories that have nothing to do with it, like hummingbird having nothing to do with dinosaurs. Was Chomsky wrong?Sophisticated naive auto-anthropology: start with axioms of folk beliefs held by me known to be false, try to resolve contradictions (like siphons, pipettes etc). Naive naive auto-anthropology, start with axioms trying to get to an objective truth.

178,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/445677-scott,5,"At this point, it has been nearly 25 years since I read Douglas Hofstadter and Daniel Dennett's anthology, ""The Mind's I,"" as part of a philosophy class on artificial intelligence at the University of Pittsburgh. One of the most-enduring essays in that volume was Dennett's ""Where am I?"", a tour-de-force of a thought experiment that became a cultural referent, the ""brain in a vat"" controlling a body containing a substitute brain via radio waves. Dennett would refer to such a construction as an ""intuition pump,"" a contrived situation created to test the reader's thoughts and assumptions about an idea. Each of his ""intuition pumps"" has ""knobs,"" or circumstances and details, that can be adjusted and changed so that the reader can explore the idea as much (or, as little) as desired. This volume collects many of Dennett's best intuition pumps from across his long and fruitful career as a philosopher. Often Dennett's exposition is new, and his writing is remarkably free from undue resorts to the sophisticated/abstruse language of academic philosophy. However, the simplicity and clarity of his writing to the lay person does not detract from the deep exploration of ideas on what it means to know something, can a computer be intelligent and think like us, the difficulties people have conceiving of evolution, and why evolution makes sense, what it means to be conscious, and do we ultimately have free will (and does it matter?). He also concludes with a few brief notes about the practice of philosophy, and encouragement (and cautionary tales) for those who might consider a career in the field.The intuition pumps presented are brief; many can be easily read in under 30 minutes time. However, each one of them can be re-read and explored in considerable detail, and many academic careers have been fruitfully spent working through the implications of these topics, attempting to find challenges and refutations to and support for these arguments. Highly recommended for all who have an interest in thinking about thinking and have at least a casual curiosity about philosophy."
179,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82933807-donald-thomann,3,"Intuition Pumps does what it claims to do in the title: Give you a number of thinking tools that you can apply across a wide variety of topics. It falls short, though, in two major ways, which really affected my enjoyment of the book overall compared to other books that in effect do the same thing. The first is that a lot of the chapters don't mix or follow one another particularly well, and at times this just comes off like a series of blog posts. As a result the whole thing feels pretty disjointed and without any kind of central, unifying theme. The sections break down roughly to logical philosophy, evolutionary biology, consciousness, etc. but the subject categories feel mostly artificial. Which brings me to the second, more important point...These are all fairly standard tools in any advanced thinker's tool kit, and invaluable tools to a noob like myself just beginning to dive into these topics. However, the tools seem so abstracted and disjointed that it becomes hard to understand how to apply them in real situations. Let's say you know very little about automobiles, carpentry and plumbing. If you entered a garage where all the tools required for these three professions were available to you, wall to wall, floor to ceiling, you'd have everything you needed to build some stuff. However, you wouldn't have the raw materials needed to actually build anything, nor would you have the knowledge of how to use the tools or apply them properly even if you did. That's how this book felt to me. It's too basic for advanced thinkers and too abstracted and removed from practical application to be useful to an amateur. Dennett throws you a bunch of nuts and bolts and wrenches and belt sanders and crimpers and clamps without giving you the instruction manual with the image of the final product and the exploded view. All that said, I think this would be a perfect read as a companion to more concrete reading material on any of these subjects, or as a massive textbook where each tool could be applied more extensively."
180,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39894105-nestor-leal,3,"This book title was a little misguiding. I like thought experiments which are called intuition pumps in here. Turns out only a few pages are dedicated to these thinking tools then they are applied to the concepts of consciousness, free will, determinism, evolution and the mind. I like to think and philosophize about these things too but the book should have been named otherwise. Some chapters are boring to people (like me) who already know binary code, assembler language and in general how computers work. On the other hand these chapters will help the untrained to learn how they work. At the end, understanding how computers work will help you understand how many things in nature are computer like, ie. our body cells.At times it seemed like this is a good philosophy companion book to The Selfish Gene which is mostly science. There are many references to Richard Dawkins’ work and even to the game theory used in his book. In fact, Dennett states that science and philosophy should go hand in hand, to which I agree, so it makes sense. I didn’t like the arrogant tone of Daniel Dennett and how the criticizes other philosophers. Still it is an ok book.I liked his idea of making good mistakes. Learning about our mistakes is always good for improvement. Mistakes, when understood correctly, help us advance even further. This is not new but mostly nobody likes to be pointed out their mistakes except when they accept and acknowledge this will greatly help them. Still it’s better to make big mistakes than stupid mistakes.Well, reading this book seemed like a good idea at the time!"

The author, a philosopher, uses the tools of philosophy to fill in the blanks about how we proceed with science.The book starts off by how we sometimes can be mislead by 'intuition pumps"", thought experiments, and how we should correctly use them. He sets up the listener in how to think about problems and then delves into some big problems, such as design within the universe and what does it mean, and what is consciousness and how to think about it.The author is a philosopher but is much more interested in understanding the scientific method as opposed to the meaning of words.I've listened to most of the science books audible has available and a book like this helps me see beyond just the science but also how to think about the science.This author had a theme throughout this whole book. That the start of all understanding first comes about by realizing the role of evolution in the design of all non-trivial systems.I will read more of this author's work. P.S. I did end up reading more of this author's work, and it made me disappointed in this book, because he copies most of this book from his other books.

I find the abstract nature of philosophy and it sometimes outlandish discussions to be uninteresting. However, this work is surely an exception. It takes together two aspects which interest me a lot, computer programming and evolution theory. Meaning, consciousness and free will are attacked using various utilities (called intuition pumps) which help thinking about the problems. Useless utilities (called crutch booms) are systematically destroyed. Mr Dennett relentlessly works towards (stopping just short of saying it) showing how the human mind is a beautiful and well-designed (yes, design can be used again, although it is design-without-a-designer) series of systems that all take care of their own and together form complex, conscious, free-willing systems, such as our minds. Note that Mr Dennett nowhere says this is actually the case, but between the lines, this looks to be the winner he is betting on. Mr Dennett also uses this book both as a means to reinforce real or perceived victories against philosophical enemies. I don't really get those, but it's probably part of the in-crowd show."

Daniel Dennett's book offers a plethora of Thinking Tools drawn from computer science, biology and many other realms which, like the apps on your phone, give you the power to do more things better - to think difficults thoughts more easily, and even tackle the most difficult questions about meaning and consciousness. It's designed to change your way of thinking and to nudge you out of some ultimately wrong intuitions you may hold. It is basically a summary of his life's work.I think Dennett's toolkit, which is made out of many thought experiments ('Intuition Pumps') and more, is extremely useful for any aspiring thinker, whether you agree with him or not."

A mixture of pessimism and optimism. Meaning isn't going to turn out to be a simple property that maps easily onto brains, and we're not going to find ""deeper"" facts anywhere that just settle the question of what a sentence, or a thought, or a belief really means. The best we can do–and it is quite good enough–is to find and anchor (apparently) best interpretations of all the physical-stance (and design-stance) data we have. If we can find one solution to a Quinian quandary about meaning, we have almost certainly found the solution–in the sense that we may be confident that no better solution lies undiscovered. As the two-bitser's move to Panama showed, meaning is always relative to a context of function, and there need be no original intentionality beyond the intentionality of our (sorta) selfish genes, which derive their sorta intentionality from the functional context of evolution by natural selection, instead of from an Intelligent Designer playing the role of our rich client ordering a giant robot. And the intuition pump about the two black boxes shows that the intentional stance, with all its tolerance of sorta beliefs and their ilk, is not optional if you want to understand and explain many of the causal regularities in the world.Our investigations into these issues are greatly enhanced, here in the twenty-first century, by the fact that, for the first time, we have ways of thinking rigorously and vigorously about mechanisms with trillions of moving parts–parts that work in unmysterious ways. Thanks to Turing, we can at least dimly see a path now, from brute uncomprehending matter (the physical stance) via a cascade of rearrangements (the design stance, and sorta meanings) to an appreciation of ourselves as paradigmatic believers, knowers, understanders (simplified by the intentional stance as intentional systems).""Darwin's theory of evolution unites meaning with matter: ""On one side, we have the world of our mods and their meanings [...] On the other side, we have galaxies ceaselessly wheeling, planets falling pointlessly into their orbits, lifeless chemical mechanisms doing what their physics ordains, all without purpose or reason.

192,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9310150-quiver,5,"Dennett courts controversy in a number of places by calling out his colleagues for being inaccurate or a little to lax with their methods of thought. His is also excessively wordy, to the point where I occasionally believed a short, single paragraph would get his idea across much better. I appreciate the examples and the historical anecdotes, though they really should have been optional whenever not directly crucial for transmitting the gist of the intuition pump.Despite all of the above, Dennet's book is trove of useful starting points. They really are starting points however: the intuition pumps are general tools that the reader needs to mull over, adopt and adapt, before slowly applying to life and academic thinking. And it's hard work, if you want to do it seriously—I've tried and it's paid off, a little. The main message is this: if you are interested in improving the sharpness of your mental edge, Dennett's book will indicate a few of the segments where you're being obtuse (dictionary meanings 1 and 3 intended). So the book won't even show you all the segments, let alone how to really sharpen them. But that's why you then go and read other books that will. It's always about climbing one rung at a time; Dennett's is an excellent rung. For that I recommend it to most people. Five stars."

I agree with another reviewer who says, ""reading this book is basically like reading Daniel Dennett in blog format."" Unlike the reviewer, I have less problem with it. Perhaps it's because I am more like a casual reader than a student in philosophy. Each intuition pump (thought experiment) discussed is relatively independent of each other, making the book friendly to a reader who reads in fragmented time. Dennett does not demonstrate ""turning all the knobs to examine a thought experiment"" in every chapter. But when he does the trick, it is often enjoyable and inspirational. To make use of this method myself, however, may require lots of practice. A few chapters I like the most and will probably re-read in the future: 	• Trapped in the Robot Control Room	• The Seven Secrets of Computer Power Revealed (on register machine) 	• Noise in the Virtual Hotel	• Mary the Color Scientist	• Dennet's intepreation of Conway's Game of Life	• The Boys from Brazil"

195,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,5,"This book is misleadingly titled  - it should be called Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking like Daniel Dennett. But no harm done.Having previously only heard of Daniel Dennett in context of his status as one of the four horsemen of the New Atheism movement, I picked up this book from Kinokuniya blind - expecting it to be a general sort of empirically-minded self-improvement book for honing your thinking techniques. Instead, I got a thinly-veiled overview of Dennett's various philosophical positions over meaning, consciousness, complexity, and free will, which are explained using such thinking tools as Dennett recommends that the reader cultivate. The subtext being that if the reader were only to apply the correct thinking tools, she would naturally reach the same, or similar, conclusions, that Dennett has.The central thinking tool in the box is really the intuition pump, a kind of thinking experiment cunningly worded and framed to get the reader to come to a desired conclusion by appealing to his or her intuitions. The term was coined by Dennett and many examples are prominently featured in this book, given such whimsically memorable names as the Curse of the Cauliflower and the Zombic Hunch. A famous example of an intuition pump (and one Dennett savages) is the Chinese Room experiment - in which one imagines a man using a set of algorithmic translation rules to translate Chinese questions into English in order to answer them. However, at no point in this process does the man actually understand the inputs - he merely acts upon them based on a set of instructions. The point of this thought experiment is to pump the intuition that - like the man in the Chinese room - computers that use algorithms to process data do not truly understand them - ergo, consciousness (i.e. understanding) cannot arise out of a set of algorithms designed to simulate its functions.The intuition pump is really a double edged sword, however, and can be used to both illuminate and mislead. This is because intuition pumps are by their very nature abstractions of philosophical problems - they simplify conditions to make it easier to think about a thing - and in some cases, to think about a thing the way the creator intended. Dennett tells us to interrogate intuition pumps by turning the knobs - in other words, changing some of the conditions or assumptions of the intuition pump and seeing if the same intuitions are pumped out. Even as Dennett presents his own intuition pumps, he also deconstructs pumps that have been devised by others. He calls misleading intuition pumps boom crutches, deliberately malappriopriating (see what I did there?) the nautical term for these anti-thinking tools that are designed to shut down thinking.Ultimately, however, after a few short chapters laying out his toolbox, Dennett begins the methodical quest of introducing the reader to his brand of philosophical thought. Dennett's positions on various matters - cognition, free will, consciousness - can be boiled down to the idea that these ideas - held by some philosophers to reside in the sacred space of epistemological inscrutability- can actually be explained with a mundane scientific approach. The hard questions are procedurally hard - but not unsolvable using scientific inquiry. In plain language, it simply means that things like consciousness or free will can be explained or described in the framework of material reality, and there is no need to posit some imagined higher substrate of reality - such as positing that consciousness manifests beyond the physical mind - in order to understand such phenomena.It's hard to distill Dennett's ideas into one paragraph, but an example of this approach is Dennett's deconstruction of the Chinese Room. That thought experiment holds that consciousness cannot manifest out of algorithms, which are ostensibly what the mind, in Dennett's model of cognition, uses - i.e. strong, conscious AI is not possible. Dennett's dictum, on the other hand, is that software, sufficiently advanced (and operating on a sufficiently complex hardware stratum like the brain), approximates consciousness to such a level of fidelity that it is indistinguishable from consciousness, and in fact, is consciousness, and in actual fact is precisely what consciousness is in reality.Think about the idea of the philosophical zombie - a being that acts and talks so like a human being that it is indistinguishable from one, except that it has no internal world, no consciousness - and elevate it to the idea of the zimboe - another philosophical creature that simulates second-order beliefs that it is a conscious thinking being, when it actually isn't. A zimboe looks, acts, and feels - or thinks it feels - like a real human being - but it doesn't actually think anything. Dennett's argument is that the zimboe is the logical outcropping of the idea that there can be p-zombies that approximate human complexity, but at that level of fidelity it would be impossible for a zimboe to be distinguished from a human being, by any means. Rather than posit some ethereal essence of consciousness, Dennett argues, why not just eliminate the need for that as-yet-undiscovered substrate and go straight to the Occam's-Razor solution - that the zimboe concept is incoherent because a sufficiently complex bundle of computational processes - i.e. the zimboe - already possesses, by dint of its mental complexity, consciousness?Back to the Chinese Room - Dennett's point is that the flaw of the intuition pump is that it doesn't specify how complex the algorithms operated upon by the man must be to make it so that the questioners who are asking the questions in Chinese are satisfied that the answers they get are from a thinking entity. Dennett's intuition is that they would have to be astoundingly complex - more complex than would be possible for one man and a pencil to analyse in any reasonable time horizon. As such, the Chinese Room thought experiment is bust because it fails to account for the possibility that the set of algorithmic instructions would only be physically possible to operationalise on a substrate capable enough to elevate it to a level in which it could be described to ""understand"" its instructions - which could approximate something like consciousness.Dennett applies this same set of thinking tools to different fields - thinking about meaning, evolution, free will. In each case Dennett purports to banish the veil of mysticism that some drape over seemingly intractable problems, and shows that they are really resolvable with the application of tried-and-true thinking methods. Another interesting example is Dennett's stance on free will. Dennett is really a compatibilist - he holds that free will is compatible with determinism. How? Simple - the kind of philosophically ideal free will that some imagine we must possess to rightly be called free is an incoherent concept. Barring quantum indeterminacy, at some level the rules of physics determine the course of the universe - that is determinism. However, reality is so complex that the kind of ""free will"" some would characterise as being required to be truly free is not required to make meaningful decisions. Dennett characterises the difference as being between a sufficiently advanced pseudo-random number generator (one that generates a random list of numbers using a series of step by step algorithms) and a ""true"" random number generator. Sufficiently advanced, there is no compelling reason to choose the latter, unless you plan to play chess with an omniscient God that can predict your every move. But who needs, or wants, that kind of ideal freedom? Free will is not a binary - it is a spectrum, and what free will we have is sufficient for our purposes down to the subatomic level.I've gone off on a bit of a tangent here - but I should be somewhat embarrassed to admit that Dennett gives voice to some of my own intuitions about mind, consciousness, and free will. I find myself agreeing with him to a very large and almost embarrassing extent. Far from being accused of being overly impressionistic, however, I should caveat that the irony of my reading experience of Dennett's tome is that I didn't glean my philosophical insights from his intuition pumps, but really from how my own intuitions corroborated with his conclusions. Dennett, here, was in effect preaching to the choir. And even more ironic was that I came away with a sneaking suspicion that his intuition pumps were simply not especially effective in conveying the point in  a watertight manner. But I suppose that is a suspicion that fosters itself. Intuition pumps are by nature unwieldy thinking tools - ripe for abuse or misuse, abstracted in ways that cloud judgment, with too many hypotheticals and variables. Are Dennett's own pumps immune to this kind of thing? Probably not. He has an easier job of it though - his positions are fundamentally more parsimonious - after all, he is arguing from the standpoint of ""possibility"" - which requires less epistemological certainty than to declare a thing ""impossible"". It is possible to conceive of consciousness, evolution and free will in terms of physical laws, and this is how it is possible to conceive of them. They may be the wrong models - perhaps consciousness does exist as a floaty-substrate, by Dennett's own admission. But Dennett doesn't have to show that his model is correct - he just has to show that it is possible to think of them as being grounded in empirics. His critics often have to show that a thing is impossible to characterize in terms of physical reality - which requires some boom crutch-y sleight of hand and other such mental breakdancing. It is impossible that consciousness is rooted in the physical world - here is inductive proof in the form of a hypothetical! Forgive me if I don't find that particularly convincing.But I ramble. Dennett's book can describe all these jumbled thoughts better than I can. Go read it, regardless of your metaphysical inclinations. I think you'll probably get something out of it. At the very least, the chance to turn some of Dennett's knobs at his invitation.I give this book: 4.5 out of 5 Sphexes"

In Intuition Pumps, he introduced a range of thought experiments, then gradually piled on new and more complex layers. Some were for supporting his views in topics like Thinking and Meaning; some were used to confront other thinkers on topics such as Religion and Free Will.I paused many many times to break down the ideas, to try to understand and to apply them in my world. How can I find holes in which argument at what time... And it had proven to be very difficult. What I did, therefore, like a school girl, was to memorize the gist of the 77 ideas, hoping I can retrieve and use them some day. I am sure that's not how this book should be read.Part IX ""What is it like to be a Philosopher?"" is my favourite. Liking something, appreciating and studying something is completely different from actually making, doing and living it. And he quoted psychologist David Hebb's rule when he discussed where a philosopher should focus his/her energy:“If it isn’t worth doing, it isn’t worth doing well.”I think this applies to every facet of life.You should read it if▫️You want to learn a set of tools that can improve your critical thinking skills▫️You want an intro on topics like consciousness, meaning, free will, evolution & AI▫️You want an intro on Dennett's view on the above, with high conviction"
197,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2704424-nick-klagge,3,"A very interesting book, but one that I think is not quite sure what it wants to be (to take the ""intentional stance"").Dennett is a philosopher who I know about mostly through his work with Doug Hofstadter, a writer who I really like (""Godel Escher Bach,"" ""Surfaces and Essences""). They have quite similar outlooks, I think--a multidisciplinary approach that takes an interest in what fields like computer science and evolutionary biology can tell us about the nature of the mind, consciousness, and free will.The publisher describes the book as ""offer[ing] seventy-seven of Dennett's most successful 'imagination-extenders and focus-holders' meant to guide you through some of life's most treacherous subject matter: evolution, meaning, mind, and free will."" I think this captures the ambiguity of the book: is it about the tools (the eponymous pumps), or about the subject matter? Dennett would certainly call my question out as an example of ""rathering"" (presentation of a false dichotomy), but I guess my feeling is that the book puts enough focus on each that there is not a fully satisfactory treatment of either. Perhaps the book best serves as entree to Dennett's work--which I think it did well for me.I ended up most interested in his assertions about free will. I have read enough of Hofstadter to be more or less already on board with his (their) views on evolution and consciousness, such as the rejection of the conclusion of Searle's ""Chinese room"" thought experiment. But his views on free will (briefly, that it is compatible with a deterministic universe) are new to me and feel like they are legitimate but also feel like they will take some time to wrap my head around--and the book wasn't long enough for a sufficient treatment.For me, the best intuition that came out of the book is as follows: many philosophical arguments are ultimately ""arguments from incredulity"" (the Chinese room, Jackson's ""What Mary Didn't Know""), and that this is not a trustworthy form of argument. In particular, human intuition is very poorly equipped to handle scales out of the bounds of our normal experience. In each of the examples I gave above, Dennett talks about the crucial role that ""lack of imagination"" plays--Searle's experiment plays down the extreme complexity and multi-layeredness of what would have to be going on by talking about ""scraps of paper,"" and Jackson's argument relies on our inability to understand what it would really mean to acquire ""all possible observational information about visual processing of color."" For Dennett, asking if we can conceive of something is a deceptively difficult challenge--it seems like a question you should be able to answer by simple introspection, but really it requires a lot of work and thinking-tools. If you say you ""can't conceive of"" something, Dennett is likely to say that you aren't working hard enough at it. In the book, Dennett spends a great deal of time talking about Borges' ""Library of Babel,"" and working through different ways of thinking about exactly what type of entity it implies--it's not enough to ""glom together"" the concepts of ""library"" and ""really big,"" because the scale is so far beyond our direct experience of ""big"" that it is really something else altogether.This is why Dennett and Hofstadter get so much mileage out of issues surrounding computing. In a sense, computing operates at scales that are ""inconceivable"" to humans, but on the other hand, it is something that his readers are intimately familiar with. It is this cognitive dissonance that ends up being philosophically productive. It seems ""inconceivable"" to us that a Turing machine made of squares of toilet paper and rocks could, given enough time, run ""Grand Theft Auto,"" but we can also intellectually understand that that is in fact the case."
198,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62274863-phoenix,4,"Danny's Wonderful Tool BoxProfessor and philosopher Dennett starts off with the wonderful project of describing a set of techniques for productive reasoning in philosophy, and presumably in other fields as well. Calling them ""intuition pumps"", they are what physicists ""gedanken"" (thought) experiments which can be tweaked by changing a limited number parameters which Dennet likens to twisting a few ""knobs"". The opposite of a pump is called a ""boom crutch"", which are analogies to be avoided. Intuition pumps can move us forward, boom crutches leave us spinning in circles. In order to keep it simple he disciplined his material by giving it in the form of a course to a group of first year university students, so we are essentially his second class.The project starts off very well. The first section covers about a dozen different concepts such as the value of Trial and Error (fail rapidly and learn from mistakes), Reductio ad Absurdum, Anatol Rapoport's rules for successful criticism, Sturgeon's Law (90% of everything is crap ), joosting (look at problems by ""jumping out of the system"", ie: what would happen if one abandoned phlogiston, or what would a Martian think of this problem), rathering (sliding past a false dichotomy), answering rhetorical questions as the answer may surprise, Occam's Razor, Occam's Broom (watch out for sweeping inconsistencies under the rug), the ""sorta"" operator ( a recommendation against using unnecessary precision) and my favourite, deepidity - a child's neologism for ideas that sound deep (""love"" is just a word) but either is or is not. Dennet seems to approach it as a boom crutch, akin to stupidity, but maybe it can be productive of ideas as well.He then continues with several illustrating scenarios, many of which have to do with the nature of consciousness, for example contrasting the inner and outer reality of what we see, and what do we mean when we ascribe purpose to animals (sphexishness), systems and inanimate objects. Quite a few discussions centre around zombies, robots, replicants and Chinese rooms - if they pass as humans should we truly say that they have an inner life.However the project suddenly runs off the rails about 100 pages in with a 50 page discussion of Turing machines (which, if you've had it before, he invites you to skip) where he urges the reader to hand simulate a computation. How very 80s! Later on even Conway's Game of Life reappears. This is old material that doesn't tell us much about thought and could have been summarized in much less time. And then he does it again in with longer segments on Borges Infinite Library, comparing it to DNA and then evolution. All very nice but it's like listening to your favorite uncle droning on about the old country and not really why we've come to the party.So while promising at first, it does disappoint by being a bit long winded. There are some good nuggets here and there such as the impossible metaphor of a sky hook, the parable of analyzing the behaviour of black boxes, the role of knowledge in fairness of lotteries where the winning ticket is decided before or after the tickets have been sold and ""qualias"" - emotional gestalts associated with colours or objects; tidbits as to why locust population explosions favour prime number intervals and the quasi-myth of ""sphexishness"".In summary, it's good at the beginning and beats the averages of Sturgeon's Law, don't be afraid to judiciously skim. A fine toothed rating for me would be 3.7, but of course your mileage may vary."
199,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5956720-anastasia-sijabat,2,"Reading this book was a wild ride.I was at first compelled to read the book because I remember taking a Science Fiction and Philosophy module when I was an undergrad and the professor raved about this book. At that time, I didn't bother to buy the book, but when a friend said that she bought a copy, I was interested to borrow it and read it to know why that professor really liked this book.My first (and consistent) impression is that if I knew Dennett in real life, we wouldn't go along. We have a very different approach to the way we communicate that I Did Not Understand Most of His Points. The impatient me two months ago, while reading this book, would be furious and think that he was a prime example of male ego who liked to namedrop and mumble about things people don't understand just to sound smart. Today, I give him benefit of the doubt.Listen, I might be dumb, but that doesn't mean I can't learn. I was not a bright student in the Physics class when I was in high school, but I understood Stephen Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" because Hawking is a great communicator and he must've gone a long way to ensuring readers understand what he wrote. Dennett has a very different way of communicating. Example: he never gives a definition of what he discusses, so for those of you who are new to philosophy, good luck guessing what determinism is and why he writes several chapters about examples on compatibilism (the view that determinism and free will might be compatible, not contradictory) before explicitly writing that he is a compatibilist (and even so he doesn't explain what it is. I was lucky because I knew the topics he discusses beforehand).One of the materials that bothers me so much is when he thinks it's mindboggling if a human is unknowingly put into another planet that resembles Earth in every aspect except the way they call a horse. He then questions: so, if she sees an animal resembling horse on that planet but is not a horse, is it actually a horse?This is absolutely ridiculous to me. I think he could've discussed it from philosophy of language point of view, given, you know, that language is social construct so nothing is actually a word? Language is a consensus so if that woman sees a horse-like specimen but is not called a horse.... it's not a horse because the communities don't agree that it's called a horse? I'm so confused as to what kind of critical thinking he intends to arouse here.Don't get me started with the whole chapters about computers either. They were insufferable. I only understood several bits but I didn't get the whole gist (I asked myself ""so what?"" so often).One thing that drove me to not give a complete 1 star rating is his analysis on free will and determinism, and he successfully distinguishes the determinism question from moral responsibility inquiry. Perhaps that was the only new thing I learned from reading the book aside from thinking ""Yep I've known this before"" or ""What the hell does this even mean?""(edit: rating down from 3 to 2 because apparently 3 means ""liked it"" and I did not like it so...)"
200,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16074924-dan-smith,3,"This book missells itself, and has its flaws, but it's worth reading if only to encourage the reader to turn a critical eye on Dennett's own arguments.Let's get one thing out of the way, an Intuition Pump is a thought experiment as far as I can see, and giving it another label (something Dennett's denigrates in other thought experiments - see his relabelling of Mr Puppet as Captain Autonomy) changes nothing other than the rhetoric. It's all a case of My Pump Pumps Harder Than Yours, and it's a bit cheap.And another thing: this in no way contains ""70 ways to make you think better"". A few generic philosophical tools at the start are fine, but the rest are specific thought experiments to prove or disprove a point, or deconstructions of another philosopher's argument. It's a quality set of disparate points, coalescing around meaning, evolution, free will and consciousness.There's a lot of begging the question going on here - the Puppet / Autonomy label a case in point: Dennett correctly identifies the unsubtle characterisation of a person in a free-will thought experiment, but then seeks to prove his case by doing just the same. His central thesis is also curiously void at heart: I get his analysis of ever more complex ""thinking"" machines and how they could be equated to our own brains, with comparable levels of thought. But all it does is set up a comparison: why make the jump and say they must be the same? Why does this tell us anything about what consciousness is? It might do, but it can't get further than saying ""I've shown you a similar system, a computer, which has the same theoretical structure as your brain. We can't see the consciousness in my example, so... you see...? *pump pump* There! I have explained consciousness!""The thing is, I get everything he says and I sorta (to borrow his convenient fuzzy phrase) agree. But I end up not thinking he's really solved anything.He also has a frustrating habit of falling into the same rhetorical tricks as ones he painstakingly and smugly criticises others for using. For example, he spends a while constructing and example of humans constructing robots to house their cryogenic bodies, giving those robots instructions and degrees of autonomy. Fun. He then declares ""but what I have shown you is no different to genes using our bodies to replicate!"" Really? I see some parallels, and they're sorta similar, but so?It's like trying to nail down jelly. Yes, I see what you've shown me, but every time you get close to a key issue, you sorta wobble, sorta allow the nail in, and then sorta ignore it.This may be the key problem with all this sorta comparisons and thought experiments. If you're minded to agree, you see the example and agree with it. If you disagree, you'll either pick it apart (if you can) or say that it's all. All well as far as it goes but it doesn't *prove* the point.I did like his ""anything you can do, I can do meta. I can do many thing meta than you"" line. Alas, this only inspired me to think of e whole thing as this: A Metaphor? Yes, fine, but what's a meta *for*?"
201,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30039874-ap,3,"I did not finish this book (read about 2/3).Interesting, but I could do with a condensed version. I don't feel like I missed the main gist, but the details were not absorbed. It is well written, and if I had followed it and finished it, I probably would rate it higher.The book is about thinking about how we think, and tools that we can use to help (or also boomcrutches, which hinder) those processes.I got lost at the end of Part I, when it got super computery. The evolution discussions of Part II were interesting, but I got lost in that, too, before it finished. In the final part, I was lost from the get-go. The main points I have so far- Break assumptions and logics down to their most basic components, to find flaws or inconsistencies.- Making mistakes is the best way to learn. Embrace it.- Everything is dependent on context. There is no hidden or deeper meanings to things.- The original intention of nearly everything is survival.- Be aware of your emotional attachments to ideas.Some useful tools: - be fair, point out pros and cons of others work, demonstrate what you learned from it before you criticize it. - don't waste time critiquing mediocrity. - simple is best. - know the system so you can step outside of it to subvert it. - remember that brains can have little in common, but still have similar intentions. Even similar intentions will use data very differently. - There is no common structure in the huamn brain that funnels in ""meaning."" Good points in the book: - Meaning is not inherent or tangible. It is stored in the brain, but not like data.  - Folk psychology - the most important patterns in our images -- gives us a foundation to interpret the word around us. It is culturally dependent, not genetic. It is the way we tend to pattern and interpret, based on how others around us do it. - There is no wonder tissue in our brains -- stop looking for top-down approaches to explain humans, consciousness, etc. We are not magical miracles. We are bottom-up, mechanical processes that internetwork in growing webs of complexity to create the people and cultures around us. - Evolution challenges the top-down approach, with unintelligent, aimless design (bent only on survival).Some boomcrutches: - inconvenient facts are conveniently swept away/ignored. - using false dichotomies to make it seem like there are only two alternatives. - set up exagerated strawman of someone's argument, then refute that as if it was their real argument. - subtle inclusion of irrelevent things to weaken their argument. - using words or phrases that sound deep but are vague or trivial. - be wary when someone uses the word ""surely"" or asks a rhetorical question in their argument."
202,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11254454-arensb,4,"An intuition pump, in Dennett's sense, is an analogy or metaphor that helps us to think about a harder problem.For instance imagine a whimsical jailer who goes around while the prisoners are asleep, and unlocks all the doors and leaves them that way for a few hours. Are the prisoners free to escape? The idea is not so much to answer this particular question, but to play with it and use it to help us analyze a more complex problem.In Intuition Pumps, Dennett introduces several dozen such intuition pumps and other mental tools, as well as some pitfalls (e.g., the seductive analogy that misleads us into accepting the wrong conclusion), forming a good introduction to philosophy for the interested amateur.He does concentrate on three areas: evolution, consciousness, and free will. Make of this what you will: he might be flogging his personal interests, or he might just be trying to avoid mistakes by presenting students with examples from the areas he knows best. I tend to lean toward the latter, but if you're bored silly by the very idea of discussions on free will, you may want to just skip Chapter VIII.All in all, this book is a good and lucid introduction to philosophy, including why it matters, and why even lay people can and should engage in it: when done correctly, and not just as an exercise in navel-gazing with five-dollar words, it's basically a way of thinking straight, and avoid reasoning errors.ETA: The section on computing and Turing machines is at best inaccurate and at worst misleading. The central message, that modern computers don't do anything that a Turing machine couldn't do, is correct. Yes, virtual machines are a real, and even useful, thing. And yes, a Turing machine can run a virtual version of your desktop PC and do everything it does, albeit at a ridiculously low speed.I think Dennett confuses virtualization with abstraction. Virtualization is the process of making one computer behave like another one. For instance, if you wanted to play your old Apple II games, you could set up a virtual Apple II on your desktop PC. That is, a program on your PC would pretend to be an Apple II, so that that virtual Apple II could run your old games.Abstraction, on the other hand, is, roughly, the process of hiding the low-level details from the programmer, who can ignore the small stuff and get on with making the program do what she really wants. As time goes on, more and more things are considered low-level.To hear Dennett explain it, though, you might think that programmers pile virtual machine upon virtual machine, rather than abstraction upon abstraction."
203,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10974082-christine,2,"Finished! Let me show you what I learned from this book. Take the sentence, ""I finished it."" In this sentence, finished is defined as ""I visually examined each page, including preface, introduction, and appendix but excluding sources, bibliography, and the majority of the index."" Note that there is nothing in this definition about comprehension, or understanding. That is because for one definition of ""finished"" (the definition I have chosen to use in this book review), the focus is on completion without concerns about understanding, knowledge, or the ability to disseminate the information received to others of similar (or any) level of knowledge. With me so far? Yes? I'm impressed. No? That's about how I felt for this entire book. Originally I purchased this book on a whim because I loved the phrase ""intuition pumps"" and thought it would have helpful tools for more articulate discussions in debates. And it does, but only if you're a philosopher. Dennett writes about philosophical debates on the nature of consciousness, free will, and meaning but with examples so abstract and metaphysical they'd be almost impossible to use in a conversation with laymen. That's not a bad thing, but judging from this book there's a huge gap between an interested layman and the entry level philosophy student this book is aimed at. I thought I was a reasonably well educated layman. I thought I would be able to make the stretch to entry level student. I could not. There were still a great many things I enjoyed. The concept of intuition pumps (61), the discussion of Occam's Razor(38) and Occam's Broom(40), Boom Crutches(48), learning about register machines(109). Although I still don't understand how a register machine could be useful as a thinking tool, unless maybe it's to internalize the process of reducing a particular activity down to its most basic operations to see if you could get a simple machine (or a cascade of simple machines) to perform the same job, without understanding it or even knowing what they are doing? Dennet holds that often what we assume is irreducible complexity could actually be performed (albeit more slowly) by sufficient layers of the most basic computers (loosely paraphrased from p 139). That's an interesting, terrifying idea. Terrifying because now I can't argue that we aren't all zombies, or robots. This book left me with more questions than answers, and more confusion than when I started reading it. I guess that's a good thing? I don't regret reading it, but only now that it's over. "
204,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,3,"Dennett enumerates some ``tools for thinking'', elaborates on some intuition pumps (a term he coined in 1980 which I guess is legitimate), explains why some apparent intuition pumps are counterproductive (and are instead what he calls ``boom crutches''), and applies the whole thing, inevitably, to philosophy of the mind.If Dennett's book broadly fall into two categories—moderately compelling pop sci that's basically solid but just wrong enough to annoy every reader in at least one way (Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Breaking the Spell), and intensely boring philosophy wank (Consciousness Explained, most of the rest)—Intuition Pumps &c. straddles the boundary. Parts of it are fair enough, but a lot of it is given over to tedious bullshit, a lot of which exemplifies why I feel philosophers are a waste of space: almost all of the thought experiments he finds so daunting turn out to be meaningless or trivial, and though career philosophers can arguably be forgiven for failing to recognise a thought experiment as meaningless (philosophy departments wouldn't exist if they couldn't), failing to recognise trivial ones is prety damned embarrassing for someone who's made this sort of thing his career for literally almost twice as long as I've existed.†Also, his position on free will is still basically wrong-headed, though it isn't more so than most things that have been written on the subject. He's clearly approaching a more sensible position, but at the pace he's going he'll be dead before he gets there.That said, the bits that are fair enough are, indeed, fair enough, and he manages to pull off aspects on which I expected a much worse performance (there's an entire set of chapters on computers and AI (proper CS AI, not philosophy AI), for example) surprisingly well. If every philosopher were only as bad as Dan Dennett, I wouldn't be nearly as bitter about their existence.(I also really appreciate that Gould is brought up as three instances of doing it wrong. Too many people Americans hold him in high regard, and it needs to stop.)---† I don't intend to stoop to their level and get into particulars here; most people who read my reviews know me well enough that I hope they'll give me some credit and accept that I'm not likely to be full of shit. If you end up reading Intuition Pumps and want to discuss any of it, feel free to contact me."
205,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11446002-dan,4,"Daniel Dennett is so committed to approachable philosophy one of his primary pillars is the use of interested laypeople as ""decoys"" in philisophical debate, so that philosophers are forced to explain their assumptions and the parameters of their ideas more rigorously. Consequently, his book is quite approachable to interested folks outside of philosophy.Dennett is also among the ""Four Horsemen of New Atheism"" so if that's going to irritate the hell out of you, definitely give this book a pass.I'll see if any of the thinking tools Dennett prescribes prove useful to me, and adjust to a 3 star or 5 star accordingly, if warranted. Initially, I think they will be useful. Taken together, the tools tend to emphasize the practical application over theoretical purity. Dennett very quickly gives up on/dismisses some of the big questions that excite people, such as ""Why is there something rather than nothing?"" (which he calls a pseudo-problem unworthy of inquiry). Philosophical ""qualia"" and ""zombies"" also get heaps of scorn from him. For him, the notion of ""free will"" that is used in courts should be enough for us: people never act independently from their context, but usually act with enough autonomy to be held accountable for those actions.Emblematic of his reliance on working-definitions and practical application is his repeated (sometimes tiresomely) use of the adjective ""sorta"". To him, getting into definitional arguments about the absolute limits of self, freedom, word definitions almost instantly become trivial as they search for fine distinctions that simply don't exist. Instead, just say someone is ""sorta"" thinking or ""sorta"" independent and move on.Finally, Dennett overflows with enthusiasm for both the evolutionary model and for computing. The evolutionary section of the book seemed useful and central to his main points but the extensive chapters on computing, including workbook-style programming problems to solve in a simple, theoretical model of a computer perplexed me. They seemed long and indulgent and I kept waiting for them to become relevant to the rest of the book. I never felt like they did.Overall, a worthwhile read, so long as I can remember some of his pumps and the ideas I had in response to them."
206,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30099981-james-ferrett,4,"""Darwinian thinking does live up to its billing as universal acid: it turns the whole traditional world upside down, challenging the top-down image of designs flowing from that genius of geniuses, the Intelligent Designer, and replacing it with the bubble-up image of mindless, motiveless cyclical processes churning out ever-more robust combinations until they start replicating on their own, speeding up the design process by reusing all the best bits over and over.""An attempt to teach readers how to ""think reliably and even gracefully about really hard questions,"" Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking goes over rough intellectual terrain -- consciousness, determinism, artificial intelligence, evolution, all decidedly daunting hills and valleys -- with assurance and wit. If you have some patience, you'll finish with clearer ways to examine and express your own thoughts -- or, at least, that's how I felt.There are some admittedly shocking jumps in difficulty. More than once I found myself, after twenty pages of lucid explanations, coming across a paragraph I had to read five times just to make certain I had understood it... and even then I wouldn't have bet money on it. This is the kind of book that will make you feel confident one moment and absurdly out of your depth the next. When you're jumping from physics, biology, computer science and cognitive psychology, that may just be the nature of the beast, but it fortunately never feels as though Dennett is being an obscurantist. He values lucidity, and by the end of this thing I was grateful.Dennett manages to glide from one mind-bending mystery to another and address each with wit, clarity, and frightening intelligence. It's impressive that a man so fiercely bright can keep his work from being too intimidating: his tone is that of a kindly uncle, guiding you with patience through some of the most difficult conundrums your brain can handle.While this was sometimes dense to the point that it hurt my head, if you find any of the topics interesting you'll be missing out on a feast for your brain if you don't give Intuition Pumps a shot."
207,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,3,"On the back of a very uninspiring month, following two really inspired months, I wanted a book that might reliably be jumper cables for my brain. A collection of thought experiments and ways of thinking to think about thinking, seemed beyond perfect. It wasn’t. It did get me thinking about why it wasn’t though. What are the qualities of something that is thought-provoking? At one extreme, I might argue everything and nothing is thought provoking, and all provocation is in the thought of the thinker. I’m uninspired in general, this didn’t inspire me. I was inspired in general, everything inspired me, especially the James Gleick books. At the other extreme, I have no role, and the content has objective thought-provoking qualities. If this is even partially true, where do those qualities lie? I was provoked by very few of these intuition pumps, some were novel thought experiments that I haven’t come across before. Some were literal about the knobs available to be turned one by one to reveal the underlying dependence of the pump. Some revealed that I might just have a bias against the phrasing, intuition pump, exemplified by the use in this unfortunate sentence ‘engage in mutual intuition pumping’. Mostly I was underwhelmed by my experience. It didn’t get me ‘thinking elegantly about hard questions’, as much as it told me how Daniel Dennett thinks elegantly about hard questions, with most chapters seeming to me how Frank Johnson’s colorblind Mary thought experiment seemed to DD, an answer writ large on the front of the envelope, having nothing to open up and discover, because it’s anyway just an empty envelope. It’s interesting to consider the strong possibility that, having pointed this out in Frank Johnson’s experiment, DD took immense pains not to fall into the same trap of experiment construction, placing most of the resultant emptiness squarely on the shoulders of dumb readers like myself. I’ll have more evidence once I go back to another James Gleick book immediately and compare my mental processes. NotesWhat separates ignorance from willful subterfuge? Take the chapter on Gould, and his use of ‘rathering’ to create false dichotomies. I find myself doing that all the time, not because I’m trying to fabricate polarization, but because I haven’t realized that the apparent dichotomy collapses under many subtle conditions. Rapaport Laws: How to criticize an idea. First rephrase it in a way that the other person appreciates as complete and accurate yet new. Then point out agreements. Then point out things you can borrow to make your own idea stronger. Only then criticize. Occam’s Broom: Only experts can figure out what evidence has been left out, as opposed to what’s been presented. That’s why conspiracy theories are so compelling, sweeping all inconvenient data under the carpet, where normal people won’t spot the omissions. Sturgeon’s Law: 90% of everything is garbage. Criticizing something for being bad is a terrible idea, because 90% of everything is bad. Focus on what’s good. Rathering: Create false dichotomies saying evolution does not proceed by X, rather by Y, when in case these 2 are not mutually exclusive, while you make it sound that wayPeople use ‘surely’ at the edge of their knowledge, or things they take for granted and are hoping you do too.Is understanding your psychology like the comments that coders put on source code, meant to understand the code but not at all affecting how the computer reads and executes it.‘Slippery Slope’ is often just a moat disguised as slippery slope. The line between two opposites is often thin, that makes us uncomfortable, so we create a buffer zone around it, razor wire, moat, and say the first foot into that buffer zone leads to a slippery slope. ‘Spontaneous intrusion’ the effect that we have, smells, shadows, weights etc that a virtual rendition has to meticulously add after creating our basic shapes. Nonfunctional noise, shed dust, leave wake, causes vibrations etc. Why do we need this when creating AI? Collisions induce creativityMemes needn’t increase fitness of host. Religion must be good for something because it’s everywhere? Some things are just good for themselves.Planiverse, more elegant version of FlatlandRock Paper Scissors, winning strategy is true randomness. How to achieve it without a random number generator?Evolution has given us practical unpredictability, burden of proof should be on those who say that free will requires total unpredictability. Conway Game Of Life: Since physics of this world are clear, it’s deterministic and can chart out entire future given a certain start position. But the past isn’t possible, there are too many possible states for each preceding step that quickly snowballs into infinite combos.Lottery A: sell tickets, then select winner. Fair?

208,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/445677-scott,5,"At this point, it has been nearly 25 years since I read Douglas Hofstadter and Daniel Dennett's anthology, ""The Mind's I,"" as part of a philosophy class on artificial intelligence at the University of Pittsburgh. One of the most-enduring essays in that volume was Dennett's ""Where am I?"", a tour-de-force of a thought experiment that became a cultural referent, the ""brain in a vat"" controlling a body containing a substitute brain via radio waves. Dennett would refer to such a construction as an ""intuition pump,"" a contrived situation created to test the reader's thoughts and assumptions about an idea. Each of his ""intuition pumps"" has ""knobs,"" or circumstances and details, that can be adjusted and changed so that the reader can explore the idea as much (or, as little) as desired. This volume collects many of Dennett's best intuition pumps from across his long and fruitful career as a philosopher. Often Dennett's exposition is new, and his writing is remarkably free from undue resorts to the sophisticated/abstruse language of academic philosophy. However, the simplicity and clarity of his writing to the lay person does not detract from the deep exploration of ideas on what it means to know something, can a computer be intelligent and think like us, the difficulties people have conceiving of evolution, and why evolution makes sense, what it means to be conscious, and do we ultimately have free will (and does it matter?). He also concludes with a few brief notes about the practice of philosophy, and encouragement (and cautionary tales) for those who might consider a career in the field.The intuition pumps presented are brief; many can be easily read in under 30 minutes time. However, each one of them can be re-read and explored in considerable detail, and many academic careers have been fruitfully spent working through the implications of these topics, attempting to find challenges and refutations to and support for these arguments. Highly recommended for all who have an interest in thinking about thinking and have at least a casual curiosity about philosophy."
209,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82933807-donald-thomann,3,"Intuition Pumps does what it claims to do in the title: Give you a number of thinking tools that you can apply across a wide variety of topics. It falls short, though, in two major ways, which really affected my enjoyment of the book overall compared to other books that in effect do the same thing. The first is that a lot of the chapters don't mix or follow one another particularly well, and at times this just comes off like a series of blog posts. As a result the whole thing feels pretty disjointed and without any kind of central, unifying theme. The sections break down roughly to logical philosophy, evolutionary biology, consciousness, etc. but the subject categories feel mostly artificial. Which brings me to the second, more important point...These are all fairly standard tools in any advanced thinker's tool kit, and invaluable tools to a noob like myself just beginning to dive into these topics. However, the tools seem so abstracted and disjointed that it becomes hard to understand how to apply them in real situations. Let's say you know very little about automobiles, carpentry and plumbing. If you entered a garage where all the tools required for these three professions were available to you, wall to wall, floor to ceiling, you'd have everything you needed to build some stuff. However, you wouldn't have the raw materials needed to actually build anything, nor would you have the knowledge of how to use the tools or apply them properly even if you did. That's how this book felt to me. It's too basic for advanced thinkers and too abstracted and removed from practical application to be useful to an amateur. Dennett throws you a bunch of nuts and bolts and wrenches and belt sanders and crimpers and clamps without giving you the instruction manual with the image of the final product and the exploded view. All that said, I think this would be a perfect read as a companion to more concrete reading material on any of these subjects, or as a massive textbook where each tool could be applied more extensively."
210,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39894105-nestor-leal,3,"This book title was a little misguiding. I like thought experiments which are called intuition pumps in here. Turns out only a few pages are dedicated to these thinking tools then they are applied to the concepts of consciousness, free will, determinism, evolution and the mind. I like to think and philosophize about these things too but the book should have been named otherwise. Some chapters are boring to people (like me) who already know binary code, assembler language and in general how computers work. On the other hand these chapters will help the untrained to learn how they work. At the end, understanding how computers work will help you understand how many things in nature are computer like, ie. our body cells.At times it seemed like this is a good philosophy companion book to The Selfish Gene which is mostly science. There are many references to Richard Dawkins’ work and even to the game theory used in his book. In fact, Dennett states that science and philosophy should go hand in hand, to which I agree, so it makes sense. I didn’t like the arrogant tone of Daniel Dennett and how the criticizes other philosophers. Still it is an ok book.I liked his idea of making good mistakes. Learning about our mistakes is always good for improvement. Mistakes, when understood correctly, help us advance even further. This is not new but mostly nobody likes to be pointed out their mistakes except when they accept and acknowledge this will greatly help them. Still it’s better to make big mistakes than stupid mistakes.Well, reading this book seemed like a good idea at the time!"

The author, a philosopher, uses the tools of philosophy to fill in the blanks about how we proceed with science.The book starts off by how we sometimes can be mislead by 'intuition pumps"", thought experiments, and how we should correctly use them. He sets up the listener in how to think about problems and then delves into some big problems, such as design within the universe and what does it mean, and what is consciousness and how to think about it.The author is a philosopher but is much more interested in understanding the scientific method as opposed to the meaning of words.I've listened to most of the science books audible has available and a book like this helps me see beyond just the science but also how to think about the science.This author had a theme throughout this whole book. That the start of all understanding first comes about by realizing the role of evolution in the design of all non-trivial systems.I will read more of this author's work. P.S. I did end up reading more of this author's work, and it made me disappointed in this book, because he copies most of this book from his other books.

I find the abstract nature of philosophy and it sometimes outlandish discussions to be uninteresting. However, this work is surely an exception. It takes together two aspects which interest me a lot, computer programming and evolution theory. Meaning, consciousness and free will are attacked using various utilities (called intuition pumps) which help thinking about the problems. Useless utilities (called crutch booms) are systematically destroyed. Mr Dennett relentlessly works towards (stopping just short of saying it) showing how the human mind is a beautiful and well-designed (yes, design can be used again, although it is design-without-a-designer) series of systems that all take care of their own and together form complex, conscious, free-willing systems, such as our minds. Note that Mr Dennett nowhere says this is actually the case, but between the lines, this looks to be the winner he is betting on. Mr Dennett also uses this book both as a means to reinforce real or perceived victories against philosophical enemies. I don't really get those, but it's probably part of the in-crowd show."

If they were, we would've figured them out long ago. Daniel Dennett's book offers a plethora of Thinking Tools drawn from computer science, biology and many other realms which, like the apps on your phone, give you the power to do more things better - to think difficults thoughts more easily, and even tackle the most difficult questions about meaning and consciousness. It's designed to change your way of thinking and to nudge you out of some ultimately wrong intuitions you may hold. It is basically a summary of his life's work.I think Dennett's toolkit, which is made out of many thought experiments ('Intuition Pumps') and more, is extremely useful for any aspiring thinker, whether you agree with him or not."

Competence without comprehension - no need to comprehend an action to execute it effectively2. What a number in a register stands fit depends on the program composed (contextual semantics)3. Since numbers in registers can stand for anything, a register can, in principle, be designed to ""notice"" anything, to ""discriminate"" any pattern or feature that can be associated with a number or number of numbers (unbound pattern awareness)4. Since a number can stand for anything, a number can stand for an instruction or address5. All possible programs can be given a unique number as a name, which can then be treated as a list of instructions to be executed by a Universal machine 6. All the improvements in computers since Turing invented his imaginary paper-tape machines are simply ways of making then faster7. There are no more secrets!

Giant robot intuition pump addresses this question. - p166Excellent summary of theory of meaning on p197-198:""And what are the verdicts of this long section on meaning? A mixture of pessimism and optimism. Meaning isn't going to turn out to be a simple property that maps easily onto brains, and we're not going to find ""deeper"" facts anywhere that just settle the question of what a sentence, or a thought, or a belief really means. The best we can do–and it is quite good enough–is to find and anchor (apparently) best interpretations of all the physical-stance (and design-stance) data we have. If we can find one solution to a Quinian quandary about meaning, we have almost certainly found the solution–in the sense that we may be confident that no better solution lies undiscovered. As the two-bitser's move to Panama showed, meaning is always relative to a context of function, and there need be no original intentionality beyond the intentionality of our (sorta) selfish genes, which derive their sorta intentionality from the functional context of evolution by natural selection, instead of from an Intelligent Designer playing the role of our rich client ordering a giant robot. And the intuition pump about the two black boxes shows that the intentional stance, with all its tolerance of sorta beliefs and their ilk, is not optional if you want to understand and explain many of the causal regularities in the world.Our investigations into these issues are greatly enhanced, here in the twenty-first century, by the fact that, for the first time, we have ways of thinking rigorously and vigorously about mechanisms with trillions of moving parts–parts that work in unmysterious ways. Thanks to Turing, we can at least dimly see a path now, from brute uncomprehending matter (the physical stance) via a cascade of rearrangements (the design stance, and sorta meanings) to an appreciation of ourselves as paradigmatic believers, knowers, understanders (simplified by the intentional stance as intentional systems).""Darwin's theory of evolution unites meaning with matter: ""On one side, we have the world of our mods and their meanings [...] On the other side, we have galaxies ceaselessly wheeling, planets falling pointlessly into their orbits, lifeless chemical mechanisms doing what their physics ordains, all without purpose or reason. Then Darwin comes along and shows us how the former arises from the latter, creating meaning as it goes, a bubble-up vision of the birth of importance to overthrow the trickle-down vision of tradition."" - p201Library of Mendel / Library of Babel: set of all possible permutations of DNA base-pairs / characters in the Roman alphabet. Useful analogy between words and genes to think about the vastness of possibilities. - p205Similarity between genes and words or subroutines.

""Why shrink from the pedagogical task of showing that there can be design without a designer? [...] The biosphere is utterly saturated with design, with purpose, with reasons. What I call the design stance predicts and explains features throughout the living world using the same assumptions that works so well when we are reverse engineering artifacts made by (somewhat) intelligent human designers."" - p222Thought: can we make a comparison between the generation of ideas and the generation of species? We feel selfishly attached to our ideas, and assign much judgement to the failure or success of ideas. But can we assign the same judgement to the failure or success of a species? No room for objective evaluation when process of design takes such a meandering path and success is usually derived from one barely intentional attempt in an endless stream of barely intentional attempts.Skyhooks vs cranes:""a skyhook is a 'mind-first' force or power or process, an exception to the principle that all design, and apparent design, is ultimately the result of mindless, motiveless mechanicity. A crane, in contrast, is a subprocess, or a special feature of a design process that can be demonstrated to permit the local speeding up of the basic, slow process of natural selection, and that can be demonstrated to be itself the preductable (or retrospectively explicable) product of the basic process."" - p228Free-floating rationales: ""the reasons uncovered by evolution before they were ever expressed or represented by human investigators or any other minds"" - p235""Gaudí had reasons for the shapes he ordered created; there are reasons for the shapes created by the termites, but the termites don't have those reasons."" - p235Speaking of the conundrum of distinguishing the point at which non-mammals became mammals: ""We should quell our desire to draw lines. We don't need to draw lines."" - p241""So, as a general rule, consider ignoring the philosophers' demand for an essence, a defining feature, a 'truth-maker'.

[...] Memes are informational symbionts, and like the mutualist symbionts by the trillions that also inhabit us, we couldn't live without them, but that doesn't mean they are all our friends."" - p276Avoiding the trap of thinking about consciousness as a Cartesian Theater, of seeing it as the most central or highest mental phenomenon: ""consciousness is not a medium, like television, into which information can get transduced or recorded, and there is no place in the brain where 'it all comes together' for the appreciation of some Central Witness..."" - p281Diff btwn imagination and conception (at least according to Descartes): imagination is limited by our physical awareness; conception is a property of ""pure mind"" and thus open to a wider design space. - p289Recursive self-representation: having higher-order information states that monitor other internal states, which are in turn monitored, and so on. - p290Qualia: worth exploring more.

222,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9310150-quiver,5,"Dennett courts controversy in a number of places by calling out his colleagues for being inaccurate or a little to lax with their methods of thought. His is also excessively wordy, to the point where I occasionally believed a short, single paragraph would get his idea across much better. I appreciate the examples and the historical anecdotes, though they really should have been optional whenever not directly crucial for transmitting the gist of the intuition pump.Despite all of the above, Dennet's book is trove of useful starting points. They really are starting points however: the intuition pumps are general tools that the reader needs to mull over, adopt and adapt, before slowly applying to life and academic thinking. And it's hard work, if you want to do it seriously—I've tried and it's paid off, a little. The main message is this: if you are interested in improving the sharpness of your mental edge, Dennett's book will indicate a few of the segments where you're being obtuse (dictionary meanings 1 and 3 intended). So the book won't even show you all the segments, let alone how to really sharpen them. But that's why you then go and read other books that will. It's always about climbing one rung at a time; Dennett's is an excellent rung. For that I recommend it to most people. Five stars."
223,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"In this book, Daniel Dennett covers a bit of everything he has studied: evolution / consciousness / free will / meaning / AI. I agree with another reviewer who says, ""reading this book is basically like reading Daniel Dennett in blog format."" Unlike the reviewer, I have less problem with it. Perhaps it's because I am more like a casual reader than a student in philosophy. Each intuition pump (thought experiment) discussed is relatively independent of each other, making the book friendly to a reader who reads in fragmented time. Dennett does not demonstrate ""turning all the knobs to examine a thought experiment"" in every chapter. But when he does the trick, it is often enjoyable and inspirational. To make use of this method myself, however, may require lots of practice. A few chapters I like the most and will probably re-read in the future: 	• Trapped in the Robot Control Room	• The Seven Secrets of Computer Power Revealed (on register machine) 	• Noise in the Virtual Hotel	• Mary the Color Scientist	• Dennet's intepreation of Conway's Game of Life	• The Boys from Brazil"

Instead, I got a thinly-veiled overview of Dennett's various philosophical positions over meaning, consciousness, complexity, and free will, which are explained using such thinking tools as Dennett recommends that the reader cultivate. The subtext being that if the reader were only to apply the correct thinking tools, she would naturally reach the same, or similar, conclusions, that Dennett has.The central thinking tool in the box is really the intuition pump, a kind of thinking experiment cunningly worded and framed to get the reader to come to a desired conclusion by appealing to his or her intuitions. The term was coined by Dennett and many examples are prominently featured in this book, given such whimsically memorable names as the Curse of the Cauliflower and the Zombic Hunch. A famous example of an intuition pump (and one Dennett savages) is the Chinese Room experiment - in which one imagines a man using a set of algorithmic translation rules to translate Chinese questions into English in order to answer them. However, at no point in this process does the man actually understand the inputs - he merely acts upon them based on a set of instructions. The point of this thought experiment is to pump the intuition that - like the man in the Chinese room - computers that use algorithms to process data do not truly understand them - ergo, consciousness (i.e. understanding) cannot arise out of a set of algorithms designed to simulate its functions.The intuition pump is really a double edged sword, however, and can be used to both illuminate and mislead. This is because intuition pumps are by their very nature abstractions of philosophical problems - they simplify conditions to make it easier to think about a thing - and in some cases, to think about a thing the way the creator intended. Dennett tells us to interrogate intuition pumps by turning the knobs - in other words, changing some of the conditions or assumptions of the intuition pump and seeing if the same intuitions are pumped out. Even as Dennett presents his own intuition pumps, he also deconstructs pumps that have been devised by others. He calls misleading intuition pumps boom crutches, deliberately malappriopriating (see what I did there?) the nautical term for these anti-thinking tools that are designed to shut down thinking.Ultimately, however, after a few short chapters laying out his toolbox, Dennett begins the methodical quest of introducing the reader to his brand of philosophical thought. Dennett's positions on various matters - cognition, free will, consciousness - can be boiled down to the idea that these ideas - held by some philosophers to reside in the sacred space of epistemological inscrutability- can actually be explained with a mundane scientific approach. The hard questions are procedurally hard - but not unsolvable using scientific inquiry. In plain language, it simply means that things like consciousness or free will can be explained or described in the framework of material reality, and there is no need to posit some imagined higher substrate of reality - such as positing that consciousness manifests beyond the physical mind - in order to understand such phenomena.It's hard to distill Dennett's ideas into one paragraph, but an example of this approach is Dennett's deconstruction of the Chinese Room. That thought experiment holds that consciousness cannot manifest out of algorithms, which are ostensibly what the mind, in Dennett's model of cognition, uses - i.e. strong, conscious AI is not possible. Dennett's dictum, on the other hand, is that software, sufficiently advanced (and operating on a sufficiently complex hardware stratum like the brain), approximates consciousness to such a level of fidelity that it is indistinguishable from consciousness, and in fact, is consciousness, and in actual fact is precisely what consciousness is in reality.Think about the idea of the philosophical zombie - a being that acts and talks so like a human being that it is indistinguishable from one, except that it has no internal world, no consciousness - and elevate it to the idea of the zimboe - another philosophical creature that simulates second-order beliefs that it is a conscious thinking being, when it actually isn't. A zimboe looks, acts, and feels - or thinks it feels - like a real human being - but it doesn't actually think anything. Dennett's argument is that the zimboe is the logical outcropping of the idea that there can be p-zombies that approximate human complexity, but at that level of fidelity it would be impossible for a zimboe to be distinguished from a human being, by any means. Rather than posit some ethereal essence of consciousness, Dennett argues, why not just eliminate the need for that as-yet-undiscovered substrate and go straight to the Occam's-Razor solution - that the zimboe concept is incoherent because a sufficiently complex bundle of computational processes - i.e. the zimboe - already possesses, by dint of its mental complexity, consciousness?Back to the Chinese Room - Dennett's point is that the flaw of the intuition pump is that it doesn't specify how complex the algorithms operated upon by the man must be to make it so that the questioners who are asking the questions in Chinese are satisfied that the answers they get are from a thinking entity. Dennett's intuition is that they would have to be astoundingly complex - more complex than would be possible for one man and a pencil to analyse in any reasonable time horizon. As such, the Chinese Room thought experiment is bust because it fails to account for the possibility that the set of algorithmic instructions would only be physically possible to operationalise on a substrate capable enough to elevate it to a level in which it could be described to ""understand"" its instructions - which could approximate something like consciousness.Dennett applies this same set of thinking tools to different fields - thinking about meaning, evolution, free will. In each case Dennett purports to banish the veil of mysticism that some drape over seemingly intractable problems, and shows that they are really resolvable with the application of tried-and-true thinking methods. Another interesting example is Dennett's stance on free will. Dennett is really a compatibilist - he holds that free will is compatible with determinism. How? Simple - the kind of philosophically ideal free will that some imagine we must possess to rightly be called free is an incoherent concept. Barring quantum indeterminacy, at some level the rules of physics determine the course of the universe - that is determinism. However, reality is so complex that the kind of ""free will"" some would characterise as being required to be truly free is not required to make meaningful decisions. Dennett characterises the difference as being between a sufficiently advanced pseudo-random number generator (one that generates a random list of numbers using a series of step by step algorithms) and a ""true"" random number generator. Sufficiently advanced, there is no compelling reason to choose the latter, unless you plan to play chess with an omniscient God that can predict your every move. But who needs, or wants, that kind of ideal freedom? Free will is not a binary - it is a spectrum, and what free will we have is sufficient for our purposes down to the subatomic level.I've gone off on a bit of a tangent here - but I should be somewhat embarrassed to admit that Dennett gives voice to some of my own intuitions about mind, consciousness, and free will. I find myself agreeing with him to a very large and almost embarrassing extent. Far from being accused of being overly impressionistic, however, I should caveat that the irony of my reading experience of Dennett's tome is that I didn't glean my philosophical insights from his intuition pumps, but really from how my own intuitions corroborated with his conclusions. Dennett, here, was in effect preaching to the choir. And even more ironic was that I came away with a sneaking suspicion that his intuition pumps were simply not especially effective in conveying the point in  a watertight manner. But I suppose that is a suspicion that fosters itself. Intuition pumps are by nature unwieldy thinking tools - ripe for abuse or misuse, abstracted in ways that cloud judgment, with too many hypotheticals and variables. Are Dennett's own pumps immune to this kind of thing? Probably not. He has an easier job of it though - his positions are fundamentally more parsimonious - after all, he is arguing from the standpoint of ""possibility"" - which requires less epistemological certainty than to declare a thing ""impossible"". It is possible to conceive of consciousness, evolution and free will in terms of physical laws, and this is how it is possible to conceive of them. They may be the wrong models - perhaps consciousness does exist as a floaty-substrate, by Dennett's own admission. But Dennett doesn't have to show that his model is correct - he just has to show that it is possible to think of them as being grounded in empirics. His critics often have to show that a thing is impossible to characterize in terms of physical reality - which requires some boom crutch-y sleight of hand and other such mental breakdancing. It is impossible that consciousness is rooted in the physical world - here is inductive proof in the form of a hypothetical! Forgive me if I don't find that particularly convincing.But I ramble. Dennett's book can describe all these jumbled thoughts better than I can. Go read it, regardless of your metaphysical inclinations. I think you'll probably get something out of it. At the very least, the chance to turn some of Dennett's knobs at his invitation.I give this book: 4.5 out of 5 Sphexes"
226,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92557747-fi,3,"Not going to lie, this had been a slow read for me. The main reason is the brief misalignment of expectation at the beginning. When I saw ""over 70 tools to help you think better"", the image of a list of bite-size fun facts came to mind. Certainly it was not going to be.Daniel C Dennett is one of the most active, serious, provocative and original philosophers in the English speaking world today. So no, his work is not child's play. In Intuition Pumps, he introduced a range of thought experiments, then gradually piled on new and more complex layers. Some were for supporting his views in topics like Thinking and Meaning; some were used to confront other thinkers on topics such as Religion and Free Will.I paused many many times to break down the ideas, to try to understand and to apply them in my world. How can I find holes in which argument at what time... And it had proven to be very difficult. What I did, therefore, like a school girl, was to memorize the gist of the 77 ideas, hoping I can retrieve and use them some day. I am sure that's not how this book should be read.Part IX ""What is it like to be a Philosopher?"" is my favourite. Liking something, appreciating and studying something is completely different from actually making, doing and living it. And he quoted psychologist David Hebb's rule when he discussed where a philosopher should focus his/her energy:“If it isn’t worth doing, it isn’t worth doing well.”I think this applies to every facet of life.You should read it if▫️You want to learn a set of tools that can improve your critical thinking skills▫️You want an intro on topics like consciousness, meaning, free will, evolution & AI▫️You want an intro on Dennett's view on the above, with high conviction"
227,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2704424-nick-klagge,3,"A very interesting book, but one that I think is not quite sure what it wants to be (to take the ""intentional stance"").Dennett is a philosopher who I know about mostly through his work with Doug Hofstadter, a writer who I really like (""Godel Escher Bach,"" ""Surfaces and Essences""). They have quite similar outlooks, I think--a multidisciplinary approach that takes an interest in what fields like computer science and evolutionary biology can tell us about the nature of the mind, consciousness, and free will.The publisher describes the book as ""offer[ing] seventy-seven of Dennett's most successful 'imagination-extenders and focus-holders' meant to guide you through some of life's most treacherous subject matter: evolution, meaning, mind, and free will."" I think this captures the ambiguity of the book: is it about the tools (the eponymous pumps), or about the subject matter? Dennett would certainly call my question out as an example of ""rathering"" (presentation of a false dichotomy), but I guess my feeling is that the book puts enough focus on each that there is not a fully satisfactory treatment of either. Perhaps the book best serves as entree to Dennett's work--which I think it did well for me.I ended up most interested in his assertions about free will. I have read enough of Hofstadter to be more or less already on board with his (their) views on evolution and consciousness, such as the rejection of the conclusion of Searle's ""Chinese room"" thought experiment. But his views on free will (briefly, that it is compatible with a deterministic universe) are new to me and feel like they are legitimate but also feel like they will take some time to wrap my head around--and the book wasn't long enough for a sufficient treatment.For me, the best intuition that came out of the book is as follows: many philosophical arguments are ultimately ""arguments from incredulity"" (the Chinese room, Jackson's ""What Mary Didn't Know""), and that this is not a trustworthy form of argument. In particular, human intuition is very poorly equipped to handle scales out of the bounds of our normal experience. In each of the examples I gave above, Dennett talks about the crucial role that ""lack of imagination"" plays--Searle's experiment plays down the extreme complexity and multi-layeredness of what would have to be going on by talking about ""scraps of paper,"" and Jackson's argument relies on our inability to understand what it would really mean to acquire ""all possible observational information about visual processing of color."" For Dennett, asking if we can conceive of something is a deceptively difficult challenge--it seems like a question you should be able to answer by simple introspection, but really it requires a lot of work and thinking-tools. If you say you ""can't conceive of"" something, Dennett is likely to say that you aren't working hard enough at it. In the book, Dennett spends a great deal of time talking about Borges' ""Library of Babel,"" and working through different ways of thinking about exactly what type of entity it implies--it's not enough to ""glom together"" the concepts of ""library"" and ""really big,"" because the scale is so far beyond our direct experience of ""big"" that it is really something else altogether.This is why Dennett and Hofstadter get so much mileage out of issues surrounding computing. In a sense, computing operates at scales that are ""inconceivable"" to humans, but on the other hand, it is something that his readers are intimately familiar with. It is this cognitive dissonance that ends up being philosophically productive. It seems ""inconceivable"" to us that a Turing machine made of squares of toilet paper and rocks could, given enough time, run ""Grand Theft Auto,"" but we can also intellectually understand that that is in fact the case."
228,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62274863-phoenix,4,"Danny's Wonderful Tool BoxProfessor and philosopher Dennett starts off with the wonderful project of describing a set of techniques for productive reasoning in philosophy, and presumably in other fields as well. Calling them ""intuition pumps"", they are what physicists ""gedanken"" (thought) experiments which can be tweaked by changing a limited number parameters which Dennet likens to twisting a few ""knobs"". The opposite of a pump is called a ""boom crutch"", which are analogies to be avoided. Intuition pumps can move us forward, boom crutches leave us spinning in circles. In order to keep it simple he disciplined his material by giving it in the form of a course to a group of first year university students, so we are essentially his second class.The project starts off very well. The first section covers about a dozen different concepts such as the value of Trial and Error (fail rapidly and learn from mistakes), Reductio ad Absurdum, Anatol Rapoport's rules for successful criticism, Sturgeon's Law (90% of everything is crap ), joosting (look at problems by ""jumping out of the system"", ie: what would happen if one abandoned phlogiston, or what would a Martian think of this problem), rathering (sliding past a false dichotomy), answering rhetorical questions as the answer may surprise, Occam's Razor, Occam's Broom (watch out for sweeping inconsistencies under the rug), the ""sorta"" operator ( a recommendation against using unnecessary precision) and my favourite, deepidity - a child's neologism for ideas that sound deep (""love"" is just a word) but either is or is not. Dennet seems to approach it as a boom crutch, akin to stupidity, but maybe it can be productive of ideas as well.He then continues with several illustrating scenarios, many of which have to do with the nature of consciousness, for example contrasting the inner and outer reality of what we see, and what do we mean when we ascribe purpose to animals (sphexishness), systems and inanimate objects. Quite a few discussions centre around zombies, robots, replicants and Chinese rooms - if they pass as humans should we truly say that they have an inner life.However the project suddenly runs off the rails about 100 pages in with a 50 page discussion of Turing machines (which, if you've had it before, he invites you to skip) where he urges the reader to hand simulate a computation. How very 80s! Later on even Conway's Game of Life reappears. This is old material that doesn't tell us much about thought and could have been summarized in much less time. And then he does it again in with longer segments on Borges Infinite Library, comparing it to DNA and then evolution. All very nice but it's like listening to your favorite uncle droning on about the old country and not really why we've come to the party.So while promising at first, it does disappoint by being a bit long winded. There are some good nuggets here and there such as the impossible metaphor of a sky hook, the parable of analyzing the behaviour of black boxes, the role of knowledge in fairness of lotteries where the winning ticket is decided before or after the tickets have been sold and ""qualias"" - emotional gestalts associated with colours or objects; tidbits as to why locust population explosions favour prime number intervals and the quasi-myth of ""sphexishness"".In summary, it's good at the beginning and beats the averages of Sturgeon's Law, don't be afraid to judiciously skim. A fine toothed rating for me would be 3.7, but of course your mileage may vary."
229,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5956720-anastasia-sijabat,2,"Reading this book was a wild ride.I was at first compelled to read the book because I remember taking a Science Fiction and Philosophy module when I was an undergrad and the professor raved about this book. At that time, I didn't bother to buy the book, but when a friend said that she bought a copy, I was interested to borrow it and read it to know why that professor really liked this book.My first (and consistent) impression is that if I knew Dennett in real life, we wouldn't go along. We have a very different approach to the way we communicate that I Did Not Understand Most of His Points. The impatient me two months ago, while reading this book, would be furious and think that he was a prime example of male ego who liked to namedrop and mumble about things people don't understand just to sound smart. Today, I give him benefit of the doubt.Listen, I might be dumb, but that doesn't mean I can't learn. I was not a bright student in the Physics class when I was in high school, but I understood Stephen Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" because Hawking is a great communicator and he must've gone a long way to ensuring readers understand what he wrote. Dennett has a very different way of communicating. Example: he never gives a definition of what he discusses, so for those of you who are new to philosophy, good luck guessing what determinism is and why he writes several chapters about examples on compatibilism (the view that determinism and free will might be compatible, not contradictory) before explicitly writing that he is a compatibilist (and even so he doesn't explain what it is. I was lucky because I knew the topics he discusses beforehand).One of the materials that bothers me so much is when he thinks it's mindboggling if a human is unknowingly put into another planet that resembles Earth in every aspect except the way they call a horse. He then questions: so, if she sees an animal resembling horse on that planet but is not a horse, is it actually a horse?This is absolutely ridiculous to me. I think he could've discussed it from philosophy of language point of view, given, you know, that language is social construct so nothing is actually a word? Language is a consensus so if that woman sees a horse-like specimen but is not called a horse.... it's not a horse because the communities don't agree that it's called a horse? I'm so confused as to what kind of critical thinking he intends to arouse here.Don't get me started with the whole chapters about computers either. They were insufferable. I only understood several bits but I didn't get the whole gist (I asked myself ""so what?"" so often).One thing that drove me to not give a complete 1 star rating is his analysis on free will and determinism, and he successfully distinguishes the determinism question from moral responsibility inquiry. Perhaps that was the only new thing I learned from reading the book aside from thinking ""Yep I've known this before"" or ""What the hell does this even mean?""(edit: rating down from 3 to 2 because apparently 3 means ""liked it"" and I did not like it so...)"
230,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16074924-dan-smith,3,"This book missells itself, and has its flaws, but it's worth reading if only to encourage the reader to turn a critical eye on Dennett's own arguments.Let's get one thing out of the way, an Intuition Pump is a thought experiment as far as I can see, and giving it another label (something Dennett's denigrates in other thought experiments - see his relabelling of Mr Puppet as Captain Autonomy) changes nothing other than the rhetoric. It's all a case of My Pump Pumps Harder Than Yours, and it's a bit cheap.And another thing: this in no way contains ""70 ways to make you think better"". A few generic philosophical tools at the start are fine, but the rest are specific thought experiments to prove or disprove a point, or deconstructions of another philosopher's argument. It's a quality set of disparate points, coalescing around meaning, evolution, free will and consciousness.There's a lot of begging the question going on here - the Puppet / Autonomy label a case in point: Dennett correctly identifies the unsubtle characterisation of a person in a free-will thought experiment, but then seeks to prove his case by doing just the same. His central thesis is also curiously void at heart: I get his analysis of ever more complex ""thinking"" machines and how they could be equated to our own brains, with comparable levels of thought. But all it does is set up a comparison: why make the jump and say they must be the same? Why does this tell us anything about what consciousness is? It might do, but it can't get further than saying ""I've shown you a similar system, a computer, which has the same theoretical structure as your brain. We can't see the consciousness in my example, so... you see...? *pump pump* There! I have explained consciousness!""The thing is, I get everything he says and I sorta (to borrow his convenient fuzzy phrase) agree. But I end up not thinking he's really solved anything.He also has a frustrating habit of falling into the same rhetorical tricks as ones he painstakingly and smugly criticises others for using. For example, he spends a while constructing and example of humans constructing robots to house their cryogenic bodies, giving those robots instructions and degrees of autonomy. Fun. He then declares ""but what I have shown you is no different to genes using our bodies to replicate!"" Really? I see some parallels, and they're sorta similar, but so?It's like trying to nail down jelly. Yes, I see what you've shown me, but every time you get close to a key issue, you sorta wobble, sorta allow the nail in, and then sorta ignore it.This may be the key problem with all this sorta comparisons and thought experiments. If you're minded to agree, you see the example and agree with it. If you disagree, you'll either pick it apart (if you can) or say that it's all. All well as far as it goes but it doesn't *prove* the point.I did like his ""anything you can do, I can do meta. I can do many thing meta than you"" line. Alas, this only inspired me to think of e whole thing as this: A Metaphor? Yes, fine, but what's a meta *for*?"
231,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30039874-ap,3,"I did not finish this book (read about 2/3).Interesting, but I could do with a condensed version. I don't feel like I missed the main gist, but the details were not absorbed. It is well written, and if I had followed it and finished it, I probably would rate it higher.The book is about thinking about how we think, and tools that we can use to help (or also boomcrutches, which hinder) those processes.I got lost at the end of Part I, when it got super computery. The evolution discussions of Part II were interesting, but I got lost in that, too, before it finished. In the final part, I was lost from the get-go. The main points I have so far- Break assumptions and logics down to their most basic components, to find flaws or inconsistencies.- Making mistakes is the best way to learn. Embrace it.- Everything is dependent on context. There is no hidden or deeper meanings to things.- The original intention of nearly everything is survival.- Be aware of your emotional attachments to ideas.Some useful tools: - be fair, point out pros and cons of others work, demonstrate what you learned from it before you criticize it. - don't waste time critiquing mediocrity. - simple is best. - know the system so you can step outside of it to subvert it. - remember that brains can have little in common, but still have similar intentions. Even similar intentions will use data very differently. - There is no common structure in the huamn brain that funnels in ""meaning."" Good points in the book: - Meaning is not inherent or tangible. It is stored in the brain, but not like data.  - Folk psychology - the most important patterns in our images -- gives us a foundation to interpret the word around us. It is culturally dependent, not genetic. It is the way we tend to pattern and interpret, based on how others around us do it. - There is no wonder tissue in our brains -- stop looking for top-down approaches to explain humans, consciousness, etc. We are not magical miracles. We are bottom-up, mechanical processes that internetwork in growing webs of complexity to create the people and cultures around us. - Evolution challenges the top-down approach, with unintelligent, aimless design (bent only on survival).Some boomcrutches: - inconvenient facts are conveniently swept away/ignored. - using false dichotomies to make it seem like there are only two alternatives. - set up exagerated strawman of someone's argument, then refute that as if it was their real argument. - subtle inclusion of irrelevent things to weaken their argument. - using words or phrases that sound deep but are vague or trivial. - be wary when someone uses the word ""surely"" or asks a rhetorical question in their argument."
232,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11254454-arensb,4,"An intuition pump, in Dennett's sense, is an analogy or metaphor that helps us to think about a harder problem.For instance imagine a whimsical jailer who goes around while the prisoners are asleep, and unlocks all the doors and leaves them that way for a few hours. Are the prisoners free to escape? The idea is not so much to answer this particular question, but to play with it and use it to help us analyze a more complex problem.In Intuition Pumps, Dennett introduces several dozen such intuition pumps and other mental tools, as well as some pitfalls (e.g., the seductive analogy that misleads us into accepting the wrong conclusion), forming a good introduction to philosophy for the interested amateur.He does concentrate on three areas: evolution, consciousness, and free will. Make of this what you will: he might be flogging his personal interests, or he might just be trying to avoid mistakes by presenting students with examples from the areas he knows best. I tend to lean toward the latter, but if you're bored silly by the very idea of discussions on free will, you may want to just skip Chapter VIII.All in all, this book is a good and lucid introduction to philosophy, including why it matters, and why even lay people can and should engage in it: when done correctly, and not just as an exercise in navel-gazing with five-dollar words, it's basically a way of thinking straight, and avoid reasoning errors.ETA: The section on computing and Turing machines is at best inaccurate and at worst misleading. The central message, that modern computers don't do anything that a Turing machine couldn't do, is correct. Yes, virtual machines are a real, and even useful, thing. And yes, a Turing machine can run a virtual version of your desktop PC and do everything it does, albeit at a ridiculously low speed.I think Dennett confuses virtualization with abstraction. Virtualization is the process of making one computer behave like another one. For instance, if you wanted to play your old Apple II games, you could set up a virtual Apple II on your desktop PC. That is, a program on your PC would pretend to be an Apple II, so that that virtual Apple II could run your old games.Abstraction, on the other hand, is, roughly, the process of hiding the low-level details from the programmer, who can ignore the small stuff and get on with making the program do what she really wants. As time goes on, more and more things are considered low-level.To hear Dennett explain it, though, you might think that programmers pile virtual machine upon virtual machine, rather than abstraction upon abstraction."
233,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10974082-christine,2,"Finished! Let me show you what I learned from this book. Take the sentence, ""I finished it."" In this sentence, finished is defined as ""I visually examined each page, including preface, introduction, and appendix but excluding sources, bibliography, and the majority of the index."" Note that there is nothing in this definition about comprehension, or understanding. That is because for one definition of ""finished"" (the definition I have chosen to use in this book review), the focus is on completion without concerns about understanding, knowledge, or the ability to disseminate the information received to others of similar (or any) level of knowledge. With me so far? Yes? I'm impressed. No? That's about how I felt for this entire book. Originally I purchased this book on a whim because I loved the phrase ""intuition pumps"" and thought it would have helpful tools for more articulate discussions in debates. And it does, but only if you're a philosopher. Dennett writes about philosophical debates on the nature of consciousness, free will, and meaning but with examples so abstract and metaphysical they'd be almost impossible to use in a conversation with laymen. That's not a bad thing, but judging from this book there's a huge gap between an interested layman and the entry level philosophy student this book is aimed at. I thought I was a reasonably well educated layman. I thought I would be able to make the stretch to entry level student. I could not. There were still a great many things I enjoyed. The concept of intuition pumps (61), the discussion of Occam's Razor(38) and Occam's Broom(40), Boom Crutches(48), learning about register machines(109). Although I still don't understand how a register machine could be useful as a thinking tool, unless maybe it's to internalize the process of reducing a particular activity down to its most basic operations to see if you could get a simple machine (or a cascade of simple machines) to perform the same job, without understanding it or even knowing what they are doing? Dennet holds that often what we assume is irreducible complexity could actually be performed (albeit more slowly) by sufficient layers of the most basic computers (loosely paraphrased from p 139). That's an interesting, terrifying idea. Terrifying because now I can't argue that we aren't all zombies, or robots. This book left me with more questions than answers, and more confusion than when I started reading it. I guess that's a good thing? I don't regret reading it, but only now that it's over. "
234,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,3,"Dennett enumerates some ``tools for thinking'', elaborates on some intuition pumps (a term he coined in 1980 which I guess is legitimate), explains why some apparent intuition pumps are counterproductive (and are instead what he calls ``boom crutches''), and applies the whole thing, inevitably, to philosophy of the mind.If Dennett's book broadly fall into two categories—moderately compelling pop sci that's basically solid but just wrong enough to annoy every reader in at least one way (Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Breaking the Spell), and intensely boring philosophy wank (Consciousness Explained, most of the rest)—Intuition Pumps &c. straddles the boundary. Parts of it are fair enough, but a lot of it is given over to tedious bullshit, a lot of which exemplifies why I feel philosophers are a waste of space: almost all of the thought experiments he finds so daunting turn out to be meaningless or trivial, and though career philosophers can arguably be forgiven for failing to recognise a thought experiment as meaningless (philosophy departments wouldn't exist if they couldn't), failing to recognise trivial ones is prety damned embarrassing for someone who's made this sort of thing his career for literally almost twice as long as I've existed.†Also, his position on free will is still basically wrong-headed, though it isn't more so than most things that have been written on the subject. He's clearly approaching a more sensible position, but at the pace he's going he'll be dead before he gets there.That said, the bits that are fair enough are, indeed, fair enough, and he manages to pull off aspects on which I expected a much worse performance (there's an entire set of chapters on computers and AI (proper CS AI, not philosophy AI), for example) surprisingly well. If every philosopher were only as bad as Dan Dennett, I wouldn't be nearly as bitter about their existence.(I also really appreciate that Gould is brought up as three instances of doing it wrong. Too many people Americans hold him in high regard, and it needs to stop.)---† I don't intend to stoop to their level and get into particulars here; most people who read my reviews know me well enough that I hope they'll give me some credit and accept that I'm not likely to be full of shit. If you end up reading Intuition Pumps and want to discuss any of it, feel free to contact me."
235,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11446002-dan,4,"Daniel Dennett is so committed to approachable philosophy one of his primary pillars is the use of interested laypeople as ""decoys"" in philisophical debate, so that philosophers are forced to explain their assumptions and the parameters of their ideas more rigorously. Consequently, his book is quite approachable to interested folks outside of philosophy.Dennett is also among the ""Four Horsemen of New Atheism"" so if that's going to irritate the hell out of you, definitely give this book a pass.I'll see if any of the thinking tools Dennett prescribes prove useful to me, and adjust to a 3 star or 5 star accordingly, if warranted. Initially, I think they will be useful. Taken together, the tools tend to emphasize the practical application over theoretical purity. Dennett very quickly gives up on/dismisses some of the big questions that excite people, such as ""Why is there something rather than nothing?"" (which he calls a pseudo-problem unworthy of inquiry). Philosophical ""qualia"" and ""zombies"" also get heaps of scorn from him. For him, the notion of ""free will"" that is used in courts should be enough for us: people never act independently from their context, but usually act with enough autonomy to be held accountable for those actions.Emblematic of his reliance on working-definitions and practical application is his repeated (sometimes tiresomely) use of the adjective ""sorta"". To him, getting into definitional arguments about the absolute limits of self, freedom, word definitions almost instantly become trivial as they search for fine distinctions that simply don't exist. Instead, just say someone is ""sorta"" thinking or ""sorta"" independent and move on.Finally, Dennett overflows with enthusiasm for both the evolutionary model and for computing. The evolutionary section of the book seemed useful and central to his main points but the extensive chapters on computing, including workbook-style programming problems to solve in a simple, theoretical model of a computer perplexed me. They seemed long and indulgent and I kept waiting for them to become relevant to the rest of the book. I never felt like they did.Overall, a worthwhile read, so long as I can remember some of his pumps and the ideas I had in response to them."

If you have some patience, you'll finish with clearer ways to examine and express your own thoughts -- or, at least, that's how I felt.There are some admittedly shocking jumps in difficulty. More than once I found myself, after twenty pages of lucid explanations, coming across a paragraph I had to read five times just to make certain I had understood it... and even then I wouldn't have bet money on it. This is the kind of book that will make you feel confident one moment and absurdly out of your depth the next. When you're jumping from physics, biology, computer science and cognitive psychology, that may just be the nature of the beast, but it fortunately never feels as though Dennett is being an obscurantist. He values lucidity, and by the end of this thing I was grateful.Dennett manages to glide from one mind-bending mystery to another and address each with wit, clarity, and frightening intelligence. It's impressive that a man so fiercely bright can keep his work from being too intimidating: his tone is that of a kindly uncle, guiding you with patience through some of the most difficult conundrums your brain can handle.While this was sometimes dense to the point that it hurt my head, if you find any of the topics interesting you'll be missing out on a feast for your brain if you don't give Intuition Pumps a shot."
237,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,3,"On the back of a very uninspiring month, following two really inspired months, I wanted a book that might reliably be jumper cables for my brain. A collection of thought experiments and ways of thinking to think about thinking, seemed beyond perfect. It wasn’t. It did get me thinking about why it wasn’t though. What are the qualities of something that is thought-provoking? At one extreme, I might argue everything and nothing is thought provoking, and all provocation is in the thought of the thinker. I’m uninspired in general, this didn’t inspire me. I was inspired in general, everything inspired me, especially the James Gleick books. At the other extreme, I have no role, and the content has objective thought-provoking qualities. If this is even partially true, where do those qualities lie? I was provoked by very few of these intuition pumps, some were novel thought experiments that I haven’t come across before. Some were literal about the knobs available to be turned one by one to reveal the underlying dependence of the pump. Some revealed that I might just have a bias against the phrasing, intuition pump, exemplified by the use in this unfortunate sentence ‘engage in mutual intuition pumping’. Mostly I was underwhelmed by my experience. It didn’t get me ‘thinking elegantly about hard questions’, as much as it told me how Daniel Dennett thinks elegantly about hard questions, with most chapters seeming to me how Frank Johnson’s colorblind Mary thought experiment seemed to DD, an answer writ large on the front of the envelope, having nothing to open up and discover, because it’s anyway just an empty envelope. It’s interesting to consider the strong possibility that, having pointed this out in Frank Johnson’s experiment, DD took immense pains not to fall into the same trap of experiment construction, placing most of the resultant emptiness squarely on the shoulders of dumb readers like myself. I’ll have more evidence once I go back to another James Gleick book immediately and compare my mental processes. NotesWhat separates ignorance from willful subterfuge? Take the chapter on Gould, and his use of ‘rathering’ to create false dichotomies. I find myself doing that all the time, not because I’m trying to fabricate polarization, but because I haven’t realized that the apparent dichotomy collapses under many subtle conditions. Rapaport Laws: How to criticize an idea. First rephrase it in a way that the other person appreciates as complete and accurate yet new. Then point out agreements. Then point out things you can borrow to make your own idea stronger. Only then criticize. Occam’s Broom: Only experts can figure out what evidence has been left out, as opposed to what’s been presented. That’s why conspiracy theories are so compelling, sweeping all inconvenient data under the carpet, where normal people won’t spot the omissions. Sturgeon’s Law: 90% of everything is garbage. Criticizing something for being bad is a terrible idea, because 90% of everything is bad. Focus on what’s good. Rathering: Create false dichotomies saying evolution does not proceed by X, rather by Y, when in case these 2 are not mutually exclusive, while you make it sound that wayPeople use ‘surely’ at the edge of their knowledge, or things they take for granted and are hoping you do too.Is understanding your psychology like the comments that coders put on source code, meant to understand the code but not at all affecting how the computer reads and executes it.‘Slippery Slope’ is often just a moat disguised as slippery slope. The line between two opposites is often thin, that makes us uncomfortable, so we create a buffer zone around it, razor wire, moat, and say the first foot into that buffer zone leads to a slippery slope. ‘Spontaneous intrusion’ the effect that we have, smells, shadows, weights etc that a virtual rendition has to meticulously add after creating our basic shapes. Nonfunctional noise, shed dust, leave wake, causes vibrations etc. Why do we need this when creating AI? Collisions induce creativityMemes needn’t increase fitness of host. Religion must be good for something because it’s everywhere? Some things are just good for themselves.Planiverse, more elegant version of FlatlandRock Paper Scissors, winning strategy is true randomness. How to achieve it without a random number generator?Evolution has given us practical unpredictability, burden of proof should be on those who say that free will requires total unpredictability.

But the past isn’t possible, there are too many possible states for each preceding step that quickly snowballs into infinite combos.Lottery A: sell tickets, then select winner. Fair? B: select winner, sell tickets. Have I sold losing tickets purposely? Ultimately they are the same thing, as long as I don’t know which is winner, every person has an equal chance of winning? True statements from history that cannot be proved, like Caesar thought of salad on June 1st. Godel? Similarly, must be true that Sherlock has or has not a mole on shoulder, but can’t be proved. Faustian bargains: 1) Solve problem once and for all laying it to rest, or complex work that will be debated for long time? Scientists pick A, Philosophers picked B. 2) Uncontroversial right thing, like Calculus/DNA Helix (Crick, but Linus P would’ve got there too), or very controversial hotly-discussed mostly wrong thing like Lamarck, Cartesian duality etc. Chomsky’s syntactical structures, while mostly wrong, birthed many descendent correct theories that have nothing to do with it, like hummingbird having nothing to do with dinosaurs. Was Chomsky wrong?Sophisticated naive auto-anthropology: start with axioms of folk beliefs held by me known to be false, try to resolve contradictions (like siphons, pipettes etc).

Leaves cricket on threshold, goes in checks burrow, comes back out and drags it in.

Does this over and over, never remembering that it has already checked the burrow. Later found that many don't, it's not some universal phenomena. Still, interesting parallels to be found. "
238,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/445677-scott,5,"At this point, it has been nearly 25 years since I read Douglas Hofstadter and Daniel Dennett's anthology, ""The Mind's I,"" as part of a philosophy class on artificial intelligence at the University of Pittsburgh. One of the most-enduring essays in that volume was Dennett's ""Where am I?"", a tour-de-force of a thought experiment that became a cultural referent, the ""brain in a vat"" controlling a body containing a substitute brain via radio waves. Dennett would refer to such a construction as an ""intuition pump,"" a contrived situation created to test the reader's thoughts and assumptions about an idea. Each of his ""intuition pumps"" has ""knobs,"" or circumstances and details, that can be adjusted and changed so that the reader can explore the idea as much (or, as little) as desired. This volume collects many of Dennett's best intuition pumps from across his long and fruitful career as a philosopher. Often Dennett's exposition is new, and his writing is remarkably free from undue resorts to the sophisticated/abstruse language of academic philosophy. However, the simplicity and clarity of his writing to the lay person does not detract from the deep exploration of ideas on what it means to know something, can a computer be intelligent and think like us, the difficulties people have conceiving of evolution, and why evolution makes sense, what it means to be conscious, and do we ultimately have free will (and does it matter?). He also concludes with a few brief notes about the practice of philosophy, and encouragement (and cautionary tales) for those who might consider a career in the field.The intuition pumps presented are brief; many can be easily read in under 30 minutes time. However, each one of them can be re-read and explored in considerable detail, and many academic careers have been fruitfully spent working through the implications of these topics, attempting to find challenges and refutations to and support for these arguments. Highly recommended for all who have an interest in thinking about thinking and have at least a casual curiosity about philosophy."
239,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82933807-donald-thomann,3,"Intuition Pumps does what it claims to do in the title: Give you a number of thinking tools that you can apply across a wide variety of topics. It falls short, though, in two major ways, which really affected my enjoyment of the book overall compared to other books that in effect do the same thing. The first is that a lot of the chapters don't mix or follow one another particularly well, and at times this just comes off like a series of blog posts. As a result the whole thing feels pretty disjointed and without any kind of central, unifying theme. The sections break down roughly to logical philosophy, evolutionary biology, consciousness, etc. but the subject categories feel mostly artificial. Which brings me to the second, more important point...These are all fairly standard tools in any advanced thinker's tool kit, and invaluable tools to a noob like myself just beginning to dive into these topics. However, the tools seem so abstracted and disjointed that it becomes hard to understand how to apply them in real situations. Let's say you know very little about automobiles, carpentry and plumbing. If you entered a garage where all the tools required for these three professions were available to you, wall to wall, floor to ceiling, you'd have everything you needed to build some stuff. However, you wouldn't have the raw materials needed to actually build anything, nor would you have the knowledge of how to use the tools or apply them properly even if you did. That's how this book felt to me. It's too basic for advanced thinkers and too abstracted and removed from practical application to be useful to an amateur. Dennett throws you a bunch of nuts and bolts and wrenches and belt sanders and crimpers and clamps without giving you the instruction manual with the image of the final product and the exploded view. All that said, I think this would be a perfect read as a companion to more concrete reading material on any of these subjects, or as a massive textbook where each tool could be applied more extensively."
240,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39894105-nestor-leal,3,"This book title was a little misguiding. I like thought experiments which are called intuition pumps in here. Turns out only a few pages are dedicated to these thinking tools then they are applied to the concepts of consciousness, free will, determinism, evolution and the mind. I like to think and philosophize about these things too but the book should have been named otherwise. Some chapters are boring to people (like me) who already know binary code, assembler language and in general how computers work. On the other hand these chapters will help the untrained to learn how they work. At the end, understanding how computers work will help you understand how many things in nature are computer like, ie. our body cells.At times it seemed like this is a good philosophy companion book to The Selfish Gene which is mostly science. There are many references to Richard Dawkins’ work and even to the game theory used in his book. In fact, Dennett states that science and philosophy should go hand in hand, to which I agree, so it makes sense. I didn’t like the arrogant tone of Daniel Dennett and how the criticizes other philosophers. Still it is an ok book.I liked his idea of making good mistakes. Learning about our mistakes is always good for improvement. Mistakes, when understood correctly, help us advance even further. This is not new but mostly nobody likes to be pointed out their mistakes except when they accept and acknowledge this will greatly help them. Still it’s better to make big mistakes than stupid mistakes.Well, reading this book seemed like a good idea at the time!"
241,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,4,"This book reads more like a science book than a philosophy book. The author, a philosopher, uses the tools of philosophy to fill in the blanks about how we proceed with science.The book starts off by how we sometimes can be mislead by 'intuition pumps"", thought experiments, and how we should correctly use them. He sets up the listener in how to think about problems and then delves into some big problems, such as design within the universe and what does it mean, and what is consciousness and how to think about it.The author is a philosopher but is much more interested in understanding the scientific method as opposed to the meaning of words.I've listened to most of the science books audible has available and a book like this helps me see beyond just the science but also how to think about the science.This author had a theme throughout this whole book. That the start of all understanding first comes about by realizing the role of evolution in the design of all non-trivial systems.I will read more of this author's work. P.S. I did end up reading more of this author's work, and it made me disappointed in this book, because he copies most of this book from his other books.

242,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5078550-robert-bor,4,"Daniel Dennett's work is not usually within my range of interest. I find the abstract nature of philosophy and it sometimes outlandish discussions to be uninteresting. However, this work is surely an exception. It takes together two aspects which interest me a lot, computer programming and evolution theory. Meaning, consciousness and free will are attacked using various utilities (called intuition pumps) which help thinking about the problems. Useless utilities (called crutch booms) are systematically destroyed. Mr Dennett relentlessly works towards (stopping just short of saying it) showing how the human mind is a beautiful and well-designed (yes, design can be used again, although it is design-without-a-designer) series of systems that all take care of their own and together form complex, conscious, free-willing systems, such as our minds. Note that Mr Dennett nowhere says this is actually the case, but between the lines, this looks to be the winner he is betting on. Mr Dennett also uses this book both as a means to reinforce real or perceived victories against philosophical enemies. I don't really get those, but it's probably part of the in-crowd show."

If they were, we would've figured them out long ago. Daniel Dennett's book offers a plethora of Thinking Tools drawn from computer science, biology and many other realms which, like the apps on your phone, give you the power to do more things better - to think difficults thoughts more easily, and even tackle the most difficult questions about meaning and consciousness. It's designed to change your way of thinking and to nudge you out of some ultimately wrong intuitions you may hold. It is basically a summary of his life's work.I think Dennett's toolkit, which is made out of many thought experiments ('Intuition Pumps') and more, is extremely useful for any aspiring thinker, whether you agree with him or not."

A mixture of pessimism and optimism. Meaning isn't going to turn out to be a simple property that maps easily onto brains, and we're not going to find ""deeper"" facts anywhere that just settle the question of what a sentence, or a thought, or a belief really means. The best we can do–and it is quite good enough–is to find and anchor (apparently) best interpretations of all the physical-stance (and design-stance) data we have. If we can find one solution to a Quinian quandary about meaning, we have almost certainly found the solution–in the sense that we may be confident that no better solution lies undiscovered. As the two-bitser's move to Panama showed, meaning is always relative to a context of function, and there need be no original intentionality beyond the intentionality of our (sorta) selfish genes, which derive their sorta intentionality from the functional context of evolution by natural selection, instead of from an Intelligent Designer playing the role of our rich client ordering a giant robot. And the intuition pump about the two black boxes shows that the intentional stance, with all its tolerance of sorta beliefs and their ilk, is not optional if you want to understand and explain many of the causal regularities in the world.Our investigations into these issues are greatly enhanced, here in the twenty-first century, by the fact that, for the first time, we have ways of thinking rigorously and vigorously about mechanisms with trillions of moving parts–parts that work in unmysterious ways. Thanks to Turing, we can at least dimly see a path now, from brute uncomprehending matter (the physical stance) via a cascade of rearrangements (the design stance, and sorta meanings) to an appreciation of ourselves as paradigmatic believers, knowers, understanders (simplified by the intentional stance as intentional systems).""Darwin's theory of evolution unites meaning with matter: ""On one side, we have the world of our mods and their meanings [...] On the other side, we have galaxies ceaselessly wheeling, planets falling pointlessly into their orbits, lifeless chemical mechanisms doing what their physics ordains, all without purpose or reason. Then Darwin comes along and shows us how the former arises from the latter, creating meaning as it goes, a bubble-up vision of the birth of importance to overthrow the trickle-down vision of tradition."" - p201Library of Mendel / Library of Babel: set of all possible permutations of DNA base-pairs / characters in the Roman alphabet. Useful analogy between words and genes to think about the vastness of possibilities. - p205Similarity between genes and words or subroutines.

We feel selfishly attached to our ideas, and assign much judgement to the failure or success of ideas. But can we assign the same judgement to the failure or success of a species?

252,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9310150-quiver,5,"Dennett courts controversy in a number of places by calling out his colleagues for being inaccurate or a little to lax with their methods of thought. His is also excessively wordy, to the point where I occasionally believed a short, single paragraph would get his idea across much better. I appreciate the examples and the historical anecdotes, though they really should have been optional whenever not directly crucial for transmitting the gist of the intuition pump.Despite all of the above, Dennet's book is trove of useful starting points. They really are starting points however: the intuition pumps are general tools that the reader needs to mull over, adopt and adapt, before slowly applying to life and academic thinking. And it's hard work, if you want to do it seriously—I've tried and it's paid off, a little. The main message is this: if you are interested in improving the sharpness of your mental edge, Dennett's book will indicate a few of the segments where you're being obtuse (dictionary meanings 1 and 3 intended). So the book won't even show you all the segments, let alone how to really sharpen them. But that's why you then go and read other books that will. It's always about climbing one rung at a time; Dennett's is an excellent rung. For that I recommend it to most people. Five stars."
253,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"In this book, Daniel Dennett covers a bit of everything he has studied: evolution / consciousness / free will / meaning / AI. I agree with another reviewer who says, ""reading this book is basically like reading Daniel Dennett in blog format."" Unlike the reviewer, I have less problem with it. Perhaps it's because I am more like a casual reader than a student in philosophy. Each intuition pump (thought experiment) discussed is relatively independent of each other, making the book friendly to a reader who reads in fragmented time. Dennett does not demonstrate ""turning all the knobs to examine a thought experiment"" in every chapter. But when he does the trick, it is often enjoyable and inspirational. To make use of this method myself, however, may require lots of practice. A few chapters I like the most and will probably re-read in the future: 	• Trapped in the Robot Control Room	• The Seven Secrets of Computer Power Revealed (on register machine) 	• Noise in the Virtual Hotel	• Mary the Color Scientist	• Dennet's intepreation of Conway's Game of Life	• The Boys from Brazil"

255,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,5,"This book is misleadingly titled  - it should be called Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking like Daniel Dennett. But no harm done.Having previously only heard of Daniel Dennett in context of his status as one of the four horsemen of the New Atheism movement, I picked up this book from Kinokuniya blind - expecting it to be a general sort of empirically-minded self-improvement book for honing your thinking techniques. Instead, I got a thinly-veiled overview of Dennett's various philosophical positions over meaning, consciousness, complexity, and free will, which are explained using such thinking tools as Dennett recommends that the reader cultivate. The subtext being that if the reader were only to apply the correct thinking tools, she would naturally reach the same, or similar, conclusions, that Dennett has.The central thinking tool in the box is really the intuition pump, a kind of thinking experiment cunningly worded and framed to get the reader to come to a desired conclusion by appealing to his or her intuitions. The term was coined by Dennett and many examples are prominently featured in this book, given such whimsically memorable names as the Curse of the Cauliflower and the Zombic Hunch. A famous example of an intuition pump (and one Dennett savages) is the Chinese Room experiment - in which one imagines a man using a set of algorithmic translation rules to translate Chinese questions into English in order to answer them. However, at no point in this process does the man actually understand the inputs - he merely acts upon them based on a set of instructions. The point of this thought experiment is to pump the intuition that - like the man in the Chinese room - computers that use algorithms to process data do not truly understand them - ergo, consciousness (i.e. understanding) cannot arise out of a set of algorithms designed to simulate its functions.The intuition pump is really a double edged sword, however, and can be used to both illuminate and mislead. This is because intuition pumps are by their very nature abstractions of philosophical problems - they simplify conditions to make it easier to think about a thing - and in some cases, to think about a thing the way the creator intended. Dennett tells us to interrogate intuition pumps by turning the knobs - in other words, changing some of the conditions or assumptions of the intuition pump and seeing if the same intuitions are pumped out. Even as Dennett presents his own intuition pumps, he also deconstructs pumps that have been devised by others. He calls misleading intuition pumps boom crutches, deliberately malappriopriating (see what I did there?) the nautical term for these anti-thinking tools that are designed to shut down thinking.Ultimately, however, after a few short chapters laying out his toolbox, Dennett begins the methodical quest of introducing the reader to his brand of philosophical thought. Dennett's positions on various matters - cognition, free will, consciousness - can be boiled down to the idea that these ideas - held by some philosophers to reside in the sacred space of epistemological inscrutability- can actually be explained with a mundane scientific approach. The hard questions are procedurally hard - but not unsolvable using scientific inquiry. In plain language, it simply means that things like consciousness or free will can be explained or described in the framework of material reality, and there is no need to posit some imagined higher substrate of reality - such as positing that consciousness manifests beyond the physical mind - in order to understand such phenomena.It's hard to distill Dennett's ideas into one paragraph, but an example of this approach is Dennett's deconstruction of the Chinese Room. That thought experiment holds that consciousness cannot manifest out of algorithms, which are ostensibly what the mind, in Dennett's model of cognition, uses - i.e. strong, conscious AI is not possible. Dennett's dictum, on the other hand, is that software, sufficiently advanced (and operating on a sufficiently complex hardware stratum like the brain), approximates consciousness to such a level of fidelity that it is indistinguishable from consciousness, and in fact, is consciousness, and in actual fact is precisely what consciousness is in reality.Think about the idea of the philosophical zombie - a being that acts and talks so like a human being that it is indistinguishable from one, except that it has no internal world, no consciousness - and elevate it to the idea of the zimboe - another philosophical creature that simulates second-order beliefs that it is a conscious thinking being, when it actually isn't. A zimboe looks, acts, and feels - or thinks it feels - like a real human being - but it doesn't actually think anything. Dennett's argument is that the zimboe is the logical outcropping of the idea that there can be p-zombies that approximate human complexity, but at that level of fidelity it would be impossible for a zimboe to be distinguished from a human being, by any means. Rather than posit some ethereal essence of consciousness, Dennett argues, why not just eliminate the need for that as-yet-undiscovered substrate and go straight to the Occam's-Razor solution - that the zimboe concept is incoherent because a sufficiently complex bundle of computational processes - i.e. the zimboe - already possesses, by dint of its mental complexity, consciousness?Back to the Chinese Room - Dennett's point is that the flaw of the intuition pump is that it doesn't specify how complex the algorithms operated upon by the man must be to make it so that the questioners who are asking the questions in Chinese are satisfied that the answers they get are from a thinking entity. Dennett's intuition is that they would have to be astoundingly complex - more complex than would be possible for one man and a pencil to analyse in any reasonable time horizon. As such, the Chinese Room thought experiment is bust because it fails to account for the possibility that the set of algorithmic instructions would only be physically possible to operationalise on a substrate capable enough to elevate it to a level in which it could be described to ""understand"" its instructions - which could approximate something like consciousness.Dennett applies this same set of thinking tools to different fields - thinking about meaning, evolution, free will. In each case Dennett purports to banish the veil of mysticism that some drape over seemingly intractable problems, and shows that they are really resolvable with the application of tried-and-true thinking methods. Another interesting example is Dennett's stance on free will. Dennett is really a compatibilist - he holds that free will is compatible with determinism. How? Simple - the kind of philosophically ideal free will that some imagine we must possess to rightly be called free is an incoherent concept. Barring quantum indeterminacy, at some level the rules of physics determine the course of the universe - that is determinism. However, reality is so complex that the kind of ""free will"" some would characterise as being required to be truly free is not required to make meaningful decisions. Dennett characterises the difference as being between a sufficiently advanced pseudo-random number generator (one that generates a random list of numbers using a series of step by step algorithms) and a ""true"" random number generator. Sufficiently advanced, there is no compelling reason to choose the latter, unless you plan to play chess with an omniscient God that can predict your every move. But who needs, or wants, that kind of ideal freedom? Free will is not a binary - it is a spectrum, and what free will we have is sufficient for our purposes down to the subatomic level.I've gone off on a bit of a tangent here - but I should be somewhat embarrassed to admit that Dennett gives voice to some of my own intuitions about mind, consciousness, and free will. I find myself agreeing with him to a very large and almost embarrassing extent. Far from being accused of being overly impressionistic, however, I should caveat that the irony of my reading experience of Dennett's tome is that I didn't glean my philosophical insights from his intuition pumps, but really from how my own intuitions corroborated with his conclusions. Dennett, here, was in effect preaching to the choir. And even more ironic was that I came away with a sneaking suspicion that his intuition pumps were simply not especially effective in conveying the point in  a watertight manner. But I suppose that is a suspicion that fosters itself. Intuition pumps are by nature unwieldy thinking tools - ripe for abuse or misuse, abstracted in ways that cloud judgment, with too many hypotheticals and variables. Are Dennett's own pumps immune to this kind of thing? Probably not. He has an easier job of it though - his positions are fundamentally more parsimonious - after all, he is arguing from the standpoint of ""possibility"" - which requires less epistemological certainty than to declare a thing ""impossible"". It is possible to conceive of consciousness, evolution and free will in terms of physical laws, and this is how it is possible to conceive of them. They may be the wrong models - perhaps consciousness does exist as a floaty-substrate, by Dennett's own admission. But Dennett doesn't have to show that his model is correct - he just has to show that it is possible to think of them as being grounded in empirics. His critics often have to show that a thing is impossible to characterize in terms of physical reality - which requires some boom crutch-y sleight of hand and other such mental breakdancing. It is impossible that consciousness is rooted in the physical world - here is inductive proof in the form of a hypothetical! Forgive me if I don't find that particularly convincing.But I ramble. Dennett's book can describe all these jumbled thoughts better than I can. Go read it, regardless of your metaphysical inclinations. I think you'll probably get something out of it. At the very least, the chance to turn some of Dennett's knobs at his invitation.I give this book: 4.5 out of 5 Sphexes"
256,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92557747-fi,3,"Not going to lie, this had been a slow read for me. The main reason is the brief misalignment of expectation at the beginning. When I saw ""over 70 tools to help you think better"", the image of a list of bite-size fun facts came to mind. Certainly it was not going to be.Daniel C Dennett is one of the most active, serious, provocative and original philosophers in the English speaking world today. So no, his work is not child's play. In Intuition Pumps, he introduced a range of thought experiments, then gradually piled on new and more complex layers. Some were for supporting his views in topics like Thinking and Meaning; some were used to confront other thinkers on topics such as Religion and Free Will.I paused many many times to break down the ideas, to try to understand and to apply them in my world. How can I find holes in which argument at what time... And it had proven to be very difficult. What I did, therefore, like a school girl, was to memorize the gist of the 77 ideas, hoping I can retrieve and use them some day. I am sure that's not how this book should be read.Part IX ""What is it like to be a Philosopher?"" is my favourite. Liking something, appreciating and studying something is completely different from actually making, doing and living it. And he quoted psychologist David Hebb's rule when he discussed where a philosopher should focus his/her energy:“If it isn’t worth doing, it isn’t worth doing well.”I think this applies to every facet of life.You should read it if▫️You want to learn a set of tools that can improve your critical thinking skills▫️You want an intro on topics like consciousness, meaning, free will, evolution & AI▫️You want an intro on Dennett's view on the above, with high conviction"
257,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2704424-nick-klagge,3,"A very interesting book, but one that I think is not quite sure what it wants to be (to take the ""intentional stance"").Dennett is a philosopher who I know about mostly through his work with Doug Hofstadter, a writer who I really like (""Godel Escher Bach,"" ""Surfaces and Essences""). They have quite similar outlooks, I think--a multidisciplinary approach that takes an interest in what fields like computer science and evolutionary biology can tell us about the nature of the mind, consciousness, and free will.The publisher describes the book as ""offer[ing] seventy-seven of Dennett's most successful 'imagination-extenders and focus-holders' meant to guide you through some of life's most treacherous subject matter: evolution, meaning, mind, and free will."" I think this captures the ambiguity of the book: is it about the tools (the eponymous pumps), or about the subject matter? Dennett would certainly call my question out as an example of ""rathering"" (presentation of a false dichotomy), but I guess my feeling is that the book puts enough focus on each that there is not a fully satisfactory treatment of either. Perhaps the book best serves as entree to Dennett's work--which I think it did well for me.I ended up most interested in his assertions about free will. I have read enough of Hofstadter to be more or less already on board with his (their) views on evolution and consciousness, such as the rejection of the conclusion of Searle's ""Chinese room"" thought experiment. But his views on free will (briefly, that it is compatible with a deterministic universe) are new to me and feel like they are legitimate but also feel like they will take some time to wrap my head around--and the book wasn't long enough for a sufficient treatment.For me, the best intuition that came out of the book is as follows: many philosophical arguments are ultimately ""arguments from incredulity"" (the Chinese room, Jackson's ""What Mary Didn't Know""), and that this is not a trustworthy form of argument. In particular, human intuition is very poorly equipped to handle scales out of the bounds of our normal experience. In each of the examples I gave above, Dennett talks about the crucial role that ""lack of imagination"" plays--Searle's experiment plays down the extreme complexity and multi-layeredness of what would have to be going on by talking about ""scraps of paper,"" and Jackson's argument relies on our inability to understand what it would really mean to acquire ""all possible observational information about visual processing of color."" For Dennett, asking if we can conceive of something is a deceptively difficult challenge--it seems like a question you should be able to answer by simple introspection, but really it requires a lot of work and thinking-tools. If you say you ""can't conceive of"" something, Dennett is likely to say that you aren't working hard enough at it. In the book, Dennett spends a great deal of time talking about Borges' ""Library of Babel,"" and working through different ways of thinking about exactly what type of entity it implies--it's not enough to ""glom together"" the concepts of ""library"" and ""really big,"" because the scale is so far beyond our direct experience of ""big"" that it is really something else altogether.This is why Dennett and Hofstadter get so much mileage out of issues surrounding computing. In a sense, computing operates at scales that are ""inconceivable"" to humans, but on the other hand, it is something that his readers are intimately familiar with. It is this cognitive dissonance that ends up being philosophically productive. It seems ""inconceivable"" to us that a Turing machine made of squares of toilet paper and rocks could, given enough time, run ""Grand Theft Auto,"" but we can also intellectually understand that that is in fact the case."
258,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62274863-phoenix,4,"Danny's Wonderful Tool BoxProfessor and philosopher Dennett starts off with the wonderful project of describing a set of techniques for productive reasoning in philosophy, and presumably in other fields as well. Calling them ""intuition pumps"", they are what physicists ""gedanken"" (thought) experiments which can be tweaked by changing a limited number parameters which Dennet likens to twisting a few ""knobs"". The opposite of a pump is called a ""boom crutch"", which are analogies to be avoided. Intuition pumps can move us forward, boom crutches leave us spinning in circles. In order to keep it simple he disciplined his material by giving it in the form of a course to a group of first year university students, so we are essentially his second class.The project starts off very well. The first section covers about a dozen different concepts such as the value of Trial and Error (fail rapidly and learn from mistakes), Reductio ad Absurdum, Anatol Rapoport's rules for successful criticism, Sturgeon's Law (90% of everything is crap ), joosting (look at problems by ""jumping out of the system"", ie: what would happen if one abandoned phlogiston, or what would a Martian think of this problem), rathering (sliding past a false dichotomy), answering rhetorical questions as the answer may surprise, Occam's Razor, Occam's Broom (watch out for sweeping inconsistencies under the rug), the ""sorta"" operator ( a recommendation against using unnecessary precision) and my favourite, deepidity - a child's neologism for ideas that sound deep (""love"" is just a word) but either is or is not. Dennet seems to approach it as a boom crutch, akin to stupidity, but maybe it can be productive of ideas as well.He then continues with several illustrating scenarios, many of which have to do with the nature of consciousness, for example contrasting the inner and outer reality of what we see, and what do we mean when we ascribe purpose to animals (sphexishness), systems and inanimate objects. Quite a few discussions centre around zombies, robots, replicants and Chinese rooms - if they pass as humans should we truly say that they have an inner life.However the project suddenly runs off the rails about 100 pages in with a 50 page discussion of Turing machines (which, if you've had it before, he invites you to skip) where he urges the reader to hand simulate a computation. How very 80s! Later on even Conway's Game of Life reappears. This is old material that doesn't tell us much about thought and could have been summarized in much less time. And then he does it again in with longer segments on Borges Infinite Library, comparing it to DNA and then evolution. All very nice but it's like listening to your favorite uncle droning on about the old country and not really why we've come to the party.So while promising at first, it does disappoint by being a bit long winded. There are some good nuggets here and there such as the impossible metaphor of a sky hook, the parable of analyzing the behaviour of black boxes, the role of knowledge in fairness of lotteries where the winning ticket is decided before or after the tickets have been sold and ""qualias"" - emotional gestalts associated with colours or objects; tidbits as to why locust population explosions favour prime number intervals and the quasi-myth of ""sphexishness"".In summary, it's good at the beginning and beats the averages of Sturgeon's Law, don't be afraid to judiciously skim. A fine toothed rating for me would be 3.7, but of course your mileage may vary."
259,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5956720-anastasia-sijabat,2,"Reading this book was a wild ride.I was at first compelled to read the book because I remember taking a Science Fiction and Philosophy module when I was an undergrad and the professor raved about this book. At that time, I didn't bother to buy the book, but when a friend said that she bought a copy, I was interested to borrow it and read it to know why that professor really liked this book.My first (and consistent) impression is that if I knew Dennett in real life, we wouldn't go along. We have a very different approach to the way we communicate that I Did Not Understand Most of His Points. The impatient me two months ago, while reading this book, would be furious and think that he was a prime example of male ego who liked to namedrop and mumble about things people don't understand just to sound smart. Today, I give him benefit of the doubt.Listen, I might be dumb, but that doesn't mean I can't learn. I was not a bright student in the Physics class when I was in high school, but I understood Stephen Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" because Hawking is a great communicator and he must've gone a long way to ensuring readers understand what he wrote. Dennett has a very different way of communicating. Example: he never gives a definition of what he discusses, so for those of you who are new to philosophy, good luck guessing what determinism is and why he writes several chapters about examples on compatibilism (the view that determinism and free will might be compatible, not contradictory) before explicitly writing that he is a compatibilist (and even so he doesn't explain what it is. I was lucky because I knew the topics he discusses beforehand).One of the materials that bothers me so much is when he thinks it's mindboggling if a human is unknowingly put into another planet that resembles Earth in every aspect except the way they call a horse. He then questions: so, if she sees an animal resembling horse on that planet but is not a horse, is it actually a horse?This is absolutely ridiculous to me. I think he could've discussed it from philosophy of language point of view, given, you know, that language is social construct so nothing is actually a word? Language is a consensus so if that woman sees a horse-like specimen but is not called a horse.... it's not a horse because the communities don't agree that it's called a horse? I'm so confused as to what kind of critical thinking he intends to arouse here.Don't get me started with the whole chapters about computers either. They were insufferable. I only understood several bits but I didn't get the whole gist (I asked myself ""so what?"" so often).One thing that drove me to not give a complete 1 star rating is his analysis on free will and determinism, and he successfully distinguishes the determinism question from moral responsibility inquiry. Perhaps that was the only new thing I learned from reading the book aside from thinking ""Yep I've known this before"" or ""What the hell does this even mean?""(edit: rating down from 3 to 2 because apparently 3 means ""liked it"" and I did not like it so...)"
260,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16074924-dan-smith,3,"This book missells itself, and has its flaws, but it's worth reading if only to encourage the reader to turn a critical eye on Dennett's own arguments.Let's get one thing out of the way, an Intuition Pump is a thought experiment as far as I can see, and giving it another label (something Dennett's denigrates in other thought experiments - see his relabelling of Mr Puppet as Captain Autonomy) changes nothing other than the rhetoric. It's all a case of My Pump Pumps Harder Than Yours, and it's a bit cheap.And another thing: this in no way contains ""70 ways to make you think better"". A few generic philosophical tools at the start are fine, but the rest are specific thought experiments to prove or disprove a point, or deconstructions of another philosopher's argument. It's a quality set of disparate points, coalescing around meaning, evolution, free will and consciousness.There's a lot of begging the question going on here - the Puppet / Autonomy label a case in point: Dennett correctly identifies the unsubtle characterisation of a person in a free-will thought experiment, but then seeks to prove his case by doing just the same. His central thesis is also curiously void at heart: I get his analysis of ever more complex ""thinking"" machines and how they could be equated to our own brains, with comparable levels of thought. But all it does is set up a comparison: why make the jump and say they must be the same? Why does this tell us anything about what consciousness is? It might do, but it can't get further than saying ""I've shown you a similar system, a computer, which has the same theoretical structure as your brain. We can't see the consciousness in my example, so... you see...? *pump pump* There! I have explained consciousness!""The thing is, I get everything he says and I sorta (to borrow his convenient fuzzy phrase) agree. But I end up not thinking he's really solved anything.He also has a frustrating habit of falling into the same rhetorical tricks as ones he painstakingly and smugly criticises others for using. For example, he spends a while constructing and example of humans constructing robots to house their cryogenic bodies, giving those robots instructions and degrees of autonomy. Fun. He then declares ""but what I have shown you is no different to genes using our bodies to replicate!"" Really? I see some parallels, and they're sorta similar, but so?It's like trying to nail down jelly. Yes, I see what you've shown me, but every time you get close to a key issue, you sorta wobble, sorta allow the nail in, and then sorta ignore it.This may be the key problem with all this sorta comparisons and thought experiments. If you're minded to agree, you see the example and agree with it. If you disagree, you'll either pick it apart (if you can) or say that it's all. All well as far as it goes but it doesn't *prove* the point.I did like his ""anything you can do, I can do meta. I can do many thing meta than you"" line. Alas, this only inspired me to think of e whole thing as this: A Metaphor? Yes, fine, but what's a meta *for*?"

I don't feel like I missed the main gist, but the details were not absorbed. It is well written, and if I had followed it and finished it, I probably would rate it higher.The book is about thinking about how we think, and tools that we can use to help (or also boomcrutches, which hinder) those processes.I got lost at the end of Part I, when it got super computery. The evolution discussions of Part II were interesting, but I got lost in that, too, before it finished. In the final part, I was lost from the get-go. The main points I have so far- Break assumptions and logics down to their most basic components, to find flaws or inconsistencies.- Making mistakes is the best way to learn. Embrace it.- Everything is dependent on context. There is no hidden or deeper meanings to things.- The original intention of nearly everything is survival.- Be aware of your emotional attachments to ideas.Some useful tools: - be fair, point out pros and cons of others work, demonstrate what you learned from it before you criticize it. - don't waste time critiquing mediocrity. - simple is best. - know the system so you can step outside of it to subvert it. - remember that brains can have little in common, but still have similar intentions. Even similar intentions will use data very differently. - There is no common structure in the huamn brain that funnels in ""meaning."" Good points in the book: - Meaning is not inherent or tangible. It is stored in the brain, but not like data.  - Folk psychology - the most important patterns in our images -- gives us a foundation to interpret the word around us. It is culturally dependent, not genetic. It is the way we tend to pattern and interpret, based on how others around us do it. - There is no wonder tissue in our brains -- stop looking for top-down approaches to explain humans, consciousness, etc. We are not magical miracles. We are bottom-up, mechanical processes that internetwork in growing webs of complexity to create the people and cultures around us. - Evolution challenges the top-down approach, with unintelligent, aimless design (bent only on survival).Some boomcrutches: - inconvenient facts are conveniently swept away/ignored. - using false dichotomies to make it seem like there are only two alternatives. - set up exagerated strawman of someone's argument, then refute that as if it was their real argument. - subtle inclusion of irrelevent things to weaken their argument. - using words or phrases that sound deep but are vague or trivial. - be wary when someone uses the word ""surely"" or asks a rhetorical question in their argument."
262,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11254454-arensb,4,"An intuition pump, in Dennett's sense, is an analogy or metaphor that helps us to think about a harder problem.For instance imagine a whimsical jailer who goes around while the prisoners are asleep, and unlocks all the doors and leaves them that way for a few hours. Are the prisoners free to escape? The idea is not so much to answer this particular question, but to play with it and use it to help us analyze a more complex problem.In Intuition Pumps, Dennett introduces several dozen such intuition pumps and other mental tools, as well as some pitfalls (e.g., the seductive analogy that misleads us into accepting the wrong conclusion), forming a good introduction to philosophy for the interested amateur.He does concentrate on three areas: evolution, consciousness, and free will. Make of this what you will: he might be flogging his personal interests, or he might just be trying to avoid mistakes by presenting students with examples from the areas he knows best. I tend to lean toward the latter, but if you're bored silly by the very idea of discussions on free will, you may want to just skip Chapter VIII.All in all, this book is a good and lucid introduction to philosophy, including why it matters, and why even lay people can and should engage in it: when done correctly, and not just as an exercise in navel-gazing with five-dollar words, it's basically a way of thinking straight, and avoid reasoning errors.ETA: The section on computing and Turing machines is at best inaccurate and at worst misleading. The central message, that modern computers don't do anything that a Turing machine couldn't do, is correct. Yes, virtual machines are a real, and even useful, thing. And yes, a Turing machine can run a virtual version of your desktop PC and do everything it does, albeit at a ridiculously low speed.I think Dennett confuses virtualization with abstraction. Virtualization is the process of making one computer behave like another one. For instance, if you wanted to play your old Apple II games, you could set up a virtual Apple II on your desktop PC. That is, a program on your PC would pretend to be an Apple II, so that that virtual Apple II could run your old games.Abstraction, on the other hand, is, roughly, the process of hiding the low-level details from the programmer, who can ignore the small stuff and get on with making the program do what she really wants. As time goes on, more and more things are considered low-level.To hear Dennett explain it, though, you might think that programmers pile virtual machine upon virtual machine, rather than abstraction upon abstraction."
263,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10974082-christine,2,"Finished! Let me show you what I learned from this book. Take the sentence, ""I finished it."" In this sentence, finished is defined as ""I visually examined each page, including preface, introduction, and appendix but excluding sources, bibliography, and the majority of the index."" Note that there is nothing in this definition about comprehension, or understanding. That is because for one definition of ""finished"" (the definition I have chosen to use in this book review), the focus is on completion without concerns about understanding, knowledge, or the ability to disseminate the information received to others of similar (or any) level of knowledge. With me so far? Yes? I'm impressed. No? That's about how I felt for this entire book. Originally I purchased this book on a whim because I loved the phrase ""intuition pumps"" and thought it would have helpful tools for more articulate discussions in debates. And it does, but only if you're a philosopher. Dennett writes about philosophical debates on the nature of consciousness, free will, and meaning but with examples so abstract and metaphysical they'd be almost impossible to use in a conversation with laymen. That's not a bad thing, but judging from this book there's a huge gap between an interested layman and the entry level philosophy student this book is aimed at. I thought I was a reasonably well educated layman. I thought I would be able to make the stretch to entry level student. I could not. There were still a great many things I enjoyed. The concept of intuition pumps (61), the discussion of Occam's Razor(38) and Occam's Broom(40), Boom Crutches(48), learning about register machines(109). Although I still don't understand how a register machine could be useful as a thinking tool, unless maybe it's to internalize the process of reducing a particular activity down to its most basic operations to see if you could get a simple machine (or a cascade of simple machines) to perform the same job, without understanding it or even knowing what they are doing? Dennet holds that often what we assume is irreducible complexity could actually be performed (albeit more slowly) by sufficient layers of the most basic computers (loosely paraphrased from p 139). That's an interesting, terrifying idea. Terrifying because now I can't argue that we aren't all zombies, or robots. This book left me with more questions than answers, and more confusion than when I started reading it. I guess that's a good thing? I don't regret reading it, but only now that it's over. "
264,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,3,"Dennett enumerates some ``tools for thinking'', elaborates on some intuition pumps (a term he coined in 1980 which I guess is legitimate), explains why some apparent intuition pumps are counterproductive (and are instead what he calls ``boom crutches''), and applies the whole thing, inevitably, to philosophy of the mind.If Dennett's book broadly fall into two categories—moderately compelling pop sci that's basically solid but just wrong enough to annoy every reader in at least one way (Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Breaking the Spell), and intensely boring philosophy wank (Consciousness Explained, most of the rest)—Intuition Pumps &c. straddles the boundary. Parts of it are fair enough, but a lot of it is given over to tedious bullshit, a lot of which exemplifies why I feel philosophers are a waste of space: almost all of the thought experiments he finds so daunting turn out to be meaningless or trivial, and though career philosophers can arguably be forgiven for failing to recognise a thought experiment as meaningless (philosophy departments wouldn't exist if they couldn't), failing to recognise trivial ones is prety damned embarrassing for someone who's made this sort of thing his career for literally almost twice as long as I've existed.†Also, his position on free will is still basically wrong-headed, though it isn't more so than most things that have been written on the subject. He's clearly approaching a more sensible position, but at the pace he's going he'll be dead before he gets there.That said, the bits that are fair enough are, indeed, fair enough, and he manages to pull off aspects on which I expected a much worse performance (there's an entire set of chapters on computers and AI (proper CS AI, not philosophy AI), for example) surprisingly well. If every philosopher were only as bad as Dan Dennett, I wouldn't be nearly as bitter about their existence.(I also really appreciate that Gould is brought up as three instances of doing it wrong. Too many people Americans hold him in high regard, and it needs to stop.)---† I don't intend to stoop to their level and get into particulars here; most people who read my reviews know me well enough that I hope they'll give me some credit and accept that I'm not likely to be full of shit. If you end up reading Intuition Pumps and want to discuss any of it, feel free to contact me."
265,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11446002-dan,4,"Daniel Dennett is so committed to approachable philosophy one of his primary pillars is the use of interested laypeople as ""decoys"" in philisophical debate, so that philosophers are forced to explain their assumptions and the parameters of their ideas more rigorously. Consequently, his book is quite approachable to interested folks outside of philosophy.Dennett is also among the ""Four Horsemen of New Atheism"" so if that's going to irritate the hell out of you, definitely give this book a pass.I'll see if any of the thinking tools Dennett prescribes prove useful to me, and adjust to a 3 star or 5 star accordingly, if warranted. Initially, I think they will be useful. Taken together, the tools tend to emphasize the practical application over theoretical purity. Dennett very quickly gives up on/dismisses some of the big questions that excite people, such as ""Why is there something rather than nothing?"" (which he calls a pseudo-problem unworthy of inquiry). Philosophical ""qualia"" and ""zombies"" also get heaps of scorn from him. For him, the notion of ""free will"" that is used in courts should be enough for us: people never act independently from their context, but usually act with enough autonomy to be held accountable for those actions.Emblematic of his reliance on working-definitions and practical application is his repeated (sometimes tiresomely) use of the adjective ""sorta"". To him, getting into definitional arguments about the absolute limits of self, freedom, word definitions almost instantly become trivial as they search for fine distinctions that simply don't exist. Instead, just say someone is ""sorta"" thinking or ""sorta"" independent and move on.Finally, Dennett overflows with enthusiasm for both the evolutionary model and for computing. The evolutionary section of the book seemed useful and central to his main points but the extensive chapters on computing, including workbook-style programming problems to solve in a simple, theoretical model of a computer perplexed me. They seemed long and indulgent and I kept waiting for them to become relevant to the rest of the book. I never felt like they did.Overall, a worthwhile read, so long as I can remember some of his pumps and the ideas I had in response to them."

If you have some patience, you'll finish with clearer ways to examine and express your own thoughts -- or, at least, that's how I felt.There are some admittedly shocking jumps in difficulty. More than once I found myself, after twenty pages of lucid explanations, coming across a paragraph I had to read five times just to make certain I had understood it... and even then I wouldn't have bet money on it. This is the kind of book that will make you feel confident one moment and absurdly out of your depth the next. When you're jumping from physics, biology, computer science and cognitive psychology, that may just be the nature of the beast, but it fortunately never feels as though Dennett is being an obscurantist. He values lucidity, and by the end of this thing I was grateful.Dennett manages to glide from one mind-bending mystery to another and address each with wit, clarity, and frightening intelligence. It's impressive that a man so fiercely bright can keep his work from being too intimidating: his tone is that of a kindly uncle, guiding you with patience through some of the most difficult conundrums your brain can handle.While this was sometimes dense to the point that it hurt my head, if you find any of the topics interesting you'll be missing out on a feast for your brain if you don't give Intuition Pumps a shot."
267,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,3,"On the back of a very uninspiring month, following two really inspired months, I wanted a book that might reliably be jumper cables for my brain. A collection of thought experiments and ways of thinking to think about thinking, seemed beyond perfect. It wasn’t. It did get me thinking about why it wasn’t though. What are the qualities of something that is thought-provoking? At one extreme, I might argue everything and nothing is thought provoking, and all provocation is in the thought of the thinker. I’m uninspired in general, this didn’t inspire me. I was inspired in general, everything inspired me, especially the James Gleick books. At the other extreme, I have no role, and the content has objective thought-provoking qualities. If this is even partially true, where do those qualities lie? I was provoked by very few of these intuition pumps, some were novel thought experiments that I haven’t come across before. Some were literal about the knobs available to be turned one by one to reveal the underlying dependence of the pump. Some revealed that I might just have a bias against the phrasing, intuition pump, exemplified by the use in this unfortunate sentence ‘engage in mutual intuition pumping’. Mostly I was underwhelmed by my experience. It didn’t get me ‘thinking elegantly about hard questions’, as much as it told me how Daniel Dennett thinks elegantly about hard questions, with most chapters seeming to me how Frank Johnson’s colorblind Mary thought experiment seemed to DD, an answer writ large on the front of the envelope, having nothing to open up and discover, because it’s anyway just an empty envelope. It’s interesting to consider the strong possibility that, having pointed this out in Frank Johnson’s experiment, DD took immense pains not to fall into the same trap of experiment construction, placing most of the resultant emptiness squarely on the shoulders of dumb readers like myself. I’ll have more evidence once I go back to another James Gleick book immediately and compare my mental processes. NotesWhat separates ignorance from willful subterfuge? Take the chapter on Gould, and his use of ‘rathering’ to create false dichotomies. I find myself doing that all the time, not because I’m trying to fabricate polarization, but because I haven’t realized that the apparent dichotomy collapses under many subtle conditions. Rapaport Laws: How to criticize an idea. First rephrase it in a way that the other person appreciates as complete and accurate yet new. Then point out agreements. Then point out things you can borrow to make your own idea stronger. Only then criticize. Occam’s Broom: Only experts can figure out what evidence has been left out, as opposed to what’s been presented. That’s why conspiracy theories are so compelling, sweeping all inconvenient data under the carpet, where normal people won’t spot the omissions. Sturgeon’s Law: 90% of everything is garbage. Criticizing something for being bad is a terrible idea, because 90% of everything is bad. Focus on what’s good. Rathering: Create false dichotomies saying evolution does not proceed by X, rather by Y, when in case these 2 are not mutually exclusive, while you make it sound that wayPeople use ‘surely’ at the edge of their knowledge, or things they take for granted and are hoping you do too.Is understanding your psychology like the comments that coders put on source code, meant to understand the code but not at all affecting how the computer reads and executes it.‘Slippery Slope’ is often just a moat disguised as slippery slope. The line between two opposites is often thin, that makes us uncomfortable, so we create a buffer zone around it, razor wire, moat, and say the first foot into that buffer zone leads to a slippery slope. ‘Spontaneous intrusion’ the effect that we have, smells, shadows, weights etc that a virtual rendition has to meticulously add after creating our basic shapes. Nonfunctional noise, shed dust, leave wake, causes vibrations etc. Why do we need this when creating AI? Collisions induce creativityMemes needn’t increase fitness of host. Religion must be good for something because it’s everywhere? Some things are just good for themselves.Planiverse, more elegant version of FlatlandRock Paper Scissors, winning strategy is true randomness. How to achieve it without a random number generator?Evolution has given us practical unpredictability, burden of proof should be on those who say that free will requires total unpredictability. Conway Game Of Life: Since physics of this world are clear, it’s deterministic and can chart out entire future given a certain start position. But the past isn’t possible, there are too many possible states for each preceding step that quickly snowballs into infinite combos.Lottery A: sell tickets, then select winner. Fair? B: select winner, sell tickets. Have I sold losing tickets purposely? Ultimately they are the same thing, as long as I don’t know which is winner, every person has an equal chance of winning? True statements from history that cannot be proved, like Caesar thought of salad on June 1st. Godel? Similarly, must be true that Sherlock has or has not a mole on shoulder, but can’t be proved. Faustian bargains: 1) Solve problem once and for all laying it to rest, or complex work that will be debated for long time? Scientists pick A, Philosophers picked B. 2) Uncontroversial right thing, like Calculus/DNA Helix (Crick, but Linus P would’ve got there too), or very controversial hotly-discussed mostly wrong thing like Lamarck, Cartesian duality etc. Chomsky’s syntactical structures, while mostly wrong, birthed many descendent correct theories that have nothing to do with it, like hummingbird having nothing to do with dinosaurs. Was Chomsky wrong?Sophisticated naive auto-anthropology: start with axioms of folk beliefs held by me known to be false, try to resolve contradictions (like siphons, pipettes etc). Naive naive auto-anthropology, start with axioms trying to get to an objective truth. Analytical metaphysics.After having read about this in 3-4 books in the space of a couple months, only now realized what universal machine is. Programs are just series of bits/numbers with main program having ability to read those bits.If we'd done something, we'd recall it now. Absence of evidence equals evidence of absence. Some things are forgotten, other false memories added. Center of narrative gravityHusserl's autophenomenology Vs Sennett heterophenomenologyCan't change the past, but can change the future? No. from what to what?Sphexing: Sphex wasp that paralyzes a cricket, drags into burrow and lays eggs that can feed on still-paralyzed cricket upon hatching. Leaves cricket on threshold, goes in checks burrow, comes back out and drags it in. If the cricket is moved a little by malevolent biologist, it will bring it back to threshold, go back in and check burrow again. Does this over and over, never remembering that it has already checked the burrow. Later found that many don't, it's not some universal phenomena. Still, interesting parallels to be found. "
268,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/445677-scott,5,"At this point, it has been nearly 25 years since I read Douglas Hofstadter and Daniel Dennett's anthology, ""The Mind's I,"" as part of a philosophy class on artificial intelligence at the University of Pittsburgh. One of the most-enduring essays in that volume was Dennett's ""Where am I?"", a tour-de-force of a thought experiment that became a cultural referent, the ""brain in a vat"" controlling a body containing a substitute brain via radio waves. Dennett would refer to such a construction as an ""intuition pump,"" a contrived situation created to test the reader's thoughts and assumptions about an idea. Each of his ""intuition pumps"" has ""knobs,"" or circumstances and details, that can be adjusted and changed so that the reader can explore the idea as much (or, as little) as desired. This volume collects many of Dennett's best intuition pumps from across his long and fruitful career as a philosopher. Often Dennett's exposition is new, and his writing is remarkably free from undue resorts to the sophisticated/abstruse language of academic philosophy. However, the simplicity and clarity of his writing to the lay person does not detract from the deep exploration of ideas on what it means to know something, can a computer be intelligent and think like us, the difficulties people have conceiving of evolution, and why evolution makes sense, what it means to be conscious, and do we ultimately have free will (and does it matter?). He also concludes with a few brief notes about the practice of philosophy, and encouragement (and cautionary tales) for those who might consider a career in the field.The intuition pumps presented are brief; many can be easily read in under 30 minutes time. However, each one of them can be re-read and explored in considerable detail, and many academic careers have been fruitfully spent working through the implications of these topics, attempting to find challenges and refutations to and support for these arguments. Highly recommended for all who have an interest in thinking about thinking and have at least a casual curiosity about philosophy."
269,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82933807-donald-thomann,3,"Intuition Pumps does what it claims to do in the title: Give you a number of thinking tools that you can apply across a wide variety of topics. It falls short, though, in two major ways, which really affected my enjoyment of the book overall compared to other books that in effect do the same thing. The first is that a lot of the chapters don't mix or follow one another particularly well, and at times this just comes off like a series of blog posts. As a result the whole thing feels pretty disjointed and without any kind of central, unifying theme. The sections break down roughly to logical philosophy, evolutionary biology, consciousness, etc. but the subject categories feel mostly artificial. Which brings me to the second, more important point...These are all fairly standard tools in any advanced thinker's tool kit, and invaluable tools to a noob like myself just beginning to dive into these topics. However, the tools seem so abstracted and disjointed that it becomes hard to understand how to apply them in real situations. Let's say you know very little about automobiles, carpentry and plumbing. If you entered a garage where all the tools required for these three professions were available to you, wall to wall, floor to ceiling, you'd have everything you needed to build some stuff. However, you wouldn't have the raw materials needed to actually build anything, nor would you have the knowledge of how to use the tools or apply them properly even if you did. That's how this book felt to me. It's too basic for advanced thinkers and too abstracted and removed from practical application to be useful to an amateur. Dennett throws you a bunch of nuts and bolts and wrenches and belt sanders and crimpers and clamps without giving you the instruction manual with the image of the final product and the exploded view. All that said, I think this would be a perfect read as a companion to more concrete reading material on any of these subjects, or as a massive textbook where each tool could be applied more extensively."
270,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39894105-nestor-leal,3,"This book title was a little misguiding. I like thought experiments which are called intuition pumps in here. Turns out only a few pages are dedicated to these thinking tools then they are applied to the concepts of consciousness, free will, determinism, evolution and the mind. I like to think and philosophize about these things too but the book should have been named otherwise. Some chapters are boring to people (like me) who already know binary code, assembler language and in general how computers work. On the other hand these chapters will help the untrained to learn how they work. At the end, understanding how computers work will help you understand how many things in nature are computer like, ie. our body cells.At times it seemed like this is a good philosophy companion book to The Selfish Gene which is mostly science. There are many references to Richard Dawkins’ work and even to the game theory used in his book. In fact, Dennett states that science and philosophy should go hand in hand, to which I agree, so it makes sense. I didn’t like the arrogant tone of Daniel Dennett and how the criticizes other philosophers. Still it is an ok book.I liked his idea of making good mistakes. Learning about our mistakes is always good for improvement. Mistakes, when understood correctly, help us advance even further. This is not new but mostly nobody likes to be pointed out their mistakes except when they accept and acknowledge this will greatly help them. Still it’s better to make big mistakes than stupid mistakes.Well, reading this book seemed like a good idea at the time!"

The author, a philosopher, uses the tools of philosophy to fill in the blanks about how we proceed with science.The book starts off by how we sometimes can be mislead by 'intuition pumps"", thought experiments, and how we should correctly use them. He sets up the listener in how to think about problems and then delves into some big problems, such as design within the universe and what does it mean, and what is consciousness and how to think about it.The author is a philosopher but is much more interested in understanding the scientific method as opposed to the meaning of words.I've listened to most of the science books audible has available and a book like this helps me see beyond just the science but also how to think about the science.This author had a theme throughout this whole book. That the start of all understanding first comes about by realizing the role of evolution in the design of all non-trivial systems.I will read more of this author's work. P.S. I did end up reading more of this author's work, and it made me disappointed in this book, because he copies most of this book from his other books.

I find the abstract nature of philosophy and it sometimes outlandish discussions to be uninteresting. However, this work is surely an exception. It takes together two aspects which interest me a lot, computer programming and evolution theory. Meaning, consciousness and free will are attacked using various utilities (called intuition pumps) which help thinking about the problems. Useless utilities (called crutch booms) are systematically destroyed. Mr Dennett relentlessly works towards (stopping just short of saying it) showing how the human mind is a beautiful and well-designed (yes, design can be used again, although it is design-without-a-designer) series of systems that all take care of their own and together form complex, conscious, free-willing systems, such as our minds. Note that Mr Dennett nowhere says this is actually the case, but between the lines, this looks to be the winner he is betting on. Mr Dennett also uses this book both as a means to reinforce real or perceived victories against philosophical enemies. I don't really get those, but it's probably part of the in-crowd show."

If they were, we would've figured them out long ago. Daniel Dennett's book offers a plethora of Thinking Tools drawn from computer science, biology and many other realms which, like the apps on your phone, give you the power to do more things better - to think difficults thoughts more easily, and even tackle the most difficult questions about meaning and consciousness. It's designed to change your way of thinking and to nudge you out of some ultimately wrong intuitions you may hold.

I resisted actually stretching my grasp of the tools for thinking about thinking. And for thinking about free will, evolution, and other topics I love thinking about but that I think I already am good at thinking about. But ya know, Prof. Dennett is the champ at pumping intuition. 5 stars for the champ. I suppose this is not as entertaining as, say, Darwin's Dangerous Idea or Breaking the Spell. Learning to use new tools, I realize, is a little uncomfortable at times. How could it not be so?"

Giant robot intuition pump addresses this question. - p166Excellent summary of theory of meaning on p197-198:""And what are the verdicts of this long section on meaning? A mixture of pessimism and optimism. Meaning isn't going to turn out to be a simple property that maps easily onto brains, and we're not going to find ""deeper"" facts anywhere that just settle the question of what a sentence, or a thought, or a belief really means. The best we can do–and it is quite good enough–is to find and anchor (apparently) best interpretations of all the physical-stance (and design-stance) data we have. If we can find one solution to a Quinian quandary about meaning, we have almost certainly found the solution–in the sense that we may be confident that no better solution lies undiscovered. As the two-bitser's move to Panama showed, meaning is always relative to a context of function, and there need be no original intentionality beyond the intentionality of our (sorta) selfish genes, which derive their sorta intentionality from the functional context of evolution by natural selection, instead of from an Intelligent Designer playing the role of our rich client ordering a giant robot. And the intuition pump about the two black boxes shows that the intentional stance, with all its tolerance of sorta beliefs and their ilk, is not optional if you want to understand and explain many of the causal regularities in the world.Our investigations into these issues are greatly enhanced, here in the twenty-first century, by the fact that, for the first time, we have ways of thinking rigorously and vigorously about mechanisms with trillions of moving parts–parts that work in unmysterious ways. Thanks to Turing, we can at least dimly see a path now, from brute uncomprehending matter (the physical stance) via a cascade of rearrangements (the design stance, and sorta meanings) to an appreciation of ourselves as paradigmatic believers, knowers, understanders (simplified by the intentional stance as intentional systems).""Darwin's theory of evolution unites meaning with matter: ""On one side, we have the world of our mods and their meanings [...] On the other side, we have galaxies ceaselessly wheeling, planets falling pointlessly into their orbits, lifeless chemical mechanisms doing what their physics ordains, all without purpose or reason.

282,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9310150-quiver,5,"Dennett courts controversy in a number of places by calling out his colleagues for being inaccurate or a little to lax with their methods of thought. His is also excessively wordy, to the point where I occasionally believed a short, single paragraph would get his idea across much better. I appreciate the examples and the historical anecdotes, though they really should have been optional whenever not directly crucial for transmitting the gist of the intuition pump.Despite all of the above, Dennet's book is trove of useful starting points. They really are starting points however: the intuition pumps are general tools that the reader needs to mull over, adopt and adapt, before slowly applying to life and academic thinking. And it's hard work, if you want to do it seriously—I've tried and it's paid off, a little. The main message is this: if you are interested in improving the sharpness of your mental edge, Dennett's book will indicate a few of the segments where you're being obtuse (dictionary meanings 1 and 3 intended). So the book won't even show you all the segments, let alone how to really sharpen them. But that's why you then go and read other books that will. It's always about climbing one rung at a time; Dennett's is an excellent rung. For that I recommend it to most people. Five stars."

I agree with another reviewer who says, ""reading this book is basically like reading Daniel Dennett in blog format."" Unlike the reviewer, I have less problem with it. Perhaps it's because I am more like a casual reader than a student in philosophy. Each intuition pump (thought experiment) discussed is relatively independent of each other, making the book friendly to a reader who reads in fragmented time. Dennett does not demonstrate ""turning all the knobs to examine a thought experiment"" in every chapter. But when he does the trick, it is often enjoyable and inspirational. To make use of this method myself, however, may require lots of practice. A few chapters I like the most and will probably re-read in the future: 	• Trapped in the Robot Control Room	• The Seven Secrets of Computer Power Revealed (on register machine) 	• Noise in the Virtual Hotel	• Mary the Color Scientist	• Dennet's intepreation of Conway's Game of Life	• The Boys from Brazil"

285,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,5,"This book is misleadingly titled  - it should be called Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking like Daniel Dennett. But no harm done.Having previously only heard of Daniel Dennett in context of his status as one of the four horsemen of the New Atheism movement, I picked up this book from Kinokuniya blind - expecting it to be a general sort of empirically-minded self-improvement book for honing your thinking techniques. Instead, I got a thinly-veiled overview of Dennett's various philosophical positions over meaning, consciousness, complexity, and free will, which are explained using such thinking tools as Dennett recommends that the reader cultivate. The subtext being that if the reader were only to apply the correct thinking tools, she would naturally reach the same, or similar, conclusions, that Dennett has.The central thinking tool in the box is really the intuition pump, a kind of thinking experiment cunningly worded and framed to get the reader to come to a desired conclusion by appealing to his or her intuitions. The term was coined by Dennett and many examples are prominently featured in this book, given such whimsically memorable names as the Curse of the Cauliflower and the Zombic Hunch. A famous example of an intuition pump (and one Dennett savages) is the Chinese Room experiment - in which one imagines a man using a set of algorithmic translation rules to translate Chinese questions into English in order to answer them. However, at no point in this process does the man actually understand the inputs - he merely acts upon them based on a set of instructions. The point of this thought experiment is to pump the intuition that - like the man in the Chinese room - computers that use algorithms to process data do not truly understand them - ergo, consciousness (i.e. understanding) cannot arise out of a set of algorithms designed to simulate its functions.The intuition pump is really a double edged sword, however, and can be used to both illuminate and mislead. This is because intuition pumps are by their very nature abstractions of philosophical problems - they simplify conditions to make it easier to think about a thing - and in some cases, to think about a thing the way the creator intended. Dennett tells us to interrogate intuition pumps by turning the knobs - in other words, changing some of the conditions or assumptions of the intuition pump and seeing if the same intuitions are pumped out. Even as Dennett presents his own intuition pumps, he also deconstructs pumps that have been devised by others. He calls misleading intuition pumps boom crutches, deliberately malappriopriating (see what I did there?) the nautical term for these anti-thinking tools that are designed to shut down thinking.Ultimately, however, after a few short chapters laying out his toolbox, Dennett begins the methodical quest of introducing the reader to his brand of philosophical thought. Dennett's positions on various matters - cognition, free will, consciousness - can be boiled down to the idea that these ideas - held by some philosophers to reside in the sacred space of epistemological inscrutability- can actually be explained with a mundane scientific approach. The hard questions are procedurally hard - but not unsolvable using scientific inquiry. In plain language, it simply means that things like consciousness or free will can be explained or described in the framework of material reality, and there is no need to posit some imagined higher substrate of reality - such as positing that consciousness manifests beyond the physical mind - in order to understand such phenomena.It's hard to distill Dennett's ideas into one paragraph, but an example of this approach is Dennett's deconstruction of the Chinese Room. That thought experiment holds that consciousness cannot manifest out of algorithms, which are ostensibly what the mind, in Dennett's model of cognition, uses - i.e. strong, conscious AI is not possible. Dennett's dictum, on the other hand, is that software, sufficiently advanced (and operating on a sufficiently complex hardware stratum like the brain), approximates consciousness to such a level of fidelity that it is indistinguishable from consciousness, and in fact, is consciousness, and in actual fact is precisely what consciousness is in reality.Think about the idea of the philosophical zombie - a being that acts and talks so like a human being that it is indistinguishable from one, except that it has no internal world, no consciousness - and elevate it to the idea of the zimboe - another philosophical creature that simulates second-order beliefs that it is a conscious thinking being, when it actually isn't. A zimboe looks, acts, and feels - or thinks it feels - like a real human being - but it doesn't actually think anything. Dennett's argument is that the zimboe is the logical outcropping of the idea that there can be p-zombies that approximate human complexity, but at that level of fidelity it would be impossible for a zimboe to be distinguished from a human being, by any means. Rather than posit some ethereal essence of consciousness, Dennett argues, why not just eliminate the need for that as-yet-undiscovered substrate and go straight to the Occam's-Razor solution - that the zimboe concept is incoherent because a sufficiently complex bundle of computational processes - i.e. the zimboe - already possesses, by dint of its mental complexity, consciousness?Back to the Chinese Room - Dennett's point is that the flaw of the intuition pump is that it doesn't specify how complex the algorithms operated upon by the man must be to make it so that the questioners who are asking the questions in Chinese are satisfied that the answers they get are from a thinking entity. Dennett's intuition is that they would have to be astoundingly complex - more complex than would be possible for one man and a pencil to analyse in any reasonable time horizon. As such, the Chinese Room thought experiment is bust because it fails to account for the possibility that the set of algorithmic instructions would only be physically possible to operationalise on a substrate capable enough to elevate it to a level in which it could be described to ""understand"" its instructions - which could approximate something like consciousness.Dennett applies this same set of thinking tools to different fields - thinking about meaning, evolution, free will. In each case Dennett purports to banish the veil of mysticism that some drape over seemingly intractable problems, and shows that they are really resolvable with the application of tried-and-true thinking methods. Another interesting example is Dennett's stance on free will. Dennett is really a compatibilist - he holds that free will is compatible with determinism. How? Simple - the kind of philosophically ideal free will that some imagine we must possess to rightly be called free is an incoherent concept. Barring quantum indeterminacy, at some level the rules of physics determine the course of the universe - that is determinism. However, reality is so complex that the kind of ""free will"" some would characterise as being required to be truly free is not required to make meaningful decisions. Dennett characterises the difference as being between a sufficiently advanced pseudo-random number generator (one that generates a random list of numbers using a series of step by step algorithms) and a ""true"" random number generator. Sufficiently advanced, there is no compelling reason to choose the latter, unless you plan to play chess with an omniscient God that can predict your every move. But who needs, or wants, that kind of ideal freedom? Free will is not a binary - it is a spectrum, and what free will we have is sufficient for our purposes down to the subatomic level.I've gone off on a bit of a tangent here - but I should be somewhat embarrassed to admit that Dennett gives voice to some of my own intuitions about mind, consciousness, and free will. I find myself agreeing with him to a very large and almost embarrassing extent. Far from being accused of being overly impressionistic, however, I should caveat that the irony of my reading experience of Dennett's tome is that I didn't glean my philosophical insights from his intuition pumps, but really from how my own intuitions corroborated with his conclusions. Dennett, here, was in effect preaching to the choir. And even more ironic was that I came away with a sneaking suspicion that his intuition pumps were simply not especially effective in conveying the point in  a watertight manner. But I suppose that is a suspicion that fosters itself. Intuition pumps are by nature unwieldy thinking tools - ripe for abuse or misuse, abstracted in ways that cloud judgment, with too many hypotheticals and variables. Are Dennett's own pumps immune to this kind of thing? Probably not. He has an easier job of it though - his positions are fundamentally more parsimonious - after all, he is arguing from the standpoint of ""possibility"" - which requires less epistemological certainty than to declare a thing ""impossible"". It is possible to conceive of consciousness, evolution and free will in terms of physical laws, and this is how it is possible to conceive of them. They may be the wrong models - perhaps consciousness does exist as a floaty-substrate, by Dennett's own admission. But Dennett doesn't have to show that his model is correct - he just has to show that it is possible to think of them as being grounded in empirics. His critics often have to show that a thing is impossible to characterize in terms of physical reality - which requires some boom crutch-y sleight of hand and other such mental breakdancing. It is impossible that consciousness is rooted in the physical world - here is inductive proof in the form of a hypothetical! Forgive me if I don't find that particularly convincing.But I ramble. Dennett's book can describe all these jumbled thoughts better than I can. Go read it, regardless of your metaphysical inclinations. I think you'll probably get something out of it. At the very least, the chance to turn some of Dennett's knobs at his invitation.I give this book: 4.5 out of 5 Sphexes"
286,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92557747-fi,3,"Not going to lie, this had been a slow read for me. The main reason is the brief misalignment of expectation at the beginning. When I saw ""over 70 tools to help you think better"", the image of a list of bite-size fun facts came to mind. Certainly it was not going to be.Daniel C Dennett is one of the most active, serious, provocative and original philosophers in the English speaking world today. So no, his work is not child's play. In Intuition Pumps, he introduced a range of thought experiments, then gradually piled on new and more complex layers. Some were for supporting his views in topics like Thinking and Meaning; some were used to confront other thinkers on topics such as Religion and Free Will.I paused many many times to break down the ideas, to try to understand and to apply them in my world. How can I find holes in which argument at what time... And it had proven to be very difficult. What I did, therefore, like a school girl, was to memorize the gist of the 77 ideas, hoping I can retrieve and use them some day. I am sure that's not how this book should be read.Part IX ""What is it like to be a Philosopher?"" is my favourite. Liking something, appreciating and studying something is completely different from actually making, doing and living it. And he quoted psychologist David Hebb's rule when he discussed where a philosopher should focus his/her energy:“If it isn’t worth doing, it isn’t worth doing well.”I think this applies to every facet of life.You should read it if▫️You want to learn a set of tools that can improve your critical thinking skills▫️You want an intro on topics like consciousness, meaning, free will, evolution & AI▫️You want an intro on Dennett's view on the above, with high conviction"
287,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2704424-nick-klagge,3,"A very interesting book, but one that I think is not quite sure what it wants to be (to take the ""intentional stance"").Dennett is a philosopher who I know about mostly through his work with Doug Hofstadter, a writer who I really like (""Godel Escher Bach,"" ""Surfaces and Essences""). They have quite similar outlooks, I think--a multidisciplinary approach that takes an interest in what fields like computer science and evolutionary biology can tell us about the nature of the mind, consciousness, and free will.The publisher describes the book as ""offer[ing] seventy-seven of Dennett's most successful 'imagination-extenders and focus-holders' meant to guide you through some of life's most treacherous subject matter: evolution, meaning, mind, and free will."" I think this captures the ambiguity of the book: is it about the tools (the eponymous pumps), or about the subject matter? Dennett would certainly call my question out as an example of ""rathering"" (presentation of a false dichotomy), but I guess my feeling is that the book puts enough focus on each that there is not a fully satisfactory treatment of either. Perhaps the book best serves as entree to Dennett's work--which I think it did well for me.I ended up most interested in his assertions about free will. I have read enough of Hofstadter to be more or less already on board with his (their) views on evolution and consciousness, such as the rejection of the conclusion of Searle's ""Chinese room"" thought experiment. But his views on free will (briefly, that it is compatible with a deterministic universe) are new to me and feel like they are legitimate but also feel like they will take some time to wrap my head around--and the book wasn't long enough for a sufficient treatment.For me, the best intuition that came out of the book is as follows: many philosophical arguments are ultimately ""arguments from incredulity"" (the Chinese room, Jackson's ""What Mary Didn't Know""), and that this is not a trustworthy form of argument. In particular, human intuition is very poorly equipped to handle scales out of the bounds of our normal experience. In each of the examples I gave above, Dennett talks about the crucial role that ""lack of imagination"" plays--Searle's experiment plays down the extreme complexity and multi-layeredness of what would have to be going on by talking about ""scraps of paper,"" and Jackson's argument relies on our inability to understand what it would really mean to acquire ""all possible observational information about visual processing of color."" For Dennett, asking if we can conceive of something is a deceptively difficult challenge--it seems like a question you should be able to answer by simple introspection, but really it requires a lot of work and thinking-tools. If you say you ""can't conceive of"" something, Dennett is likely to say that you aren't working hard enough at it. In the book, Dennett spends a great deal of time talking about Borges' ""Library of Babel,"" and working through different ways of thinking about exactly what type of entity it implies--it's not enough to ""glom together"" the concepts of ""library"" and ""really big,"" because the scale is so far beyond our direct experience of ""big"" that it is really something else altogether.This is why Dennett and Hofstadter get so much mileage out of issues surrounding computing. In a sense, computing operates at scales that are ""inconceivable"" to humans, but on the other hand, it is something that his readers are intimately familiar with. It is this cognitive dissonance that ends up being philosophically productive. It seems ""inconceivable"" to us that a Turing machine made of squares of toilet paper and rocks could, given enough time, run ""Grand Theft Auto,"" but we can also intellectually understand that that is in fact the case."
288,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62274863-phoenix,4,"Danny's Wonderful Tool BoxProfessor and philosopher Dennett starts off with the wonderful project of describing a set of techniques for productive reasoning in philosophy, and presumably in other fields as well. Calling them ""intuition pumps"", they are what physicists ""gedanken"" (thought) experiments which can be tweaked by changing a limited number parameters which Dennet likens to twisting a few ""knobs"". The opposite of a pump is called a ""boom crutch"", which are analogies to be avoided. Intuition pumps can move us forward, boom crutches leave us spinning in circles. In order to keep it simple he disciplined his material by giving it in the form of a course to a group of first year university students, so we are essentially his second class.The project starts off very well. The first section covers about a dozen different concepts such as the value of Trial and Error (fail rapidly and learn from mistakes), Reductio ad Absurdum, Anatol Rapoport's rules for successful criticism, Sturgeon's Law (90% of everything is crap ), joosting (look at problems by ""jumping out of the system"", ie: what would happen if one abandoned phlogiston, or what would a Martian think of this problem), rathering (sliding past a false dichotomy), answering rhetorical questions as the answer may surprise, Occam's Razor, Occam's Broom (watch out for sweeping inconsistencies under the rug), the ""sorta"" operator ( a recommendation against using unnecessary precision) and my favourite, deepidity - a child's neologism for ideas that sound deep (""love"" is just a word) but either is or is not. Dennet seems to approach it as a boom crutch, akin to stupidity, but maybe it can be productive of ideas as well.He then continues with several illustrating scenarios, many of which have to do with the nature of consciousness, for example contrasting the inner and outer reality of what we see, and what do we mean when we ascribe purpose to animals (sphexishness), systems and inanimate objects. Quite a few discussions centre around zombies, robots, replicants and Chinese rooms - if they pass as humans should we truly say that they have an inner life.However the project suddenly runs off the rails about 100 pages in with a 50 page discussion of Turing machines (which, if you've had it before, he invites you to skip) where he urges the reader to hand simulate a computation. How very 80s! Later on even Conway's Game of Life reappears. This is old material that doesn't tell us much about thought and could have been summarized in much less time. And then he does it again in with longer segments on Borges Infinite Library, comparing it to DNA and then evolution. All very nice but it's like listening to your favorite uncle droning on about the old country and not really why we've come to the party.So while promising at first, it does disappoint by being a bit long winded. There are some good nuggets here and there such as the impossible metaphor of a sky hook, the parable of analyzing the behaviour of black boxes, the role of knowledge in fairness of lotteries where the winning ticket is decided before or after the tickets have been sold and ""qualias"" - emotional gestalts associated with colours or objects; tidbits as to why locust population explosions favour prime number intervals and the quasi-myth of ""sphexishness"".In summary, it's good at the beginning and beats the averages of Sturgeon's Law, don't be afraid to judiciously skim. A fine toothed rating for me would be 3.7, but of course your mileage may vary."
289,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5956720-anastasia-sijabat,2,"Reading this book was a wild ride.I was at first compelled to read the book because I remember taking a Science Fiction and Philosophy module when I was an undergrad and the professor raved about this book. At that time, I didn't bother to buy the book, but when a friend said that she bought a copy, I was interested to borrow it and read it to know why that professor really liked this book.My first (and consistent) impression is that if I knew Dennett in real life, we wouldn't go along. We have a very different approach to the way we communicate that I Did Not Understand Most of His Points. The impatient me two months ago, while reading this book, would be furious and think that he was a prime example of male ego who liked to namedrop and mumble about things people don't understand just to sound smart. Today, I give him benefit of the doubt.Listen, I might be dumb, but that doesn't mean I can't learn. I was not a bright student in the Physics class when I was in high school, but I understood Stephen Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" because Hawking is a great communicator and he must've gone a long way to ensuring readers understand what he wrote. Dennett has a very different way of communicating. Example: he never gives a definition of what he discusses, so for those of you who are new to philosophy, good luck guessing what determinism is and why he writes several chapters about examples on compatibilism (the view that determinism and free will might be compatible, not contradictory) before explicitly writing that he is a compatibilist (and even so he doesn't explain what it is. I was lucky because I knew the topics he discusses beforehand).One of the materials that bothers me so much is when he thinks it's mindboggling if a human is unknowingly put into another planet that resembles Earth in every aspect except the way they call a horse. He then questions: so, if she sees an animal resembling horse on that planet but is not a horse, is it actually a horse?This is absolutely ridiculous to me. I think he could've discussed it from philosophy of language point of view, given, you know, that language is social construct so nothing is actually a word? Language is a consensus so if that woman sees a horse-like specimen but is not called a horse.... it's not a horse because the communities don't agree that it's called a horse? I'm so confused as to what kind of critical thinking he intends to arouse here.Don't get me started with the whole chapters about computers either. They were insufferable. I only understood several bits but I didn't get the whole gist (I asked myself ""so what?"" so often).One thing that drove me to not give a complete 1 star rating is his analysis on free will and determinism, and he successfully distinguishes the determinism question from moral responsibility inquiry. Perhaps that was the only new thing I learned from reading the book aside from thinking ""Yep I've known this before"" or ""What the hell does this even mean?""(edit: rating down from 3 to 2 because apparently 3 means ""liked it"" and I did not like it so...)"
290,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16074924-dan-smith,3,"This book missells itself, and has its flaws, but it's worth reading if only to encourage the reader to turn a critical eye on Dennett's own arguments.Let's get one thing out of the way, an Intuition Pump is a thought experiment as far as I can see, and giving it another label (something Dennett's denigrates in other thought experiments - see his relabelling of Mr Puppet as Captain Autonomy) changes nothing other than the rhetoric. It's all a case of My Pump Pumps Harder Than Yours, and it's a bit cheap.And another thing: this in no way contains ""70 ways to make you think better"". A few generic philosophical tools at the start are fine, but the rest are specific thought experiments to prove or disprove a point, or deconstructions of another philosopher's argument. It's a quality set of disparate points, coalescing around meaning, evolution, free will and consciousness.There's a lot of begging the question going on here - the Puppet / Autonomy label a case in point: Dennett correctly identifies the unsubtle characterisation of a person in a free-will thought experiment, but then seeks to prove his case by doing just the same. His central thesis is also curiously void at heart: I get his analysis of ever more complex ""thinking"" machines and how they could be equated to our own brains, with comparable levels of thought. But all it does is set up a comparison: why make the jump and say they must be the same? Why does this tell us anything about what consciousness is? It might do, but it can't get further than saying ""I've shown you a similar system, a computer, which has the same theoretical structure as your brain. We can't see the consciousness in my example, so... you see...? *pump pump* There! I have explained consciousness!""The thing is, I get everything he says and I sorta (to borrow his convenient fuzzy phrase) agree. But I end up not thinking he's really solved anything.He also has a frustrating habit of falling into the same rhetorical tricks as ones he painstakingly and smugly criticises others for using. For example, he spends a while constructing and example of humans constructing robots to house their cryogenic bodies, giving those robots instructions and degrees of autonomy. Fun. He then declares ""but what I have shown you is no different to genes using our bodies to replicate!"" Really? I see some parallels, and they're sorta similar, but so?It's like trying to nail down jelly. Yes, I see what you've shown me, but every time you get close to a key issue, you sorta wobble, sorta allow the nail in, and then sorta ignore it.This may be the key problem with all this sorta comparisons and thought experiments. If you're minded to agree, you see the example and agree with it. If you disagree, you'll either pick it apart (if you can) or say that it's all. All well as far as it goes but it doesn't *prove* the point.I did like his ""anything you can do, I can do meta. I can do many thing meta than you"" line. Alas, this only inspired me to think of e whole thing as this: A Metaphor? Yes, fine, but what's a meta *for*?"
291,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30039874-ap,3,"I did not finish this book (read about 2/3).Interesting, but I could do with a condensed version. I don't feel like I missed the main gist, but the details were not absorbed. It is well written, and if I had followed it and finished it, I probably would rate it higher.The book is about thinking about how we think, and tools that we can use to help (or also boomcrutches, which hinder) those processes.I got lost at the end of Part I, when it got super computery. The evolution discussions of Part II were interesting, but I got lost in that, too, before it finished. In the final part, I was lost from the get-go. The main points I have so far- Break assumptions and logics down to their most basic components, to find flaws or inconsistencies.- Making mistakes is the best way to learn. Embrace it.- Everything is dependent on context. There is no hidden or deeper meanings to things.- The original intention of nearly everything is survival.- Be aware of your emotional attachments to ideas.Some useful tools: - be fair, point out pros and cons of others work, demonstrate what you learned from it before you criticize it. - don't waste time critiquing mediocrity. - simple is best. - know the system so you can step outside of it to subvert it. - remember that brains can have little in common, but still have similar intentions. Even similar intentions will use data very differently. - There is no common structure in the huamn brain that funnels in ""meaning."" Good points in the book: - Meaning is not inherent or tangible. It is stored in the brain, but not like data.  - Folk psychology - the most important patterns in our images -- gives us a foundation to interpret the word around us. It is culturally dependent, not genetic. It is the way we tend to pattern and interpret, based on how others around us do it. - There is no wonder tissue in our brains -- stop looking for top-down approaches to explain humans, consciousness, etc. We are not magical miracles. We are bottom-up, mechanical processes that internetwork in growing webs of complexity to create the people and cultures around us. - Evolution challenges the top-down approach, with unintelligent, aimless design (bent only on survival).Some boomcrutches: - inconvenient facts are conveniently swept away/ignored. - using false dichotomies to make it seem like there are only two alternatives. - set up exagerated strawman of someone's argument, then refute that as if it was their real argument. - subtle inclusion of irrelevent things to weaken their argument. - using words or phrases that sound deep but are vague or trivial. - be wary when someone uses the word ""surely"" or asks a rhetorical question in their argument."
292,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11254454-arensb,4,"An intuition pump, in Dennett's sense, is an analogy or metaphor that helps us to think about a harder problem.For instance imagine a whimsical jailer who goes around while the prisoners are asleep, and unlocks all the doors and leaves them that way for a few hours. Are the prisoners free to escape? The idea is not so much to answer this particular question, but to play with it and use it to help us analyze a more complex problem.In Intuition Pumps, Dennett introduces several dozen such intuition pumps and other mental tools, as well as some pitfalls (e.g., the seductive analogy that misleads us into accepting the wrong conclusion), forming a good introduction to philosophy for the interested amateur.He does concentrate on three areas: evolution, consciousness, and free will. Make of this what you will: he might be flogging his personal interests, or he might just be trying to avoid mistakes by presenting students with examples from the areas he knows best. I tend to lean toward the latter, but if you're bored silly by the very idea of discussions on free will, you may want to just skip Chapter VIII.All in all, this book is a good and lucid introduction to philosophy, including why it matters, and why even lay people can and should engage in it: when done correctly, and not just as an exercise in navel-gazing with five-dollar words, it's basically a way of thinking straight, and avoid reasoning errors.ETA: The section on computing and Turing machines is at best inaccurate and at worst misleading. The central message, that modern computers don't do anything that a Turing machine couldn't do, is correct. Yes, virtual machines are a real, and even useful, thing. And yes, a Turing machine can run a virtual version of your desktop PC and do everything it does, albeit at a ridiculously low speed.I think Dennett confuses virtualization with abstraction. Virtualization is the process of making one computer behave like another one. For instance, if you wanted to play your old Apple II games, you could set up a virtual Apple II on your desktop PC. That is, a program on your PC would pretend to be an Apple II, so that that virtual Apple II could run your old games.Abstraction, on the other hand, is, roughly, the process of hiding the low-level details from the programmer, who can ignore the small stuff and get on with making the program do what she really wants. As time goes on, more and more things are considered low-level.To hear Dennett explain it, though, you might think that programmers pile virtual machine upon virtual machine, rather than abstraction upon abstraction."
293,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10974082-christine,2,"Finished! Let me show you what I learned from this book. Take the sentence, ""I finished it."" In this sentence, finished is defined as ""I visually examined each page, including preface, introduction, and appendix but excluding sources, bibliography, and the majority of the index."" Note that there is nothing in this definition about comprehension, or understanding. That is because for one definition of ""finished"" (the definition I have chosen to use in this book review), the focus is on completion without concerns about understanding, knowledge, or the ability to disseminate the information received to others of similar (or any) level of knowledge. With me so far? Yes? I'm impressed. No? That's about how I felt for this entire book. Originally I purchased this book on a whim because I loved the phrase ""intuition pumps"" and thought it would have helpful tools for more articulate discussions in debates. And it does, but only if you're a philosopher. Dennett writes about philosophical debates on the nature of consciousness, free will, and meaning but with examples so abstract and metaphysical they'd be almost impossible to use in a conversation with laymen. That's not a bad thing, but judging from this book there's a huge gap between an interested layman and the entry level philosophy student this book is aimed at. I thought I was a reasonably well educated layman. I thought I would be able to make the stretch to entry level student. I could not. There were still a great many things I enjoyed. The concept of intuition pumps (61), the discussion of Occam's Razor(38) and Occam's Broom(40), Boom Crutches(48), learning about register machines(109). Although I still don't understand how a register machine could be useful as a thinking tool, unless maybe it's to internalize the process of reducing a particular activity down to its most basic operations to see if you could get a simple machine (or a cascade of simple machines) to perform the same job, without understanding it or even knowing what they are doing? Dennet holds that often what we assume is irreducible complexity could actually be performed (albeit more slowly) by sufficient layers of the most basic computers (loosely paraphrased from p 139). That's an interesting, terrifying idea. Terrifying because now I can't argue that we aren't all zombies, or robots. This book left me with more questions than answers, and more confusion than when I started reading it. I guess that's a good thing? I don't regret reading it, but only now that it's over. "
294,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,3,"Dennett enumerates some ``tools for thinking'', elaborates on some intuition pumps (a term he coined in 1980 which I guess is legitimate), explains why some apparent intuition pumps are counterproductive (and are instead what he calls ``boom crutches''), and applies the whole thing, inevitably, to philosophy of the mind.If Dennett's book broadly fall into two categories—moderately compelling pop sci that's basically solid but just wrong enough to annoy every reader in at least one way (Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Breaking the Spell), and intensely boring philosophy wank (Consciousness Explained, most of the rest)—Intuition Pumps &c. straddles the boundary. Parts of it are fair enough, but a lot of it is given over to tedious bullshit, a lot of which exemplifies why I feel philosophers are a waste of space: almost all of the thought experiments he finds so daunting turn out to be meaningless or trivial, and though career philosophers can arguably be forgiven for failing to recognise a thought experiment as meaningless (philosophy departments wouldn't exist if they couldn't), failing to recognise trivial ones is prety damned embarrassing for someone who's made this sort of thing his career for literally almost twice as long as I've existed.†Also, his position on free will is still basically wrong-headed, though it isn't more so than most things that have been written on the subject. He's clearly approaching a more sensible position, but at the pace he's going he'll be dead before he gets there.That said, the bits that are fair enough are, indeed, fair enough, and he manages to pull off aspects on which I expected a much worse performance (there's an entire set of chapters on computers and AI (proper CS AI, not philosophy AI), for example) surprisingly well. If every philosopher were only as bad as Dan Dennett, I wouldn't be nearly as bitter about their existence.(I also really appreciate that Gould is brought up as three instances of doing it wrong. Too many people Americans hold him in high regard, and it needs to stop.)---† I don't intend to stoop to their level and get into particulars here; most people who read my reviews know me well enough that I hope they'll give me some credit and accept that I'm not likely to be full of shit.

295,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11446002-dan,4,"Daniel Dennett is so committed to approachable philosophy one of his primary pillars is the use of interested laypeople as ""decoys"" in philisophical debate, so that philosophers are forced to explain their assumptions and the parameters of their ideas more rigorously. Consequently, his book is quite approachable to interested folks outside of philosophy.Dennett is also among the ""Four Horsemen of New Atheism"" so if that's going to irritate the hell out of you, definitely give this book a pass.I'll see if any of the thinking tools Dennett prescribes prove useful to me, and adjust to a 3 star or 5 star accordingly, if warranted. Initially, I think they will be useful. Taken together, the tools tend to emphasize the practical application over theoretical purity. Dennett very quickly gives up on/dismisses some of the big questions that excite people, such as ""Why is there something rather than nothing?"" (which he calls a pseudo-problem unworthy of inquiry). Philosophical ""qualia"" and ""zombies"" also get heaps of scorn from him. For him, the notion of ""free will"" that is used in courts should be enough for us: people never act independently from their context, but usually act with enough autonomy to be held accountable for those actions.Emblematic of his reliance on working-definitions and practical application is his repeated (sometimes tiresomely) use of the adjective ""sorta"". To him, getting into definitional arguments about the absolute limits of self, freedom, word definitions almost instantly become trivial as they search for fine distinctions that simply don't exist. Instead, just say someone is ""sorta"" thinking or ""sorta"" independent and move on.Finally, Dennett overflows with enthusiasm for both the evolutionary model and for computing. The evolutionary section of the book seemed useful and central to his main points but the extensive chapters on computing, including workbook-style programming problems to solve in a simple, theoretical model of a computer perplexed me. They seemed long and indulgent and I kept waiting for them to become relevant to the rest of the book. I never felt like they did.Overall, a worthwhile read, so long as I can remember some of his pumps and the ideas I had in response to them."

If you have some patience, you'll finish with clearer ways to examine and express your own thoughts -- or, at least, that's how I felt.There are some admittedly shocking jumps in difficulty. More than once I found myself, after twenty pages of lucid explanations, coming across a paragraph I had to read five times just to make certain I had understood it... and even then I wouldn't have bet money on it. This is the kind of book that will make you feel confident one moment and absurdly out of your depth the next. When you're jumping from physics, biology, computer science and cognitive psychology, that may just be the nature of the beast, but it fortunately never feels as though Dennett is being an obscurantist. He values lucidity, and by the end of this thing I was grateful.Dennett manages to glide from one mind-bending mystery to another and address each with wit, clarity, and frightening intelligence. It's impressive that a man so fiercely bright can keep his work from being too intimidating: his tone is that of a kindly uncle, guiding you with patience through some of the most difficult conundrums your brain can handle.While this was sometimes dense to the point that it hurt my head, if you find any of the topics interesting you'll be missing out on a feast for your brain if you don't give Intuition Pumps a shot."
297,0393348784,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,3,"On the back of a very uninspiring month, following two really inspired months, I wanted a book that might reliably be jumper cables for my brain. A collection of thought experiments and ways of thinking to think about thinking, seemed beyond perfect. It wasn’t. It did get me thinking about why it wasn’t though. What are the qualities of something that is thought-provoking? At one extreme, I might argue everything and nothing is thought provoking, and all provocation is in the thought of the thinker. I’m uninspired in general, this didn’t inspire me. I was inspired in general, everything inspired me, especially the James Gleick books. At the other extreme, I have no role, and the content has objective thought-provoking qualities. If this is even partially true, where do those qualities lie? I was provoked by very few of these intuition pumps, some were novel thought experiments that I haven’t come across before. Some were literal about the knobs available to be turned one by one to reveal the underlying dependence of the pump. Some revealed that I might just have a bias against the phrasing, intuition pump, exemplified by the use in this unfortunate sentence ‘engage in mutual intuition pumping’. Mostly I was underwhelmed by my experience. It didn’t get me ‘thinking elegantly about hard questions’, as much as it told me how Daniel Dennett thinks elegantly about hard questions, with most chapters seeming to me how Frank Johnson’s colorblind Mary thought experiment seemed to DD, an answer writ large on the front of the envelope, having nothing to open up and discover, because it’s anyway just an empty envelope. It’s interesting to consider the strong possibility that, having pointed this out in Frank Johnson’s experiment, DD took immense pains not to fall into the same trap of experiment construction, placing most of the resultant emptiness squarely on the shoulders of dumb readers like myself. I’ll have more evidence once I go back to another James Gleick book immediately and compare my mental processes. NotesWhat separates ignorance from willful subterfuge? Take the chapter on Gould, and his use of ‘rathering’ to create false dichotomies. I find myself doing that all the time, not because I’m trying to fabricate polarization, but because I haven’t realized that the apparent dichotomy collapses under many subtle conditions. Rapaport Laws: How to criticize an idea. First rephrase it in a way that the other person appreciates as complete and accurate yet new. Then point out agreements. Then point out things you can borrow to make your own idea stronger. Only then criticize. Occam’s Broom: Only experts can figure out what evidence has been left out, as opposed to what’s been presented. That’s why conspiracy theories are so compelling, sweeping all inconvenient data under the carpet, where normal people won’t spot the omissions. Sturgeon’s Law: 90% of everything is garbage. Criticizing something for being bad is a terrible idea, because 90% of everything is bad. Focus on what’s good. Rathering: Create false dichotomies saying evolution does not proceed by X, rather by Y, when in case these 2 are not mutually exclusive, while you make it sound that wayPeople use ‘surely’ at the edge of their knowledge, or things they take for granted and are hoping you do too.Is understanding your psychology like the comments that coders put on source code, meant to understand the code but not at all affecting how the computer reads and executes it.‘Slippery Slope’ is often just a moat disguised as slippery slope. The line between two opposites is often thin, that makes us uncomfortable, so we create a buffer zone around it, razor wire, moat, and say the first foot into that buffer zone leads to a slippery slope. ‘Spontaneous intrusion’ the effect that we have, smells, shadows, weights etc that a virtual rendition has to meticulously add after creating our basic shapes. Nonfunctional noise, shed dust, leave wake, causes vibrations etc. Why do we need this when creating AI? Collisions induce creativityMemes needn’t increase fitness of host.

B: select winner, sell tickets. Have I sold losing tickets purposely? Ultimately they are the same thing, as long as I don’t know which is winner, every person has an equal chance of winning? True statements from history that cannot be proved, like Caesar thought of salad on June 1st. Godel? Similarly, must be true that Sherlock has or has not a mole on shoulder, but can’t be proved. Faustian bargains: 1) Solve problem once and for all laying it to rest, or complex work that will be debated for long time? Scientists pick A, Philosophers picked B. 2) Uncontroversial right thing, like Calculus/DNA Helix (Crick, but Linus P would’ve got there too), or very controversial hotly-discussed mostly wrong thing like Lamarck, Cartesian duality etc. Chomsky’s syntactical structures, while mostly wrong, birthed many descendent correct theories that have nothing to do with it, like hummingbird having nothing to do with dinosaurs.

One of the most-enduring essays in that volume was Dennett's ""Where am I?"", a tour-de-force of a thought experiment that became a cultural referent, the ""brain in a vat"" controlling a body containing a substitute brain via radio waves. Dennett would refer to such a construction as an ""intuition pump,"" a contrived situation created to test the reader's thoughts and assumptions about an idea. Each of his ""intuition pumps"" has ""knobs,"" or circumstances and details, that can be adjusted and changed so that the reader can explore the idea as much (or, as little) as desired. This volume collects many of Dennett's best intuition pumps from across his long and fruitful career as a philosopher. Often Dennett's exposition is new, and his writing is remarkably free from undue resorts to the sophisticated/abstruse language of academic philosophy. However, the simplicity and clarity of his writing to the lay person does not detract from the deep exploration of ideas on what it means to know something, can a computer be intelligent and think like us, the difficulties people have conceiving of evolution, and why evolution makes sense, what it means to be conscious, and do we ultimately have free will (and does it matter?). He also concludes with a few brief notes about the practice of philosophy, and encouragement (and cautionary tales) for those who might consider a career in the field.The intuition pumps presented are brief; many can be easily read in under 30 minutes time. However, each one of them can be re-read and explored in considerable detail, and many academic careers have been fruitfully spent working through the implications of these topics, attempting to find challenges and refutations to and support for these arguments. Highly recommended for all who have an interest in thinking about thinking and have at least a casual curiosity about philosophy."

It falls short, though, in two major ways, which really affected my enjoyment of the book overall compared to other books that in effect do the same thing. The first is that a lot of the chapters don't mix or follow one another particularly well, and at times this just comes off like a series of blog posts. As a result the whole thing feels pretty disjointed and without any kind of central, unifying theme. The sections break down roughly to logical philosophy, evolutionary biology, consciousness, etc. but the subject categories feel mostly artificial. Which brings me to the second, more important point...These are all fairly standard tools in any advanced thinker's tool kit, and invaluable tools to a noob like myself just beginning to dive into these topics. However, the tools seem so abstracted and disjointed that it becomes hard to understand how to apply them in real situations. Let's say you know very little about automobiles, carpentry and plumbing. If you entered a garage where all the tools required for these three professions were available to you, wall to wall, floor to ceiling, you'd have everything you needed to build some stuff. However, you wouldn't have the raw materials needed to actually build anything, nor would you have the knowledge of how to use the tools or apply them properly even if you did. That's how this book felt to me. It's too basic for advanced thinkers and too abstracted and removed from practical application to be useful to an amateur. Dennett throws you a bunch of nuts and bolts and wrenches and belt sanders and crimpers and clamps without giving you the instruction manual with the image of the final product and the exploded view. All that said, I think this would be a perfect read as a companion to more concrete reading material on any of these subjects, or as a massive textbook where each tool could be applied more extensively."
