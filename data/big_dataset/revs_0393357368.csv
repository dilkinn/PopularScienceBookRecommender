1,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4410234-riegs,3,"Thoroughly researched and more balanced that expected, but still problematic. As a librarian/Information Science professional, I have serious qualms with the argument that we should learn to ""live"" with algorithms/machines controlling functions of society. Yes, I see the benefits and potential. Yes, I agree that better developed algorithms can improve quality of life. But, I think the folks who develop tech often forget that an algorithm (a machine) should never be depended upon to make humane decisions - nor is it a reliable agent of Effective Altruism. Let me put it this way: An algorithm does not breathe or think. It cannot express democratic values, no matter how sophisticated it is. It does not know how to critically think; its only goal is to complete a program and meet a target. It does not value privacy. Algorithms will never give a shit about us. I cannot live with the idea that I should be coerced to surrender my free will or private information in order to improve someone else's algorithm. Some things are too unpredictable to be entrusted to a machine. That is what we should really learn to live with. "

As the digital world permeates our life further computers are being used as part of, or in some cases the entire part of the decision process. For all those of you who laughed at the 'Computer Says No' sketch in Little Britain, life might not always be so funny now. The question that Fry poses in her book is: Who would you rather decide your future – an algorithm or a human?In answering this simple question Fry takes us on a tour of the history of the algorithm, where and how they are being used and the possible implications of our dependency on them. We learn of the first algorithms that reached the point where they could beat a grandmaster at chess and how leaving human-like pauses disconcerted him. How sat nav can be a blessing and a curse, how facial recognition can spot the suspect in a crowd and how human error can ensure a decade of misery for an individual passing through passport control.Every click you make online is saved an analysed by the government and private corporations. The authorities are seeking the ghosts in the machine and to a company, you're just a product that someone can make money out of. Your future might be decided by a pigeon too as Fry explains in the chapter on health and how pattern recognition is being used to evaluate biopsy's for cancers and if you have been really bad, you may not stand in front of a judge, but be sentenced by a computer that would not care one bit about extenuating circumstances; frightening stuff. Algorithms have been used successfully to narrow down the search parameters for those who have committed the most serious crimes and are being used to predict where crimes might take place, the first steps towards Minority Report… Even a subject like art is succumbing to the computer code, what you watch or listen to, prompts suggestions of what else to watch or hear.To say this book was eye-opening would be an understatement. Fry does not go too heavy on the computer and technology in here, rather she relies on the stories that show how we are all affected by algorithms and the way that they are shaping our lives. This thought-provoking writing has a clarity about it that will make this accessible to almost anyone who picks it up. We do need to use algorithms to our advantage; I worry that we're not at the moment and that we may reach a point where we won’t be able to control them."

Among all of the staggeringly impressive, mindboggling things that data and statistics can tell me, how it feels to be human isn't one of them.
This is the book I've been searching for, the book I had been hoping for when I read Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy a couple of months ago. Both books cover similar concepts and even examples, but while I found Weapons overly negative and pessimistic, Fry wonderfully covers both the problems and the huge, huge benefits of using algorithms and statistics. Because, really, if algorithms were only negative, we wouldn't be using them, would we? Fry's arguments and conclusions (that we should be using the strengths of algorithms to supplement human decision making and get round human weaknesses, and vice versa) are balanced and well-evidenced. On top of being highly informative, reading this book was just so much fun! Fry has a fantastic sense of humour and writes in a way that I believe makes the book accessible for anyone. Don't worry if you're not mathematically inclined, Fry makes sure to explain the concepts well and it's very easy to follow.I can't fault this book. I loved every second of it and feel much more informed on this area now. I apologise in advance to all my friends, because I predict I am not going to shut up about this book and will be raving about it any chance I can get."

Some of it is really scary, some of it holds a glimpse of a better future--especially when Fry explains the ways machine intelligence *plus* human insight give the best results--and all of it make it extremely clear that we need massive legal regulation stat to prevent every aspect of our lives being sold for profit by a handful of rich American tech bastards.

6,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5008298-charlotte-dann,2,"Too shallow for anyone who already knows a fair bit about algorithms. I felt (strongly in the Art section) that she wasn't advocating for the programmers and had the perspective of someone who hasn't thought very holistically about human computer interaction. 'Computers can't make art' is a sentiment that really bugs me, it shrouds technology in this cold deific cloak when THE COMPUTER IS THE ART. I so strongly believe that making a computer make art is an extremely artistic endeavour. Go read some McLuhan.It was a good book, and an interesting grounding on the ways in which algorithms already govern much of our lives and will do even more of our future. For me though, it felt like it had too much fear of the machine, too much alienation, it should have been written by a computer scientist who understands the nuances of HCI, rather than a (admittedly well-researched) mathematician."

9,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,5,"An excellent overview of the past, present and future of how computational algorithms shape our world, from the estimable Dr Hannah Fry.In seven sections - Power, Data, Justice, Medicine, Cars, Crime & Art - Fry give examples, background, threats and potentials of this incredibly powerful IT tool. The examples are well chosen - some I knew, some were new to me - and she uses each as a jumping-off point to discuss the effect not only of the technology itself, but of the cultural, societal and intellectual ways we interact with it. Is what we expect from it realistic or, indeed, desirable?She uses the well-known example of Idaho Medicaid recipients being stripped of essential benefits by an 'algorithm' that eventually was revealed to be nothing more than a badly constructed Excel spreadsheet to discuss how much we should (or shouldn't) trust the Black Box, of how facial recognition and crime-prediction software is so often racially biased and skewed toward false-positives (it constantly amazes me how little the general populace are aware of the effect of false positives vs false negatives, and how little the media does to educate them), but balanced with positives examples of the effectiveness of algorithms.This, as a popular science book, does an superb job of covering the main issues and philosophical and social questions of our increasing reliance on algorithms - from everything from shopping preferences to medicine, from security to self-driving cars an autopilot - leaving the reader with a solid base of knowledge and many questions about how we, as a society, use this powerful tool. I could easily have had the book be twice as long and deep (especially in the area of social media and news preferences, although perhaps that is too big a topic for a single chapter) but, for the general popular science audience, this is a brilliant overview with some very thoughtful insights.One point which is an observation rather than a criticism is that, for the most part, I didn't 'hear' Dr Fry's voice in the writing. This isn't to say there was any problem with the writing or the pacing but, knowing her voice from her radio work - especially the marvellous Curios Cases of Rutherford and Fry that she presents with Adam Rutherford (which, for those not blessed with access to the BBC is available as a podcast and I HIGHLY recommend you seek it out) - the only place I heard Dr Fry was in the short conclusion. I understand she reads the audiobook, so I am intrigued how different it would be to listen to it.Highly recommended."
10,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24679550-ashley-c,4,"Hannah Fry introduces us to algorithms and to thinking about algorithms in her crisp, lighthearted, accessible book. This is definitely something for the uninitiated and may benefit you the most if this is one of your first books about data science. There are no in-depth arguments of any sort, she didn't zero in on any sub-topic; it's a light skim off the frothing issue condensed into something you can read on your commute or before bed. 
""It's about asking if an algorithm is having a net benefit on society."" 
This was the premise of her novel. Fry explored seven key areas of society - Power, Data, Justice, Medicine, Cars, Crime, and Art. Her stance is that algorithms, like any tool, should be viewed and treated as such. We must not forget that we hold control and agency over algorithms, and we can and should continue to be critical of an algorithm's origin, influence, and power. At the same time, we have to be mindful that inevitably, an algorithm can have far reaching and god-like influence over the way we think, the information we receive, and the decisions that we make as a society.
""Perhaps more ominous, given how much of our information we now get from algorithms like search engines, is how much agency people believed they had in their own opinions: 'When people are unaware how are being manipulated, they tend to believe hey have adopted their new thinking voluntarily,' Epstein wrote in the original paper."" 
As always, I read with a social perspective, and I find it worth noting that, like everything else - our social norms, structures, our states and its policies, our private lives - algorithms reflect our ideologies. Fry detailed how ironically in our attempt to make our judicial system fair through consistency and objectivity, it still reflected (actually, through reflection, consistently and objectively, I'd say) institutional racism and classism. The algorithm merely picks up our pattern of decisions and automates that. In other cases, it could be that the creater of the algorithm used incorrect base data, or didn't think through the real-world consequences of their algorithm before rolling it out.
 ""For the time being, worrying about evil AI is a bit like worrying about overcrowding on Mars.""
And she's right. Worry about what's here now. Encourage discussions and create dialogue. And this is a good book to start with."
11,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18940910-james-miller,5,"Thought provoking and interesting read delving into our evolving use of algorithms to make decisions in place of and in addition to those we make ourselves. Balanced arguments explore the positives and negatives of this increasing dependence across the topics of power, data, justice, medicine, cars, crime and art. The author takes us on a journey from the beginnings of our capabilities to program machines, through to the emergence of self-driving cars and the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal before finally leading us to varying hypotheses as to the use of algorithms in the future. The text is easy to understand for anyone without a background in this field and also assists the reader in understanding how everyday tools including social networking apps and supermarket loyalty cards aim to collect and use our data to their advantage in an increasingly competitive and complex marketplace.This book takes on a very different angle to Hannah Fry’s earlier book The Indisputable Existence of Santa Claus in that it does not focus on specific mathematical proofs for individual scenarios and more our interaction with the output of the algorithms that are already in use across many aspects of our daily activities. To that effect in my opinion it is more accessible to those who have little or no interest in mathematics and will undoubtedly serve as a focal point for further conversations. The topics explored are applicable to all of us, and anything that helps us to understand how our lives are being shaped by technology is surely a good thing.The interest of passages is shown most by the fact that some paragraphs have been photographed and Whatsapped with recommendations to buy!As an avid listener to her podcast with Adam Rutherford (search for the Mysterious Cases of Rutherford and Fry), I was wholly unsurprised by how good it is: Fry is naturally excellent at communicating."
12,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51524202-clelixedda,5,"In this book, Hannah Fry gives an introduction and overview on algorithms and algorithmic techniques used (or set out for future use) in our modern societies. It starts by explaining basic concepts of machine learning, AI and data-driven algorithms. She then explores different areas of society and life to show that similar techniques can be used in very different contexts, like medicine, cars, the justice system or art. In all of these contexts, she manages to highlight the good, the bad and the problematic and guides the reader through the questions that the use of these algorithms raises. I loved this book. It’s a little gem of scientific writing with focus on mathematics, because it’s well written, very understandable, interesting, thought-provoking and entertaining. The author has a very charming style and it makes me especially happy that she is using her talents to educate people on my favourite STEM subject :). I also really loved her optimistic outlook on future uses of data-driven algorithms and the quite global perspective she had. Also, love the title :DUPDATE: I liked this book so much, I bought a second copy of this book, because Waterstones had a signed edition. "

But doesn't cast a future of doom, sounding like a luddite. The book is a refreshing take on how we could have a framework where we understand and accept AI for its flaws, and make decisions aided by it while questioning its power at each stage."

Reminded me of reading Atul Gawande or Jon Ronson, such a brilliant blend of passionate narrator, demonstrable excellence and understanding in their field and page turning enthusiasm."
15,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,4,"Algorithms are increasingly an important part of our lives, yet even as more of us become aware of this, how much do we actually stop to consider what that means? How much do we stop to consider who is designing these algorithms and how they actually work? And why are we willing to give up so much control to them in the first place? Hello World is a short tour through the various ways in which algorithms intersect with human decision-making. It is neither comprehensive nor particularly in-depth. Nevertheless, through a few choice examples, Hannah Fry illustrates why this is an important topic and an issue we should think about more often and more deeply.Fry has organized the book into 7 discrete chapters: Power, Data, Justice, Medicine, Cars, Crime, and Art. Each chapter explores the role of algorithms in these parts of our society. Fry intersperses explanations of various algorithms with anecdotes, many of which, as she notes about the now-infamous story of Target outing a teenager’s pregnancy, the reader might already have heard. I believe that one of Fry’s goals is to demonstrate for the reader how algorithms aren’t exotic animals confined to the zoo of a computer science lab. They have real-world applications and real-world effects.It’s probably inevitable that I compare this to 
Weapons of Math Destruction
, given the similarity of these two books. (Cathy O’Neil blurbed Hello World as well—very good job, marketing team!) Honestly, the subject matter of these two books is very similar, yet I’m not willing to say that one is better than the other. O’Neil writes from the perspective of a mathematician who spent a significant part of her career embedded in the financial sector; Fry is a mathematician who studies Big Data from as an academic career. Many of the concepts elucidated in Weapons of Math Destruction make an appearance here, and Fry often draws similar conclusions as O’Neil. Whereas O’Neil is mostly concerned with the negative effects of algorithms, however, I’d argue that Fry is more interested in raising our awareness about the complexity of these algorithms.This is a math book at its finest—by which I mean it’s a math book with very few equations in it. Lay people often assume a good mathematics book needs a lot of formulas and numbers, and that’s not true. Math isn’t formulas (that’s engineering—sorry not sorry). Math is about developing a system for solving problems creatively. Fry breaks down what an algorithm is in simple terms, and I loved the chapters on Medicine and Cars, because Fry uses these to explain some great statistical concepts: false positives and negatives, in the former; and Bayesian inference, in the latter. So even though a lot of the anecdotes, specific algorithm examples, etc., were already familiar to me, I still enjoyed how Fry tackles these fundamental but often overlooked mathematical ideas. (As a fan of graph theory and decision math, I also liked the discussion of random forests.)Fry spends a lot of time discussing how algorithms can get thing wrong. She points out (perhaps obviously) that algorithms will never have “human” judgment—algorithms can’t be empathetic or sympathetic. She illustrates how an algorithm is always going to be biased, so we should be less concerned with chasing after “objective” algorithms but instead focus on building algorithms that are more honest about their biases. The problem with machine learning is two-fold: it’s the data sets we feed in, but it’s also the fact that the decision-making that leads to the output is often opaque.For all that Fry paints a dire picture, though, she presents a balanced viewpoint that also endorses algorithms as potentially beneficial and necessary. In the Medicine chapter, she points out that algorithmic recognition of diseases like breast cancer is going to make the healthcare system more efficient—as long as these tools are used in conjunction with human judgment, not as a replacement for it. These sentiments are echoed in every chapter, from her exploration of the justice system to her explication of driverless cars, repeated once more at the end of the book where she mentions Kasparov’s centaur chess. If Fry is correct, then perhaps our optimal future is a cyborg future: one in which algorithms enhance our decision-making and help defuse the fallibility of our human judgment, but where humans remain in control of the ultimate decision process and can audit the algorithm.Hello World is a clear, easy to follow discussion of an extremely relevant topic in today’s society. If, like me, you’re well-read on this subject already, there isn’t a lot of new stuff in here—but I suspect you’ll probably find something. Even so, you’ll hopefully appreciate Fry’s talent for writing and explaining these ideas. As for anyone who has only recently become interested in this subject, you’ll not find many books that explain these ideas so well. Like I said above, this pairs nicely with Weapons of Math Destruction—read both!

16,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79575646-inkspill,3,"more 3.5 starsA short book written for a non-techie like me, the anecdotes made this a leisurely read – some were very funny – which helped to illustrate the point better. Hannah Fry’s enthusiasm for tech and maths really comes through. I also liked how the book chapters were divided into broad topics, my least favourite was art, I found it to be less comprehensive than the others. The most surprising was how algorithm is used in justice and medicine; I had no idea how they it’s used by judges or developed to improve accuracy in diagnosing medical conditions. My favourite chapter was on cars, from the info here, I’d say self-driving, fully automated, cars are still some way off.I also didn’t have a full grasp of how cookies work and how information is not private, so overall reading this has been an eye-opener. And though it was a fun read, my only quibble is the style of the book. On the surface it’s expressing a balance view, but looking at the language closer it’s clearly advocating the advantages of AI and machine learning. I wish this was clearer, in the way it’s done to me it feels a touch contradictory and insensitive. In the book Hannah Fry gives many examples of people who have fallen victims of human or machine error, I appreciate whatever system is applied it will never be perfect but this book in places left me with the sense that it’s okay for there to be these victims using algorithms as they will be fewer. So, it left me feeling a little concerned but reading this also sparked my interest to know more about algorithms, AI and machine learning. "
17,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44562174-myles-cowper-coles,5,"Hannah Fry writes in a very human and relatable way about how algorithms have come to play a role into our lives in a variety of different ways.

It's a quick read and definitely one worth picking up even if you have a passing interest in technology and computer science."

It just examines their place in our daily life and considers how much we should be using/trusting them, weighing the pros and cons and their level of ""perfection""."
22,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6007859-pete-wung,5,"The idea of artificial intelligence, particularly the application of artificial intelligence algorithms in the service of human activities that have always been human based both scare and fascinates us, that idea being a fecund field to harvest for popular literature and films. We humans, with some of us relying on overdeveloped imaginations, dreams of AI as the solution for everything that ails us. While for other humans, those with an overdramatic sense of pessimism, have nightmares about how human society will be conquered by droids who will eventually destroy us.The truth I believe, is somewhere in between. One of the problems is that the general layperson has no idea what AI entails and how it works, not how well or how badly it works in real life. The popular media is of no help as they are wont to lean towards the sensational, in both the optimistic and pessimistic directions to enable the selling of papers or website subscriptions.Fortunately for us, there are people like Hannah Fry, a mathematician, and a hell of a good writer to explain it to us, if not the nuts and bolts of AI, then the results of existing experimental results and how the algorithms are applied to real world problems. To get Prof. Fry’s credentials out of the way, she is an associate professor in mathematics at the University College of London. I am a fan of her writing in the New Yorker, as she has a way of explaining the details and nuances of mathematical topics with great clarity and ease.The subtitle of the book is: Being Human in the Age of Algorithms. It is both somewhat comforting and a touch menacing at the same time. I took it to be comforting. The title Hello World comes from an example in rudimentary programming classes, the very first program any neophyte programmer writes are programs that outputs: ‘Hello World’ onto the screen. I too, have had the excitement of having those two words present themselves in my computers. So, it is a welcoming sign, it is also a foreshadowing of what is in store for the reader in the succeeding pages. The book is divided simply into nine total chapters; an Introduction and Conclusion bookends the middle chapters named after seven distinct parts of the human existence as we know it in the 21st century. They are: Power, Data, Justice, Medicine, Cars, Crime, and Art. While the structure of the book is simple enough, the intent of the book is quite ambitious. Prof. Fry lays out the present and past excursions we humans have made into the realm of using artificial intelligence to alleviate human based computational efforts. Some reasoning which drove us to evolving our decision-making advances along this route involves the perceived and many times a real need for faster and more accurate computations. The faster part is won handily by computers, and most of the time the accuracy part is also won by the computers. What people forget is that first, the computer’s cogitations is only as good as the data and to a much larger degree, the algorithm that it is given. It is garbage in, and you get garbage out. The parallel effect is that if you have garbage logic cooked into the algorithm, then garbage out as well. The more egregious result then is that garbage analysis and interpretation of the results mean even worse garbage out.Prof. Fry goes through each of the seven topics and demonstrates where the human propensity for bias creates disastrous errors in inference and in computing the wrong numbers or asking the wrong questions. On the other hand, she also takes great pains to explain why computers are much better suited to not just doing the computations quickly but to also make decisions quickly and at times more accurately. One would think that the main arguments in a book such as this are all along the lines of: it is game over, let the silicon-based lifeform govern our existence, but that is not the case. Prof. Fry explores and negotiates the complex and nonlinear landscape of what we humans have done in experimentation with designing and allowing algorithms to make decisions for us in order to get at the clearest picture yet of what AI can do for and against us. She tells us stories of how Gary Kasparov, chess master, the very epitome of human decision-making prowess, became seduced by the idea of the AI, after having been beaten by Big Blue. She tells us about how a self-driving car is supposed to navigate our highways and byways, but still can not do so safely. She, most disturbingly, tells us how our government, in their attempts to simplify and creating accurate decision-making processes had wreaked havoc in our society, thereby creating equality issues in how justice is dealt out to us. Indeed, I found the chapters on Data, Justice, Medicine, and Crime the scariest and the most fascinating because those chapters hit the closest to home. The idea that our faceless bureaucracy places their trust on unrealistic, biased, and logically error ridden algorithms to handle our privacy data, decide on long term guilt and innocence of our fellow humans, cure what ails us, and solve problems due to human proclivity to trespass on our fellow beings is decidedly unsettling to say the least. In every chapter, however, Prof. Fry collects and organizes the stories in easily digestible and logically intuitive chunks, giving us cogent arguments for her opinions. In the Conclusion, she lays out her case, buttressed by the facts and gave me quite a bit to think about, after of course, educating me on the nuances of the intricate and logically confounding sequence of action, reaction, and unintended consequences, which we are not very able to predict a priori. My belief is that this is a must read for all cogent human beings who live in todays’ world of technological abundance. We can not live without fully understanding how decisions are made by algorithms, most importantly, we need to understand how those decisions can be wrong. In addition, we must also learn how we can leverage the algorithms so that the computational tools can be used in conjunction with those areas of cogitation where we human have an advantage and succeed in creating a more perfect society."

This does not affect my rating or opinions of this book.Perhaps the greatest strength of this book is that it was understandable for the layperson with minimal technical experience, but not patronizing or reductive which would alienate a more knowledgeable reader. It's written conversationally, with an occasional witty aside/observation/pop culture reference, but always stays on topic: balancing thorough research with practical applications and analysis. The thematic organization (the use of algorithms vs. human judgment in ""Power,"" ""Data,"" ""Justice,"" ""Medicine,"" ""Cars,"" ""Crime,"" and ""Art"") makes good sense, introducing specific case studies, hypotheticals, and conclusions for comparison within and without each topic.

As she says in the introduction, this is primarily a book about humans - who we are, where we are going, and how that is changing through technology. Her most important point is that we shouldn't think of algorithms as an authority. The best world is one where humans work with transparent algorithms, assisted but not overruled, and very much held accountable."

It can be of major help to humans, it could judge poorly depending on its efficiency and the everlasting limitation to which extent we can improve such algorithm. But in the end, I agree with the author that the best way is to work along with the machine and to question its choices and aim to improve it as much as we can. Great book! very thorough research very enjoyable and engaging. And not at all boring!"

They help us find jobs, mates, cars, houses, and most everything else. More and more they are relied upon by doctors, educators employers, insurance companies and all of big business.This book tackles the important topic of algorithms and compares them to the fragile and imperfect abilities of the humans they are supposed to serve. ""Hello World"" is a basic command that's given to first time programmers, and Hannah Fry takes us behind the scenes to tackle what the programmers are seeing.There are two types of algorithms- the rule-based ones that we take for granted that are repeated instructions for getting from A to B, and machine-learning ones that have come to dominate our world, also known as artificial intelligence, or AI.The book covers six critical areas where AI is being utilized right now, and goes over in depth the pros and cons of their abilities.1- Data is mined by new learning algorithms to figure out our behaviors, looking for patterns in our buying, voting and living habits. Some of the programs ares scarily accurate. Large numbers of data brokers now trade in our purchasing data and build profiles of our likes and dislikes, which drives which kind of advertising we can see. Fry looks at the Cambridge Analytica scandal and how the data company was able to identify vulnerable voters and push information their way, much of it fake. This kind of manipulation will almost certainly continue.2- Fry looks at our justice system- specifically how judges decide on sentence length and whether to release accused criminals on bail. Databases of past results are now being used to score people who have been arrested and while the scores are helpful, they are also ridden with biases. Judges, unfortunately, are even worse, giving vastly different sentences for the same crime depending on their mood, the time of day, or their feelings toward the accused.3- She then looks at the medical field, and points to new programs that can help spot cancerous cells on slides much more accurately than humans can. Computers are great at finding patterns, and can catch things humans can't especially if different humans deal with a patient over an extended period. There are attempts now to diagnose illnesses using computers, as well as projects to look at DNA from genetic providers like 23 and me. While the speed is impressive, mistakes can happen and privacy is a big concern.4- Self driving cars are supposedly the next big thing for AI, and Fry looks at the challenges in this field. Humans make terrible mistakes when driving, and many of them can be disastrous. Machines can drive cars too, but there are many real-world issues that self-driving cars can't anticipate. Having a hybrid system where the car drives itself most of the time and relies on the human as backup looks to be a bad idea because humans are lazy and too trusting of computer prowess. 5- The chapter on crime covers how hot spots for criminals can be predicted by machines, something that police departments are utilizing more and more. Computers use pattern recognition to predict where crimes are most likely to happen, which allows officers to head off problems ahead of time. Crime shows on tv are all big on facial recognition technology, which depends on incredibly complex algorithms, but are far from perfect. 6- The final chapter, oddly enough, is about how AI can predict and create great art and music.AI programs have written pieces of music that have fooled audiences. They can also use audience preferences to tell if something is likely to be popular, though this process is still far from perfect.We rely on social proof through such algorithms as Rotten Tomatoes, Billboard, bestseller lists to tell us if something is good or not. We also let places like Amazon and Netflix suggest tv shows and movies to us because they can see what we watch the most.So what's the answer? Is AI coming to take our jobs and be our master? Not for a while, but it does in general do a better job at most tasks than we do. It's faster, more consistent, and less prone to cognitive bias than human beings. Ms. Fry tells the precautionary tale of Stanislov Petrov, the man who single-handedly saved the world from nuclear war. In 1983 Petrov was working for the Soviets when his computer system alerted him to an incoming US attack. Proper protocol would have been to believe the computer and pass the information to his bosses. But Petrov, in his wisdom, overruled the computer and judged it to be a false alarm, which it turned out to be. AI performs better than humans, but it still far from perfect, and the last chapter of this book is a wonderful recipe for working alongside algorithms, not beneath them. They are too prone to bias, error, and incomplete judgements to ever be completely trusted. There will always be a place for humans to step in an correct them when needed, but the challenge will be where and when. "
31,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60169232-kate,5,"I liked everything about this book from cover to cover (literally - how cool is the design?!) and swallowed it in no time. Meticuously researched and translating difficult but important concepts into simple, engaging language using lots of real life examples without oversimplifying - just how I like my pop science. Whether we care or not, we live in the age of the algorithm. But because we don't care enough, we don't understand them enough and are simultaneously scared of them and overreliant on their authority. Even I identified those patterns in my thinking while reading the book. Fry delves deeper into 7 areas (e.g. justice, cars, medicine) where they are used and talks about the pros and cons. Just to mention a few general pros and cons: Cons: we sometimes don't know (e.g. because they're often proprietary) or don't understand (e.g. because they often rely on different ""thought"" processes) how they arrive at a conclusion leading to issues with transparency and accountability. They also often train based on limited, biased data, use assumptions and probability and aren't sufficiently regulated leading to issues with bias, fairness, errors, privacy, manipulation etc. Our overreliance on them can also make us lazier and dumber. Pros: they (should) make us analyse our decision making and I was shocked to find out how flimsy our thought processes are when it comes to things like justice for example. This should at the very least push us to understand and improve how we think and make decisions. In most of the areas in the book the algorithm decisions were more accurate/ precise than the human ones, algorithms never get tired and help us be more efficient. Snake oil algorithms promising what they can't deliver aside, Fry concludes the best way forward in most cases is a human and algorithm cooperation where we understand the algorithm's possibilities and shortcomings and where possible try to fix the latter (e.g. by taking their decisions as options rather than rules, regulation). And Fry's really helped with the understanding through her book."

AI-assisted diagnoses by pathologists seem to be the best example of this in the book, but i think we’re poised to see more such success stories in the future. "

38,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4073465-carlos-martinez,4,"Rounded up from 3.5. An insightful, thought-provoking and fun book about algorithms: what they are, how they work, the problems they fix, the problems they cause, and how we can build a happy symbiosis between human and machine.The science was a bit more basic than I was after - it's addressed at someone who knows _nothing_ about algorithms rather than someone who knows _a little bit_. The book in general suffers for being somewhat Eurocentric - for example in spite of China being a world leader in AI, the only mention it gets involves perpetuating silly exaggerations about its 'social credit rating' system. Also the book hints at but doesn't quite do justice to a very important social/political/economic issue about algorithms: ownership. An awful lot of the negative aspects of algorithms' ever-increasing impact on our lives derives from private ownership of the systems involved, as the production of use values (improving peoples' lives) takes second place to the production of market values (improving shareholders' bank balances). For products that impact humanity to such an enormous degree, and which challenge affect our collective understanding of ethics, there's a fairly clear case for public ownership and democratic accountability.I listened to the audiobook, which is read (very well) by Hannah Fry herself."

Her liberal contempt at the software industry was palpable, and she brings a ""I think I'm smart because I have a PhD but actually know nothing about the industry"" attitude. I was so surprised, for someone who is a mathematician, to know so little about how algorithms are actually devised, tested and implemented for software. I will say though, it was handy to have a collection of all the racy tech articles from the last couple years, and fun to read them again. That's what gave her two stars instead of one."

How good is good enough? Once you’ve built a flawed algorithm that can calculate something, should you let it?""page 140 ""But for me true art can’t be created by accident. There are boundaries to the reach of algorithms. Limits to what can be quantified. Among all of the staggeringly impressive, mind-boggling things that data and statistics can tell me, how it feels to be human isn’t one of them.""page 195After having read a lot of books warning of the immense power of algorithms, this was refreshing. Instead of arguing that algorithms are all powerful and will eventually encompass all aspects of the human experience, Fry chooses instead to focus on the current limitations that exist as a way of exploring some deep issues that arise from the use of algorithms today. In doing so, she makes me more relaxed about the extent to which algorithms and AI can really displace humans in the foreseeable future (her chapters on Art and Crime were particularly good in this regard), and more worried about the fact that we aren't asking a very important question: to what extent should we trust the decisions reached by algorithms? Principally, that is what the book is about: how much authority should we cede to algorithms to make decisions on our behalf? It is clear from Fry's perspective that we currently give far too much because we are not cognisant of the limitations that exist. Whether this is because of faulty narratives about the power of 'logical decision making', or because we are straight up deceived about how the algorithm is reaching a conclusion (as she points out, we cannot see the inner workings of some algorithms because they are proprietary, but others that we can look at such as the Idaho healthcare one are so unbelievably shoddy that their outcomes are basically random), we need to do a better job at challenging the authority which algorithms are being given. This is especially true because of the immense damage that can be caused when things go wrong. None of this is to say that we should go in the opposite direction either. Algorithms obviously offer an immense capacity for good, evidenced in many aspects of day to day life. To allow us to reap these benefits and avoid the potential downsides of giving over control to entire decisions, Fry advocates two things: 1) We should be thinking of algorithms more like team mates than competitors. The cases where they are most effective, such as in the case of diagnosing cancerous cells, are where the algorithm does the heavy lifting of narrowing down a range of suspicious cases which a human expert can then consider. Humans are far better at making these specific judgements, where algorithms are better at identifying the anomalies within a pattern. These strengths are complementary. 2) We should be build algorithms to be contestable from the ground up. Instead of aiming for perfect precision (a goal that Fry argues is largely unattainable) in which an algorithm aims for a single, definitive answer, we should instead be building ones that offer us a series of answers that were considered in the algorithm's process along side a score based on how confident it is in each answer being correct - exactly what IBM's Watson did when it went about winning on Jeopardy. This would help us as humans better question the information the algorithm is offering and consider the potential biases, and motives that have been coded into the algorithm by the creators. In this way we become better at holding their decisions accountable, or understanding their mistakes. This has definitely pulled me back from the position that I was heading towards that the ""infotech"" revolution was going to be a fundamentally different change in production that would displace humans in the work place. If Fry's perspective is indeed correct then humans still have an important role to play in working with algorithms and AIs to complement their weaknesses and benefit from their strengths. She puts it very nicely in the last line of the book: ""In the age of the algorithm, humans have never been more important""."
42,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37124155-lthmath,4,"This was the book for our LThMath Book Club for June and July. It was a great read after Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy. It is similar to it: it explains different mathematical models and algorithms that influence our society. It covers different aspects from medicine, justice, art and the car industry (I have to confess that my favourite chapter was the one about cars.) It is very easy to read. She doesn't use any complicated mathematical or any other technical terminologies. It doesn't contain a lot of mathematics, but the little mathematical concepts presented are well explained. Everything is very precise and easy to understand. Considering the vocabulary, this is a book for everyone - you don't need to have any background in mathematics or computer science. Another aspect I enjoyed a lot is the fact that she presents both pros and cons for every algorithm. The book gives you the oportunity to decide by yourself if the algorithmul is useful or not. This was something I was missing in Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy and I found it very refreshing in this book. Hannah Fry does a very good job at being neutral. In conclusion, this book is something everyone should be reading. All of the algorithms/ mathematical models / machines presented in this book are part of our lives, they influence our day to day activities and we need to know more about them. We need to be informed about the changes that happen with our society and this book covers a very important aspect. I cannot highlight how important this type of books are to everyone. "
43,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24682440-tom-stamper,4,"The world of algorithmsI think there is a reason that flawed algorithms are becoming a science fiction trope. We would like to think that human decisions are based on empathy and empathy can overcome the coldness and cruelness of the world. We also know that science is a powerful tool and if the people in power use it to manipulate outcomes the defense against it is harder to win than against a flesh and blood opponent. Somewhere in our consciousness we realize that the benefits of science have a trade-off and we can all think of situations where the trade-off isn't worth it. But I think we often forget that the modern bureaucracy is already running like an algorithm. So many of the decisions that effect your life are made by people, but not with empathy but with utilitarianism in mind. We had a safety class a year or so ago and the instructor asked whether we would ever trust self-driving cars. I would say 80% of the people in class said they wouldn't trust them. I was among the 80% probably influenced by news articles that have demonstrated the imperfection of them. The instructor went on to tell us that the most dangerous thing when it comes to driving is distracted driving. You can't distract a computer. Therefore, there will come a day when automated cars will be safer than human driven cars. I came out of the class convinced he was right and yet still leery of letting a computer drive me anywhere. I think mathematician, Hannah Fry, captures her own uneasiness well in her book.  Fry looks at Power, Data, Justice, Medicine, Cars, Crime, and Art. For much of the book reads like Freaknomics or The Tipping Point. Things like how to determine the proper prison sentence and how to diagnose cancer bring up interesting research and the benefits and drawbacks of using algorithms. But it was the section on crime that I found most interesting. It starts with the story of Jack Maple and William Bratton and how they decreased crime in New York City starting on the subways. I had read Maples book two decades ago about his experiences as a transit cop and they were the kind of simple brilliance that we all admire in the world. I think Fry admires these folks as well, but she often tempers her admiration with a devil's advocate balance. I get the impression that she fears being labeled an uncaring automaton for appreciating the math. Fry tells us the science behind using geography as a predictive pattern in curbing crime or at least making arrests. We get a great anecdotal story of a U.K. rapist found using this method as well as crime statistics in New York City that dropped after targeted policing. Then a good deal of statistics about Los Angeles area crime that found success targeting hot spots. Then Fry asks if the whole thing is just a feedback loop. Maybe cops find more crime in areas they cover because they are covering those areas. If the algorithm is fed crimes statistics from areas cops are patrol won't it just tell cops to keep going back to those areas? She seems to forget that a small percentage of people create a large majority of the crime. The very thing they are doing will eventually remove the problem people from the streets and/or scare the criminal element away from such areas. Maybe the biggest social problem with crime algorithms is that the math creates predictions that would appear discriminatory if they were decided by the whims of people. And because such conclusions have become a debatable evidence of discrimination what is society to do when it's repeated by the indifferent machine? These are just not questions the sociologist is ready to debate and I think Fry can see that her math makes her a big obstacle in the way of current zeitgeist. I would expect Fry to be an advocate of the hard science and let others be an advocate for the soft science. But the narrative of the soft science often has an intuitive advantage over the mathematician in the public relations department. Fry's reluctance to be a full throttle advocate is an example of how culture leads science rather than vice versa. In more complex areas like climate science where the data is more ambiguous but public relations is in alignment the predictions are much bolder with less equivocation. If one were to say that climate science could be creating a feedback loop you'd be denounced as a denier. Thus I believe is the reason for Fry's call for independent experts and a regulatory body in algorithmic decisions so that the responsibility and blame can be spread among a greater number of bureaucrats and the mathematicians can go back to doing math without being blamed for their anti-social results. The section on art takes a computer algorithm and creates a new Bach composition based on derivatives of Bach's catalog of work. This work is performed with 2 others works. One work is an obscure piece by Bach. The second is by a Bach expert. The audience is convinced that the algorithm Bach is the genuine Bach. This is troubling to the composure mimicking Bach and to a lot of musicians that see music as an expression of emotion rather than code. And yet of all the arts music is the one most influenced by numbers so such an experiment shouldn't be surprising. Fry's conclusion in that chapter is that algorithms can be creative but they can't be art because art is the expression of the artist. I think that's a very modern view of art and it doesn't take into account that Homer did not write the Illiad. First, it was a oral tale for centuries before it was written. Second, the actual person who wrote it down is not really known. In a way you could argue that the numerous people who were repeating the story for centuries were a collective means to deliver a story that couldn't possibly have been the same story originally told. If all of those versions had been written and then an algorithm had created a composite would it be discernibly artificial compared to what we ultimately have? But even if Homer did take all of the stories and write his own composite what would that have to do with his own emotional experience? In short, algorithms are just numerical expressions of what humans have already been doing with less sophisticated means. There is a danger that algorithms will error and that any of us could be the victim of that error. Well, humans error everyday and we are the victims of that error too. I think the essence of the conflict is that people want to think that strangers are treating them as individuals even when they are not. We want to think that what happens to us is the result someone's best intentions with us in mind. That fiction that we create within ourselves is broken if we take the human out of the equation so even a better result in the aggregate is not worth losing the fiction. This, I think, is the conflict that we will face as the decades roll on. "

The book is extremely well researched with all lively anecdotes about the successes and mishaps of letting the machine decide on our faith backed by references, however lots in the form of cumbersome URLs, because the subject matter is in a quickly changing field, the actuality of the book may well disintegrate with the rate of death of those links, but for the moment the book is a very good overview of the current developments in the field. The opinion of the author shines through the pages as being in favor of this development in automation but with a caution. This is not your nerdy mathematician pitching the virtues of artificial intelligence, but an enthusiastic practitioner that still has a human heart beating and that struggles with the consequences of her science and we should not take this lightly. Hopefully it will not be like the hindsight of Oppenheimer repenting after the bomb was dropped. Because make no mistake, these algorithms are slated to make decisions over life and death as exemplified clearly in this book. There are some clear insights in this book that can help you to form an educated opinion about the subject of algorithms whether you incline in favor or against them. If only the understanding of the concepts of sensitivity and specificity remain after reading this book it would be already a win, but chances are your intellectual baggage will expand a little bit more. The book strikes a nice balance between the dead serious discussion of the hard science behind the algorithms and a lively and playful way when describing them as being applied to real life situations, sometimes with a personal touch in which she doesn’t spare herself. Here we see the capacity of an educator at work that is able to bring difficult subjects to a general audience in a palatable format. We are some time away from Skynet taking over, after reading this book you know why."

...one thing is for sure. In the age of the algorithm, humans have never been more important.
 I can't remember having read a book so insightful and important as Hello World: Being Human in the Age of Algorithms. This has been one of the best books I've even read in regard of my professional field, one whose relevance I can't measure. This book is about algorithms and humans, the relation between each other and how they have to work together in order to accomplish something actually good for humanity. This is a book about ethics, and how humans and algorithms book make mistakes and how we still have to work to improve together. I loved it because it was an objetive book, and it brought a lot of useful info (both handly anecdotes and practical technical knowledge) all while insisting on the ethical side of creating and using algorithms. The thing I loved the most was that it didn't only have questions or data, but answers as well, and I really liked the point Hannah Fry was making. Overall, I find this a must read for any person working with algorithms, and a good, useful read for anybody who wants to learn how algorithms are already changing our lives and how should we act about it. 
The algorithm and the human work together in partnership, exploiting each other’s strengths and embracing each other’s flaws.

Hannah Fry has written a book that explains what an algorithm is (simply put, “a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a task"", what they can do, the pros and cons, along with well-chosen examples. What she's writing about are mathematical operations that include equations, probability, and logic translated into computer code. She clearly explains that computers don't think, but only follow sequential directions coded by humans. Because the code is written by humans, the algorithm can be accidentally biased or contain bugs, or the bias may be intentional. Algorithms allow computers to scan slides quickly and more accurately for signs of cancer, guide the buying and selling of stocks on Wall Street, and ""drive"" self-driving cars. Algorithms can help us greatly, and also do great harm. Ms. Fry thinks that humans and machines working together is the best and safest way to head bravely into the future. GPS can get you safely from point A to point B, but it's also your responsibility not to drive off a cliff, even if Mandy's friendly GPS voice tells you to. Hello World is an excellent, informative read, and one I highly recommend."

I think it's really important for anyone engaging with computers, with software 'that makes everything easier', to understand what's going on behind those calculations.Fry covers medicine, art, justice - several different points of where algorithms have gotten things so right, but combined with the flaws of the world (and our own human decisions), where things can quickly go sour.Fry's conclusion is brilliant because it does veer into simple scare stories that we should tear it all down, nor does she suggest that we hand over control to the algorithmic overlords; we should instead find areas where algorithms can do a lot of the heavy lifting for us and leave the bigger moral questions to the human decision at the end. The world is not clear cut about what is 'right' and 'wrong' - it's unwise to ask for an algorithm to pretend it can be. Algorithms are built on the flaws of today - we can harness the power of algorithms to understand these flaws and get it right for the future.A great read."
49,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37739033-louise,5,"I found this to be an amusing and compelling read. Hannah Fry, a maths professor at UCL, asks not how to learn to live with algorithms, but illustrates how we already live with them and in what manner they could be used differently. The science behind the algorithms discussed is well explained with little theory, as most of the discussion is anecdotal and upon the human interactions with the algorithms. Told anecdotally, the story meanders pleasantly, always presenting the potentially deep subject of algorithms in an engaging way. Fry asks us to consider algorithms that already exist in the areas of power, data, justice, medicine, cars, crime, and art. This process highlights the importance of data in algorithms: where it comes from; how powerful it can be; and the necessity for quality, to avoid unconscious bias (programs will be as biased as their creators). Also, just how much is already known about yourself. Overall, this book is most suitable for those interested in the uses of algorithms, not the theory behind them. Fry advocates for the tandem use of algorithms and humans to overcome issues experienced by both parties, while inspiring a questioning mindset on the morality of using data in the discussed situations. I’m left wondering what we consider appropriate for algorithms to decide upon and what mistakes are acceptable for a computer acting as a human being."
50,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5913132-titus-hjelm,4,"I picked this up because some years ago I shared the stage with Dr Fry at TEDxUCL. Her performance there launched her career as a semi-celebrity maths/complexity person. I'm happy to see that it paid off and her debut trade book is a very entertaining and interesting read. But do get it as an audiobook if you can. She also has an extremely pleasant reading voice. The content is rather standard narrative popular science, illustrating a point through real-life stories, but it works very well. I especially appreciated that, in a world divided into luddites and Wired magazine-reading true believers, her finishing sentiment is to say that algorithms will never replace humans, no matter how much they develop and change our lives, yet some things they actually do better than fallible humans.

51,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,4,"Although AI (artificial intelligence) has come on in leaps and bounds of late, it is still only ‘intelligent’ in the narrowest sense of the word. It would be more useful to think of what we’ve been through as a revolution in computational statistics than a revolution in intelligence. - Hannah Fry (Hello World) Here’s the latest instance of something I’ve noticed occurs with increased regularity … I recently purchased a pair of prescription bi-focals from an on-line retailer. Now, every website I visit serves up ‘customized’ ads from companies selling … wait for it … eyeglasses. Coincidence?!? … Obviously not. It’s a typical example of an algorithm at work.  In this case the algorithm monitored my browsing habits and attempted to extrapolate the types of advertisements that may be of interest based on the sites I visit. The advantages to the advertiser are clear … rather than paying for blanket advertising coverage, they can more selectively target potential customers. Theoretically, there are potential advantages to customers as well. They are shown ads that reflect their interests. For example, those who need bi-focals are more likely to be interested in fiber supplements than baby diapers … so … win/win?!? Before exploring this question, first some basics. In case you don’t know, an algorithm is simply a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing some task (especially by a computer). They broadly perform four functions:1. Prioritization – making an ordered list (such a Google search).2. Classification – picking a category (showing ads for glasses to someone shopping for them).3. Association – finding links (you like Lord of the Rings, perhaps you’ll enjoy Game of Thrones).4. Filtering – isolating what’s important (such as Fbook filtering stories in your feed based on your ‘like’ history).  Algorithms have many other uses than advertising and Hannah Fry (Associate Professor in the Mathematics of Cities at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis at University College London) describes a number of them in fields such as:Justice – determining whether a prisoner should be paroled based on the likelihood that they’ll revert to a life of crime.Medicine – detecting abnormal cells in a mammogram.Self-driving Cars – enabling them to navigate complicated roads.Crime – predicting crime hot spots and directing law enforcement resources accordingly.Art – computer generated art and music. What she finds is that algorithms can perform certain tasks very well, but that they all have significant limitations. For example, algorithms are better than human experts at detecting abnormal cells in a mammogram. The problem is that they flag many healthy cells as cancerous (false positives). This is not desirable since it could lead to unnecessary medical procedures in otherwise healthy women. Human experts, on the other hand, rarely confuse healthy cells with cancer, but they have a difficult time detecting small abnormalities. This is also undesirable since it could allow an undetected disease to progress unchecked. Thus, the logical solution would be to have an algorithm take the first pass and let the human weed out the false positives … which is exactly what is being done with very high rates of success. Hannah concludes that blind trust in algorithms is misplaced and that the ideal situation is for the “algorithm and the human to work together in partnership, exploiting each other’s strengths and embracing each other’s flaws”. But it’s not all sweetness and light. There’s a dark side to algorithms as well. Internet companies are building up a tremendous amount of information about every aspect of your life based on your on-line activities. Companies such as Google and Facebook are not only collecting and sifting this data, they are using it to make predictions about your personal life and are selling this information to other businesses. Many of these firms just want to sell you more crap, but others are trying to influence what you think … and they do not necessarily have your best interests in mind (unless your deepest wish is to fervently believe things that simply aren’t true).  To take but one example, Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm hired by Trump’s 2016 election campaign, gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users. The firm offered tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. This data was then used to serve up fake news stories and memes designed to enflame passions and manipulate people to vote a certain way. Did it work? It’s tough to say for sure but given that Trump’s margin of victory in states such as Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and North Carolina amounted to only a few percentage points, it may have been enough to swing the needle in his favor.  Your best defense against this form of manipulation is to simply employ basic critical thinking skills rather than believe everything you see, but unfortunately this isn’t a skill most people possess. Therefore, it is incumbent on legislators to force the tech companies to meet basic standards of truth and accuracy or at least to make that information available in an effort to counter misinformation. We’ll see if this comes to pass, but as usual, the technology is outpacing our ability to regulate it. As to the book – it’s really quite good. Fry provides a nuanced view of the current state of algorithms … their use as well as abuse and describes the potential implications that they have on our lives. Highly recommended."

I work in machine-learning, and I learned some things from this book: I'd unhesitatingly recommend it for outsiders wanting to know what this whole AI thing is really about and whether or not they should be worried about it."

54,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4816422-chris,3,"I would give this book 3.5 stars. I actually had a book club book on-the-go at the same time and also an audio book so perhaps did not give the book the attention it deserved. It was very interesting hearing about all of the ways algorithms are part of our lives, many times without our knowledge. I thought it posed very interesting questions about how much power do we want to give these algorithms and what are the trade-offs between blindly using them to automate our lives and decisions and what are we giving up in the process. Interesting questions with no simple answers."

Real world problems in different areas partly solved with AI solutions.

Great book to read for fun & in the same time learn something new with every page. "

So when I started, I was skeptical. But frankly, it's probably the better book, a little more even-handed. The end solution to our algorithmic problems is a human-in-the-loop, as they say, combined with making sure we recognize algorithms are not gods, they're just tools which can be poorly made and badly used - or well made or well used. Not a bad place for a book to land, and Fry's writing is plenty accessible."

Just the other day I went downtown and there were so few humans and so many robots, androids and other machines, I thought I was living in a SciFi movie. Actually, come to think about it, even in the films, maybe there is one scene where the humans are a minority, but I can't recall one single movie in which the humans did not have the majority in most of the scenes. So, talking about crap. Even in the imaginary, humans don't live in an ""Age of the Machine""."

She also talks about how and when they are useful. In her conclusion, she notes that algorithms work best when they're not given the final word; when they work in conjunction with human experts, rather than having the final word.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is just getting started investigating the world of algorithmic bias."

80,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47755613-scott,4,"If you are looking for a book that will scare you in a similar way to the many who refused to go swimming after watching the movie Jaws, “Hello World: Being Human in the Age of Algorithms” by Hannah Fry is the book you will want to pick up and give it a listen. No, the book is not a piece of horror fiction like that of Steve King. Instead it details a number of actual real-world examples of how computer and mathematical algorithms guide nearly every one of our daily actions. The book is not only well laid out, concise, and eye opening, the narration is skillfully performed by Dr. Fry herself. I’m not usually a fan of an author narrating their own work, but in this case her accent, pace, and inflection really brought the material to life in audio format. As the subtitle suggests, the book covers how simply being a human today makes you one who is continuously tracked, lead, and whose information is often sold to the highest bidder all collected from various algorithms. Hannah Fry is no stranger to mathematical algorithms, she is a well-known British mathematician who can often be found on the Numberphile’s YouTube channel and she has also presented a few TED talks.The author does an exceptional job of educating the listener on both the good and bad aspects of algorithms. Much like any tool, algorithms can be used for their intended purpose, but many algorithms are used in ethical or evil ways. Early on she defines what an algorithm is and why they are important. Next, she provides some high-level examples of a few very useful algorithms and a few not so useful ones. No book covering such as subject matter would leave out the importance of machine learning and the author gives some details on why this type of algorithm is important along with how it differs from procedural algorithms. What I really liked was that she did not stick to only examples that were computer or math based, but we are given a view into how most business sectors today leverage algorithms in one way or another. Sometimes to drive sales, sometimes to guide decisions, and sometimes to get ahead of their competition. The book is not intended to be a doom and gloom piece, yet it truly is a wakeup call for most. I also liked that the book was targeted at the average user, you do not have to understand computers, mathematical formulas or science to enjoy the book. It is written a way that nearly anyone would be able to listen and understand her points. Dr. Fry spends some time diving into data brokers. She explains why they exist, how they survive, and just how powerful they are when it comes to knowing who you are. Imagine one company aggregating all the data from your computer (browser history, searches, social posts) and blend this information with your credit card purchases, loyalty cards, photos, and phone/GPS data. Such a company may just know more about you then you know about yourself. Many say that Google alone by the data collected about your search history knowns more about you than your closest family members. These data broker companies slurp up every bit of data you leave behind and profit by selling it to people wanting to target very specific people. What is even more concerning is that these data brokers are often not bound to regulatory bodies, so what they collect and how they use this information is like the wild west and what is even more worrisome is that there is not much one can do to limit or stop it. We are beginning to see more regulations in both Europe (GDPR) and the United States to require such companies to notify you of how such collected data will be used. As with most people who use “free” services today, they do not take the time or effort to read the End User License Agreements (EULA) which often state that information will be shared with data broker companies. As Dr. Fry points out, we should not be surprised that companies sell this information especially for free services like Facebook and Gmail as they need to profit someway. As the saying goes, “If you do not pay for a product, you are the product.” And after listening to this book, you will wonder what value you should be placing on such important details. Much of the trading between companies and brokers is usually for misuse and abuse then for your or my good. When it comes to data brokers, think of all the crumbs one leaves behind from all the activities in our lives and imagine a large vacuum cleaner coming behind us to collect and assemble them into the loaf which they came. Again, very scary!I did want to say that the book itself does not cover anything new or ground shattering, but it is a part of our lives we often ignore or are ignorant to, and I can say that the author does a great job of waking up the listener to better understand how these algorithms affect and impact our lives ever day. She educates us on what is often referred to as the “creepy line”. It is an artificial line which targeted marketing company may cross at times and when they do, it is perceived as being more creeping then good. As the author says, both sales and marketing desire it to get as close to the creepy line as possible without actually crossing it, and that really is a fine line as most have a different buffer zone. Not only is the information we drop and collect used for marketing, but as the author points out, it can also be used to sway us one way or another via techniques call micro-manipulation. It is a way of influencing and emotionally leveraging data they have collects and use it against us (overtly) to lead us to a conclusion or decision which they desire. As she says in the book, “Data is the new gold” and it will be a standard we will all be measured by in the coming years. What began with supermarket loyalty cards for some has grown into a large government control data profile on the population. It sounds Orwellian in many ways but do some research on the Chinese Sesame Credit systems and you will quickly find out how a volunteer system will become mandatory in due time. Dr. Fry covers situations where algorithms are used in shopping to get you to buy one more item, judicial for sentencing, automotive when we talk about autonomous cars, healthcare for automating the reading of test results, to our money systems (cash, credit, and stocks). As the book unfolds, you quickly see how these algorithms, directly or indirectly, impact one’s life. In the United States, just think of the importance and focus on having a “good credit score” when looking at getting a loan or buying a house. Now apply that same logic (like in China) which one’s ability to receive government services, timely healthcare, etc. are all based on one’s profile. It is not about being worried by the things one does online, but all the information one is willing to give up saving a little on some grocery item. One area where the author spends some time is the issue with most algorithms being either black or white. There is little to no grey areas (as with human judgement or compassion). Also, algorithms are only as good as the people who developed and coded them. There is no such thing as a perfect algorithm. We have issues on two extremes called false negatives and false positives. These both need to be adjusted to cause the least amount of issues within a given system. For example, take breast cancer screening. An algorithm that is set to limit false negatives (telling people they do not have cancer when they do) increases the chance of more false positives (telling a person they have cancer when they do not.) Neither outcome is good, and any algorithm has to take such things in to consideration. She also covers that there is no such thing as a non-bias algorithm. They are only as good as the information being feed in to them. For example, if you feed criminal convection data into a database seeking people that may be considered high-risk, such an algorithm will be bias towards males who are of color from females that are Caucasian. That is only because of the bias of the data feed in I the system. One of the more interesting section for me was her dive into algorithms being used to be creative. Can a computer compose music, write a book, or create art. Many will say yes, and a few will say no. Again, this all comes down to the information fed into the algorithm and what makes something like this creative. A piece of music or poetry and follow specific rules assigned to them but is it really art or simply regurgitating data based on the rule feed into it. I can play a musical piece precisely following the rule of music, yet creativity often comes from how a piece is interpreted and played by the individual. I can speed up notes, lengthen their durations, and give it life and body. Can an algorithm accomplish the same thing? I think it is still being debated. Lastly, the book has a really good summary chapter where the author closes out and covers at a high-level why algorithms matter and why we should care. It was very well done. I can say that this is the first audiobook I have listened too that was narrated by Dr. Fry, and I can say that if she ever wants to give up her day job, she could become a full-time audiobook narrator. Her voice is pleasant to listen too, and a wonderful accent that is not difficult to comprehend, and her pacing of the book was just right. I do not recall any issues with the audio itself, no pops, volume issues, or page turns. The piece was very professionally produced.For parents and younger readers, there were a few places that vulgar language was used in the book. As I recall, it was only used when quoting a source or individual. There are very few places I remember words being used, and I believe the subject matter is important for people to understand. For this reason, I would still recommend it but be aware that there are a few places such language is used. In summary, I know this has been a rather long review so I will not spend too much time on a summary section. If you want to learn more about algorithms and not get lost in the weeds of maths or science, you will find this book very approachable, entertaining, and educating. The examples she gives are relevant to not only today but will greatly impact future generations if this data collection via algorithms is left unchecked. It is well worth the credit and I look forward to future pieces by her."

110,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47755613-scott,4,"If you are looking for a book that will scare you in a similar way to the many who refused to go swimming after watching the movie Jaws, “Hello World: Being Human in the Age of Algorithms” by Hannah Fry is the book you will want to pick up and give it a listen. No, the book is not a piece of horror fiction like that of Steve King. Instead it details a number of actual real-world examples of how computer and mathematical algorithms guide nearly every one of our daily actions. The book is not only well laid out, concise, and eye opening, the narration is skillfully performed by Dr. Fry herself. I’m not usually a fan of an author narrating their own work, but in this case her accent, pace, and inflection really brought the material to life in audio format. As the subtitle suggests, the book covers how simply being a human today makes you one who is continuously tracked, lead, and whose information is often sold to the highest bidder all collected from various algorithms. Hannah Fry is no stranger to mathematical algorithms, she is a well-known British mathematician who can often be found on the Numberphile’s YouTube channel and she has also presented a few TED talks.The author does an exceptional job of educating the listener on both the good and bad aspects of algorithms. Much like any tool, algorithms can be used for their intended purpose, but many algorithms are used in ethical or evil ways. Early on she defines what an algorithm is and why they are important. Next, she provides some high-level examples of a few very useful algorithms and a few not so useful ones. No book covering such as subject matter would leave out the importance of machine learning and the author gives some details on why this type of algorithm is important along with how it differs from procedural algorithms. What I really liked was that she did not stick to only examples that were computer or math based, but we are given a view into how most business sectors today leverage algorithms in one way or another. Sometimes to drive sales, sometimes to guide decisions, and sometimes to get ahead of their competition. The book is not intended to be a doom and gloom piece, yet it truly is a wakeup call for most. I also liked that the book was targeted at the average user, you do not have to understand computers, mathematical formulas or science to enjoy the book. It is written a way that nearly anyone would be able to listen and understand her points. Dr. Fry spends some time diving into data brokers. She explains why they exist, how they survive, and just how powerful they are when it comes to knowing who you are. Imagine one company aggregating all the data from your computer (browser history, searches, social posts) and blend this information with your credit card purchases, loyalty cards, photos, and phone/GPS data. Such a company may just know more about you then you know about yourself. Many say that Google alone by the data collected about your search history knowns more about you than your closest family members. These data broker companies slurp up every bit of data you leave behind and profit by selling it to people wanting to target very specific people. What is even more concerning is that these data brokers are often not bound to regulatory bodies, so what they collect and how they use this information is like the wild west and what is even more worrisome is that there is not much one can do to limit or stop it. We are beginning to see more regulations in both Europe (GDPR) and the United States to require such companies to notify you of how such collected data will be used. As with most people who use “free” services today, they do not take the time or effort to read the End User License Agreements (EULA) which often state that information will be shared with data broker companies. As Dr. Fry points out, we should not be surprised that companies sell this information especially for free services like Facebook and Gmail as they need to profit someway. As the saying goes, “If you do not pay for a product, you are the product.” And after listening to this book, you will wonder what value you should be placing on such important details. Much of the trading between companies and brokers is usually for misuse and abuse then for your or my good. When it comes to data brokers, think of all the crumbs one leaves behind from all the activities in our lives and imagine a large vacuum cleaner coming behind us to collect and assemble them into the loaf which they came. Again, very scary!I did want to say that the book itself does not cover anything new or ground shattering, but it is a part of our lives we often ignore or are ignorant to, and I can say that the author does a great job of waking up the listener to better understand how these algorithms affect and impact our lives ever day. She educates us on what is often referred to as the “creepy line”. It is an artificial line which targeted marketing company may cross at times and when they do, it is perceived as being more creeping then good. As the author says, both sales and marketing desire it to get as close to the creepy line as possible without actually crossing it, and that really is a fine line as most have a different buffer zone. Not only is the information we drop and collect used for marketing, but as the author points out, it can also be used to sway us one way or another via techniques call micro-manipulation. It is a way of influencing and emotionally leveraging data they have collects and use it against us (overtly) to lead us to a conclusion or decision which they desire. As she says in the book, “Data is the new gold” and it will be a standard we will all be measured by in the coming years. What began with supermarket loyalty cards for some has grown into a large government control data profile on the population. It sounds Orwellian in many ways but do some research on the Chinese Sesame Credit systems and you will quickly find out how a volunteer system will become mandatory in due time. Dr. Fry covers situations where algorithms are used in shopping to get you to buy one more item, judicial for sentencing, automotive when we talk about autonomous cars, healthcare for automating the reading of test results, to our money systems (cash, credit, and stocks). As the book unfolds, you quickly see how these algorithms, directly or indirectly, impact one’s life. In the United States, just think of the importance and focus on having a “good credit score” when looking at getting a loan or buying a house. Now apply that same logic (like in China) which one’s ability to receive government services, timely healthcare, etc. are all based on one’s profile. It is not about being worried by the things one does online, but all the information one is willing to give up saving a little on some grocery item. One area where the author spends some time is the issue with most algorithms being either black or white. There is little to no grey areas (as with human judgement or compassion). Also, algorithms are only as good as the people who developed and coded them. There is no such thing as a perfect algorithm. We have issues on two extremes called false negatives and false positives. These both need to be adjusted to cause the least amount of issues within a given system. For example, take breast cancer screening. An algorithm that is set to limit false negatives (telling people they do not have cancer when they do) increases the chance of more false positives (telling a person they have cancer when they do not.) Neither outcome is good, and any algorithm has to take such things in to consideration. She also covers that there is no such thing as a non-bias algorithm. They are only as good as the information being feed in to them. For example, if you feed criminal convection data into a database seeking people that may be considered high-risk, such an algorithm will be bias towards males who are of color from females that are Caucasian. That is only because of the bias of the data feed in I the system. One of the more interesting section for me was her dive into algorithms being used to be creative. Can a computer compose music, write a book, or create art. Many will say yes, and a few will say no. Again, this all comes down to the information fed into the algorithm and what makes something like this creative. A piece of music or poetry and follow specific rules assigned to them but is it really art or simply regurgitating data based on the rule feed into it. I can play a musical piece precisely following the rule of music, yet creativity often comes from how a piece is interpreted and played by the individual. I can speed up notes, lengthen their durations, and give it life and body. Can an algorithm accomplish the same thing? I think it is still being debated. Lastly, the book has a really good summary chapter where the author closes out and covers at a high-level why algorithms matter and why we should care. It was very well done. I can say that this is the first audiobook I have listened too that was narrated by Dr. Fry, and I can say that if she ever wants to give up her day job, she could become a full-time audiobook narrator. Her voice is pleasant to listen too, and a wonderful accent that is not difficult to comprehend, and her pacing of the book was just right. I do not recall any issues with the audio itself, no pops, volume issues, or page turns. The piece was very professionally produced.For parents and younger readers, there were a few places that vulgar language was used in the book. As I recall, it was only used when quoting a source or individual. There are very few places I remember words being used, and I believe the subject matter is important for people to understand. For this reason, I would still recommend it but be aware that there are a few places such language is used. In summary, I know this has been a rather long review so I will not spend too much time on a summary section. If you want to learn more about algorithms and not get lost in the weeds of maths or science, you will find this book very approachable, entertaining, and educating. The examples she gives are relevant to not only today but will greatly impact future generations if this data collection via algorithms is left unchecked. It is well worth the credit and I look forward to future pieces by her."

It is a way of influencing and emotionally leveraging data they have collects and use it against us (overtly) to lead us to a conclusion or decision which they desire. As she says in the book, “Data is the new gold” and it will be a standard we will all be measured by in the coming years. What began with supermarket loyalty cards for some has grown into a large government control data profile on the population. It sounds Orwellian in many ways but do some research on the Chinese Sesame Credit systems and you will quickly find out how a volunteer system will become mandatory in due time. Dr. Fry covers situations where algorithms are used in shopping to get you to buy one more item, judicial for sentencing, automotive when we talk about autonomous cars, healthcare for automating the reading of test results, to our money systems (cash, credit, and stocks). As the book unfolds, you quickly see how these algorithms, directly or indirectly, impact one’s life. In the United States, just think of the importance and focus on having a “good credit score” when looking at getting a loan or buying a house. Now apply that same logic (like in China) which one’s ability to receive government services, timely healthcare, etc. are all based on one’s profile. It is not about being worried by the things one does online, but all the information one is willing to give up saving a little on some grocery item. One area where the author spends some time is the issue with most algorithms being either black or white. There is little to no grey areas (as with human judgement or compassion). Also, algorithms are only as good as the people who developed and coded them. There is no such thing as a perfect algorithm. We have issues on two extremes called false negatives and false positives. These both need to be adjusted to cause the least amount of issues within a given system. For example, take breast cancer screening. An algorithm that is set to limit false negatives (telling people they do not have cancer when they do) increases the chance of more false positives (telling a person they have cancer when they do not.) Neither outcome is good, and any algorithm has to take such things in to consideration. She also covers that there is no such thing as a non-bias algorithm. They are only as good as the information being feed in to them. For example, if you feed criminal convection data into a database seeking people that may be considered high-risk, such an algorithm will be bias towards males who are of color from females that are Caucasian. That is only because of the bias of the data feed in I the system. One of the more interesting section for me was her dive into algorithms being used to be creative. Can a computer compose music, write a book, or create art. Many will say yes, and a few will say no. Again, this all comes down to the information fed into the algorithm and what makes something like this creative. A piece of music or poetry and follow specific rules assigned to them but is it really art or simply regurgitating data based on the rule feed into it. I can play a musical piece precisely following the rule of music, yet creativity often comes from how a piece is interpreted and played by the individual. I can speed up notes, lengthen their durations, and give it life and body. Can an algorithm accomplish the same thing? I think it is still being debated. Lastly, the book has a really good summary chapter where the author closes out and covers at a high-level why algorithms matter and why we should care. It was very well done. I can say that this is the first audiobook I have listened too that was narrated by Dr. Fry, and I can say that if she ever wants to give up her day job, she could become a full-time audiobook narrator. Her voice is pleasant to listen too, and a wonderful accent that is not difficult to comprehend, and her pacing of the book was just right. I do not recall any issues with the audio itself, no pops, volume issues, or page turns. The piece was very professionally produced.For parents and younger readers, there were a few places that vulgar language was used in the book. As I recall, it was only used when quoting a source or individual. There are very few places I remember words being used, and I believe the subject matter is important for people to understand. For this reason, I would still recommend it but be aware that there are a few places such language is used. In summary, I know this has been a rather long review so I will not spend too much time on a summary section. If you want to learn more about algorithms and not get lost in the weeds of maths or science, you will find this book very approachable, entertaining, and educating. The examples she gives are relevant to not only today but will greatly impact future generations if this data collection via algorithms is left unchecked. It is well worth the credit and I look forward to future pieces by her."

170,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47755613-scott,4,"If you are looking for a book that will scare you in a similar way to the many who refused to go swimming after watching the movie Jaws, “Hello World: Being Human in the Age of Algorithms” by Hannah Fry is the book you will want to pick up and give it a listen. No, the book is not a piece of horror fiction like that of Steve King. Instead it details a number of actual real-world examples of how computer and mathematical algorithms guide nearly every one of our daily actions. The book is not only well laid out, concise, and eye opening, the narration is skillfully performed by Dr. Fry herself. I’m not usually a fan of an author narrating their own work, but in this case her accent, pace, and inflection really brought the material to life in audio format. As the subtitle suggests, the book covers how simply being a human today makes you one who is continuously tracked, lead, and whose information is often sold to the highest bidder all collected from various algorithms. Hannah Fry is no stranger to mathematical algorithms, she is a well-known British mathematician who can often be found on the Numberphile’s YouTube channel and she has also presented a few TED talks.The author does an exceptional job of educating the listener on both the good and bad aspects of algorithms. Much like any tool, algorithms can be used for their intended purpose, but many algorithms are used in ethical or evil ways. Early on she defines what an algorithm is and why they are important. Next, she provides some high-level examples of a few very useful algorithms and a few not so useful ones. No book covering such as subject matter would leave out the importance of machine learning and the author gives some details on why this type of algorithm is important along with how it differs from procedural algorithms. What I really liked was that she did not stick to only examples that were computer or math based, but we are given a view into how most business sectors today leverage algorithms in one way or another. Sometimes to drive sales, sometimes to guide decisions, and sometimes to get ahead of their competition. The book is not intended to be a doom and gloom piece, yet it truly is a wakeup call for most. I also liked that the book was targeted at the average user, you do not have to understand computers, mathematical formulas or science to enjoy the book. It is written a way that nearly anyone would be able to listen and understand her points. Dr. Fry spends some time diving into data brokers. She explains why they exist, how they survive, and just how powerful they are when it comes to knowing who you are. Imagine one company aggregating all the data from your computer (browser history, searches, social posts) and blend this information with your credit card purchases, loyalty cards, photos, and phone/GPS data. Such a company may just know more about you then you know about yourself. Many say that Google alone by the data collected about your search history knowns more about you than your closest family members. These data broker companies slurp up every bit of data you leave behind and profit by selling it to people wanting to target very specific people. What is even more concerning is that these data brokers are often not bound to regulatory bodies, so what they collect and how they use this information is like the wild west and what is even more worrisome is that there is not much one can do to limit or stop it. We are beginning to see more regulations in both Europe (GDPR) and the United States to require such companies to notify you of how such collected data will be used. As with most people who use “free” services today, they do not take the time or effort to read the End User License Agreements (EULA) which often state that information will be shared with data broker companies. As Dr. Fry points out, we should not be surprised that companies sell this information especially for free services like Facebook and Gmail as they need to profit someway. As the saying goes, “If you do not pay for a product, you are the product.” And after listening to this book, you will wonder what value you should be placing on such important details. Much of the trading between companies and brokers is usually for misuse and abuse then for your or my good. When it comes to data brokers, think of all the crumbs one leaves behind from all the activities in our lives and imagine a large vacuum cleaner coming behind us to collect and assemble them into the loaf which they came. Again, very scary!I did want to say that the book itself does not cover anything new or ground shattering, but it is a part of our lives we often ignore or are ignorant to, and I can say that the author does a great job of waking up the listener to better understand how these algorithms affect and impact our lives ever day. She educates us on what is often referred to as the “creepy line”. It is an artificial line which targeted marketing company may cross at times and when they do, it is perceived as being more creeping then good. As the author says, both sales and marketing desire it to get as close to the creepy line as possible without actually crossing it, and that really is a fine line as most have a different buffer zone. Not only is the information we drop and collect used for marketing, but as the author points out, it can also be used to sway us one way or another via techniques call micro-manipulation. It is a way of influencing and emotionally leveraging data they have collects and use it against us (overtly) to lead us to a conclusion or decision which they desire.

200,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47755613-scott,4,"If you are looking for a book that will scare you in a similar way to the many who refused to go swimming after watching the movie Jaws, “Hello World: Being Human in the Age of Algorithms” by Hannah Fry is the book you will want to pick up and give it a listen. No, the book is not a piece of horror fiction like that of Steve King. Instead it details a number of actual real-world examples of how computer and mathematical algorithms guide nearly every one of our daily actions. The book is not only well laid out, concise, and eye opening, the narration is skillfully performed by Dr. Fry herself. I’m not usually a fan of an author narrating their own work, but in this case her accent, pace, and inflection really brought the material to life in audio format. As the subtitle suggests, the book covers how simply being a human today makes you one who is continuously tracked, lead, and whose information is often sold to the highest bidder all collected from various algorithms. Hannah Fry is no stranger to mathematical algorithms, she is a well-known British mathematician who can often be found on the Numberphile’s YouTube channel and she has also presented a few TED talks.The author does an exceptional job of educating the listener on both the good and bad aspects of algorithms. Much like any tool, algorithms can be used for their intended purpose, but many algorithms are used in ethical or evil ways. Early on she defines what an algorithm is and why they are important. Next, she provides some high-level examples of a few very useful algorithms and a few not so useful ones. No book covering such as subject matter would leave out the importance of machine learning and the author gives some details on why this type of algorithm is important along with how it differs from procedural algorithms. What I really liked was that she did not stick to only examples that were computer or math based, but we are given a view into how most business sectors today leverage algorithms in one way or another. Sometimes to drive sales, sometimes to guide decisions, and sometimes to get ahead of their competition. The book is not intended to be a doom and gloom piece, yet it truly is a wakeup call for most. I also liked that the book was targeted at the average user, you do not have to understand computers, mathematical formulas or science to enjoy the book. It is written a way that nearly anyone would be able to listen and understand her points. Dr. Fry spends some time diving into data brokers. She explains why they exist, how they survive, and just how powerful they are when it comes to knowing who you are. Imagine one company aggregating all the data from your computer (browser history, searches, social posts) and blend this information with your credit card purchases, loyalty cards, photos, and phone/GPS data. Such a company may just know more about you then you know about yourself. Many say that Google alone by the data collected about your search history knowns more about you than your closest family members. These data broker companies slurp up every bit of data you leave behind and profit by selling it to people wanting to target very specific people. What is even more concerning is that these data brokers are often not bound to regulatory bodies, so what they collect and how they use this information is like the wild west and what is even more worrisome is that there is not much one can do to limit or stop it. We are beginning to see more regulations in both Europe (GDPR) and the United States to require such companies to notify you of how such collected data will be used. As with most people who use “free” services today, they do not take the time or effort to read the End User License Agreements (EULA) which often state that information will be shared with data broker companies. As Dr. Fry points out, we should not be surprised that companies sell this information especially for free services like Facebook and Gmail as they need to profit someway. As the saying goes, “If you do not pay for a product, you are the product.” And after listening to this book, you will wonder what value you should be placing on such important details. Much of the trading between companies and brokers is usually for misuse and abuse then for your or my good. When it comes to data brokers, think of all the crumbs one leaves behind from all the activities in our lives and imagine a large vacuum cleaner coming behind us to collect and assemble them into the loaf which they came. Again, very scary!I did want to say that the book itself does not cover anything new or ground shattering, but it is a part of our lives we often ignore or are ignorant to, and I can say that the author does a great job of waking up the listener to better understand how these algorithms affect and impact our lives ever day. She educates us on what is often referred to as the “creepy line”. It is an artificial line which targeted marketing company may cross at times and when they do, it is perceived as being more creeping then good. As the author says, both sales and marketing desire it to get as close to the creepy line as possible without actually crossing it, and that really is a fine line as most have a different buffer zone. Not only is the information we drop and collect used for marketing, but as the author points out, it can also be used to sway us one way or another via techniques call micro-manipulation. It is a way of influencing and emotionally leveraging data they have collects and use it against us (overtly) to lead us to a conclusion or decision which they desire. As she says in the book, “Data is the new gold” and it will be a standard we will all be measured by in the coming years. What began with supermarket loyalty cards for some has grown into a large government control data profile on the population. It sounds Orwellian in many ways but do some research on the Chinese Sesame Credit systems and you will quickly find out how a volunteer system will become mandatory in due time. Dr. Fry covers situations where algorithms are used in shopping to get you to buy one more item, judicial for sentencing, automotive when we talk about autonomous cars, healthcare for automating the reading of test results, to our money systems (cash, credit, and stocks). As the book unfolds, you quickly see how these algorithms, directly or indirectly, impact one’s life. In the United States, just think of the importance and focus on having a “good credit score” when looking at getting a loan or buying a house. Now apply that same logic (like in China) which one’s ability to receive government services, timely healthcare, etc. are all based on one’s profile. It is not about being worried by the things one does online, but all the information one is willing to give up saving a little on some grocery item. One area where the author spends some time is the issue with most algorithms being either black or white. There is little to no grey areas (as with human judgement or compassion). Also, algorithms are only as good as the people who developed and coded them. There is no such thing as a perfect algorithm. We have issues on two extremes called false negatives and false positives. These both need to be adjusted to cause the least amount of issues within a given system. For example, take breast cancer screening. An algorithm that is set to limit false negatives (telling people they do not have cancer when they do) increases the chance of more false positives (telling a person they have cancer when they do not.) Neither outcome is good, and any algorithm has to take such things in to consideration. She also covers that there is no such thing as a non-bias algorithm. They are only as good as the information being feed in to them. For example, if you feed criminal convection data into a database seeking people that may be considered high-risk, such an algorithm will be bias towards males who are of color from females that are Caucasian. That is only because of the bias of the data feed in I the system. One of the more interesting section for me was her dive into algorithms being used to be creative. Can a computer compose music, write a book, or create art. Many will say yes, and a few will say no. Again, this all comes down to the information fed into the algorithm and what makes something like this creative. A piece of music or poetry and follow specific rules assigned to them but is it really art or simply regurgitating data based on the rule feed into it. I can play a musical piece precisely following the rule of music, yet creativity often comes from how a piece is interpreted and played by the individual. I can speed up notes, lengthen their durations, and give it life and body. Can an algorithm accomplish the same thing? I think it is still being debated. Lastly, the book has a really good summary chapter where the author closes out and covers at a high-level why algorithms matter and why we should care. It was very well done. I can say that this is the first audiobook I have listened too that was narrated by Dr. Fry, and I can say that if she ever wants to give up her day job, she could become a full-time audiobook narrator. Her voice is pleasant to listen too, and a wonderful accent that is not difficult to comprehend, and her pacing of the book was just right. I do not recall any issues with the audio itself, no pops, volume issues, or page turns. The piece was very professionally produced.For parents and younger readers, there were a few places that vulgar language was used in the book. As I recall, it was only used when quoting a source or individual. There are very few places I remember words being used, and I believe the subject matter is important for people to understand. For this reason, I would still recommend it but be aware that there are a few places such language is used. In summary, I know this has been a rather long review so I will not spend too much time on a summary section. If you want to learn more about algorithms and not get lost in the weeds of maths or science, you will find this book very approachable, entertaining, and educating. The examples she gives are relevant to not only today but will greatly impact future generations if this data collection via algorithms is left unchecked. It is well worth the credit and I look forward to future pieces by her."

I think that this is the first that lays out the good with the bad. The author doesn't just talk about the mistakes (often fatal) that are made by algorithms. She also talks about how and when they are useful. In her conclusion, she notes that algorithms work best when they're not given the final word; when they work in conjunction with human experts, rather than having the final word.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is just getting started investigating the world of algorithmic bias."

260,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47755613-scott,4,"If you are looking for a book that will scare you in a similar way to the many who refused to go swimming after watching the movie Jaws, “Hello World: Being Human in the Age of Algorithms” by Hannah Fry is the book you will want to pick up and give it a listen. No, the book is not a piece of horror fiction like that of Steve King. Instead it details a number of actual real-world examples of how computer and mathematical algorithms guide nearly every one of our daily actions. The book is not only well laid out, concise, and eye opening, the narration is skillfully performed by Dr. Fry herself. I’m not usually a fan of an author narrating their own work, but in this case her accent, pace, and inflection really brought the material to life in audio format. As the subtitle suggests, the book covers how simply being a human today makes you one who is continuously tracked, lead, and whose information is often sold to the highest bidder all collected from various algorithms. Hannah Fry is no stranger to mathematical algorithms, she is a well-known British mathematician who can often be found on the Numberphile’s YouTube channel and she has also presented a few TED talks.The author does an exceptional job of educating the listener on both the good and bad aspects of algorithms. Much like any tool, algorithms can be used for their intended purpose, but many algorithms are used in ethical or evil ways. Early on she defines what an algorithm is and why they are important. Next, she provides some high-level examples of a few very useful algorithms and a few not so useful ones. No book covering such as subject matter would leave out the importance of machine learning and the author gives some details on why this type of algorithm is important along with how it differs from procedural algorithms. What I really liked was that she did not stick to only examples that were computer or math based, but we are given a view into how most business sectors today leverage algorithms in one way or another. Sometimes to drive sales, sometimes to guide decisions, and sometimes to get ahead of their competition. The book is not intended to be a doom and gloom piece, yet it truly is a wakeup call for most. I also liked that the book was targeted at the average user, you do not have to understand computers, mathematical formulas or science to enjoy the book. It is written a way that nearly anyone would be able to listen and understand her points. Dr. Fry spends some time diving into data brokers. She explains why they exist, how they survive, and just how powerful they are when it comes to knowing who you are. Imagine one company aggregating all the data from your computer (browser history, searches, social posts) and blend this information with your credit card purchases, loyalty cards, photos, and phone/GPS data. Such a company may just know more about you then you know about yourself. Many say that Google alone by the data collected about your search history knowns more about you than your closest family members. These data broker companies slurp up every bit of data you leave behind and profit by selling it to people wanting to target very specific people. What is even more concerning is that these data brokers are often not bound to regulatory bodies, so what they collect and how they use this information is like the wild west and what is even more worrisome is that there is not much one can do to limit or stop it. We are beginning to see more regulations in both Europe (GDPR) and the United States to require such companies to notify you of how such collected data will be used. As with most people who use “free” services today, they do not take the time or effort to read the End User License Agreements (EULA) which often state that information will be shared with data broker companies. As Dr. Fry points out, we should not be surprised that companies sell this information especially for free services like Facebook and Gmail as they need to profit someway. As the saying goes, “If you do not pay for a product, you are the product.” And after listening to this book, you will wonder what value you should be placing on such important details. Much of the trading between companies and brokers is usually for misuse and abuse then for your or my good. When it comes to data brokers, think of all the crumbs one leaves behind from all the activities in our lives and imagine a large vacuum cleaner coming behind us to collect and assemble them into the loaf which they came. Again, very scary!I did want to say that the book itself does not cover anything new or ground shattering, but it is a part of our lives we often ignore or are ignorant to, and I can say that the author does a great job of waking up the listener to better understand how these algorithms affect and impact our lives ever day. She educates us on what is often referred to as the “creepy line”. It is an artificial line which targeted marketing company may cross at times and when they do, it is perceived as being more creeping then good. As the author says, both sales and marketing desire it to get as close to the creepy line as possible without actually crossing it, and that really is a fine line as most have a different buffer zone. Not only is the information we drop and collect used for marketing, but as the author points out, it can also be used to sway us one way or another via techniques call micro-manipulation. It is a way of influencing and emotionally leveraging data they have collects and use it against us (overtly) to lead us to a conclusion or decision which they desire. As she says in the book, “Data is the new gold” and it will be a standard we will all be measured by in the coming years. What began with supermarket loyalty cards for some has grown into a large government control data profile on the population. It sounds Orwellian in many ways but do some research on the Chinese Sesame Credit systems and you will quickly find out how a volunteer system will become mandatory in due time. Dr. Fry covers situations where algorithms are used in shopping to get you to buy one more item, judicial for sentencing, automotive when we talk about autonomous cars, healthcare for automating the reading of test results, to our money systems (cash, credit, and stocks). As the book unfolds, you quickly see how these algorithms, directly or indirectly, impact one’s life. In the United States, just think of the importance and focus on having a “good credit score” when looking at getting a loan or buying a house. Now apply that same logic (like in China) which one’s ability to receive government services, timely healthcare, etc. are all based on one’s profile. It is not about being worried by the things one does online, but all the information one is willing to give up saving a little on some grocery item. One area where the author spends some time is the issue with most algorithms being either black or white. There is little to no grey areas (as with human judgement or compassion). Also, algorithms are only as good as the people who developed and coded them. There is no such thing as a perfect algorithm. We have issues on two extremes called false negatives and false positives. These both need to be adjusted to cause the least amount of issues within a given system. For example, take breast cancer screening. An algorithm that is set to limit false negatives (telling people they do not have cancer when they do) increases the chance of more false positives (telling a person they have cancer when they do not.) Neither outcome is good, and any algorithm has to take such things in to consideration. She also covers that there is no such thing as a non-bias algorithm. They are only as good as the information being feed in to them. For example, if you feed criminal convection data into a database seeking people that may be considered high-risk, such an algorithm will be bias towards males who are of color from females that are Caucasian. That is only because of the bias of the data feed in I the system. One of the more interesting section for me was her dive into algorithms being used to be creative. Can a computer compose music, write a book, or create art. Many will say yes, and a few will say no. Again, this all comes down to the information fed into the algorithm and what makes something like this creative. A piece of music or poetry and follow specific rules assigned to them but is it really art or simply regurgitating data based on the rule feed into it. I can play a musical piece precisely following the rule of music, yet creativity often comes from how a piece is interpreted and played by the individual. I can speed up notes, lengthen their durations, and give it life and body. Can an algorithm accomplish the same thing? I think it is still being debated. Lastly, the book has a really good summary chapter where the author closes out and covers at a high-level why algorithms matter and why we should care. It was very well done. I can say that this is the first audiobook I have listened too that was narrated by Dr. Fry, and I can say that if she ever wants to give up her day job, she could become a full-time audiobook narrator. Her voice is pleasant to listen too, and a wonderful accent that is not difficult to comprehend, and her pacing of the book was just right. I do not recall any issues with the audio itself, no pops, volume issues, or page turns. The piece was very professionally produced.For parents and younger readers, there were a few places that vulgar language was used in the book. As I recall, it was only used when quoting a source or individual. There are very few places I remember words being used, and I believe the subject matter is important for people to understand. For this reason, I would still recommend it but be aware that there are a few places such language is used. In summary, I know this has been a rather long review so I will not spend too much time on a summary section. If you want to learn more about algorithms and not get lost in the weeds of maths or science, you will find this book very approachable, entertaining, and educating. The examples she gives are relevant to not only today but will greatly impact future generations if this data collection via algorithms is left unchecked. It is well worth the credit and I look forward to future pieces by her."

Dr. Fry covers situations where algorithms are used in shopping to get you to buy one more item, judicial for sentencing, automotive when we talk about autonomous cars, healthcare for automating the reading of test results, to our money systems (cash, credit, and stocks). As the book unfolds, you quickly see how these algorithms, directly or indirectly, impact one’s life. In the United States, just think of the importance and focus on having a “good credit score” when looking at getting a loan or buying a house. Now apply that same logic (like in China) which one’s ability to receive government services, timely healthcare, etc. are all based on one’s profile. It is not about being worried by the things one does online, but all the information one is willing to give up saving a little on some grocery item. One area where the author spends some time is the issue with most algorithms being either black or white. There is little to no grey areas (as with human judgement or compassion). Also, algorithms are only as good as the people who developed and coded them. There is no such thing as a perfect algorithm. We have issues on two extremes called false negatives and false positives. These both need to be adjusted to cause the least amount of issues within a given system. For example, take breast cancer screening. An algorithm that is set to limit false negatives (telling people they do not have cancer when they do) increases the chance of more false positives (telling a person they have cancer when they do not.) Neither outcome is good, and any algorithm has to take such things in to consideration. She also covers that there is no such thing as a non-bias algorithm. They are only as good as the information being feed in to them. For example, if you feed criminal convection data into a database seeking people that may be considered high-risk, such an algorithm will be bias towards males who are of color from females that are Caucasian. That is only because of the bias of the data feed in I the system. One of the more interesting section for me was her dive into algorithms being used to be creative. Can a computer compose music, write a book, or create art. Many will say yes, and a few will say no. Again, this all comes down to the information fed into the algorithm and what makes something like this creative. A piece of music or poetry and follow specific rules assigned to them but is it really art or simply regurgitating data based on the rule feed into it. I can play a musical piece precisely following the rule of music, yet creativity often comes from how a piece is interpreted and played by the individual. I can speed up notes, lengthen their durations, and give it life and body. Can an algorithm accomplish the same thing? I think it is still being debated. Lastly, the book has a really good summary chapter where the author closes out and covers at a high-level why algorithms matter and why we should care. It was very well done. I can say that this is the first audiobook I have listened too that was narrated by Dr. Fry, and I can say that if she ever wants to give up her day job, she could become a full-time audiobook narrator. Her voice is pleasant to listen too, and a wonderful accent that is not difficult to comprehend, and her pacing of the book was just right. I do not recall any issues with the audio itself, no pops, volume issues, or page turns. The piece was very professionally produced.For parents and younger readers, there were a few places that vulgar language was used in the book. As I recall, it was only used when quoting a source or individual. There are very few places I remember words being used, and I believe the subject matter is important for people to understand. For this reason, I would still recommend it but be aware that there are a few places such language is used. In summary, I know this has been a rather long review so I will not spend too much time on a summary section. If you want to learn more about algorithms and not get lost in the weeds of maths or science, you will find this book very approachable, entertaining, and educating. The examples she gives are relevant to not only today but will greatly impact future generations if this data collection via algorithms is left unchecked. It is well worth the credit and I look forward to future pieces by her."

292,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97247921-damian-kozakiewicz,4,"Good introduction to AI and how it might influence our lives in the future. The author brings up some interesting ideas, which are all plausible and comprehensible.The only downside is how often the word algorithm is used. It is literally in every second sentence and after reading this book, I couldn't hear the word algorithm any more without rolling my eyes-"
293,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51553479-carlos-mart-nez-gadea,5,Brilliant approach to algorithms and artificial intelligence. It'll bring up controversial topics that are very alive these days. And will bring as well some positive mindset about it.
294,0393357368,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9799369-freddie,4,Very interesting and balanced. 4 stars rather than 5 as felt like written by a smart A level student rather than high skilled author.
