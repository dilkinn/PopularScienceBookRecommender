It is written like a history book, building essential knowledge on the investigation of key historical figures and moments. I loved how the end of the book became very philosophical. It begins by breaking down the 'God' argument and outlining why belief in God exists. This is a very different critical approach to other writers at the time (not naming any Dawkins). What this book does is show how the highly improbable existence of the universe can naturally lead to the belief in a creator, but then respectfully outlines alternate views, first exploring the multiverse theory and then questioning reality itself. Atom theory enables us to question the reality of what we see and experience around us and makes us question what is existence and what is real. This leads to the exciting conclusion that there is still so much we don't know about reality and there is still so much to learn. Rather than drawing atheistic or religious conclusions, you become intrigued by the journey of learning the human race has been on and the revelations to come through our own curiosity and investigation."

Since the first theories until the future challenges the humanity will have to understand the atom and the Creation itself. The book is nice to follow, and easy to understand, specially all the things related to math and physics. "

Its tale is one riddled with jealousy, rivalry, missed opportunities and moments of genius.Piers Bizony tells the story of the young misfit New Zealander, Ernest Rutherford, who showed that the atom consisted mainly of empty space, a discovery that turned 200 years of classical physics on its head, and the brilliant Dane, Niels Bohr, who made the next great leap into the incredible world of quantum theory.Yet he and a handful of other Young Turks in this revolutionary new science weren't prepared for the shocks that Nature had up her sleeve. At the dawn of the Atomic Age, a dangerous new force was unleashed with terrifying speed ...--------------Piers Bizony is a science journalist and space historian who writes for magazines such as Focus and Wired as well as the Independent. His award-winning book on Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey was described as 'full of sparkling enthusiasm' by the New Scientist and 'excellent, in every way worthy of Kubrick's original precision-crafted vision' by the Evening Standard."

Rutherford was boisterous and has a bellowing voice, while Schrodinger claims his womanizing helps him in his discoveries in quantum mechanics. Or have you ever heard of the epic fights and debates on the Solway conferences, or experiences the tension of the moment during the Manhattan Project where they realized the monstrous power of the atomic bomb? Scientists are also human, science and history go hand-in-hand, and Piers Bizony will bring you into a realm of physics your average physics teacher will not lead you to. "

The book does a nice job illustrating how science is a series of arguments and the role of hunches and assumptions. The instrumental nature of atomic ideas is well documented, but balanced well with the need for empirical evidence. The final chapter, origins of the cosmos, goes a bit beyond the atom, but is interesting. The author illustrates the many personalities behind the science and the story really does read like a drama with accurate science woven in seamlessly. "

Mistakes and rivalries of human beings in the journey of discovery. A compelling read, wonderful knowledge, making you realise how innovative, creative and driven we are as a life-form. Recommended."
