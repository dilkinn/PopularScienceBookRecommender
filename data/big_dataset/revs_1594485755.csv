1,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/248357-lynn-weber,2,"If you're interested in this topic, I'd recommend starting with Martha Stout's The Sociopath Next Door rather than this book. The problem with this one is that it's more ""Follow me as I delve into this crazy world and have surreal experiences"" than it is a study of sociopathy. And that ultimately makes it less gripping. I remember clearly the first section of of Stout's book, as it took the reader on a tour of one man's mind as he faced a simple but telling moment of moral decision-making. It was so suspenseful and kind of harrowing. This is much less profound. Nonetheless, it's a genial read and certainly a good book. "
2,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12772859-mischas,5,"I got lucky so lucky with this book that I still cannot understand it. Sometimes, I read the blurb for a book, reviews from my favourite reviewers, a couple of chapters which are free somewhere and yet the book is a huge disappointment for me. Here? I just saw this book on BookDepository, I loved the title, and I bought it. I had no idea what's this book about, who wrote it, what's the genre. Starting with this book, I immediately enjoyed it. It was not a quick read for me, but every time I read it, the story pulled me inside, several times I missed my stops! I wanted more. I kept wondering how it all connected because it did not seem like it did. Then I recognised a name, and I realised that this book is not a fiction. And suddenly it all made sense how all this connected. And it started to terrify me. It reminded me of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. In the most horrifying way. Where is the line between normal human quirks and a mental disorder? How terrifying that people might be misdiagnosed? How do you prove your sanity?I enjoyed how the author struggled with his knowledge of how to spot psychopaths because he was right if you're not careful, you'll suddenly see them everywhere. “I've always believed society to be a fundamentally rational thing, but what if it isn't? What if it is built on insanity?”What I know is that I won't be reading Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. While I enjoyed the information about it included in this book, how it went from a thin booklet to the monstrosity which now has close to a thousand pages. Because I'm certain it would make me paranoid, and I would feel like everybody around me has some mental disorder. And maybe they do. Perhaps we all do. Or none of us does. “Trying to prove you’re not a psychopath is even harder than trying to prove you’re not mentally ill,’ said Tony.”This is not a good review, I know it, but the book left such an impression that I have a hard time voicing my opinion on it. “If you want to get away with wielding true, malevolent power, be boring.”What I can say is that I enjoyed it. It was nothing I expected. But it is a book which will keep me awake for days and I will be thinking about it for weeks. "
3,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83582-bill-kerwin,4,"A breezy, entertaining journey through the public effects of madness, with particular attention to the impact of the psychopath on society. Ronson is an excellent writer with a fine sense of humor who knows how to tell a good story in plain language. That he is able to do this while making subtle observations about our society shows what a really good writer he is."
4,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655438-courtney-lindwall,4,"I read this in about a 4 hour span, from 12 am - 4 am. It freaked me out and I slept with the lights on. But on with the review. So I've read things about psychopaths previously. How their brains are actually wired differently and they are unable to feel empathy, etcetc. Psychopathy is incurable. Psychopathy, in its violent and sexual strands, is outright fucking terrifying. But Ronson's book talks more about the frequent misdiagnosis of psychopathy. And the misdiagnosis of many other ""mental illnesses"" that may in fact just be trying to label and profit off of various human eccentricities. I thought it was interesting. Especially the inmate Tony who scammed his way into the Mental Hospital hoping for nicer amenities and found himself unable to convince the doctors of his sanity for another 20 years (13 years after his prison sentence was originally intended to be over). That's some real life One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest stuff. When the majority decides that the only thing needed to stamp a lifelong label of ""psychopath"" is a score over 30 on a 20 point behavioral checklist, an incredible danger arises. Misuse and misguided priorities in diagnosis can ruin lives, create madness instead of protect against it. As relatively new fields, I think psychotherapy and the psychiatric world at large are bound to make huge changes in their approach as they learn more and more about the human brain and its relation to behavior. A lot of the disorders seem, to me, very subjective in their conditions. (e.g. one of the characteristics for psychopathy is an 'inflated sense of self worth'....uhm? that's pretty subjective and would probably include the vast majority of my professors) The human brain itself is just such an incredible unknown that I think there needs to be a certain level of trepidation in creating absolutes. For Tony, the ""absolute"" definition of psychopathic tendencies lost him the best 20 years of his life surrounded by rapists and serial killers in a maximum security Hospital. Of course, at the same time, there are definitely strands of human beings who objectively act differently and need to be addressed by society. They respond differently. They do not have the same emotional capacity as the other 99% of the human race. There is some definitive consistency in the way their minds work. There need to be tactics for identification, for prevention against their possible havoc. So basically Ronson's conclusion is that, like with every other thing in this world, there needs to be a balance in the approach. There can't be a mass frenzy to diagnose and label every little idiosyncrasy of human behavior, turning the world into a medicated homogenization scared of every feeling outside of complacent and numb. But at the same time, we can't ignore extreme human behavior, the kind that is debilitating and sometimes even dangerous. Oh wait, back to my review of the actual book. It was decent. Who isn't intrigued by the minds of psychopaths (and the minds of those who study the minds of psychopaths)? I thought his different chapters and stories were a little too disjointed and he trailed off topic a little toward the end. The book didn't have as great of a flow or dynamic as it could've. But overall, pretty interesting and worth a read. "

The Psychopath Test has Ronson's humour, similar style, empathetic point of view, and personal life injected into the story, but this research felt meandering. I thought it'd be clearer, earlier in the novel, how dangerous it can be to misdiagnose people, and how truly nuanced, complicated, and personal each diagnosis should be, but I felt it took to long to get to that angle of this story. A lot of it also didn't feel like a story, it felt like a collection of similar case studies, but honestly a bunch of them could have been cut out and I wouldn't have noticed.Overall this has cemented that I like Ronson's writing and his journalistic storytelling methods, but that this topic, and the scattered structure, wasn't for me.

It reminded me of this book, in which the author, in his quest to uncover psychopaths, visits Al Dunlap. This was a man who actually enjoyed closing down plants and firing people (Scott, Sunbeam). The fact that the share price skyrocketed while he was CEO and fired huge numbers of employees, is really unsettling. Ronson's book is filled with stories about people he meets in the madness industry. He encounters some experts in the field, some scientologists, a criminal labeled as a psychopath, a death squad leader... These encounters were interesting enough to me to enjoy reading this book. I especially liked his encounter with Robert Spitzer, who worked for six years on the DSM III edition (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders).However, it's a lightweight read and not everything he writes in his book fits the title. The author is not an expert, and he makes himself too central to the narrative, which is really sad because I thought he was a bit lame. Not mind-blowing, but a worthwhile read. 7/10"

And in fact our unhappiness and our strangeness, our anxieties and compulsions, those least fashionable aspects of our personalities, are quite often what lead us to do rather interesting things.” Jon Ronson, in preparation of writing this book took a course from a top psychologist on how to spot a Psychopath.

I've always believed society to be a fundamentally rational thing, but what if it isn't? What if it is built on insanity?” I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Jon makes us look twice at the world around us and how we are all defined by our 'maddest edges'...all of our edges are a bit mad. He shows us a look at the 'madness industry' and how one Doctor took the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) from 40ish pages into the 800s. Being normal is a disorder these days.Here is Jon's TED talk on this bookIf you are worried about the above traits, well....“At the end of our conversation she (Martha Stout) turned to address you, the reader. She said if you're beginning to feel worried that you may be a psychopath, if you recognize some of those traits in yourself, if you're feeling a creeping anxiety about it, that means you are not one.”"
10,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin,4,"This is what I might call ""an oddly interesting book"". I say that because in retrospect I'm a bit surprised that it holds the interest so well. Mr. Ronson begins with a strange little mystery concerning running down the source/writer of an (to use the same word) odd book that has been mailed to certain people. From this the book springboards into a look at Psychopathy, its diagnosis and by extension the way in which psychiatric disorders are not only diagnosed but agreed on (that is agreed to exist as disorders).Rambling a bit and full of introspective thoughts by the author (most of which are interesting and entertaining if not always germane) we go through a series of interviews that range from ""Tony"" to Bob Hare who basically formulated the most used Psychopath test. Tony was a young man who has been in Broadmoor for years, sent there after a relatively minor offense. The author was brought there by representatives of the church of Scientology in an attempt to discredit psychiatry in general. Other interviews included Emmanuel Constant, a former Haitian death-squad leader. He also interviewed a corporate hatchet man type exec. who was known for blithely firing people and joyously shutting down plants. There is a lot that's interesting here and the book will (I believe) keep you involved. After looking into how disorders get into (and are pulled out of) DSM-IV-TR, considering the implications of Hare's list (and how it effected the author as he found himself setting out to find and identify ""free range psychopaths) and the attitudes around these he came to an interesting conclusion. That they may be dangerous tools leading to over diagnosis.I suggest you take a look at this, especially if you (like me) have been ""concerned"" about statements like ""1% to 10% of the population may be psychopaths"". While this book may be a bit more disjointed than some of the author's other works...it's well done and interesting."
11,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4426615-jason,3,"I thought this would be a great tool for self-diagnosis, but actually Ronson skitters from one case to another without really making any definitive point. But maybe that’s the point. Psychopathy is probably not an absolute for most people, as there are many among us who exist in some sort of sociopathic gray area (myself included). Me, I scored a 10, so I’m a partial psychopath. (Surprise, surprise!) My downfall? Apparently, I don’t really care too much about other people.Here, take the test!"
12,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1381728-maxwell,2,"This was a bit of a disappointment. I found the first 50% of the book to be a bit forgettable. It was hard for me to see where Ronson was going with each chapter. Though I found the examination of mental illness, especially the stigmas around it and the potential harms of labeling to be really fascinating, the book as a whole lacked direction. When I read So You've Been Publicly Shamed, I felt like each chapter really compounded on one another to create a vivid and interesting picture of shame through the lens of an empathetic viewer. While Ronson maintained that empathy in The Psychopath Test, I felt a bit less invested in the stories he shared and found it harder to connect with his points. However, the last few chapters were awesome. I'm not bummed I listened to this one because Ronson is a wonderful narrator and has a unique perspective in almost everything he does, but it didn't live up to what I'd expected. If you're curious about this topic, I'd recommend listening to this episode of the Criminal Podcast where he talks about psychopathy and even some of the subjects he handles in this book."
13,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"I'm a fan of pop-psych books, so I was primed to enjoy this one. Journalist Jon Ronson was asked to investigate a mysterious, anonymous book that had been sent to numerous academics around the world. As he was following up on leads, he developed a theory that whoever sent it was somehow mentally ill — a crackpot, to use his term.During his investigation, Ronson heard the term psychopath and learned about a test designed by Robert Hare to rate someone's level of psychopathy. Hare described psychopaths as ""predators who use charm, manipulation, intimidation, sex and violence to control others and to satisfy their own selfish needs. Lacking in conscience and empathy, they take what they want and do as they please, violating social norms and expectations without guilt or remorse. What is missing, in other words, are the very qualities that allow a human being to live in social harmony.""Hare's test assesses a person on 20 different personality traits, including their superficial charm, grandiose sense of self-worth, need for stimulation, pathological lying, lack of remorse, lack of empathy, parasitic lifestyle, early behavior problems, etc. Ronson became obsessed by this psychopath checklist and decided to interview some criminals, taking inventory of their antisocial behaviors. As the subtitle says, Ronson took quite a journey through the madness industry, interviewing a variety of psychologists, psychiatrists, researchers and even conspiracy theorists. He also talked to Scientologists, who are famously anti-psychiatry. The book is filled with interesting anecdotes and stories, and I was fascinated by all of it. I especially liked the discussions about the damage that psychopaths can do, both in prisons and in society. Researchers have noted that about 1 percent of the non-prison population would be classified as psychopaths, but a higher percentage of them are business and political leaders — industries that have a lot of power. In prison, about 25 percent of the inmates are psychopaths, but they have been found to cause more than 60 percent of the violent crime there.Readers who want a straightforward book on the history of psychopathy will be disappointed; instead, the story meanders, based on whoever Ronson was interviewing that day. Ronson is witty and clever and has a pleasant writing style. I picked up this book after seeing him interviewed on several talk shows, and I am curious to look up his other works. I would recommend this to anyone interested in psychology.Favorite Quotes""I remembered those psychologists who said psychopaths made the world go around. They meant it: society was, they claimed, an expression of that particular sort of madness. Suddenly, madness was everywhere, and I was determined to learn about the impact it had on the way society evolves. I've always believed society to be a fundamentally rational thing, but what if it isn't? What if it is built on insanity?""[Robert Hare said he was interested in researching the levels of psychopathy not just in prisons, but also in the finance industry] ""Serial killers ruin families ... Corporate and political and religious psychopaths ruin economies. They ruin societies.""""Psychopaths don't change ... They don't learn from punishment. The best you can hope for is that they'll eventually get too old and lazy to be bothered to offend. And they can seem impressive. Charismatic. People are dazzled. So, yeah, the real trouble starts when one makes it big in mainstream society."""
14,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,2,"This book is quite lame, to put it simply. I watched The Men Who Stare at Goats, which was pretty damn funny, and I thought I’d read a book by Ronson. This book neither has much to say, nor is it that entertaining. It starts off with a bizarre (and unrelated to psycopathy) “mystery” that Ronson is called upon to solve. During the unfolding of that dull “mystery” Jonson hears about the true meaning of psychopath and goes off to understand and investigate it. If you’re like Ronson and don’t know the technical definition of psychopath, this book may be mildly informative. But you can read one of Robert Hare’s books for that. Even the pop-psych The Sociopath Next Door is better than this book. I can’t stand it when someone writes a book just to tell us how he went and studied something and learned about it. Like, who cares? I can read the original books on the subject and I don’t need to hear your story. But I guess if you’re Jon Ronson you can do that. You can decide to do a “research” on psychopathy and travel between Europe and America and meet with Robert Hare and then a few known or suspected psychopaths, and then write a lousy book about it and sell it to people so that you can pay for your next “research.”"
15,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3122452-nancy,5,"It is self explanatory that this review will make me enemies. Fortunately, those who know me are really the only ones at risk. Like many people, I took my first psychology class in high school and my interest was piqued. My second psychology class was during college, as was my third and fourth. I then diverged into the world of sociology which fascinated me and graduated from Utah State University with a bachelor's degree in sociology. Yay for me! Like the hundreds of psychology graduates, I was now qualified to do one of three things 1) move onto graduate school, 2) sell clothes at a department store or 3) get married and forget all about my career aspirations. Naturally, I sold clothes at JCPenney for one full year before I wanted to slit my wrists - not for suicidal ideation but simply to break up the monotony of my incredibly meaningless life. The following school year, I was admitted to a graduate program in psychology at Brigham Young University. The following two years were full-time classes, year round then two practicums and, at last, an internship with a couple of classes in the evening. It was intense, enjoyable, and I graduated with a career plan and, frankly, a head far too big to fit through the doors. I had textbook answers and an excellent mentor who had been a pioneer in educational psychology with 30 years of private practice, running troubled youth homes, and teaching at various universities. Most people called him Dr. LaPray. I called him ""Daddy."" May I also mention how grateful I am to the certified borderline personalities who required long-term care. You are directly responsible for my dad being able to pay my tuition.The best two classes I took during graduate school was how to administer and read the MMPI and the study of the diagnostic bible, the DSM III-R. I studiously purchased the very expensive book in the bookstore, took it home and read it cover to cover. By the end of the weekend, I had self-diagnosed myself with 19 serious disorders. Fortunately, class began the following Monday and the professor put the diagnoses into perspective. I have also married a social worker since then and he repeats this mantra: Many of us exhibit some of the characteristics found in the DSM. The concern is when the behavior become extreme and dictates our lives, sabotaging our ability to work or interact with others.Unfortunately, 22 years later, I am still convinced of my own neurosis and anxiety. Ah, well. It's nice to know and embrace the real me.So what does this have to do with Jon Ronson? Jon and I really do share a debilitating bout of anxiety. My method of understanding it was to study the crap out of it then dedicate the past 21 years to pursuing a career in helping. Also, Jon is brilliantly hilarious. Like me. If I were to be clinical, I'd guess that Mr. Ronson is overcompensating for his anxiety disorder by being brilliantly hilarious. Like me. But then maybe I am simply projecting.Seriously, though, Mr. Ronson took a circuitous route to rooting out the therapeutic approaches in the 60's and 70's which were completely true and bizarre then went to interview a man who had created a psychopath test named Dr. Hare who empowered all who took his workshop by providing a checklist for spotting a psychopath. He met with murderers in prison wards, cold-hearted CEO's and power-controlling concierge. All psychopaths, of course. Until a friend pointed out that he was using it as a weapon rather than a diagnostic tool. This was a circular story as it led us back to a patient held at Broadmoor, a high security insane asylum for the incurable where one patient pretended to be a psychopath in order to avoid prison. Now he can't get out.Speaking of diagnostic checklists, Mr. Ronson then explores the etiology of the DSM. My testimony of the DSM is now shaken and I'm starting to rethink my habit of taking the pocket size with me to church so I can secretly diagnose congregation members. I understood the reciprical relationship DSM has with not only insurance companies but also drug companies. Also, every revision adds more disorders that circle closer and closer to normal behavior. The explosion of autistic diagnoses has a lot more to do with including aspergers on the spectrum than the MMR vaccination and has solidified my belief the one truism -Normal is a setting on your washing machine.Completely fascinating read and surprisingly funny. My husband kept asking me what I was laughing about. The joke and delivery was so complicated (but easy to spot and understand), it would have been impossible to explain. I just gave him the book when I was finished. Really enjoyable read."
16,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/934928-dan,3,"An entertaining romp and with a fair bit of food for thought. I liked this book, while at the same time being disappointed with it.My main problem with the work was that I had heard that this book dealt extensively with the idea of psychopaths as possessing traits that tended to land them in positions of power. This is a fascinating topic, is of personal interest to me, and is a concept well-worth a full-length journalistic book. Unfortunately, this is not that book. A clever agent is selling this book as an investigation into this topic, but Ronson does little more than flirt with this idea in a couple of places throughout the work. In fact, the writing style is often jumpy enough that it could be argued that it is difficult to pin down exactly what the book was about. But my synopsis would be that the work is 'a philosophical approach on the nature of human personality and its' tendency to lie along maddeningly-difficult-to-classify continuums.'Of course, my synopsis would sell many less books.That said, the book is entertaining and engaging. Like ""Being or Nothingness"", or the ""DSM-IV"" (both heavily featured in this book), it leads the reader towards Narcissistic thoughts on how much of various psychotic/abnormal character traits they possess. (Or how much said characteristics apply to co-workers and in-laws.) It does challenge the reader to think about where they draw their own lines of inclusiveness and exclusiveness with regard to understanding/sympathizing with alternative personality traits and tastes.I still couldn't shake a feeling that the book was a little hollow. The characters that Ronson was interviewing seemed to do the real 'work' in the book. I was often far more engaged when hearing directly about Tony, the psychiatric patient, or the powerful CEO with the predator statue collection than I was when left to hear Ronson's meta-analysis of their interaction. The 'filler' material occasionally seemed too unfocused or vague - possibly because Ronson decided to pull an interesting, although unconventional, two-timing trick halfway through the book: suddenly changing sides in the discussion. "
17,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4262996-kate-woods-walker,2,"The subtitle, “a Journey Through the Madness Industry,” should have tipped me off. This was to be a self-consciously iconoclastic, too-cutesy look at psychiatry.I am a fan of Jon Ronson, but less so after this book. I enjoyed Them. I thought the sly Ronson did a stellar job of bringing the horror of U.S. torture at Abu Ghraib to public consciousness in The Men Who Stare at Goats. But I now realize I was making excuses for his irritating, postmodern, bemused style. He's too intent on inserting himself into the narrative as the innocent yet all-knowing Wise Child. When I read the Goats book, I rationalized his use of the gimmicky, humorous voice, thinking the importance of the subject excused the breezy tone. Not so much here. Here it just became sneering and cruel, and to what purpose I cannot say.Ronson seems to mock the mentally ill, sympathize with incarcerated psychopaths, undermine the work of researchers and, ultimately, make no point whatsoever with this book. From a totally unnecessary story about a mysterious book to the deceptive title (there's no test, per se, there is only a checklist easily available to anyone who can Google), The Psychopath Test isn't even a good introduction to the subject of psychopathy.Oh, he quotes the right sources: Hervey Cleckley, Robert Hare, Martha Stout, to name a few. But his determination to present himself as irreverent also means he gives respectful voice to anti-psychiatry cranks and to the psychopaths themselves. Anyone not personally victimized by one of these monsters could easily be fooled into thinking they are not dangerous, just misunderstood. And that would truly be evil."

What starts as a light-hearted investigation into a set of books sent to academics around the world, proceeds to be an investigation into aspects of the mental disease industry. What is a psychopath? How is medication for mental diseases used? Each chapter is a different story about an aspect of how mental disease has been treated in the past and currently. There are stories that will make you wonder, stories to make you laugh and stories that will chill you to the bone.I listened to this on audiobook read by the author. Robson has a distinctive voice, something like Julian Clary, and it does take a few minutes to get used to. But in the long-term I found his voice soothing and his reading of his own work is natural, flowing and humorous. He knows where to emphasise for humour and emotional effect.I have never heard of Ronson before. I saw this book mentioned by a favourite science author, Brian Clegg, and chose it based upon his thumbs up. I am glad I did. It was a special listen that can be likened to other authors and documentary makers like Louis Theroux, Mary Roach and Will Storr. It is a journalistic look at the mental illness system, written to provoke thought and to entertain. I mention this sometimes these types of books are criticised that they are not a serious and valid piece of research to draw conclusions from. These types of books and documentaries never are - they play a different role. I enjoyed this thoroughly for its humour, the fascinating stories and Ronson's perspective. Highly recommended for fans of Mary Roach and Will Storr."

In The Psychopath Test, Ronson explores the labels we give some of the most dangerous members of society, the roughly 1% of the population who are psychopaths, sociopaths, or have antisocial personality disorder (apparently these all describe the same thing). Where do those labels come from? Who gets to write the book on mental disorders (the DSM)? How do we protect potential victims from the actions of psychopaths? Can they be rehabilitated? Do we ever overstep our bounds in enforcement? What does psychopathy look like in the business world? Can you be just a little bit psychopathic? And of course, most interesting to the reader: how do you identify a psychopath? Ronson addresses these questions without offering definitive answers, but provides plenty of food for thought, all offered with candor and humor. His delivery is great, so I recommend the audio book as well."
20,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,5,".This review contains spoilersThis is an hilarious book by a wonderful writer. He injects himself into the story in a way not dissimilar to Bill Bryson. It had me bellowing with laughter – laughing at him, with him and at the strange and startling anecdotes that unfurled themselves one after another as the book went on. This book is a glorious example of truth being stranger than fiction…Okay, so that is one aspect of the story. The other aspect is that he dealt with some important issues. In this book he was investigating insanity, and the ways in which we try and describe it and deal with it in our society. Beneath his rather pick and mix approach he covered a lot of ground. Here are some of the snips that I picked up from reading the book.*As we well know, journalists often seek mad or neurotic people, on the grounds they make for exciting reading and viewing. In the book Ronson interviews someone who used to work for a reality television show. She admitted that when they interviewed potential subjects for the programme they would ask them what medication they were on. No medication meant they were too sane. Medication for schizophrenia or bi-polar disorder was a bit too serious. Prozac and meds on that sort of level were perfect, and a good criteria for inviting people onto the show.* Diagnoses of mental illnesses have increased greatly in recent years, much to the joy of pharmaceutical companies. This can perhaps most easily be seen in the increased diagnosis of ADHD, Childhood bi-polar disorder (which didn’t exist at all as a diagnosis a few years ago), and autism/Asperger’s Syndrome. For instance Ronson says that when he was a child, less than one in two thousand children was diagnosed with autism - now the diagnosis is greater than one in a hundred.*There is also a great increase in the number of different diagnoses. The DSM (the standard psychiatric textbook of checklists for diagnosing mental illnesses), used to be 65 pages long. In 1980 it came out at 494 pages. Whilst many people are concerned about the medicalization of previously unlisted syndromes, Ronson is partly sympathetic to the increase, stressing that they are usually very extreme manifestations of perhaps ordinary-sounding problems. On the other hand he notes that the biggest built up new diagnoses is on the edges of normality, or what most would consider normal behaviours.*The standard checklist for psychopaths, used by psychiatrists was designed by a Canadian called Bob Hare in 1990. http://www.minddisorders.com/Flu-Inv/...He also runs courses to teach people how to use his checklist, and he is concerned that some people – professional people - are very inadequate in the way that they use it.*In the UK people diagnosed as psychopaths used to be let back out into the community after serving their prison sentences – the law said only patients with mental disorders that could be treated could be detained beyond their prison sentences, and psychopaths were considered untreatable, and were therefore set free. Then in 1996 Lin Russell and her daughter Megan were murdered by a known psychopath called Michael Stone. As a result of this, in the same year as the murders, a series of ‘Dangerous and Severe Personality Units' were opened, basically to house psychopaths, four for men and one for women.”The official line was that these were places to treat psychopaths (with cognitive behavioural therapy and anti-libidinous drugs – chemical castrations – for the sexual ones), to teach them how to manage their psychopathy with a view to one day theoretically sending them back out into the world as a safe and productive people. But the widespread theory was the whole thing was in fact a scheme to keep psychopaths locked up for life”.*Many would argue that it is likely that a few of our most successful businessmen are psychopaths, or that others show psychopathic traits. Ronson uses Al Dunlap as a study, a businessman with a history of callous firing of his employees, as someone who might possibly fit this profile.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_J...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This book was a great read. I read it in two sessions, finding it almost impossible to put it down. It's funny and serious, and filled with stories that will make your eyeballs throb (in a nice way). I am now a keen Jon Ronson fan, and cannot wait to read his other books. Highly recommended."
21,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44309339-chris-p,4,"This was a quite different book than I thought it would be when I first discovered it. Jon Ronson doesn't seem to follow the conventions of writing a study. In fact, it's non-fiction but definitely reads like fiction.Many thoughts passed through my head as I was reading it but what I found more disturbing was the realization that, more or less, people are turning into psychopaths. Let me explain. Here is the Hare PCL-R Checklist which is used to decide whether an individual is a psychopath.
Item 1: Glibness/superficial charmItem 2: Grandiose sense of self-worthItem 3: Need for stimulation/proneness to boredomItem 4: Pathological lying Item 5: Conning/manipulativeItem 6: Lack of remorse or guiltItem 7: Shallow affectItem 8: Callous/lack of empathyItem 9: Parasitic lifestyleItem 10: Poor behavioral controlsItem 11: Promiscuous sexual behaviorItem 12: Early behavior problemsItem 13: Lack of realistic long-term goalsItem 14: ImpulsivityItem 15: IrresponsibilityItem 16: Failure to accept responsibility for own actionsItem 17: Many short-term marital relationshipsItem 18: Juvenile delinquencyItem 19: Revocation of conditional releaseItem 20: Criminal versatility
Now, society promotes a certain self-centered style, with everything revolving around how good-looking one should be, how talented and how succesful and of course how much money one makes in order to be able to buy more and more... stuff. One of the teenagers' favorite pastime activities is taking self-ies and posting them online in order to get ""likes"" and thus gain a certain respectability among their ""friends"" in order to feel good. Meanwhile, the sense of responsibility toward the others and the common welfare is ignored. In fact, most virtues seem to be sacrificed in the name of egotism. Additionally, we are so much exposed to death through cinema and the media, that it takes a lot for one to be shocked nowadays. Horror films have become so graphic, that the image of a gutted person can hardly make us twitch anymore. A serious result of all this (and possibly many more) is the fact that we can watch thousands of people dying of hunger and poverty (not to mention the immigrants getting drowned in the sea while trying to get away from a war sponsored and encouraged by the ""civilized"" west) from the comfort of our living rooms and simply shake our heads before switching to the news about beyonce's latest appearance. Of course, when there's a terrorist attack in the US or France we are all in grief and show our sympathy by putting flags on our facebook accounts. What I'm trying to say is that people are being taught to be self-absorbed and completely lacking empathy. That is why we can continue our parasitic lifestyle and not care about the misery that exists right next to our fancy shops and about what our economy does to certain, less priviledged parts of the world. While there are far more conditions that need to be fulfilled for one to be called a psychopath, the modern human model that's being promoted has a few upsetting characteristics. Food for thought, that's all.All the above derived from my personal process of what I read in Ronson's book and that's what I liked most about it: the fact that it lets the readers make their own conclusions. It's in no way patronizing. Although the title may imply that it's a book about psychopaths, it actually concerns a lot of aspects of human psychology and how psychiatrists approach certain issues, while the writing style remains witty and gripping at all times without trying to support or go against anything and anyone. All conclusions is for the reader to make.Very interesting read."
22,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1836077-lightreads,4,"A book about psychopaths that I actually liked, minor miracle, and that made me think a lot about compassion.Okay, qualifications – the book is more about “the madness industry” – the complex of media and medicine and science and big pharma and fucking weirdness that informs our understanding of people who are mad. It’s a wandering book, tracking Ronson’s haphazard introduction to psychopathy, to spotting psychopaths, and then onto a survey of madness criminal, madness florid and newsworthy, madness very sad. It’s about the stigma and sexiness of madness – Ronson is wondering on a meta level, as a journalist, why some people’s madness is culturally fascinating and others’ is repulsive. He manages to talk about the utterly crap job psychiatry does at diagnostics and some of the fringiest of the fringe elements of conspiracy theory with the same inquisitive interest. It’s a really great book; I think the one major point Ronson missed was failing to really dig in to the validity of our diagnostic categorizations. He wonders how many people are “mad” by virtue of being too difficult, too inconveniently odd, but misses the deeper point that socioeconomics and race play an enormous and terrifying role in diagnostic categorization.Anyway, who talks about books in book reviews anymore?One of my favorite moments here was when Ronson, becoming a little alarmed and disenchanted by the power of the diagnostician, says to someone that it sounds like he’s talking about these people – psychopaths – like they aren’t human. His interlocutor doesn’t really know how to answer that, because it’s absolutely true.And yes. Yes yes yes, this is what it is like. Psychiatric professionals, true crime authors, journalists, cop shows – they talk about psychopaths like they are animals, and often like they should be put down. And when someone gets uncomfortable with this, the response is usually something like, “well, but he doesn’t have any compassion for you.” Because psychopaths don’t, generally – that’s pretty much the definition, right? Inability to connect, inability to learn from adverse stimuli – an inability to learn social norms more bluntly, a lack of understanding of others’s pain, sometimes enjoyment of it.And I just . . . that’s not my definition of compassion. It doesn’t exist just for the object. I could get into all the humanist and philosophical reasons, but I imagine someone smarter has done this better (I’m pretty sure there’s an entire subgenre of European postwar writing on this). My point is even woo-wooier.I know that Ashley X cannot appreciate or understand my compassion for her and the terrible thing that was done to her, but I’ve spent years giving it while respected academics explain in the New York Times why I shouldn’t, why she wasn’t wronged at all because the rules don’t apply to her. She’s different. She’s less than human – it’s not even subtext for some people in this argument. Compassion can be transgressive, and it can definitely be a political act.And I have a crazy theory that sometime in the next few hundred years, our treatment of criminals is going to become one of those society-redefining arguments. Our justice system is a travesty of racial and economic oppression, a massive financial drain, and largely ineffective. We punish like no one’s business, and funny thing, it doesn’t really work. Just makes people feel good. And at the same time we’re just barely beginning to muck about in the sort of neuro-fiddling science that might, one day, let us, you know, actually have a corrections system. (And won’t that be a whole new and scary can of worms). And sometime in the next few centuries these things are going to collide, and we’re going to have one hell of a cultural paroxysm about, well. About how we have no compassion for those with no compassion.At least I really hope so."
23,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4643325-paul,3,"Reads very easily and is well written in a journalistic sort of way. Ronson meanders through the mental health industry in a rather idiosyncratic way. The basis of the book concerns the psychopath checklist developed by Hare and Ronson manages to get himself invited into various high secuity institutions to talk to various inmates. His wanderings extend to a brief look at diagnosis of bi-polar in childhood and some thoughts on the medication industry. The growth of the DSM system is explained and the rise of labelling almost everything from mild irritation to an offbeat way of looking at the world as a psychiatric disorder. I think Ronson has produced an interesting account of his experiences, with perhaps a little too much of himself in it. However, for me there is a big but. There is nothing here about the social construction of madness, which would question an empirical-behaviourist approach. To reduce psychopathy to a chemical reaction (or not) in the brain is limiting; although I did appreciate the idea that real madness is at the top of large corproations and banking. A dose of Szasz's ideas at this point would be helpful; he questioned the whole basis of psychiatry and the madness industry. Szasz argued that no behaviour or misbehaviour could be classified as a disease and cited the idea that women who did not conform or bend to men's will were labelled as hysterics. Szasz saw psychiatrists as modern day priests and psychiatry as a modern religion. He is not alone in questioning the mental health edifice; Foucault and Goffman did likewise. This more radical type of questioning was not present in Ronson's book; but I enjoyed it for what it was; I would just have liked a deeper analysis"
24,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2027950-justin,4,"I've never read anything by Jon Ronson so I wasn't sure what to expect. I heard an interview with him about this book and was fascinated by the subject matter. I was not disappointed, this book is extremely interesting. I like Ronson's style a great deal, and his writing is very approachable. I came to respect him a lot for his ability to acknowledge his weaknesses and then go forward despite them.Ronson has a great ability in communicating his perspective to the reader. He is very clear about his own biases and often accounts for them through out the novel. It was refreshing to have an author admit that he was he was becoming overzealous with his knowledge of psychopaths. Secretly diagnosing everyone around him, often incorrectly.The overall message to the book is a little unclear. The only message I got from it is that the world is full of crazy people, who cannot help how they are, they cannot be ""fixed"", and they have a huge impact on our society. Not exactly mind shattering, but it's the ""cannot be fixed"" part I think Ronson struggles with the most through out his journey.This is a must read for anyone interested in Psychology. If you are like me and have general fascination with the odd and the unusual, you will like this a great deal. This as a nice break from my usual regimen of Fantasy. "
25,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/833538-rhi,3,"Strap in tightly, there's a scientology rant in here! Wheeee!Anybody who knows a marginal amount about sociopaths/psychopathy would be right in thinking it is dangerous, and can be, an evil condition. This book is not so much about that. Sure, it is Ronson's 'journey' through the madness industry, but that includes a dally with scientologists, a brief glimpse into the world of diagnosing/medicating bi-polar children and a tale of reality TV hell.He throws around a lot of big wig psychopathy names. He even had drinks on several occasions with Bob Hare himself! But I was mistaken in believing this was going to be a research based book, looking into the idea of how many of our businesses/governments/Really Important People are, in fact, psychopathic. What you get instead, is an almost jovial romp through one random experience after another, all narrated in the semi-humorous, semi-deadpan voice of Ronson.I will admit to getting three thirds of the way through this book, and wondering where the hell it was going. Where did all these strings connect? What was the overall point going to be?!And then he made it. And I felt a little disappointed to say the least. But before I get to that, let’s talk about how it does in fact raise some very interesting questions, and how it also doesn’t raise enough.The idea of psychopathy being diagnosed based on a 20 point list is perhaps the most interesting question. You see, as long as you get 30 points or more out of 40, you are officially a psychopath. Ronson went on a course taught by Bob Hare himself in order to learn how to ‘spot a psycho’. However, what I find to be the most terrifying aspect of psychopathy, the lack of empathy, or of any ability in fact to feel ‘normal’ human emotion, may in fact be one of the 10 points missing from any given psychopath’s overall score. This begs the question, should all psychopath’s be treated the same, if they all tick a variety of boxes?An even more interesting question that Ronson didn’t touch on, is what leads some psychopath’s to be violent, aggressive, evil people? And what leads others to be CEO’s of big companies? This is where I thought this book was leading, but this is not where it went at all.Perhaps my biggest issue with the book was his dangerous lack of research into scientology. Or perhaps it was just a fear of what the litigious nature of scientologists would do to him if he did, in fact, write about them in any more detail. You see, he made points about how they are indeed a little crazy, and how they may be making a valid point about anti-psychiatry but taking it too far. But what he failed to acknowledge in any way, is that scientology is arguably run by one of the most well protected psychopaths out there. How can any ‘religious’ (and let me make clear that, yes, those quotes are there for a reason. Scientology is as much a religion as the Avon lady trying to sell you her wares is) group claiming to be against something so vehemently, also be led by someone badly in need of some anti-psychotic councelling/medication?  These  three articles do a brilliant job of detailing some of the issues surrounding the cult, and they explain in much more detail about the three defectors that Ronson moved over very quickly.Where it ended up was a vague conclusion about how maybe we shouldn’t label people based on their psychopathic criteria, maybe we should base them on their human criteria. Which also brought in a whole side story about how mental illnesses are being diagnosed far too easily and far too young, in some cases. (It would seem from Ronson’s narrative this mostly takes place in America. But who knows, it was a vague side story that only interviewed one mother with 2 diagnosed and medicated bi-polar children, and felt like it was there just for Ronson to point out how bad that mother was for not being able to cope with her children.)Did it feel like he was sympathising with psychopaths? Kinda, yeah. Did it feel like he had really got to the crux of what is possible if you are a psychopath? Not really, no. But at the same time, it still made me wonder about the humanity of some psychopaths. If one feels no emotion as we know it, no empathy or conscience, where is the humanity in that? Can someone be human if they experience no humanity? And how do you cope with that? These are questions that weren’t really answered. But questions I’m hoping other books on this topic might.It’s a really easy read. Even with my issues with it I would recommend it, I passed it onto my mother as soon as I had finished it and she too finished it in less than a day."
26,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4146551-kelli,4,"I just love Jon Ronson! I adore his unique approach of curiosity blended with what comes across as a genuine sense of kindness and empathy, almost an innate desire to understand and uncover, but in the best possible way. Listening to him read his book, particularly his interviews and personal thoughts, was highly entertaining. In terms of content, it was odd and interesting. 4 stars"
27,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/121445-n,2,"The non-fiction genre can basically be divided into two groups: mediocre books by experts; well-written books by non-experts. I’d normally err on the side of wanting to read the latter kind of book, because who the hell wants to endure shitty prose? However, non-experts writing about a highly complicated subject matter is not without its pitfalls.Imagine, say, a journalist wandering into a woman’s home, observing her kids for a few minutes and drawing the conclusion that they’ve been wrongly diagnosed as bipolar. The journalist – someone completely outside the medical profession – effectively accuses the mother of being a hysterical who can’t discipline her kids and so pumps them full of drugs instead.That’s what Jon Ronson does in The Psychopath Test.I mean, maybe Ronson is right and these kids aren’t bipolar, but since he has a BA in Media Studies (not a doctorate in Psychology), his opinion is worth about as much as that of my pet goldfish.It’s not that The Psychopath Test isn’t diverting fare. It’s funny in places and there’s none of the turgid prose you might expect from an academic. But there’s really no there there.Ronson boasts the book’s lack of structure proudly. This was a journey he took, whimsically bouncing from subject to subject (and from country to country), but unfortunately the end result is just a mess. It’s not really about psychopaths, because Ronson wanders off that subject into the aforementioned bipolar stuff, by way of some conspiracy theory tosh that he lifted from his previous book, and yet another rehash of Paul Britton’s undoing.Shouldn’t journalists be searching for the truth?Ronson just seems like he’s searching for the next thing he can spin into a witty book in order to earn his next paycheck."
28,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"The rate of psychopathy in the general population is 1%; among corporate executives it’s more like 4–5%. Although the statistics aren’t there (it’s considered bad practice to diagnose mental disorders from a distance), it and narcissistic personality disorder are likely higher among political leaders, too. Glance through Bob Hare’s 20-point Hare PCL-R Checklist for psychopaths and you’ll have no doubt that the current POTUS meets the requirements – everything from pathological lying and promiscuous sexual behavior to failure to accept responsibility for one’s own actions. Psychopaths are charismatic so fool people into liking them, but they have no fear of punishment and don’t change or learn from their mistakes.This is my second book by Ronson, after So You've Been Publicly Shamed. He writes fun and incredibly readable books about madcap journeys he’s made to meet out-of-the-ordinary people. Here he draws a distinction between people who are just crazy enough to be interesting and those who cross the line into being dangerous. Sending academics a cryptic self-published book? Claiming to be the Messiah? Innocuous, even amusing. Firing thousands of employees? Ending up in the Dangerous and Severe Personality Disorder Unit of a prison? Not so harmless.Ronson also meets Scientologists who mistrust psychiatry and the head of a Haitian death squad. This is a bit of a scattered read in that it hops between case studies that don’t seem related, but it remains compelling throughout – I read over 150 pages in one day, and I plan to pass it on to a friend who doesn’t read but is fascinated by psychology. I reckon even a non-reader will stay engaged by Ronson’s nerdy/blokey writing; after that I might try my friend out on Dave Gorman and A.J. Jacobs."
29,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote,4,"Jon Ronson goes on a mental illness odyssey in his book, The Psychopath Test, which takes in some extraordinary people and facts, and is, by turns, a funny and serious read in alternating chapters. As always, Ronson packs a ton of enjoyably kooky characters into his books. Like the Scandinavian translator sending out mysterious manuscripts to people that pertain to something only his mind knows. Also, ""Tony"" the Broadmoor inmate who faked mental illness because he was told he would have an easier time inside if he were in a mental hospital instead of prison - except now he can't leave! The Scientologists are involved in Tony's case and are campaigning for his release. With “Tony”’s case, we get an insight into why Scientologists dislike psychiatrists so much. We’re introduced to David Shayler, an ex-MI5 agent turned conspiracy theorist, who became notorious for suggesting 9/11 was faked and that missiles with holograms to make them look like planes were fired at the World Trade Center. He’s also in turn a cross dresser and believes he is the messiah returned. The main narrative is Ronson's investigation into the idea that most CEOs and world leaders are in fact psychopaths, but I felt Ronson didn't investigate this enough. He does write a lot about Al Dunlap, a CEO of an American toaster company called Sunbeam, and while the case for Dunlap is sometimes convincing, I felt that this wasn't enough for his thesis and that he should have investigated further (there are no interviews with world leaders or other CEOs). The more serious side to this book gives it a stronger purpose. Like Ronson looking how a formerly reputable criminal psychologist who made a suspect fit the evidence in a rape/murder only for it to be later discovered that the suspect was entirely innocent. Also profiled is a psychologist who came up with a label for every type of behaviour which contributed to numerous misdiagnoses, specifically in children with illnesses like bipolar disorder, and how the current climate of over-analysing previously acceptable behaviour as dangerous can lead to over-medicating children, in some cases fatally. Ronson's meandering writing style is similar to his previous books which I didn't mind as it was still thoroughly readable but can obviously be annoying for some readers looking for more structure. He can take complicated cases, such as the mistaken identity of the rape/murder or the psychopath LSD experiments of the ‘60s, and make them understandable to a wider audience who aren't familiar with the circumstances. There’s plenty to enjoy in The Psychopath Test as Ronson goes from gentle but eccentric personalities to more dangerous ones to some quite scary ones and one genuinely confusing one - I was enthralled every step of the way. Jon Ronson has written another fantastic and highly enjoyable book showcasing some very real problems with our modern world and the compelling eccentrics that populate it."
30,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,4,"Ok, first of all, I have to admit I have a soft spot in my heart for the pop-psy. That being said, I really enjoyed this well-rounded take on psychopathy; from the use of labels to the tests to determine if a person is one. He did not take a position and try to convince us, except as a story technique, but that was also done as a full circle. Very good writing for what it is. I loved the same style turned on scientologists and their crusade against psychiatry, the psychopharmacology industry, and the creators of the DSM III through IV (although I would have loved him to take on V as well).He's the same writer of The Men Who Stare At Goats, which I thought was a very funny movie, and I'll have to read that book now. I've become a fan of the author. :)"

“Suddenly, madness was everywhere, and I was determined to learn about the impact it had on the way society evolves. I've always believed society to be a fundamentally rational thing, but what if it isn't? What if it is built on insanity?”

 The book was engaging, I enjoyed reading it, however I couldn't help being a little disappointed. While Ronson makes a few good points and raises some good questions, I was hoping the book would go deeper into the world of psychopaths, instead it was mainly focused on his journey of researching the topic. However, I can't hold this too hard against the book as Jon Ronson is an investigative journalist, not a mental health care specialist."
32,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7022024-mike,4,"For a book about psychopaths this was a surprisingly light(ish, come on, we're still talking about psychopaths here) read. The author is a journalist and it covers a wide range of the topic from interviewing a few (suspected) psychopaths, to speaking with psychiatrists who are involved in psychopathy and the classification there of, to scientologists, to neurologists who examined the brains of normal people and psychopaths. It is a fast read of a book that I think does a good job being honest and truth seeking.The psychopath test in this book, called Hare Psychopathy Checklist presents a set of characteristics a person can be graded on. Score too high and you just might be a psychopath. Once the author had learned of this test and taken a seminar about it he started to see it both in his own behavior and others, annotating his interactions with others with various qualities on the test. Instead of narrowly focusing on just psychopaths (and mostly avoiding the lurid details of the more famous/horrifying ones) Ronson presents the reader with a broad, if shallow, survey of the field. He also does an excellent job of linking together different parts of the history of psychology and how those events impact the modern world (such as the explosion of psychological disorder classifications, the massive expansion of pharmaceuticals to ""treat"" these conditions, and how the entertainment industry, especially reality TV, benefits from just the right amount of madness). I found his writing style very accessible and the presentation of the interviews and facts well conveyed without becoming too dry or boring.The animating force behind the book was a weird event where a bunch of scientists from all over the world get a strange, cryptic book. They banded to together over the internet to try and figure it out but were flummoxed. One of the scientists in question contacted Ronson to help and he eventually tracked down the person he thought was responsible. Turns out it likely wasn't some genius mystery maker but likely a slightly off kilter Swede. But Ronson was intrigued by how much this solitary person caused the world to change and wondered how much of the state of the world was due to psychopaths. While he doesn't answer the question (many others, including folks he interviewed, have delved into this) he does write about how psychopathy did appear to be more prevalent in business circles. Given how much havoc financial decisions can make (shutting down manufacturing plants, crashing the economy, putting profits before people, etc.). All in all a fast and interesting read, but not one for people looking for a deeper understanding of psychopathy. I devoured it in the course of an intercontinental (unless you are one of those people who think the Americas are just one continent) and was found the experience both entertaining and enlightening."
33,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76697789-ryan-krueger,5,"** The Psychopath Test by Jon Robson is an informative non-fiction book. The book was written with intent to inform readers about the abundance of psychopaths in our world and how they impact our daily lives. The author is a journalist who has traveled the world to meet with professors, scientists, psychologists and more to find information on this subject to create a strong basis for the book. Ronson makes plenty of flights around the globe to meet with researchers as well as psychopaths themselves. His main point in this is to display how psychopaths are common in our lives whether it be the workplace or interacting with someone who seems in an everyday environment. The work discusses psychopaths lack of emotions such as fear or remorse and how that can lead some people to be at the top of the business chain. Due to them not having remorse they can be willing to fire half of their staff in one day with no regards to how it may affect their lives, while the boss’s mind is only focused on financial gains. A quote in the book goes, “Serial killers ruin families, corporate and political and religious psychopaths ruin economies. They ruin societies.”This is a very interesting book in my opinion as I have always had an interest in the wiring of people’s brains. The details included and quoted from psychopaths that he interviewed were intriguing as they would say stuff along the lines of them wanting to kill to see what blood looks like or what the insides of someone else looks like. The book raises issues on how psychopaths can ruin families, societies, and economies. It covers a wide range of topics and goes into detail on each area including how psychopaths can affect these issues. I agree with everything in this book except that the words psychopath and sociopath can be used interchangeably. After looking into this I’ve found various sources as well as teachers who stated that psychopaths are born the way they are and it’s genetics, while sociopaths are born through traumatic experiences and have capabilities of feeling remorse as well as developing relationships or bonds with others. This book answered a lot of questions I have had. There are two people in my life who I always wondered why they act the way they do but I realized that they are most likely a psychopath. However, it made me realize how easy it can be to target someone as a psychopath due to the bob hare psychopath test and how normal actions can be misinterpreted into a biased stance. As someone who has an interest in helping soldiers suffering from PTSD this relates to my personal agenda due to me having the possibility of preventing someone from becoming a sociopath. "

36,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,4,"While Jon Ronson reveals a great deal about his own neuroses in this book, he casts little light on the psychopaths he is allegedly researching, though he does give some interesting insights into the ""madness industry"" of psychologists who have studied, categorized, labeled, and tried to treat psychopaths, mostly without success.Ronson begins with a strange introduction to the field of psychology and mental illness thanks to a group of Scientologists, who chose him to ""expose"" the evils of psychology. Scientologists believe that all mental disorders are because of engrams accumulated from past lives or space aliens or some shit like that. L. Ron Hubbard had a particular hatred of psychologists. Ronson spends a little time discussing the peculiarities of Scientology, but this book is primarily about psychopaths and what makes them tick... and what makes the people who study them tick.After reading The Psychopath Test, it is not hard to believe that you have to be a little bit crazy to study crazy people. (Look out for those Abnormal Psychology majors...) From the arbitrariness of what goes into the DSM (did you know that far more copies are sold to interested non-academics/non-practitioners than to mental health professionals?) to the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, a diagnostic tool that's become a quick and dirty way to label someone a psychopath, to the Rosenhan Experiment, the history of psychology is filled with enough self-reinforcing bumbling and egomania to make one think the Scientologists may have a point.While Ronson's book is a collection of interesting anecdotes and observations, digressing into the overmedication of children, misdiagnoses of autism, and the brutality of capitalist devotion to ""shareholder value,"" between interviews with ex-death squad leaders and allegedly psychopathic CEO Al Dunlap, it's a bit weak in its critique of science, and sheds little light on his subjects.Martha Stout's book The Sociopath Next Door was more illuminating. Ronson does, however, give a bit of a glimpse into the mind of a sociopath in a way that Stout only addressed abstractly: how do sociopaths/psychopaths (there is no technical difference between them) see themselves? Do they recognize that they are ""broken""? Do they ever want to be cured, and can they be? (Short answer: no.)Ronson's interview with Al Dunlap was particularly interesting, as he actually confronted Dunlap with the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, and the allegations that Dunlap, according to this tool, scored high on the psychopathy scale. Dunlap proceeded to point out that every behavior presented as evidence of being a psychopath could also be interpreted as someone who has a forceful and driven personality who gets things done. True enough, there is a lot of evidence that psychopathy is an asset in positions of power, like boardrooms.Ronson is able to see how some of his subjects ape normal human reactions and manipulate people the way they'd handle a TV remote control, but others, like Al Dunlap, are more ambiguous. Is Dunlap really a psychopath, or just a merciless asshole? As both Stout and Ronson point out, even genuine psychopaths are rarely serial killers; most live law-abiding, respectable lives, though never out of any actual respect for the law or society.An interesting if somewhat meandering trip into the perilous world of diagnosing psychopaths, The Psychopath Test is not exactly a weighty, heavily-researched book, but it will be of interest to anyone who has an, ahem, clinical interest in psychopaths."
37,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14084605-pink,4,"A real thought provoker. What is a psychopath? Are you a psychopath? How about your friends or co-workers? This book will leave you diagnosing everyone you know and becoming all powerful with your new amazing psychopath detection skills, just like Jon Ronson. The book really made me think about how mental illness is defined. Sure there are clear cut cases of insanity and sanity, but there's a huge area in the middle, with a range of diagnoses that are possible to be made and indeed are being sweepingly made and medicated for across the world. Quite apart from the issues of psychopath detection and detention, there were some interesting stories. A wide range of people were interviewed for his research and I was fascinated by several of their lives, whether they were the professionals, or the patients. This was my first Jon Ronson book and I haven't read any of his journalistic material so his style of writing is all new to me. I appreciated the humour and details about himself that were included, which broke up some pretty heavy content at times. I also liked how the book came full circle and re-visited the people at the beginning of his journey, which gave closure to their own stories. Much recommended and I can't wait to read more of his books now! "
38,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37830213-zuky-the-bookbum,5,Final rating: 4.5This was a really fun and intriguing read! I love Ronson's writing and journalistic style.
39,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4529669-willow,4,"Jon Ronson is a hoot. It would be great to have lunch with him. He puts so much of himself into his writing, bringing up his own little insecurities and observations, pretty much showing that he’ll be happy to go anywhere or do anything provided there’s a good story. This book is all over the place following Jon around and he brings up different case studies after another. In fact, I’m not sure they had that much in common with each other except that Jon decided they were worth investigating. This ‘all over the place’ is the book’s weakness and the reason I knocked a star. You see, I’m not sure Jon really proved his point. That doesn’t mean it wasn’t informative and entertaining. I definitely learned a lot about the psychopath test, which is here by the way: http://thinkcreatedesign.wordpress.co...Some of the provocative ideas this book brings up is that psychopaths may actually have a brain abnormality that has to do with their amygdale. They don’t feel the full range of emotions like most people. This makes them fearless, lacking in empathy and they gravitate toward positions of power because they are missing regular emotional stimulation. There could be one psychopath in every hundred people. Jon even jokes that he started seeing psychopaths everywhere once he acquired his new psychopath spotting skills. Obviously he’s not the only one with psychopath spotting skills. One of the reviews on GR even suggested that pretty much everybody in the GOP is a psychopath, posting pictures. Judging by the seriousness of her review, and the lack of seriousness in Jon’s book, I can’t help but think that she ignored the last quarter of the book. That’s because by the end, Jon is rethinking what he’s learned about psychopaths and the psychopath test, suggesting that nothing is cut and dried, and scoring high on a test shouldn’t get you locked away forever. He takes a look at criminal profilers and some of their serious blunders (something crime shows rarely show on TV). If the police are convinced you are the culprit, or a doctor wants to slap a diagnosis on you, they will find a way, because that’s what they want to find. Both the media, the pharmaceutical companies, and the public want to promote mental illness for different reasons. Categorizing is something humans love to do. We look for order in a chaotic world. It’s comforting. And sometimes when people are trying to fit someone in a personality box, we ignore all the things that make them not fit there. Psychology is not an exact science I’ve read that The Society for the Scientific Study of Psychopathy (SSSP) published a statement regarding this book stating that certain interviews in it were exaggerated or fictionalised and that they ""think that Ronson’s book trivializes a serious personality disorder and its measurement, which is not helpful to those who have the disorder or to their unfortunate victims"".This statement made me laugh, because I don’t think this book was ever meant to be a deep serious study of psychopaths. It’s more about Jon investigating them, and coming up with different conclusions. He’s a thoughtful writer and I enjoyed reading his observations. I think this book raises more questions than it answers. I love that. "
40,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1016626-tim-pendry,3,"This book is being promoted as 'comic'. Sadly, it is not. It is quite a sad read. I laughed once out loud and smiled twice but only in the first chapter. If you end this book laughing, you have not ‘got it’. You should leave it a little angry and troubled.Ronson exhibits all the graces and the flaws of modern British journalism. It is an easy read. The man is self-questioning (though clearly not too deeply lest he cease to function) and he is honest. But he is also skimming the surface of issues that require a far tougher and better book than this.Perhaps he is being cleverer than I think. Perhaps his periodic questioning of the way his profession turns reality into narratives, into modern folk tales, will create a suspicion in the public's mind about how it receives information, how its mental world is structured. I think not.The book is about the phenomenon of the psychopath which operates at so many levels as part of our cultural self-definition. As a species, we tend to need a scapegoat for structural ills that derive from our own nature - so, why not the 'psychopath' in our culture.Perhaps 1% of the population is 'psychopathic' in the sense of presenting a reasonable danger to others under certain conditions. Perhaps another 5% have traits that could be dangerous under yet other more extreme conditions. I suspect 88% are just a danger to themselves as ‘normals’.Political fear (I speak as a radical empath who is in the 'other' 6%, potentially equally dangerous to society for completely different reasons) seems to be determining that media headlines must ensure that 'psychopaths' are defined for incarceration by their nature rather than by their deeds.Yet, as Charlie Chaplin’s M. Verdoux so eloquently put it in the film of that name, it is not the single psychopath whose default mode is tolerance for enormous crimes against humanity but the vast ‘normal’ mass who vote, work and play without much of a thought in their little minds.Ronson opens the door to such subversive thinking but he only peeks in. The psychopath in Broadmoor is judged fit for release and we know it is a gamble. The corporate boss targeted as a psychopath turns out to be depressingly conventional in his private life. So far, so ‘normal’.But Scientologists prove to be champions of human rights and psychiatrists appear to be at forefront of new sociologies of population control, aided by pharmaceuticals interests who turn any mild abnormality from a genetic variant of possible evolutionary value into a diagnosed disease.Some of the most ethically filthy conduct in the book, leading to suicide and death in their victims, come from ‘normals’, the same sort of ‘normal’ who obeys an order in a war or who thinks corporate career progression is a substitute for personal responsibility.The book deserves better than its jokey style. Perhaps the jokey style will build more understanding amongst the general population and that is its justification. Unfortunately, it will probably just flow off most ‘normal’s backs like that of the proverbial duck.So let us try the analysis here that Ronson seems nervous of attempting – that hoary old business, no doubt, in his case, of just being a reporter, just telling a story.First, as he rightly points out, there really are very dangerous persons which we have termed psychopaths but which are simply at one genetic and personality end of our human Bell Curve. They are not monsters, they are human. They are simply accentuations of aspects of our normal selves.Society needs protection but it also needs to recognize, in different ecological circumstances, that they may be more important to us than ourselves in the future of our own species. We have to hope we hang on to civilization long enough to ensure that they are never needed.Second, these dangerous ones are there but they are rare. We cannot build our entire social structure around protecting ourselves from what amounts to a force of nature any more than we should be degenerating as a free and questioning culture because of a few terrorists.Faced with nature, sometimes bad things happen. They will continue to happen. ‘The bomber will always get through’. This is what we are as humans. It is dreadful for the victim but these cases are still rare and we should concentrate on a society that polices itself and is not policed.What is happening is that the existence of the genuine psychopath and the genuine terrorist is being used by the authoritarian bureaucrat to introduce ever-increasing controls on our movement, conduct and language (aspirationally, on our minds) in an attempt to manage the unmanageable.Without the ‘noble lie’ of a religion, with no Pope to serve Constantine, the bureaucrats are turning to definitional analysis and what they like to call science but which is no more scientific than was Lysenko under Stalin. If this book does one service, it is to cast doubt on the more radical scientific credentials of psychology.Over the last two decades, the psychologists and social scientists have found themselves riding on a lucrative gravy train medicalising ‘misbehaviour’ and unhappiness and offering cures based on chemicals and incarceration. The sick are becoming overwhelmed by the worried and the inconvenient.These new priests of the mind are now busy perpetrating the lie of there being no free will (a spurious philosophical conclusion from consciousness studies by people who could usefully spend some time reading the great existentialists) and the even worse lie of a beneficent normality.It was men in white coats who murdered the physically abnormal in euthanasia programmes under national-socialism. It is now men in white coats who are engaged in soul murder against the mentally different. There are throw-away stories in the book of how gays and feminists could lobby successfully to ensure that certain psychological definitions were abandoned. Either science is science or it is not. Scientific decision-making in physics would not allow the peer review to include a lobbyist.‘Conditions’ that have no politically powerful lobbies against them also have many commercial and family interests seeking their establishment. But we have to keep our feet on the ground. If social science and psychology are socio-political tools, there are still things to be cured or managed.There are people seriously suffering pain (yet the system still refuses to let psychiatrists test low dosage levels of psychedelics for depression and trauma). There is certainly work to be done on re-engineering society for relief from anxiety and self empowerment.What is grossly unacceptable is to allow social or family order requirements to permit collusion between drug companies, a morally degenerate professional class and the state or parents in the use of drugs for social control of behaviours that are merely inconvenient or embarrassing.We live in monstrous times. This book, to its credit, opens the door on the monsters – psychopathic and professional alike. We have a choice to go through the door and see what our society has become or shut it and pretend it is not happening. So, my regret about this well-written, entertaining and thought-provoking book is that Ronson limits himself to anecdotes and questions. ‘Normals’ will pick this up, be entertained and go back to being ‘normal’ again. ‘Normal’ people are the shills for the men in white coats and grey suits. What we really need now are writers who show people that just being ‘normal’ (and certainly being ‘normalised’) is damned dangerous to them and to their kids’ future and that ‘normal’ now means little more than manageable and controllable. Ronson merely skims the surface of this story."
41,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara,5,"I couldn't imagine that a book about psychopaths would be so good! Ronson interviews lots of people including people in institutions for the criminally insane, Scientologists, psychiatrists and conspiracy theorists. Ronson also has a very engaging narrating style. We all encounter psychopaths, and sometimes it takes time for us to realize the person has a personality disorder. They may be work colleagues, neighbors, and other people we interact with. It has helped me at times to realize that someone's behavior fits the parameters of psychopathy. Of course, Ronson also explores cases where individuals have been institutionalized for years or even a lifetime without adequate evidence that they continue to be a threat to others. I recommend this to anyone interested in the topic of psychopathic behavior but don't want a technical treatment for the subject."
42,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"Entertaining and a surprisingly breezy read, The Psychopath Test is a somewhat rambling and ultimately non-conclusive record of an investigative journey into the mental health industry, conspiracy theories and scientology. The author meets some very interesting people -- about whom you can form your own conclusions: I was never exactly happy about Bob Hare.I enjoyed reading it, but oddly I'm not sure I can recommend it. Looking back at it, there's not much substance, and isn't as hilariously funny as the blurb and reviews on the back would have you believe -- then again, I don't think it was a waste of time either."
43,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62761616-imane,4,"This was an enjoyable read. In addition to defining and describing the traits of psychopathy, the author raises some questions regarding the sanity of the industry of psychiatry .Overall it was informative, funny and sometimes disturbing; reading about the brutal murders was not my favorite part but if you are looking for ways to spot a psychopath then this book is the one. "
44,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5487874-g,3,"3.5/5Less of ""a journey through the madness industry"" and more of a random romp. Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable one. The Psychopath Test didn't bring me any greater clarity on the subject. Instead, it gave me more to think about. And, frankly, I'm not not mad about that. I'd actually like to read more of Jon Ronson's work."
45,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,4,"4.5 starsJon Ronson is one of those writers - like David Sedaris - whose voice you hear as you read his words; the soft, slightly effete, often uncertain lilt of his sounding in the reader's inner ear. This is one of the things that makes him such an engaging writer, along with his style of placing himself (and his neuroses, which are particularly apposite in this context) directly in view, a method which rather than obscuring his subjects illuminates them, by giving us such an upfront view. The very subjectivity of Ronson's journalistic style allows us to see the complexity of the tale with clarity.In this book Ronson stitches together, as usual, stories that illuminate a single theme - initially tied loosely but bound tighter and tighter as the book progresses. The chapters each involve a way in which we view madness, starting with his own rather off-hand description of an interviewee as a ""psychopath"" and his involvement in an entirely unrelated mystery (which is ultimately used to bookend the volume) which then spirals off from his increasing fascination with the diagnosis of mental disorders following delving into the DSM-IV (and subsequent self diagnosis of a dozen disorders). We meet a patient at Broadmoor high security psychiatric hospital, committed following an insanity plea when on trial for GBH and a subsequent diagnosis as a psychopath, a history of that disorder and its diagnosis and treatment, and then on to a gallery of cases involving both people Ronson has interviewed (psychologists, psychiatrists, a former Haitian paramilitary leader, a corporate CEO famous for his glee in downsizing for fun and profit, former MI5 agent David Shayler) and others whose lives have been changed by direct or indirect contact either those who may have psychiatric disorders or with the madness industry tat has grown around them.The connecting thread is this; that over recent decades we have become increasingly fond of defining behaviours that lay on the spectrum of human personality as 'disorders', using methods which may or may not be scientific and may or may not be accurate. There is plenty of questioning of those methods in this book, but the criticism is largely leveled at those people and organisations that are too ready to use these blunt tools for their own ends - whether it is the pharmaceutical industry and their ever increasing push to medicate human difference or the Metropolitan Police entrapping a neat suspect in a murder case despite a complete lack of evidence, while possibly allowing the actual killer the freedom to kill again.Ronson is sometimes described as a humorist (as does Will Self in his Guardian review quoted on the blurb) but I think this is entirely misleading. Ronson is and always has been a journalist, albeit one who uses his wit and humour to allow us insights to the things about which he writes, a technique which is also effective when he drops it to highlight the sad or horrific - the town of Shubuta, Mississippi, devastated when the local toaster factory was closed to increase the manufacturing company's share price, the murders committed by actual violent psychopaths, the deaths and harm caused by the 'reality' TV industry when they have focused on a distorted view of what is not 'normal'. And, unlike much journalism, this does not attempt to give definite answers; the threads Ronson has drawn together are tied neatly enough to make sense but with enough frayed, trailing lines to leave the reader pondering long after closing the book."
46,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,4,"So Jon Ronson, the man who brought the theory that the world is run by extraterrestrial lizard people to the world's attention, turns his worried gaze to psychopaths. He wrote something like a deeply ambivalent travelogue of his time writing this book. We meet death squad leaders and CEOs who love firing people. We meet a man wrongly picked by a criminal profiler as a brutal killer and we meet Scientologists. We meet the man who helped get homosexuality out of the DSM as a psychiatric condition and we meet a guy who tried nude LSD-assisted psychotherapy for criminal psychopaths. We meet a man who believes no one blew themselves up in subway cars in London one July day and we meet a woman on one of those subway cars. And what do we learn? I’m not sure. That psychiatry started using check lists to standardize diagnoses and the pharmacologization of psychiatry followed, yes. That now in three days, you too can diagnose psychopaths with a handy dandy 40 question check list, yes. But those are headlines, not books. That psychopaths are both like, and unlike, extraterrestrial lizard people, maybe. I quite enjoyed this book. I’m struggling to find something useful to say about it. As foreshadowed above, ambivalent travelogue is the best I’ve come up with. I thought at first the thesis was that psychopaths are everywhere, disproportionately in positions of power, and how they use that power destroys the world. Bob Hare, the man who developed the psychopath test itself, told Ronson he regretted doing so much of his work in prisons instead of on the stock exchange. When Ronson protested that serial killers were worse than psychopathic stock brokers, Hare said:‘“Serial killers ruin families.’ Bob shrugged. ‘Corporate and political and religious psychopaths ruin economies. They ruin societies.’	“This – Bob was saying – was the straightforward solution to the greatest mystery of all: why is the world so unfair? Why all that savage economic injustice, those brutal wars, the everyday corporate cruelty? The answer: psychopaths. The part of the brain that doesn’t function right. . . . . We aren’t all good people just trying to do good. Some of us are psychopaths. And psychopaths are to blame for this brutal, misshapen society. They’re the jagged rocks thrown into the still pond.” (112)And that moved me deeply. But Ronson doesn’t develop that thesis. Instead, he travelogues his earnest conversations with marginal nutball after marginal nutball, takes a brief foray into how the modern psychiatric profession became what it is today, then returns us to a secure psychiatric facility to watch a man committed for years after faking madness be released. Maybe there’s nothing more to be said on that. The idea that psychopaths drive the action on the world stage may be just too depressing to stare at for too long, even if you do have a BBC film crew with you. It was a good book. Well worth reading. I have the nagging feeling there was a better one inchoate in the source material, but I’m dead certain Ronson did better than I would have writing it. "
47,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3397530-lea,4,"I am a huuuuuge Jon Ronson fan, so it's no surprise that I enjoyed this book too. The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry lives up to its title -- Ronson really does take the reader on a journey through the ""madness industry"". The book opens with a bit of a mystery concerning an unusual book that was mailed to various academics throughout the world. At first it doesn't seem to fit the theme of the book, but Ronson ties it in eventually. His typical style is to jump around between subjects, finding common themes, and this book is no different -- we meet an incarcerated psychopath (who may not, in fact, be a psychopath at all), learn about the methods of diagnosing psychopathy, investigate current psychological diagnoses (especially those in children), and see another possible psychopath's positive spin on those ""negative"" traits. The book also looks at Scientology's war on psychiatry, the experimental psychiatric treatments of the 1970s, and criminal profiling. The author covers a lot of ground here, but it's a very fast read. There are several parts that are unsettling -- some crime descriptions, the kafka-esque plight of those stuck in a psychiatric catch-22, a child's accidental overdose of psychiatric medication -- although that could be more indicative of my sensitivity than anythng else.As usual, Ronson explores his own feelings and anxieties as well. Some readers may find this annoying, although his fans most likely won't -- I enjoy those parts of his books!All in all, I really enjoyed this book, and I would recommend it, especially if you've read and liked his previous books."
48,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948275-josh,3,"Let me begin by saying that the title is deceiving. While it does go into the subject of psychopaths and eventually ends with it, there are many points at which I felt like Ronson's main objective was the critique the overall approach to mental disorders that this country (and other researchers from other countries around the world) have taken over the years. We've gotten ourselves into the habit of classifying every little oddity in our personalities as something strange and unwanted, rather than looking at people as individuals with individualistic tendencies -- and this is especially true when it comes to differences of the mind and its inner workings. So, the fact that I was reading this book as a way into psychopaths and psychopaths alone left me with a unsavory taste once I started to realize that there was much more going on here that I wasn't prepared for. Which isn't to say that I disliked any of what was in the book. There are some very interesting (and entertaining) takes on issues such as Scientology, childhood psychiatry, and even conspiracy theorists. However, that's not what the title of the book leads you to believe the book is about. And I call that false advertisement. And no matter how entertaining this book ended up being (and it was -- Ronson tells a story here, with a plot and everything, rather than reporting like a journalist), no matter how drawn in I was into the story he created, the fact still remains that I don't feel like I learned nearly enough about psychopaths as I should have from a book titled, ""The Psychopath Test."""

Listened to the audiobook read by the author himself, and was hooked after only a few minutes; then when Ronson started talking about Douglas Hofstadter and Scientologists I had to think ""I am so lucky to be listening to this book!"" I learned about how the original DSM was created - how arbitrary all those diagnoses are - and that's (can I say:) depressing. I should write a thoughtful review but I am pressed for time, so I will quote Laura Miller at Salon: [Ronson is] not afraid to play the feckless neurotic for laughs, but that doesn't obscure the serious questions raise by his investigations. Psychiatric diagnoses (and, these days, the medications that follow) really can become fads, with certain experts suddenly deciding that multiple personality disorder or childhood bipolar disorder are far more common that ever before suspected. Ronson even finds the occasion for a little professional soul-searching; he accuses himself and other journalists of being the Goldilocks of craziness, seeking out people to write about who are just nuts enough to be colorful but not so disturbed that they're downright sad."
51,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4845040-gregory,5,"Mr. Ronson puts forth ideas, scenarios, and real life observations in a easily read format. He writes so fluently that reading this book is like breathing. I just started it yesternight and about a 1/3 of the way through, he also highlights certain aspects of the study of the mind in relation to its historcal perspective(s).Although the subject/topics are a bit challenging, if you think you may be interested in this book, It is well worth your time. Also, I think his paradigm exposes/shows us concepts perhaps that may have permeated some of our current and past leaders in all walks of life. Something to consider and think about.My hats off to Mr. Ronson, Great job.This is an excellent book and it is excellently written. I believe I will read it again very soon just to see what I missed: even dispite the topic difficulty.It really gives you a great deal to think about, and seems related to Brightsided, in terms of some modern moras."

Lots of oddballs emerge.Ronson's got a funny style, and apparently a real knack for tracking down the world's screwballs. Very interesting and enjoyable.Also uncomfortable at times, especially when the reader starts considering the psychopath checklist in terms of himself or his friends."
53,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina,2,"This is actually a 1.5 stars book. Meh. The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson has absolutely nothing of interest to say. It's been on my ""to read"" shelf for a while so when I impulsively bought it one day while sitting bored in a doctor's office, I couldn't remember why I had wanted to read it, just that I did. Why can't I learn my lesson about impulsive book-buying? It rarely turns out well. Ronson starts the book by recounting the Mystery of the Mysterious Book. An expensively produced, attractive hard bound book was sent to various academics around the world and none of them can figure out why they received the book or what its purpose is. The sender is unknown, but the books were sent from Sweden. Ronson is recruited to solve the mystery. Along the way, he gets interested in the idea of mental illness and psychopaths and also begins pursing the idea of what it means to be diagnosed as a psychopath and how they are diagnosed. Ronson interviews various psychologists in the field, including Robert Hare, creator of the PCL-R (the Hare Checklist for psychopathology). Ronson also talks with people who doubt the accuracy of the PCL-R (Scientologists...ha ha ha ha), discusses his own neuroses and anxieties, muses on the tendency of psychologists these days to over-analyze, abuses the exclamation mark and makes a lot of lame jokes. This is an idiotic book. I would not recommend it to anyone who is interested in psychopathology and either has a good layperson's understanding of psychopathology or is a professional in the field of psychology (unless that person wants a good laugh). Some of the books Ronson lists as research sources I've already read (plus Harvey Cleckley's Mask of Sanity which Ronson mentions but didn't read) so I already knew more about psychopathology than the author; this revelation did not make me happy. When Ronson begins to explore the subject, he has only the vaguest (Hollywood-influenced) idea of psychopaths and who does he turn to first? Why, Scientologists of course. I mean, if I wanted an understanding of any topic in the field of psychology, I would automatically turn to a group of nutbars who believe in aliens but think psychology is nonsense. A group within Scientologists called the CCHR (Citizens Commission on Human Rights) have made it their mission to ""prove to the world that psychiatrists are wicked and must be stopped"" (28). Ronson is impressed by their record of exposing some very bad psychiatrists...well, yes, they did expose some bad ones, but the examples that Ronson provides (provided to him by the CCHR) are fairly obvious quacks (or mentally ill individuals) who were in the field for reasons other than to honestly practice the profession. Eventually Ronson decides that talking to actual psychologists instead of Scientologists is a good idea. I got fairly disgusted early on when a Scientologist took him to Broadmoor (insane asylum in England) to meet a psychopath (Tony) who isn't really a psychopath--he just pretended to be one so he could avoid prison. Once in Broadmoor, surprise surprise, Tony is diagnosed as a psychopath. Ronson listens to Tony's story of woe without (seemingly) a critical thought in his head. Because at this point Ronson still hasn't done any research about psychopaths, he is completely taken in by Tony's story and believes he is wrongly incarcerated. It's not until later when he talks with Tony's doctor does he have a more informed view of Tony and why he is at Broadmoor. This whole book irritates me because I can't decide if Ronson is really such an idiot or if he possesses some sly sense of humor I can't perceive. When Ronson finally gets to Robert Hare and his pathology checklist, I'm again annoyed. He walks around with the checklist and interviews people whose behavior suggests psychopathology (most notable: Al Dunlap, former CEO--and destroyer--of the Sunbeam Corporation and Emmanuel ""Toto"" Constant, leader of the paramilitary group FRAPH in Haiti). Ronson mentally checks off each psychopath characteristic (Item 6: Lack of Remorse or Guilt, Item 7: Shallow Affect) he thinks they display as he interviews them. With Dunlap, Ronson goes straight through the list and directly asks him about each item. Ronson describes himself as feeling powerful because he has this secret knowledge and can identify psychopaths. What Ronson (willfully?) forgets (ignores?) is that it's not enough to say, yeah, this person seems to not have empathy or sympathy, but an interviewee also has to determine to what degree this person doesn't have sympathy. Maybe some things do bother him and others don't. I understand that at least one of Ronson's objectives of the book is to say, hey, it's way too easy to diagnose someone with a mental illness by going through a list. Well, yeah. This is not a revelation. The fact that Ronson thinks this state of affairs within the psychology/psychiatry field is shocking is, in itself, shocking. What field doesn't have its instances of abuse and misuse? He has a chapter discussing how children are diagnosed with bipolar disorders and then prescribed drugs to treat this (as many psychologists think) imaginary children's condition. It's apparently the latest fad. Parents with kids who are moody or restless or high-energy and don't have the time to deal with them get their children diagnosed with something (for a while ADHD was huge; maybe it still is) and doped up. Parents aren't necessarily to blame; there are the professionals who misdiagnose and the pharmaceutical industry eager to make money any way it can. Many factors create and exacerbate the abuse of Hare's PCL-R and the way anyone is misdiagnosed and over-medicated. The Psychopath Test is generally a mess of a book. There's no clear thesis/objective for the book. What exactly is Ronson investigating? What is he trying to prove? His discussion of the PCL-R is thrown off track by the chapter detailing how the DSM is created (a rather haphazard and unscientific process if Ronson's information is correct) and the misdiagnosis of children. If Ronson wanted to explore the abuses of psychology and psychiatry (combined with the shady connection between psychiatrists and the pharmaceutical industry), then why didn't he do that? This book is merely a glib commentary on several topics combined with the author's (non-humorous) observations of his own anxieties and neuroses. Although I did not like how he approached the topic nor how he wrote it, I am still interested in reading (if not buying) Ronson's other books. It's clear that Ronson was out of his depth with this subject. "
54,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22440207-agn,4,"WHAT IS IT ABOUT?In his book “The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry,” a bestselling journalist Jon Ronson, propelled by a mysterious hoax played on the world’s leading scientists, dives into the world of madness to explore just how mad we really are. During his two-year journey, Ronson not only interviews a bunch of madmen as well as several influential psychologists, psychiatrists and anti-psychiatric Scientologists but also practices his newly gained skill of using Hare Psychopathy Checklist to spot psychopaths. Unexpectedly and quite disturbingly, the author discovers the society’s drive for the ‘right amount’ of insanity, and often detrimental tendency to define individuals by their maddest edges.THUMBS UP:1) Intriguing introduction.The first chapter of “The Psychopath Test” is THE BEST (mysterious, suspenseful and utterly captivating) introductory chapter I have ever read in a non-fiction book. The opening story is so bizarre it can be easily turned into a book itself.2) Well researched, skillfully written.Ronson’s style is quite humorous and engaging, making his non-fiction very readable and not in the least dry. Also, the author put quite some time and effort into researching and interviewing, which allowed him to explore the madness industry from multiple perspectives, which in turn enables the readers to form their own opinions on the matter. COULD BE BETTER:1) Not what I expected.I guess it’s not really the author’s fault, but I was expecting this book to be more about psychopaths and less about everything else. Instead, at least half of the book has little to do with psychopathy as the author probes multiple issues related to general insanity. It works this way as well, but I was hoping for an in-depth exploration of the psychopath’s mind and thus was a tiny bit disappointed.2) Fragmented and seemingly directionless.While I was reading “The Psychopath Test,” I felt rather confused as if the story has been patched together from several seemingly unrelated parts: at first the book seemed like a really engaging mystery, then it became psychopath-oriented, but soon enough the chapters became quite independent, loosely connected by the general madness theme. Honestly, up until the final chapters I wasn’t sure where the story was going. Although at the very end the author’s intentions became more or less clear, Ronson could have done a better job guiding the reader throughout the whole book.VERDICT: 4 out of 5Although “The Psychopath Test” might seem a little fragmented and directionless, it is nonetheless a very entertaining non-fiction that carries an important message."
55,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7232207-fiona,3,"I had a run-in with a psychopath once. I definitely came out worse from that encounter.But that's the thing that I just can't get my head around: once upon a time, I met a bona fide psychopath and in hindsight it was really, really noticeable! But if, according to Jon Ronson and his sources, psychopaths make up a little less than 1% of the population, where are all the rest of them? Are one in ten Londoners psychopathic? (Apparently they head for big cities.) Are prisons disproportionately full of them? I mean, I imagine so, but even that wouldn't account for the fact that I've identifiably met considerably fewer of them than I would expect to. Where've I been? Mostly (in my adult life) legal academia, the construction industry, and musical theatre. Hardly hotbeds of the empathetic.So something is a bit off, and I think Jon Ronson also knows this: his book is not just called Psychopaths, but The Psychopath Test - it's also partly about diagnosis of mental health problems. It's really engaging, and Ronson is a great writer, but it's hardly in depth. He's got a really light touch, skipping from prison populations to business management, to the writing of DSM-III, to the potential for misdiagnosis of childhood ADHD. This is a 250-page book! I feel like the book poses more questions than it answers, mainly because there's not enough time, and Ronson has no apparent inclination, to go into anything in any depth. He's just spotted something shiny and moved on.So what do I want to know about psychopaths? Well, what I'm missing, for a start. I don't believe that nearly one in a hundred people on this earth are incurably heinous, robot-hearted monsters with no souls and an aptitude on the London Stock Exchange. So is the percentage smaller, or does psychopathy actually mean something different to that? Is it possible to have all these traits and still have a meaningful life, loving relationships and friendships, and do some good in the world? I'm sure it must be; coming out of this book, I saw no indication of it. Have a bit of optimism, Jon! The world's not completely up the creek. It can't be as totally hopeless as you make it out to be. Which means - what aren't you telling me?"
56,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526809-donna,4,"Saw the interview on 'John Stewart', then ordered it like a cubic zirconia tennis bracelet from The Shopping Channel. I got a slow start with it. The Kindle app formatting is kinda shitty. stray lines. Typos. I kept asking myself whether anybody checked it out beforehand. Then again, maybe they wanted it to look that way. Once I got used to this clash of esthetics, I found it a great deal of fun. Wha? A book about psychopathy fun? He doesn't just seek out the usual suspects. He talks to Bob Hare who came up with the oft used checklist to spot it. I was worried at first, that Ronson would turn out to be one of tthose 'it all comes back to me' sorts of interviewers, but he asked many of the questions I would have liked to ask. He doesn't give the impression of being thorough, but he is. So he talked with Bob Hare, which resulted in his seeing psychopaths everywhere. He visited Al Dunlap, dismantler of Sunbeam to wonder whether he might be one. ""He pointed at a sculpture of four sharks encircling the planet. 'I believe in predators,' he said. 'Their spirit will enable you to succeed. Over there you've got falcons. Alligators. Alligators. More alligators. Tigers.' 'It's As if both Midas and also the Queen of Narnia were here,' I said, 'and the Queen of Narnia flew above a particularly fierce zoo and turned everything there to stone and then transported everything here.' 'What?' said Al. 'Nothing,' I said. 'No,' he said, 'What did you just say?' He shot me a steely, blue-eyed stare, which I found quite debilitating. ""I appreciated how he took the subject out of prison where we, the still living prey can really relate to it. Of course,I liked this because it's really all about me. Without seeming to, he also gets into some searching questions about journalism and madness. "
57,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4636758-vanessa,4,"I really enjoyed this book. I have for a while now had an interest in psychology and mental disorders of various kinds, finding them absolutely fascinating to read about. Psychopathy (or sociopathy) was something, however, that I didn't really know much about prior to reading this book. I certainly hadn't heard of The Psychopath Test, created by Bob Hare, a Canadian criminal psychologist.In his book, Ronson shares his encounters with various people that may or may not be classified as psychopaths, from a man known only as ""Tony"" who 'fakes' madness to get out of a prison sentence, to Al Dunlap, a retired corporate executive with a tendency to see factors on the Psychopath Test as positive in the eyes of business. All is told from the humorous and objective viewpoint of Ronson, whilst over-analysing his own motivations in true anxiety-related style.Ronson reminded me a lot of myself at points in this book, and I really enjoyed the way he structured his book and the interviews he conducted. I will definitely be seeking out more of his work, and if you have any interest in the topic of psychopathy, or are a fan of gonzo-style journalism, then I would highly recommend this."
58,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3659939-bree,4,"Really, really enjoyed this. First of all, I listened to the audiobook and Jon Ronson's voice reminds me of Neil Gaiman's, so already it's a win. It's fascinating to consider how psychopathy is diagnosed and what that diagnosis means. Most human beings display some psychopathic traits from time to time, but how do you determine when someone displays enough to be considered a danger to society? Jon Ronson's writing is humorous, fun, and completely engaging. At times the structure of the book felt a little disjointed, but I appreciated how it all came together at the end. Because much of the book consists of interviews with various psychiatrists and psychopaths (and maybe-psychopaths), the reader is able to come to their own conclusions rather than relying on the author to tell you what to think. "
59,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,4,"This is the sort of book that I tend to enjoy – a journalist tells amusing stories about his investigations into a particular topic – but which readers with a more focused interest in the purported subject may find frustrating. Ronson portrays himself as a cheerfully unmethodical explorer of the world of craziness, meeting with experts, prisoners, and potentially psychotic retired executives and presenting their stories and his responses in a lively, vivid style. Some of the stories involved, almost necessarily, are rather horrible, but he keeps the gruesome stuff to a minimum and finds the absurd humor in situations where you might not expect to find it. As engaging and entertaining a book on psychopaths as you are likely to find, and I particularly enjoyed the way he concluded his story. Four and a half stars."
60,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,4,"Ok, first of all, I have to admit I have a soft spot in my heart for the pop-psy. That being said, I really enjoyed this well-rounded take on psychopathy; from the use of labels to the tests to determine if a person is one. He did not take a position and try to convince us, except as a story technique, but that was also done as a full circle. Very good writing for what it is. I loved the same style turned on scientologists and their crusade against psychiatry, the psychopharmacology industry, and the creators of the DSM III through IV (although I would have loved him to take on V as well).He's the same writer of The Men Who Stare At Goats, which I thought was a very funny movie, and I'll have to read that book now. I've become a fan of the author. :)"

“Suddenly, madness was everywhere, and I was determined to learn about the impact it had on the way society evolves. I've always believed society to be a fundamentally rational thing, but what if it isn't? What if it is built on insanity?”

 The book was engaging, I enjoyed reading it, however I couldn't help being a little disappointed. While Ronson makes a few good points and raises some good questions, I was hoping the book would go deeper into the world of psychopaths, instead it was mainly focused on his journey of researching the topic. However, I can't hold this too hard against the book as Jon Ronson is an investigative journalist, not a mental health care specialist."
62,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7022024-mike,4,"For a book about psychopaths this was a surprisingly light(ish, come on, we're still talking about psychopaths here) read. The author is a journalist and it covers a wide range of the topic from interviewing a few (suspected) psychopaths, to speaking with psychiatrists who are involved in psychopathy and the classification there of, to scientologists, to neurologists who examined the brains of normal people and psychopaths. It is a fast read of a book that I think does a good job being honest and truth seeking.The psychopath test in this book, called Hare Psychopathy Checklist presents a set of characteristics a person can be graded on. Score too high and you just might be a psychopath. Once the author had learned of this test and taken a seminar about it he started to see it both in his own behavior and others, annotating his interactions with others with various qualities on the test. Instead of narrowly focusing on just psychopaths (and mostly avoiding the lurid details of the more famous/horrifying ones) Ronson presents the reader with a broad, if shallow, survey of the field. He also does an excellent job of linking together different parts of the history of psychology and how those events impact the modern world (such as the explosion of psychological disorder classifications, the massive expansion of pharmaceuticals to ""treat"" these conditions, and how the entertainment industry, especially reality TV, benefits from just the right amount of madness). I found his writing style very accessible and the presentation of the interviews and facts well conveyed without becoming too dry or boring.The animating force behind the book was a weird event where a bunch of scientists from all over the world get a strange, cryptic book. They banded to together over the internet to try and figure it out but were flummoxed. One of the scientists in question contacted Ronson to help and he eventually tracked down the person he thought was responsible. Turns out it likely wasn't some genius mystery maker but likely a slightly off kilter Swede. But Ronson was intrigued by how much this solitary person caused the world to change and wondered how much of the state of the world was due to psychopaths. While he doesn't answer the question (many others, including folks he interviewed, have delved into this) he does write about how psychopathy did appear to be more prevalent in business circles. Given how much havoc financial decisions can make (shutting down manufacturing plants, crashing the economy, putting profits before people, etc.). All in all a fast and interesting read, but not one for people looking for a deeper understanding of psychopathy. I devoured it in the course of an intercontinental (unless you are one of those people who think the Americas are just one continent) and was found the experience both entertaining and enlightening."
63,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76697789-ryan-krueger,5,"** The Psychopath Test by Jon Robson is an informative non-fiction book. The book was written with intent to inform readers about the abundance of psychopaths in our world and how they impact our daily lives. The author is a journalist who has traveled the world to meet with professors, scientists, psychologists and more to find information on this subject to create a strong basis for the book. Ronson makes plenty of flights around the globe to meet with researchers as well as psychopaths themselves. His main point in this is to display how psychopaths are common in our lives whether it be the workplace or interacting with someone who seems in an everyday environment. The work discusses psychopaths lack of emotions such as fear or remorse and how that can lead some people to be at the top of the business chain. Due to them not having remorse they can be willing to fire half of their staff in one day with no regards to how it may affect their lives, while the boss’s mind is only focused on financial gains. A quote in the book goes, “Serial killers ruin families, corporate and political and religious psychopaths ruin economies. They ruin societies.”This is a very interesting book in my opinion as I have always had an interest in the wiring of people’s brains. The details included and quoted from psychopaths that he interviewed were intriguing as they would say stuff along the lines of them wanting to kill to see what blood looks like or what the insides of someone else looks like. The book raises issues on how psychopaths can ruin families, societies, and economies. It covers a wide range of topics and goes into detail on each area including how psychopaths can affect these issues. I agree with everything in this book except that the words psychopath and sociopath can be used interchangeably. After looking into this I’ve found various sources as well as teachers who stated that psychopaths are born the way they are and it’s genetics, while sociopaths are born through traumatic experiences and have capabilities of feeling remorse as well as developing relationships or bonds with others. This book answered a lot of questions I have had. There are two people in my life who I always wondered why they act the way they do but I realized that they are most likely a psychopath. However, it made me realize how easy it can be to target someone as a psychopath due to the bob hare psychopath test and how normal actions can be misinterpreted into a biased stance. As someone who has an interest in helping soldiers suffering from PTSD this relates to my personal agenda due to me having the possibility of preventing someone from becoming a sociopath. "

66,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,4,"While Jon Ronson reveals a great deal about his own neuroses in this book, he casts little light on the psychopaths he is allegedly researching, though he does give some interesting insights into the ""madness industry"" of psychologists who have studied, categorized, labeled, and tried to treat psychopaths, mostly without success.Ronson begins with a strange introduction to the field of psychology and mental illness thanks to a group of Scientologists, who chose him to ""expose"" the evils of psychology. Scientologists believe that all mental disorders are because of engrams accumulated from past lives or space aliens or some shit like that. L. Ron Hubbard had a particular hatred of psychologists. Ronson spends a little time discussing the peculiarities of Scientology, but this book is primarily about psychopaths and what makes them tick... and what makes the people who study them tick.After reading The Psychopath Test, it is not hard to believe that you have to be a little bit crazy to study crazy people. (Look out for those Abnormal Psychology majors...) From the arbitrariness of what goes into the DSM (did you know that far more copies are sold to interested non-academics/non-practitioners than to mental health professionals?) to the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, a diagnostic tool that's become a quick and dirty way to label someone a psychopath, to the Rosenhan Experiment, the history of psychology is filled with enough self-reinforcing bumbling and egomania to make one think the Scientologists may have a point.While Ronson's book is a collection of interesting anecdotes and observations, digressing into the overmedication of children, misdiagnoses of autism, and the brutality of capitalist devotion to ""shareholder value,"" between interviews with ex-death squad leaders and allegedly psychopathic CEO Al Dunlap, it's a bit weak in its critique of science, and sheds little light on his subjects.Martha Stout's book The Sociopath Next Door was more illuminating. Ronson does, however, give a bit of a glimpse into the mind of a sociopath in a way that Stout only addressed abstractly: how do sociopaths/psychopaths (there is no technical difference between them) see themselves? Do they recognize that they are ""broken""? Do they ever want to be cured, and can they be? (Short answer: no.)Ronson's interview with Al Dunlap was particularly interesting, as he actually confronted Dunlap with the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, and the allegations that Dunlap, according to this tool, scored high on the psychopathy scale. Dunlap proceeded to point out that every behavior presented as evidence of being a psychopath could also be interpreted as someone who has a forceful and driven personality who gets things done. True enough, there is a lot of evidence that psychopathy is an asset in positions of power, like boardrooms.Ronson is able to see how some of his subjects ape normal human reactions and manipulate people the way they'd handle a TV remote control, but others, like Al Dunlap, are more ambiguous. Is Dunlap really a psychopath, or just a merciless asshole? As both Stout and Ronson point out, even genuine psychopaths are rarely serial killers; most live law-abiding, respectable lives, though never out of any actual respect for the law or society.An interesting if somewhat meandering trip into the perilous world of diagnosing psychopaths, The Psychopath Test is not exactly a weighty, heavily-researched book, but it will be of interest to anyone who has an, ahem, clinical interest in psychopaths."
67,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14084605-pink,4,"A real thought provoker. What is a psychopath? Are you a psychopath? How about your friends or co-workers? This book will leave you diagnosing everyone you know and becoming all powerful with your new amazing psychopath detection skills, just like Jon Ronson. The book really made me think about how mental illness is defined. Sure there are clear cut cases of insanity and sanity, but there's a huge area in the middle, with a range of diagnoses that are possible to be made and indeed are being sweepingly made and medicated for across the world. Quite apart from the issues of psychopath detection and detention, there were some interesting stories. A wide range of people were interviewed for his research and I was fascinated by several of their lives, whether they were the professionals, or the patients. This was my first Jon Ronson book and I haven't read any of his journalistic material so his style of writing is all new to me. I appreciated the humour and details about himself that were included, which broke up some pretty heavy content at times. I also liked how the book came full circle and re-visited the people at the beginning of his journey, which gave closure to their own stories. Much recommended and I can't wait to read more of his books now! "

69,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4529669-willow,4,"Jon Ronson is a hoot. It would be great to have lunch with him. He puts so much of himself into his writing, bringing up his own little insecurities and observations, pretty much showing that he’ll be happy to go anywhere or do anything provided there’s a good story. This book is all over the place following Jon around and he brings up different case studies after another. In fact, I’m not sure they had that much in common with each other except that Jon decided they were worth investigating. This ‘all over the place’ is the book’s weakness and the reason I knocked a star. You see, I’m not sure Jon really proved his point. That doesn’t mean it wasn’t informative and entertaining. I definitely learned a lot about the psychopath test, which is here by the way: http://thinkcreatedesign.wordpress.co...Some of the provocative ideas this book brings up is that psychopaths may actually have a brain abnormality that has to do with their amygdale. They don’t feel the full range of emotions like most people. This makes them fearless, lacking in empathy and they gravitate toward positions of power because they are missing regular emotional stimulation. There could be one psychopath in every hundred people. Jon even jokes that he started seeing psychopaths everywhere once he acquired his new psychopath spotting skills. Obviously he’s not the only one with psychopath spotting skills. One of the reviews on GR even suggested that pretty much everybody in the GOP is a psychopath, posting pictures. Judging by the seriousness of her review, and the lack of seriousness in Jon’s book, I can’t help but think that she ignored the last quarter of the book. That’s because by the end, Jon is rethinking what he’s learned about psychopaths and the psychopath test, suggesting that nothing is cut and dried, and scoring high on a test shouldn’t get you locked away forever. He takes a look at criminal profilers and some of their serious blunders (something crime shows rarely show on TV). If the police are convinced you are the culprit, or a doctor wants to slap a diagnosis on you, they will find a way, because that’s what they want to find. Both the media, the pharmaceutical companies, and the public want to promote mental illness for different reasons. Categorizing is something humans love to do. We look for order in a chaotic world. It’s comforting. And sometimes when people are trying to fit someone in a personality box, we ignore all the things that make them not fit there. Psychology is not an exact science I’ve read that The Society for the Scientific Study of Psychopathy (SSSP) published a statement regarding this book stating that certain interviews in it were exaggerated or fictionalised and that they ""think that Ronson’s book trivializes a serious personality disorder and its measurement, which is not helpful to those who have the disorder or to their unfortunate victims"".This statement made me laugh, because I don’t think this book was ever meant to be a deep serious study of psychopaths. It’s more about Jon investigating them, and coming up with different conclusions. He’s a thoughtful writer and I enjoyed reading his observations. I think this book raises more questions than it answers. I love that. "
70,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1016626-tim-pendry,3,"This book is being promoted as 'comic'. Sadly, it is not. It is quite a sad read. I laughed once out loud and smiled twice but only in the first chapter. If you end this book laughing, you have not ‘got it’. You should leave it a little angry and troubled.Ronson exhibits all the graces and the flaws of modern British journalism. It is an easy read. The man is self-questioning (though clearly not too deeply lest he cease to function) and he is honest. But he is also skimming the surface of issues that require a far tougher and better book than this.Perhaps he is being cleverer than I think. Perhaps his periodic questioning of the way his profession turns reality into narratives, into modern folk tales, will create a suspicion in the public's mind about how it receives information, how its mental world is structured. I think not.The book is about the phenomenon of the psychopath which operates at so many levels as part of our cultural self-definition. As a species, we tend to need a scapegoat for structural ills that derive from our own nature - so, why not the 'psychopath' in our culture.Perhaps 1% of the population is 'psychopathic' in the sense of presenting a reasonable danger to others under certain conditions. Perhaps another 5% have traits that could be dangerous under yet other more extreme conditions. I suspect 88% are just a danger to themselves as ‘normals’.Political fear (I speak as a radical empath who is in the 'other' 6%, potentially equally dangerous to society for completely different reasons) seems to be determining that media headlines must ensure that 'psychopaths' are defined for incarceration by their nature rather than by their deeds.Yet, as Charlie Chaplin’s M. Verdoux so eloquently put it in the film of that name, it is not the single psychopath whose default mode is tolerance for enormous crimes against humanity but the vast ‘normal’ mass who vote, work and play without much of a thought in their little minds.Ronson opens the door to such subversive thinking but he only peeks in. The psychopath in Broadmoor is judged fit for release and we know it is a gamble. The corporate boss targeted as a psychopath turns out to be depressingly conventional in his private life. So far, so ‘normal’.But Scientologists prove to be champions of human rights and psychiatrists appear to be at forefront of new sociologies of population control, aided by pharmaceuticals interests who turn any mild abnormality from a genetic variant of possible evolutionary value into a diagnosed disease.Some of the most ethically filthy conduct in the book, leading to suicide and death in their victims, come from ‘normals’, the same sort of ‘normal’ who obeys an order in a war or who thinks corporate career progression is a substitute for personal responsibility.The book deserves better than its jokey style. Perhaps the jokey style will build more understanding amongst the general population and that is its justification. Unfortunately, it will probably just flow off most ‘normal’s backs like that of the proverbial duck.So let us try the analysis here that Ronson seems nervous of attempting – that hoary old business, no doubt, in his case, of just being a reporter, just telling a story.First, as he rightly points out, there really are very dangerous persons which we have termed psychopaths but which are simply at one genetic and personality end of our human Bell Curve. They are not monsters, they are human. They are simply accentuations of aspects of our normal selves.Society needs protection but it also needs to recognize, in different ecological circumstances, that they may be more important to us than ourselves in the future of our own species. We have to hope we hang on to civilization long enough to ensure that they are never needed.Second, these dangerous ones are there but they are rare. We cannot build our entire social structure around protecting ourselves from what amounts to a force of nature any more than we should be degenerating as a free and questioning culture because of a few terrorists.Faced with nature, sometimes bad things happen. They will continue to happen. ‘The bomber will always get through’. This is what we are as humans. It is dreadful for the victim but these cases are still rare and we should concentrate on a society that polices itself and is not policed.What is happening is that the existence of the genuine psychopath and the genuine terrorist is being used by the authoritarian bureaucrat to introduce ever-increasing controls on our movement, conduct and language (aspirationally, on our minds) in an attempt to manage the unmanageable.Without the ‘noble lie’ of a religion, with no Pope to serve Constantine, the bureaucrats are turning to definitional analysis and what they like to call science but which is no more scientific than was Lysenko under Stalin. If this book does one service, it is to cast doubt on the more radical scientific credentials of psychology.Over the last two decades, the psychologists and social scientists have found themselves riding on a lucrative gravy train medicalising ‘misbehaviour’ and unhappiness and offering cures based on chemicals and incarceration. The sick are becoming overwhelmed by the worried and the inconvenient.These new priests of the mind are now busy perpetrating the lie of there being no free will (a spurious philosophical conclusion from consciousness studies by people who could usefully spend some time reading the great existentialists) and the even worse lie of a beneficent normality.It was men in white coats who murdered the physically abnormal in euthanasia programmes under national-socialism. It is now men in white coats who are engaged in soul murder against the mentally different. There are throw-away stories in the book of how gays and feminists could lobby successfully to ensure that certain psychological definitions were abandoned. Either science is science or it is not. Scientific decision-making in physics would not allow the peer review to include a lobbyist.‘Conditions’ that have no politically powerful lobbies against them also have many commercial and family interests seeking their establishment. But we have to keep our feet on the ground. If social science and psychology are socio-political tools, there are still things to be cured or managed.There are people seriously suffering pain (yet the system still refuses to let psychiatrists test low dosage levels of psychedelics for depression and trauma). There is certainly work to be done on re-engineering society for relief from anxiety and self empowerment.What is grossly unacceptable is to allow social or family order requirements to permit collusion between drug companies, a morally degenerate professional class and the state or parents in the use of drugs for social control of behaviours that are merely inconvenient or embarrassing.We live in monstrous times. This book, to its credit, opens the door on the monsters – psychopathic and professional alike. We have a choice to go through the door and see what our society has become or shut it and pretend it is not happening. So, my regret about this well-written, entertaining and thought-provoking book is that Ronson limits himself to anecdotes and questions. ‘Normals’ will pick this up, be entertained and go back to being ‘normal’ again. ‘Normal’ people are the shills for the men in white coats and grey suits. What we really need now are writers who show people that just being ‘normal’ (and certainly being ‘normalised’) is damned dangerous to them and to their kids’ future and that ‘normal’ now means little more than manageable and controllable. Ronson merely skims the surface of this story."
71,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara,5,"I couldn't imagine that a book about psychopaths would be so good! Ronson interviews lots of people including people in institutions for the criminally insane, Scientologists, psychiatrists and conspiracy theorists. Ronson also has a very engaging narrating style. We all encounter psychopaths, and sometimes it takes time for us to realize the person has a personality disorder. They may be work colleagues, neighbors, and other people we interact with. It has helped me at times to realize that someone's behavior fits the parameters of psychopathy. Of course, Ronson also explores cases where individuals have been institutionalized for years or even a lifetime without adequate evidence that they continue to be a threat to others. I recommend this to anyone interested in the topic of psychopathic behavior but don't want a technical treatment for the subject."
72,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"Entertaining and a surprisingly breezy read, The Psychopath Test is a somewhat rambling and ultimately non-conclusive record of an investigative journey into the mental health industry, conspiracy theories and scientology. The author meets some very interesting people -- about whom you can form your own conclusions: I was never exactly happy about Bob Hare.I enjoyed reading it, but oddly I'm not sure I can recommend it. Looking back at it, there's not much substance, and isn't as hilariously funny as the blurb and reviews on the back would have you believe -- then again, I don't think it was a waste of time either."

In addition to defining and describing the traits of psychopathy, the author raises some questions regarding the sanity of the industry of psychiatry .Overall it was informative, funny and sometimes disturbing; reading about the brutal murders was not my favorite part but if you are looking for ways to spot a psychopath then this book is the one. "
74,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5487874-g,3,"3.5/5Less of ""a journey through the madness industry"" and more of a random romp. Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable one. The Psychopath Test didn't bring me any greater clarity on the subject. Instead, it gave me more to think about. And, frankly, I'm not not mad about that. I'd actually like to read more of Jon Ronson's work."
75,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,4,"4.5 starsJon Ronson is one of those writers - like David Sedaris - whose voice you hear as you read his words; the soft, slightly effete, often uncertain lilt of his sounding in the reader's inner ear. This is one of the things that makes him such an engaging writer, along with his style of placing himself (and his neuroses, which are particularly apposite in this context) directly in view, a method which rather than obscuring his subjects illuminates them, by giving us such an upfront view. The very subjectivity of Ronson's journalistic style allows us to see the complexity of the tale with clarity.In this book Ronson stitches together, as usual, stories that illuminate a single theme - initially tied loosely but bound tighter and tighter as the book progresses. The chapters each involve a way in which we view madness, starting with his own rather off-hand description of an interviewee as a ""psychopath"" and his involvement in an entirely unrelated mystery (which is ultimately used to bookend the volume) which then spirals off from his increasing fascination with the diagnosis of mental disorders following delving into the DSM-IV (and subsequent self diagnosis of a dozen disorders). We meet a patient at Broadmoor high security psychiatric hospital, committed following an insanity plea when on trial for GBH and a subsequent diagnosis as a psychopath, a history of that disorder and its diagnosis and treatment, and then on to a gallery of cases involving both people Ronson has interviewed (psychologists, psychiatrists, a former Haitian paramilitary leader, a corporate CEO famous for his glee in downsizing for fun and profit, former MI5 agent David Shayler) and others whose lives have been changed by direct or indirect contact either those who may have psychiatric disorders or with the madness industry tat has grown around them.The connecting thread is this; that over recent decades we have become increasingly fond of defining behaviours that lay on the spectrum of human personality as 'disorders', using methods which may or may not be scientific and may or may not be accurate. There is plenty of questioning of those methods in this book, but the criticism is largely leveled at those people and organisations that are too ready to use these blunt tools for their own ends - whether it is the pharmaceutical industry and their ever increasing push to medicate human difference or the Metropolitan Police entrapping a neat suspect in a murder case despite a complete lack of evidence, while possibly allowing the actual killer the freedom to kill again.Ronson is sometimes described as a humorist (as does Will Self in his Guardian review quoted on the blurb) but I think this is entirely misleading. Ronson is and always has been a journalist, albeit one who uses his wit and humour to allow us insights to the things about which he writes, a technique which is also effective when he drops it to highlight the sad or horrific - the town of Shubuta, Mississippi, devastated when the local toaster factory was closed to increase the manufacturing company's share price, the murders committed by actual violent psychopaths, the deaths and harm caused by the 'reality' TV industry when they have focused on a distorted view of what is not 'normal'. And, unlike much journalism, this does not attempt to give definite answers; the threads Ronson has drawn together are tied neatly enough to make sense but with enough frayed, trailing lines to leave the reader pondering long after closing the book."
76,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,4,"So Jon Ronson, the man who brought the theory that the world is run by extraterrestrial lizard people to the world's attention, turns his worried gaze to psychopaths. He wrote something like a deeply ambivalent travelogue of his time writing this book. We meet death squad leaders and CEOs who love firing people. We meet a man wrongly picked by a criminal profiler as a brutal killer and we meet Scientologists. We meet the man who helped get homosexuality out of the DSM as a psychiatric condition and we meet a guy who tried nude LSD-assisted psychotherapy for criminal psychopaths. We meet a man who believes no one blew themselves up in subway cars in London one July day and we meet a woman on one of those subway cars. And what do we learn? I’m not sure. That psychiatry started using check lists to standardize diagnoses and the pharmacologization of psychiatry followed, yes. That now in three days, you too can diagnose psychopaths with a handy dandy 40 question check list, yes. But those are headlines, not books. That psychopaths are both like, and unlike, extraterrestrial lizard people, maybe. I quite enjoyed this book. I’m struggling to find something useful to say about it. As foreshadowed above, ambivalent travelogue is the best I’ve come up with. I thought at first the thesis was that psychopaths are everywhere, disproportionately in positions of power, and how they use that power destroys the world. Bob Hare, the man who developed the psychopath test itself, told Ronson he regretted doing so much of his work in prisons instead of on the stock exchange. When Ronson protested that serial killers were worse than psychopathic stock brokers, Hare said:‘“Serial killers ruin families.’ Bob shrugged. ‘Corporate and political and religious psychopaths ruin economies. They ruin societies.’	“This – Bob was saying – was the straightforward solution to the greatest mystery of all: why is the world so unfair? Why all that savage economic injustice, those brutal wars, the everyday corporate cruelty? The answer: psychopaths. The part of the brain that doesn’t function right. . . . . We aren’t all good people just trying to do good. Some of us are psychopaths. And psychopaths are to blame for this brutal, misshapen society. They’re the jagged rocks thrown into the still pond.” (112)And that moved me deeply. But Ronson doesn’t develop that thesis. Instead, he travelogues his earnest conversations with marginal nutball after marginal nutball, takes a brief foray into how the modern psychiatric profession became what it is today, then returns us to a secure psychiatric facility to watch a man committed for years after faking madness be released. Maybe there’s nothing more to be said on that. The idea that psychopaths drive the action on the world stage may be just too depressing to stare at for too long, even if you do have a BBC film crew with you. It was a good book. Well worth reading. I have the nagging feeling there was a better one inchoate in the source material, but I’m dead certain Ronson did better than I would have writing it. "
77,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3397530-lea,4,"I am a huuuuuge Jon Ronson fan, so it's no surprise that I enjoyed this book too. The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry lives up to its title -- Ronson really does take the reader on a journey through the ""madness industry"". The book opens with a bit of a mystery concerning an unusual book that was mailed to various academics throughout the world. At first it doesn't seem to fit the theme of the book, but Ronson ties it in eventually. His typical style is to jump around between subjects, finding common themes, and this book is no different -- we meet an incarcerated psychopath (who may not, in fact, be a psychopath at all), learn about the methods of diagnosing psychopathy, investigate current psychological diagnoses (especially those in children), and see another possible psychopath's positive spin on those ""negative"" traits. The book also looks at Scientology's war on psychiatry, the experimental psychiatric treatments of the 1970s, and criminal profiling. The author covers a lot of ground here, but it's a very fast read. There are several parts that are unsettling -- some crime descriptions, the kafka-esque plight of those stuck in a psychiatric catch-22, a child's accidental overdose of psychiatric medication -- although that could be more indicative of my sensitivity than anythng else.As usual, Ronson explores his own feelings and anxieties as well. Some readers may find this annoying, although his fans most likely won't -- I enjoy those parts of his books!All in all, I really enjoyed this book, and I would recommend it, especially if you've read and liked his previous books."
78,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948275-josh,3,"Let me begin by saying that the title is deceiving. While it does go into the subject of psychopaths and eventually ends with it, there are many points at which I felt like Ronson's main objective was the critique the overall approach to mental disorders that this country (and other researchers from other countries around the world) have taken over the years. We've gotten ourselves into the habit of classifying every little oddity in our personalities as something strange and unwanted, rather than looking at people as individuals with individualistic tendencies -- and this is especially true when it comes to differences of the mind and its inner workings. So, the fact that I was reading this book as a way into psychopaths and psychopaths alone left me with a unsavory taste once I started to realize that there was much more going on here that I wasn't prepared for. Which isn't to say that I disliked any of what was in the book. There are some very interesting (and entertaining) takes on issues such as Scientology, childhood psychiatry, and even conspiracy theorists. However, that's not what the title of the book leads you to believe the book is about. And I call that false advertisement. And no matter how entertaining this book ended up being (and it was -- Ronson tells a story here, with a plot and everything, rather than reporting like a journalist), no matter how drawn in I was into the story he created, the fact still remains that I don't feel like I learned nearly enough about psychopaths as I should have from a book titled, ""The Psychopath Test."""

Listened to the audiobook read by the author himself, and was hooked after only a few minutes; then when Ronson started talking about Douglas Hofstadter and Scientologists I had to think ""I am so lucky to be listening to this book!"" I learned about how the original DSM was created - how arbitrary all those diagnoses are - and that's (can I say:) depressing. I should write a thoughtful review but I am pressed for time, so I will quote Laura Miller at Salon: [Ronson is] not afraid to play the feckless neurotic for laughs, but that doesn't obscure the serious questions raise by his investigations. Psychiatric diagnoses (and, these days, the medications that follow) really can become fads, with certain experts suddenly deciding that multiple personality disorder or childhood bipolar disorder are far more common that ever before suspected. Ronson even finds the occasion for a little professional soul-searching; he accuses himself and other journalists of being the Goldilocks of craziness, seeking out people to write about who are just nuts enough to be colorful but not so disturbed that they're downright sad."
81,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4845040-gregory,5,"Mr. Ronson puts forth ideas, scenarios, and real life observations in a easily read format. He writes so fluently that reading this book is like breathing. I just started it yesternight and about a 1/3 of the way through, he also highlights certain aspects of the study of the mind in relation to its historcal perspective(s).Although the subject/topics are a bit challenging, if you think you may be interested in this book, It is well worth your time. Also, I think his paradigm exposes/shows us concepts perhaps that may have permeated some of our current and past leaders in all walks of life. Something to consider and think about.My hats off to Mr. Ronson, Great job.This is an excellent book and it is excellently written. I believe I will read it again very soon just to see what I missed: even dispite the topic difficulty.It really gives you a great deal to think about, and seems related to Brightsided, in terms of some modern moras."

Lots of oddballs emerge.Ronson's got a funny style, and apparently a real knack for tracking down the world's screwballs. Very interesting and enjoyable.Also uncomfortable at times, especially when the reader starts considering the psychopath checklist in terms of himself or his friends."
83,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina,2,"This is actually a 1.5 stars book. Meh. The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson has absolutely nothing of interest to say. It's been on my ""to read"" shelf for a while so when I impulsively bought it one day while sitting bored in a doctor's office, I couldn't remember why I had wanted to read it, just that I did. Why can't I learn my lesson about impulsive book-buying? It rarely turns out well. Ronson starts the book by recounting the Mystery of the Mysterious Book. An expensively produced, attractive hard bound book was sent to various academics around the world and none of them can figure out why they received the book or what its purpose is. The sender is unknown, but the books were sent from Sweden. Ronson is recruited to solve the mystery. Along the way, he gets interested in the idea of mental illness and psychopaths and also begins pursing the idea of what it means to be diagnosed as a psychopath and how they are diagnosed. Ronson interviews various psychologists in the field, including Robert Hare, creator of the PCL-R (the Hare Checklist for psychopathology). Ronson also talks with people who doubt the accuracy of the PCL-R (Scientologists...ha ha ha ha), discusses his own neuroses and anxieties, muses on the tendency of psychologists these days to over-analyze, abuses the exclamation mark and makes a lot of lame jokes. This is an idiotic book. I would not recommend it to anyone who is interested in psychopathology and either has a good layperson's understanding of psychopathology or is a professional in the field of psychology (unless that person wants a good laugh). Some of the books Ronson lists as research sources I've already read (plus Harvey Cleckley's Mask of Sanity which Ronson mentions but didn't read) so I already knew more about psychopathology than the author; this revelation did not make me happy. When Ronson begins to explore the subject, he has only the vaguest (Hollywood-influenced) idea of psychopaths and who does he turn to first? Why, Scientologists of course. I mean, if I wanted an understanding of any topic in the field of psychology, I would automatically turn to a group of nutbars who believe in aliens but think psychology is nonsense. A group within Scientologists called the CCHR (Citizens Commission on Human Rights) have made it their mission to ""prove to the world that psychiatrists are wicked and must be stopped"" (28). Ronson is impressed by their record of exposing some very bad psychiatrists...well, yes, they did expose some bad ones, but the examples that Ronson provides (provided to him by the CCHR) are fairly obvious quacks (or mentally ill individuals) who were in the field for reasons other than to honestly practice the profession. Eventually Ronson decides that talking to actual psychologists instead of Scientologists is a good idea. I got fairly disgusted early on when a Scientologist took him to Broadmoor (insane asylum in England) to meet a psychopath (Tony) who isn't really a psychopath--he just pretended to be one so he could avoid prison. Once in Broadmoor, surprise surprise, Tony is diagnosed as a psychopath. Ronson listens to Tony's story of woe without (seemingly) a critical thought in his head. Because at this point Ronson still hasn't done any research about psychopaths, he is completely taken in by Tony's story and believes he is wrongly incarcerated. It's not until later when he talks with Tony's doctor does he have a more informed view of Tony and why he is at Broadmoor. This whole book irritates me because I can't decide if Ronson is really such an idiot or if he possesses some sly sense of humor I can't perceive. When Ronson finally gets to Robert Hare and his pathology checklist, I'm again annoyed. He walks around with the checklist and interviews people whose behavior suggests psychopathology (most notable: Al Dunlap, former CEO--and destroyer--of the Sunbeam Corporation and Emmanuel ""Toto"" Constant, leader of the paramilitary group FRAPH in Haiti). Ronson mentally checks off each psychopath characteristic (Item 6: Lack of Remorse or Guilt, Item 7: Shallow Affect) he thinks they display as he interviews them. With Dunlap, Ronson goes straight through the list and directly asks him about each item. Ronson describes himself as feeling powerful because he has this secret knowledge and can identify psychopaths. What Ronson (willfully?) forgets (ignores?) is that it's not enough to say, yeah, this person seems to not have empathy or sympathy, but an interviewee also has to determine to what degree this person doesn't have sympathy. Maybe some things do bother him and others don't. I understand that at least one of Ronson's objectives of the book is to say, hey, it's way too easy to diagnose someone with a mental illness by going through a list. Well, yeah. This is not a revelation. The fact that Ronson thinks this state of affairs within the psychology/psychiatry field is shocking is, in itself, shocking. What field doesn't have its instances of abuse and misuse? He has a chapter discussing how children are diagnosed with bipolar disorders and then prescribed drugs to treat this (as many psychologists think) imaginary children's condition. It's apparently the latest fad. Parents with kids who are moody or restless or high-energy and don't have the time to deal with them get their children diagnosed with something (for a while ADHD was huge; maybe it still is) and doped up. Parents aren't necessarily to blame; there are the professionals who misdiagnose and the pharmaceutical industry eager to make money any way it can. Many factors create and exacerbate the abuse of Hare's PCL-R and the way anyone is misdiagnosed and over-medicated. The Psychopath Test is generally a mess of a book. There's no clear thesis/objective for the book. What exactly is Ronson investigating? What is he trying to prove? His discussion of the PCL-R is thrown off track by the chapter detailing how the DSM is created (a rather haphazard and unscientific process if Ronson's information is correct) and the misdiagnosis of children. If Ronson wanted to explore the abuses of psychology and psychiatry (combined with the shady connection between psychiatrists and the pharmaceutical industry), then why didn't he do that? This book is merely a glib commentary on several topics combined with the author's (non-humorous) observations of his own anxieties and neuroses. Although I did not like how he approached the topic nor how he wrote it, I am still interested in reading (if not buying) Ronson's other books. It's clear that Ronson was out of his depth with this subject. "
84,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22440207-agn,4,"WHAT IS IT ABOUT?In his book “The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry,” a bestselling journalist Jon Ronson, propelled by a mysterious hoax played on the world’s leading scientists, dives into the world of madness to explore just how mad we really are. During his two-year journey, Ronson not only interviews a bunch of madmen as well as several influential psychologists, psychiatrists and anti-psychiatric Scientologists but also practices his newly gained skill of using Hare Psychopathy Checklist to spot psychopaths. Unexpectedly and quite disturbingly, the author discovers the society’s drive for the ‘right amount’ of insanity, and often detrimental tendency to define individuals by their maddest edges.THUMBS UP:1) Intriguing introduction.The first chapter of “The Psychopath Test” is THE BEST (mysterious, suspenseful and utterly captivating) introductory chapter I have ever read in a non-fiction book. The opening story is so bizarre it can be easily turned into a book itself.2) Well researched, skillfully written.Ronson’s style is quite humorous and engaging, making his non-fiction very readable and not in the least dry. Also, the author put quite some time and effort into researching and interviewing, which allowed him to explore the madness industry from multiple perspectives, which in turn enables the readers to form their own opinions on the matter. COULD BE BETTER:1) Not what I expected.I guess it’s not really the author’s fault, but I was expecting this book to be more about psychopaths and less about everything else. Instead, at least half of the book has little to do with psychopathy as the author probes multiple issues related to general insanity. It works this way as well, but I was hoping for an in-depth exploration of the psychopath’s mind and thus was a tiny bit disappointed.2) Fragmented and seemingly directionless.While I was reading “The Psychopath Test,” I felt rather confused as if the story has been patched together from several seemingly unrelated parts: at first the book seemed like a really engaging mystery, then it became psychopath-oriented, but soon enough the chapters became quite independent, loosely connected by the general madness theme. Honestly, up until the final chapters I wasn’t sure where the story was going. Although at the very end the author’s intentions became more or less clear, Ronson could have done a better job guiding the reader throughout the whole book.VERDICT: 4 out of 5Although “The Psychopath Test” might seem a little fragmented and directionless, it is nonetheless a very entertaining non-fiction that carries an important message."
85,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7232207-fiona,3,"I had a run-in with a psychopath once. I definitely came out worse from that encounter.But that's the thing that I just can't get my head around: once upon a time, I met a bona fide psychopath and in hindsight it was really, really noticeable! But if, according to Jon Ronson and his sources, psychopaths make up a little less than 1% of the population, where are all the rest of them? Are one in ten Londoners psychopathic? (Apparently they head for big cities.) Are prisons disproportionately full of them? I mean, I imagine so, but even that wouldn't account for the fact that I've identifiably met considerably fewer of them than I would expect to. Where've I been? Mostly (in my adult life) legal academia, the construction industry, and musical theatre. Hardly hotbeds of the empathetic.So something is a bit off, and I think Jon Ronson also knows this: his book is not just called Psychopaths, but The Psychopath Test - it's also partly about diagnosis of mental health problems. It's really engaging, and Ronson is a great writer, but it's hardly in depth. He's got a really light touch, skipping from prison populations to business management, to the writing of DSM-III, to the potential for misdiagnosis of childhood ADHD. This is a 250-page book! I feel like the book poses more questions than it answers, mainly because there's not enough time, and Ronson has no apparent inclination, to go into anything in any depth. He's just spotted something shiny and moved on.So what do I want to know about psychopaths? Well, what I'm missing, for a start. I don't believe that nearly one in a hundred people on this earth are incurably heinous, robot-hearted monsters with no souls and an aptitude on the London Stock Exchange. So is the percentage smaller, or does psychopathy actually mean something different to that? Is it possible to have all these traits and still have a meaningful life, loving relationships and friendships, and do some good in the world? I'm sure it must be; coming out of this book, I saw no indication of it. Have a bit of optimism, Jon! The world's not completely up the creek. It can't be as totally hopeless as you make it out to be. Which means - what aren't you telling me?"

He doesn't just seek out the usual suspects. He talks to Bob Hare who came up with the oft used checklist to spot it. I was worried at first, that Ronson would turn out to be one of tthose 'it all comes back to me' sorts of interviewers, but he asked many of the questions I would have liked to ask. He doesn't give the impression of being thorough, but he is. So he talked with Bob Hare, which resulted in his seeing psychopaths everywhere. He visited Al Dunlap, dismantler of Sunbeam to wonder whether he might be one. ""He pointed at a sculpture of four sharks encircling the planet. 'I believe in predators,' he said. 'Their spirit will enable you to succeed. Over there you've got falcons. Alligators. Alligators. More alligators. Tigers.' 'It's As if both Midas and also the Queen of Narnia were here,' I said, 'and the Queen of Narnia flew above a particularly fierce zoo and turned everything there to stone and then transported everything here.' 'What?' said Al. 'Nothing,' I said. 'No,' he said, 'What did you just say?' He shot me a steely, blue-eyed stare, which I found quite debilitating. ""I appreciated how he took the subject out of prison where we, the still living prey can really relate to it. Of course,I liked this because it's really all about me. Without seeming to, he also gets into some searching questions about journalism and madness. "

I have for a while now had an interest in psychology and mental disorders of various kinds, finding them absolutely fascinating to read about. Psychopathy (or sociopathy) was something, however, that I didn't really know much about prior to reading this book. I certainly hadn't heard of The Psychopath Test, created by Bob Hare, a Canadian criminal psychologist.In his book, Ronson shares his encounters with various people that may or may not be classified as psychopaths, from a man known only as ""Tony"" who 'fakes' madness to get out of a prison sentence, to Al Dunlap, a retired corporate executive with a tendency to see factors on the Psychopath Test as positive in the eyes of business. All is told from the humorous and objective viewpoint of Ronson, whilst over-analysing his own motivations in true anxiety-related style.Ronson reminded me a lot of myself at points in this book, and I really enjoyed the way he structured his book and the interviews he conducted. I will definitely be seeking out more of his work, and if you have any interest in the topic of psychopathy, or are a fan of gonzo-style journalism, then I would highly recommend this."
88,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3659939-bree,4,"Really, really enjoyed this. First of all, I listened to the audiobook and Jon Ronson's voice reminds me of Neil Gaiman's, so already it's a win. It's fascinating to consider how psychopathy is diagnosed and what that diagnosis means. Most human beings display some psychopathic traits from time to time, but how do you determine when someone displays enough to be considered a danger to society? Jon Ronson's writing is humorous, fun, and completely engaging. At times the structure of the book felt a little disjointed, but I appreciated how it all came together at the end. Because much of the book consists of interviews with various psychiatrists and psychopaths (and maybe-psychopaths), the reader is able to come to their own conclusions rather than relying on the author to tell you what to think. "
89,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,4,"This is the sort of book that I tend to enjoy – a journalist tells amusing stories about his investigations into a particular topic – but which readers with a more focused interest in the purported subject may find frustrating. Ronson portrays himself as a cheerfully unmethodical explorer of the world of craziness, meeting with experts, prisoners, and potentially psychotic retired executives and presenting their stories and his responses in a lively, vivid style. Some of the stories involved, almost necessarily, are rather horrible, but he keeps the gruesome stuff to a minimum and finds the absurd humor in situations where you might not expect to find it. As engaging and entertaining a book on psychopaths as you are likely to find, and I particularly enjoyed the way he concluded his story. Four and a half stars."
90,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,4,"Ok, first of all, I have to admit I have a soft spot in my heart for the pop-psy. That being said, I really enjoyed this well-rounded take on psychopathy; from the use of labels to the tests to determine if a person is one. He did not take a position and try to convince us, except as a story technique, but that was also done as a full circle. Very good writing for what it is. I loved the same style turned on scientologists and their crusade against psychiatry, the psychopharmacology industry, and the creators of the DSM III through IV (although I would have loved him to take on V as well).He's the same writer of The Men Who Stare At Goats, which I thought was a very funny movie, and I'll have to read that book now. I've become a fan of the author. :)"

“Suddenly, madness was everywhere, and I was determined to learn about the impact it had on the way society evolves. I've always believed society to be a fundamentally rational thing, but what if it isn't? What if it is built on insanity?”

 The book was engaging, I enjoyed reading it, however I couldn't help being a little disappointed. While Ronson makes a few good points and raises some good questions, I was hoping the book would go deeper into the world of psychopaths, instead it was mainly focused on his journey of researching the topic. However, I can't hold this too hard against the book as Jon Ronson is an investigative journalist, not a mental health care specialist."
92,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7022024-mike,4,"For a book about psychopaths this was a surprisingly light(ish, come on, we're still talking about psychopaths here) read. The author is a journalist and it covers a wide range of the topic from interviewing a few (suspected) psychopaths, to speaking with psychiatrists who are involved in psychopathy and the classification there of, to scientologists, to neurologists who examined the brains of normal people and psychopaths. It is a fast read of a book that I think does a good job being honest and truth seeking.The psychopath test in this book, called Hare Psychopathy Checklist presents a set of characteristics a person can be graded on. Score too high and you just might be a psychopath. Once the author had learned of this test and taken a seminar about it he started to see it both in his own behavior and others, annotating his interactions with others with various qualities on the test. Instead of narrowly focusing on just psychopaths (and mostly avoiding the lurid details of the more famous/horrifying ones) Ronson presents the reader with a broad, if shallow, survey of the field. He also does an excellent job of linking together different parts of the history of psychology and how those events impact the modern world (such as the explosion of psychological disorder classifications, the massive expansion of pharmaceuticals to ""treat"" these conditions, and how the entertainment industry, especially reality TV, benefits from just the right amount of madness). I found his writing style very accessible and the presentation of the interviews and facts well conveyed without becoming too dry or boring.The animating force behind the book was a weird event where a bunch of scientists from all over the world get a strange, cryptic book. They banded to together over the internet to try and figure it out but were flummoxed. One of the scientists in question contacted Ronson to help and he eventually tracked down the person he thought was responsible. Turns out it likely wasn't some genius mystery maker but likely a slightly off kilter Swede. But Ronson was intrigued by how much this solitary person caused the world to change and wondered how much of the state of the world was due to psychopaths. While he doesn't answer the question (many others, including folks he interviewed, have delved into this) he does write about how psychopathy did appear to be more prevalent in business circles. Given how much havoc financial decisions can make (shutting down manufacturing plants, crashing the economy, putting profits before people, etc.). All in all a fast and interesting read, but not one for people looking for a deeper understanding of psychopathy. I devoured it in the course of an intercontinental (unless you are one of those people who think the Americas are just one continent) and was found the experience both entertaining and enlightening."
93,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76697789-ryan-krueger,5,"** The Psychopath Test by Jon Robson is an informative non-fiction book. The book was written with intent to inform readers about the abundance of psychopaths in our world and how they impact our daily lives. The author is a journalist who has traveled the world to meet with professors, scientists, psychologists and more to find information on this subject to create a strong basis for the book. Ronson makes plenty of flights around the globe to meet with researchers as well as psychopaths themselves. His main point in this is to display how psychopaths are common in our lives whether it be the workplace or interacting with someone who seems in an everyday environment. The work discusses psychopaths lack of emotions such as fear or remorse and how that can lead some people to be at the top of the business chain. Due to them not having remorse they can be willing to fire half of their staff in one day with no regards to how it may affect their lives, while the boss’s mind is only focused on financial gains. A quote in the book goes, “Serial killers ruin families, corporate and political and religious psychopaths ruin economies. They ruin societies.”This is a very interesting book in my opinion as I have always had an interest in the wiring of people’s brains. The details included and quoted from psychopaths that he interviewed were intriguing as they would say stuff along the lines of them wanting to kill to see what blood looks like or what the insides of someone else looks like. The book raises issues on how psychopaths can ruin families, societies, and economies. It covers a wide range of topics and goes into detail on each area including how psychopaths can affect these issues. I agree with everything in this book except that the words psychopath and sociopath can be used interchangeably. After looking into this I’ve found various sources as well as teachers who stated that psychopaths are born the way they are and it’s genetics, while sociopaths are born through traumatic experiences and have capabilities of feeling remorse as well as developing relationships or bonds with others. This book answered a lot of questions I have had. There are two people in my life who I always wondered why they act the way they do but I realized that they are most likely a psychopath. However, it made me realize how easy it can be to target someone as a psychopath due to the bob hare psychopath test and how normal actions can be misinterpreted into a biased stance. As someone who has an interest in helping soldiers suffering from PTSD this relates to my personal agenda due to me having the possibility of preventing someone from becoming a sociopath. "

95,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6296289-tyler-j-gray,4,Very thought-provoking and well worth a read!
96,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,4,"While Jon Ronson reveals a great deal about his own neuroses in this book, he casts little light on the psychopaths he is allegedly researching, though he does give some interesting insights into the ""madness industry"" of psychologists who have studied, categorized, labeled, and tried to treat psychopaths, mostly without success.Ronson begins with a strange introduction to the field of psychology and mental illness thanks to a group of Scientologists, who chose him to ""expose"" the evils of psychology. Scientologists believe that all mental disorders are because of engrams accumulated from past lives or space aliens or some shit like that. L. Ron Hubbard had a particular hatred of psychologists. Ronson spends a little time discussing the peculiarities of Scientology, but this book is primarily about psychopaths and what makes them tick... and what makes the people who study them tick.After reading The Psychopath Test, it is not hard to believe that you have to be a little bit crazy to study crazy people. (Look out for those Abnormal Psychology majors...) From the arbitrariness of what goes into the DSM (did you know that far more copies are sold to interested non-academics/non-practitioners than to mental health professionals?) to the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, a diagnostic tool that's become a quick and dirty way to label someone a psychopath, to the Rosenhan Experiment, the history of psychology is filled with enough self-reinforcing bumbling and egomania to make one think the Scientologists may have a point.While Ronson's book is a collection of interesting anecdotes and observations, digressing into the overmedication of children, misdiagnoses of autism, and the brutality of capitalist devotion to ""shareholder value,"" between interviews with ex-death squad leaders and allegedly psychopathic CEO Al Dunlap, it's a bit weak in its critique of science, and sheds little light on his subjects.Martha Stout's book The Sociopath Next Door was more illuminating. Ronson does, however, give a bit of a glimpse into the mind of a sociopath in a way that Stout only addressed abstractly: how do sociopaths/psychopaths (there is no technical difference between them) see themselves? Do they recognize that they are ""broken""? Do they ever want to be cured, and can they be? (Short answer: no.)Ronson's interview with Al Dunlap was particularly interesting, as he actually confronted Dunlap with the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, and the allegations that Dunlap, according to this tool, scored high on the psychopathy scale. Dunlap proceeded to point out that every behavior presented as evidence of being a psychopath could also be interpreted as someone who has a forceful and driven personality who gets things done. True enough, there is a lot of evidence that psychopathy is an asset in positions of power, like boardrooms.Ronson is able to see how some of his subjects ape normal human reactions and manipulate people the way they'd handle a TV remote control, but others, like Al Dunlap, are more ambiguous. Is Dunlap really a psychopath, or just a merciless asshole? As both Stout and Ronson point out, even genuine psychopaths are rarely serial killers; most live law-abiding, respectable lives, though never out of any actual respect for the law or society.An interesting if somewhat meandering trip into the perilous world of diagnosing psychopaths, The Psychopath Test is not exactly a weighty, heavily-researched book, but it will be of interest to anyone who has an, ahem, clinical interest in psychopaths."
97,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14084605-pink,4,"A real thought provoker. What is a psychopath? Are you a psychopath? How about your friends or co-workers? This book will leave you diagnosing everyone you know and becoming all powerful with your new amazing psychopath detection skills, just like Jon Ronson. The book really made me think about how mental illness is defined. Sure there are clear cut cases of insanity and sanity, but there's a huge area in the middle, with a range of diagnoses that are possible to be made and indeed are being sweepingly made and medicated for across the world. Quite apart from the issues of psychopath detection and detention, there were some interesting stories. A wide range of people were interviewed for his research and I was fascinated by several of their lives, whether they were the professionals, or the patients. This was my first Jon Ronson book and I haven't read any of his journalistic material so his style of writing is all new to me. I appreciated the humour and details about himself that were included, which broke up some pretty heavy content at times. I also liked how the book came full circle and re-visited the people at the beginning of his journey, which gave closure to their own stories. Much recommended and I can't wait to read more of his books now! "
98,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37830213-zuky-the-bookbum,5,Final rating: 4.5This was a really fun and intriguing read! I love Ronson's writing and journalistic style.
99,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4529669-willow,4,"Jon Ronson is a hoot. It would be great to have lunch with him. He puts so much of himself into his writing, bringing up his own little insecurities and observations, pretty much showing that he’ll be happy to go anywhere or do anything provided there’s a good story. This book is all over the place following Jon around and he brings up different case studies after another. In fact, I’m not sure they had that much in common with each other except that Jon decided they were worth investigating. This ‘all over the place’ is the book’s weakness and the reason I knocked a star. You see, I’m not sure Jon really proved his point. That doesn’t mean it wasn’t informative and entertaining. I definitely learned a lot about the psychopath test, which is here by the way: http://thinkcreatedesign.wordpress.co...Some of the provocative ideas this book brings up is that psychopaths may actually have a brain abnormality that has to do with their amygdale. They don’t feel the full range of emotions like most people. This makes them fearless, lacking in empathy and they gravitate toward positions of power because they are missing regular emotional stimulation. There could be one psychopath in every hundred people. Jon even jokes that he started seeing psychopaths everywhere once he acquired his new psychopath spotting skills. Obviously he’s not the only one with psychopath spotting skills. One of the reviews on GR even suggested that pretty much everybody in the GOP is a psychopath, posting pictures. Judging by the seriousness of her review, and the lack of seriousness in Jon’s book, I can’t help but think that she ignored the last quarter of the book. That’s because by the end, Jon is rethinking what he’s learned about psychopaths and the psychopath test, suggesting that nothing is cut and dried, and scoring high on a test shouldn’t get you locked away forever. He takes a look at criminal profilers and some of their serious blunders (something crime shows rarely show on TV). If the police are convinced you are the culprit, or a doctor wants to slap a diagnosis on you, they will find a way, because that’s what they want to find. Both the media, the pharmaceutical companies, and the public want to promote mental illness for different reasons. Categorizing is something humans love to do. We look for order in a chaotic world. It’s comforting. And sometimes when people are trying to fit someone in a personality box, we ignore all the things that make them not fit there. Psychology is not an exact science I’ve read that The Society for the Scientific Study of Psychopathy (SSSP) published a statement regarding this book stating that certain interviews in it were exaggerated or fictionalised and that they ""think that Ronson’s book trivializes a serious personality disorder and its measurement, which is not helpful to those who have the disorder or to their unfortunate victims"".This statement made me laugh, because I don’t think this book was ever meant to be a deep serious study of psychopaths. It’s more about Jon investigating them, and coming up with different conclusions. He’s a thoughtful writer and I enjoyed reading his observations. I think this book raises more questions than it answers. I love that. "
100,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1016626-tim-pendry,3,"This book is being promoted as 'comic'. Sadly, it is not. It is quite a sad read. I laughed once out loud and smiled twice but only in the first chapter. If you end this book laughing, you have not ‘got it’. You should leave it a little angry and troubled.Ronson exhibits all the graces and the flaws of modern British journalism. It is an easy read. The man is self-questioning (though clearly not too deeply lest he cease to function) and he is honest. But he is also skimming the surface of issues that require a far tougher and better book than this.Perhaps he is being cleverer than I think. Perhaps his periodic questioning of the way his profession turns reality into narratives, into modern folk tales, will create a suspicion in the public's mind about how it receives information, how its mental world is structured. I think not.The book is about the phenomenon of the psychopath which operates at so many levels as part of our cultural self-definition. As a species, we tend to need a scapegoat for structural ills that derive from our own nature - so, why not the 'psychopath' in our culture.Perhaps 1% of the population is 'psychopathic' in the sense of presenting a reasonable danger to others under certain conditions. Perhaps another 5% have traits that could be dangerous under yet other more extreme conditions. I suspect 88% are just a danger to themselves as ‘normals’.Political fear (I speak as a radical empath who is in the 'other' 6%, potentially equally dangerous to society for completely different reasons) seems to be determining that media headlines must ensure that 'psychopaths' are defined for incarceration by their nature rather than by their deeds.Yet, as Charlie Chaplin’s M. Verdoux so eloquently put it in the film of that name, it is not the single psychopath whose default mode is tolerance for enormous crimes against humanity but the vast ‘normal’ mass who vote, work and play without much of a thought in their little minds.Ronson opens the door to such subversive thinking but he only peeks in. The psychopath in Broadmoor is judged fit for release and we know it is a gamble. The corporate boss targeted as a psychopath turns out to be depressingly conventional in his private life. So far, so ‘normal’.But Scientologists prove to be champions of human rights and psychiatrists appear to be at forefront of new sociologies of population control, aided by pharmaceuticals interests who turn any mild abnormality from a genetic variant of possible evolutionary value into a diagnosed disease.Some of the most ethically filthy conduct in the book, leading to suicide and death in their victims, come from ‘normals’, the same sort of ‘normal’ who obeys an order in a war or who thinks corporate career progression is a substitute for personal responsibility.The book deserves better than its jokey style. Perhaps the jokey style will build more understanding amongst the general population and that is its justification. Unfortunately, it will probably just flow off most ‘normal’s backs like that of the proverbial duck.So let us try the analysis here that Ronson seems nervous of attempting – that hoary old business, no doubt, in his case, of just being a reporter, just telling a story.First, as he rightly points out, there really are very dangerous persons which we have termed psychopaths but which are simply at one genetic and personality end of our human Bell Curve. They are not monsters, they are human. They are simply accentuations of aspects of our normal selves.Society needs protection but it also needs to recognize, in different ecological circumstances, that they may be more important to us than ourselves in the future of our own species. We have to hope we hang on to civilization long enough to ensure that they are never needed.Second, these dangerous ones are there but they are rare. We cannot build our entire social structure around protecting ourselves from what amounts to a force of nature any more than we should be degenerating as a free and questioning culture because of a few terrorists.Faced with nature, sometimes bad things happen. They will continue to happen. ‘The bomber will always get through’. This is what we are as humans. It is dreadful for the victim but these cases are still rare and we should concentrate on a society that polices itself and is not policed.What is happening is that the existence of the genuine psychopath and the genuine terrorist is being used by the authoritarian bureaucrat to introduce ever-increasing controls on our movement, conduct and language (aspirationally, on our minds) in an attempt to manage the unmanageable.Without the ‘noble lie’ of a religion, with no Pope to serve Constantine, the bureaucrats are turning to definitional analysis and what they like to call science but which is no more scientific than was Lysenko under Stalin. If this book does one service, it is to cast doubt on the more radical scientific credentials of psychology.Over the last two decades, the psychologists and social scientists have found themselves riding on a lucrative gravy train medicalising ‘misbehaviour’ and unhappiness and offering cures based on chemicals and incarceration. The sick are becoming overwhelmed by the worried and the inconvenient.These new priests of the mind are now busy perpetrating the lie of there being no free will (a spurious philosophical conclusion from consciousness studies by people who could usefully spend some time reading the great existentialists) and the even worse lie of a beneficent normality.It was men in white coats who murdered the physically abnormal in euthanasia programmes under national-socialism. It is now men in white coats who are engaged in soul murder against the mentally different. There are throw-away stories in the book of how gays and feminists could lobby successfully to ensure that certain psychological definitions were abandoned. Either science is science or it is not. Scientific decision-making in physics would not allow the peer review to include a lobbyist.‘Conditions’ that have no politically powerful lobbies against them also have many commercial and family interests seeking their establishment. But we have to keep our feet on the ground. If social science and psychology are socio-political tools, there are still things to be cured or managed.There are people seriously suffering pain (yet the system still refuses to let psychiatrists test low dosage levels of psychedelics for depression and trauma). There is certainly work to be done on re-engineering society for relief from anxiety and self empowerment.What is grossly unacceptable is to allow social or family order requirements to permit collusion between drug companies, a morally degenerate professional class and the state or parents in the use of drugs for social control of behaviours that are merely inconvenient or embarrassing.We live in monstrous times. This book, to its credit, opens the door on the monsters – psychopathic and professional alike. We have a choice to go through the door and see what our society has become or shut it and pretend it is not happening. So, my regret about this well-written, entertaining and thought-provoking book is that Ronson limits himself to anecdotes and questions. ‘Normals’ will pick this up, be entertained and go back to being ‘normal’ again. ‘Normal’ people are the shills for the men in white coats and grey suits. What we really need now are writers who show people that just being ‘normal’ (and certainly being ‘normalised’) is damned dangerous to them and to their kids’ future and that ‘normal’ now means little more than manageable and controllable. Ronson merely skims the surface of this story."
101,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara,5,"I couldn't imagine that a book about psychopaths would be so good! Ronson interviews lots of people including people in institutions for the criminally insane, Scientologists, psychiatrists and conspiracy theorists. Ronson also has a very engaging narrating style. We all encounter psychopaths, and sometimes it takes time for us to realize the person has a personality disorder. They may be work colleagues, neighbors, and other people we interact with. It has helped me at times to realize that someone's behavior fits the parameters of psychopathy. Of course, Ronson also explores cases where individuals have been institutionalized for years or even a lifetime without adequate evidence that they continue to be a threat to others. I recommend this to anyone interested in the topic of psychopathic behavior but don't want a technical treatment for the subject."
102,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"Entertaining and a surprisingly breezy read, The Psychopath Test is a somewhat rambling and ultimately non-conclusive record of an investigative journey into the mental health industry, conspiracy theories and scientology. The author meets some very interesting people -- about whom you can form your own conclusions: I was never exactly happy about Bob Hare.I enjoyed reading it, but oddly I'm not sure I can recommend it. Looking back at it, there's not much substance, and isn't as hilariously funny as the blurb and reviews on the back would have you believe -- then again, I don't think it was a waste of time either."
103,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62761616-imane,4,"This was an enjoyable read. In addition to defining and describing the traits of psychopathy, the author raises some questions regarding the sanity of the industry of psychiatry .Overall it was informative, funny and sometimes disturbing; reading about the brutal murders was not my favorite part but if you are looking for ways to spot a psychopath then this book is the one. "
104,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5487874-g,3,"3.5/5Less of ""a journey through the madness industry"" and more of a random romp. Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable one. The Psychopath Test didn't bring me any greater clarity on the subject. Instead, it gave me more to think about. And, frankly, I'm not not mad about that. I'd actually like to read more of Jon Ronson's work."
105,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,4,"4.5 starsJon Ronson is one of those writers - like David Sedaris - whose voice you hear as you read his words; the soft, slightly effete, often uncertain lilt of his sounding in the reader's inner ear. This is one of the things that makes him such an engaging writer, along with his style of placing himself (and his neuroses, which are particularly apposite in this context) directly in view, a method which rather than obscuring his subjects illuminates them, by giving us such an upfront view. The very subjectivity of Ronson's journalistic style allows us to see the complexity of the tale with clarity.In this book Ronson stitches together, as usual, stories that illuminate a single theme - initially tied loosely but bound tighter and tighter as the book progresses. The chapters each involve a way in which we view madness, starting with his own rather off-hand description of an interviewee as a ""psychopath"" and his involvement in an entirely unrelated mystery (which is ultimately used to bookend the volume) which then spirals off from his increasing fascination with the diagnosis of mental disorders following delving into the DSM-IV (and subsequent self diagnosis of a dozen disorders). We meet a patient at Broadmoor high security psychiatric hospital, committed following an insanity plea when on trial for GBH and a subsequent diagnosis as a psychopath, a history of that disorder and its diagnosis and treatment, and then on to a gallery of cases involving both people Ronson has interviewed (psychologists, psychiatrists, a former Haitian paramilitary leader, a corporate CEO famous for his glee in downsizing for fun and profit, former MI5 agent David Shayler) and others whose lives have been changed by direct or indirect contact either those who may have psychiatric disorders or with the madness industry tat has grown around them.The connecting thread is this; that over recent decades we have become increasingly fond of defining behaviours that lay on the spectrum of human personality as 'disorders', using methods which may or may not be scientific and may or may not be accurate. There is plenty of questioning of those methods in this book, but the criticism is largely leveled at those people and organisations that are too ready to use these blunt tools for their own ends - whether it is the pharmaceutical industry and their ever increasing push to medicate human difference or the Metropolitan Police entrapping a neat suspect in a murder case despite a complete lack of evidence, while possibly allowing the actual killer the freedom to kill again.Ronson is sometimes described as a humorist (as does Will Self in his Guardian review quoted on the blurb) but I think this is entirely misleading. Ronson is and always has been a journalist, albeit one who uses his wit and humour to allow us insights to the things about which he writes, a technique which is also effective when he drops it to highlight the sad or horrific - the town of Shubuta, Mississippi, devastated when the local toaster factory was closed to increase the manufacturing company's share price, the murders committed by actual violent psychopaths, the deaths and harm caused by the 'reality' TV industry when they have focused on a distorted view of what is not 'normal'. And, unlike much journalism, this does not attempt to give definite answers; the threads Ronson has drawn together are tied neatly enough to make sense but with enough frayed, trailing lines to leave the reader pondering long after closing the book."
106,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,4,"So Jon Ronson, the man who brought the theory that the world is run by extraterrestrial lizard people to the world's attention, turns his worried gaze to psychopaths. He wrote something like a deeply ambivalent travelogue of his time writing this book. We meet death squad leaders and CEOs who love firing people. We meet a man wrongly picked by a criminal profiler as a brutal killer and we meet Scientologists. We meet the man who helped get homosexuality out of the DSM as a psychiatric condition and we meet a guy who tried nude LSD-assisted psychotherapy for criminal psychopaths. We meet a man who believes no one blew themselves up in subway cars in London one July day and we meet a woman on one of those subway cars. And what do we learn? I’m not sure. That psychiatry started using check lists to standardize diagnoses and the pharmacologization of psychiatry followed, yes. That now in three days, you too can diagnose psychopaths with a handy dandy 40 question check list, yes. But those are headlines, not books. That psychopaths are both like, and unlike, extraterrestrial lizard people, maybe. I quite enjoyed this book. I’m struggling to find something useful to say about it. As foreshadowed above, ambivalent travelogue is the best I’ve come up with. I thought at first the thesis was that psychopaths are everywhere, disproportionately in positions of power, and how they use that power destroys the world. Bob Hare, the man who developed the psychopath test itself, told Ronson he regretted doing so much of his work in prisons instead of on the stock exchange. When Ronson protested that serial killers were worse than psychopathic stock brokers, Hare said:‘“Serial killers ruin families.’ Bob shrugged. ‘Corporate and political and religious psychopaths ruin economies. They ruin societies.’	“This – Bob was saying – was the straightforward solution to the greatest mystery of all: why is the world so unfair? Why all that savage economic injustice, those brutal wars, the everyday corporate cruelty? The answer: psychopaths. The part of the brain that doesn’t function right. . . . . We aren’t all good people just trying to do good. Some of us are psychopaths. And psychopaths are to blame for this brutal, misshapen society. They’re the jagged rocks thrown into the still pond.” (112)And that moved me deeply. But Ronson doesn’t develop that thesis. Instead, he travelogues his earnest conversations with marginal nutball after marginal nutball, takes a brief foray into how the modern psychiatric profession became what it is today, then returns us to a secure psychiatric facility to watch a man committed for years after faking madness be released. Maybe there’s nothing more to be said on that. The idea that psychopaths drive the action on the world stage may be just too depressing to stare at for too long, even if you do have a BBC film crew with you. It was a good book. Well worth reading. I have the nagging feeling there was a better one inchoate in the source material, but I’m dead certain Ronson did better than I would have writing it. "
107,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3397530-lea,4,"I am a huuuuuge Jon Ronson fan, so it's no surprise that I enjoyed this book too. The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry lives up to its title -- Ronson really does take the reader on a journey through the ""madness industry"". The book opens with a bit of a mystery concerning an unusual book that was mailed to various academics throughout the world. At first it doesn't seem to fit the theme of the book, but Ronson ties it in eventually. His typical style is to jump around between subjects, finding common themes, and this book is no different -- we meet an incarcerated psychopath (who may not, in fact, be a psychopath at all), learn about the methods of diagnosing psychopathy, investigate current psychological diagnoses (especially those in children), and see another possible psychopath's positive spin on those ""negative"" traits. The book also looks at Scientology's war on psychiatry, the experimental psychiatric treatments of the 1970s, and criminal profiling. The author covers a lot of ground here, but it's a very fast read. There are several parts that are unsettling -- some crime descriptions, the kafka-esque plight of those stuck in a psychiatric catch-22, a child's accidental overdose of psychiatric medication -- although that could be more indicative of my sensitivity than anythng else.As usual, Ronson explores his own feelings and anxieties as well. Some readers may find this annoying, although his fans most likely won't -- I enjoy those parts of his books!All in all, I really enjoyed this book, and I would recommend it, especially if you've read and liked his previous books."
108,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948275-josh,3,"Let me begin by saying that the title is deceiving. While it does go into the subject of psychopaths and eventually ends with it, there are many points at which I felt like Ronson's main objective was the critique the overall approach to mental disorders that this country (and other researchers from other countries around the world) have taken over the years. We've gotten ourselves into the habit of classifying every little oddity in our personalities as something strange and unwanted, rather than looking at people as individuals with individualistic tendencies -- and this is especially true when it comes to differences of the mind and its inner workings. So, the fact that I was reading this book as a way into psychopaths and psychopaths alone left me with a unsavory taste once I started to realize that there was much more going on here that I wasn't prepared for. Which isn't to say that I disliked any of what was in the book. There are some very interesting (and entertaining) takes on issues such as Scientology, childhood psychiatry, and even conspiracy theorists. However, that's not what the title of the book leads you to believe the book is about. And I call that false advertisement. And no matter how entertaining this book ended up being (and it was -- Ronson tells a story here, with a plot and everything, rather than reporting like a journalist), no matter how drawn in I was into the story he created, the fact still remains that I don't feel like I learned nearly enough about psychopaths as I should have from a book titled, ""The Psychopath Test."""

Listened to the audiobook read by the author himself, and was hooked after only a few minutes; then when Ronson started talking about Douglas Hofstadter and Scientologists I had to think ""I am so lucky to be listening to this book!"" I learned about how the original DSM was created - how arbitrary all those diagnoses are - and that's (can I say:) depressing. I should write a thoughtful review but I am pressed for time, so I will quote Laura Miller at Salon: [Ronson is] not afraid to play the feckless neurotic for laughs, but that doesn't obscure the serious questions raise by his investigations. Psychiatric diagnoses (and, these days, the medications that follow) really can become fads, with certain experts suddenly deciding that multiple personality disorder or childhood bipolar disorder are far more common that ever before suspected. Ronson even finds the occasion for a little professional soul-searching; he accuses himself and other journalists of being the Goldilocks of craziness, seeking out people to write about who are just nuts enough to be colorful but not so disturbed that they're downright sad."
111,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4845040-gregory,5,"Mr. Ronson puts forth ideas, scenarios, and real life observations in a easily read format. He writes so fluently that reading this book is like breathing. I just started it yesternight and about a 1/3 of the way through, he also highlights certain aspects of the study of the mind in relation to its historcal perspective(s).Although the subject/topics are a bit challenging, if you think you may be interested in this book, It is well worth your time. Also, I think his paradigm exposes/shows us concepts perhaps that may have permeated some of our current and past leaders in all walks of life. Something to consider and think about.My hats off to Mr. Ronson, Great job.This is an excellent book and it is excellently written. I believe I will read it again very soon just to see what I missed: even dispite the topic difficulty.It really gives you a great deal to think about, and seems related to Brightsided, in terms of some modern moras."
112,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/326263-patrick,4,"I blame Ronson for turning me on to mega-nut David Icke and his endlessly entertaining Lizard people conspiracy theory in ""Them: Adventures with Extremists.""In this one he's asked to investigate an elaborate and weird hoax involving a book called ""Being or Nothingness,"" by Joe K. - which takes him to Indiana and Douglas Hofstadter (""Godel, Escher, Bach"").That in turn sets him off on psychopaths, the Hare Psychopathy Checklist. Lots of oddballs emerge.Ronson's got a funny style, and apparently a real knack for tracking down the world's screwballs. Very interesting and enjoyable.Also uncomfortable at times, especially when the reader starts considering the psychopath checklist in terms of himself or his friends."
113,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina,2,"This is actually a 1.5 stars book. Meh. The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson has absolutely nothing of interest to say. It's been on my ""to read"" shelf for a while so when I impulsively bought it one day while sitting bored in a doctor's office, I couldn't remember why I had wanted to read it, just that I did. Why can't I learn my lesson about impulsive book-buying? It rarely turns out well. Ronson starts the book by recounting the Mystery of the Mysterious Book. An expensively produced, attractive hard bound book was sent to various academics around the world and none of them can figure out why they received the book or what its purpose is. The sender is unknown, but the books were sent from Sweden. Ronson is recruited to solve the mystery. Along the way, he gets interested in the idea of mental illness and psychopaths and also begins pursing the idea of what it means to be diagnosed as a psychopath and how they are diagnosed. Ronson interviews various psychologists in the field, including Robert Hare, creator of the PCL-R (the Hare Checklist for psychopathology). Ronson also talks with people who doubt the accuracy of the PCL-R (Scientologists...ha ha ha ha), discusses his own neuroses and anxieties, muses on the tendency of psychologists these days to over-analyze, abuses the exclamation mark and makes a lot of lame jokes. This is an idiotic book. I would not recommend it to anyone who is interested in psychopathology and either has a good layperson's understanding of psychopathology or is a professional in the field of psychology (unless that person wants a good laugh). Some of the books Ronson lists as research sources I've already read (plus Harvey Cleckley's Mask of Sanity which Ronson mentions but didn't read) so I already knew more about psychopathology than the author; this revelation did not make me happy. When Ronson begins to explore the subject, he has only the vaguest (Hollywood-influenced) idea of psychopaths and who does he turn to first? Why, Scientologists of course. I mean, if I wanted an understanding of any topic in the field of psychology, I would automatically turn to a group of nutbars who believe in aliens but think psychology is nonsense. A group within Scientologists called the CCHR (Citizens Commission on Human Rights) have made it their mission to ""prove to the world that psychiatrists are wicked and must be stopped"" (28). Ronson is impressed by their record of exposing some very bad psychiatrists...well, yes, they did expose some bad ones, but the examples that Ronson provides (provided to him by the CCHR) are fairly obvious quacks (or mentally ill individuals) who were in the field for reasons other than to honestly practice the profession. Eventually Ronson decides that talking to actual psychologists instead of Scientologists is a good idea. I got fairly disgusted early on when a Scientologist took him to Broadmoor (insane asylum in England) to meet a psychopath (Tony) who isn't really a psychopath--he just pretended to be one so he could avoid prison. Once in Broadmoor, surprise surprise, Tony is diagnosed as a psychopath. Ronson listens to Tony's story of woe without (seemingly) a critical thought in his head. Because at this point Ronson still hasn't done any research about psychopaths, he is completely taken in by Tony's story and believes he is wrongly incarcerated. It's not until later when he talks with Tony's doctor does he have a more informed view of Tony and why he is at Broadmoor. This whole book irritates me because I can't decide if Ronson is really such an idiot or if he possesses some sly sense of humor I can't perceive. When Ronson finally gets to Robert Hare and his pathology checklist, I'm again annoyed. He walks around with the checklist and interviews people whose behavior suggests psychopathology (most notable: Al Dunlap, former CEO--and destroyer--of the Sunbeam Corporation and Emmanuel ""Toto"" Constant, leader of the paramilitary group FRAPH in Haiti). Ronson mentally checks off each psychopath characteristic (Item 6: Lack of Remorse or Guilt, Item 7: Shallow Affect) he thinks they display as he interviews them. With Dunlap, Ronson goes straight through the list and directly asks him about each item. Ronson describes himself as feeling powerful because he has this secret knowledge and can identify psychopaths. What Ronson (willfully?) forgets (ignores?) is that it's not enough to say, yeah, this person seems to not have empathy or sympathy, but an interviewee also has to determine to what degree this person doesn't have sympathy. Maybe some things do bother him and others don't. I understand that at least one of Ronson's objectives of the book is to say, hey, it's way too easy to diagnose someone with a mental illness by going through a list. Well, yeah. This is not a revelation. The fact that Ronson thinks this state of affairs within the psychology/psychiatry field is shocking is, in itself, shocking. What field doesn't have its instances of abuse and misuse? He has a chapter discussing how children are diagnosed with bipolar disorders and then prescribed drugs to treat this (as many psychologists think) imaginary children's condition. It's apparently the latest fad. Parents with kids who are moody or restless or high-energy and don't have the time to deal with them get their children diagnosed with something (for a while ADHD was huge; maybe it still is) and doped up. Parents aren't necessarily to blame; there are the professionals who misdiagnose and the pharmaceutical industry eager to make money any way it can. Many factors create and exacerbate the abuse of Hare's PCL-R and the way anyone is misdiagnosed and over-medicated. The Psychopath Test is generally a mess of a book. There's no clear thesis/objective for the book. What exactly is Ronson investigating? What is he trying to prove? His discussion of the PCL-R is thrown off track by the chapter detailing how the DSM is created (a rather haphazard and unscientific process if Ronson's information is correct) and the misdiagnosis of children. If Ronson wanted to explore the abuses of psychology and psychiatry (combined with the shady connection between psychiatrists and the pharmaceutical industry), then why didn't he do that? This book is merely a glib commentary on several topics combined with the author's (non-humorous) observations of his own anxieties and neuroses. Although I did not like how he approached the topic nor how he wrote it, I am still interested in reading (if not buying) Ronson's other books. It's clear that Ronson was out of his depth with this subject. "
114,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22440207-agn,4,"WHAT IS IT ABOUT?In his book “The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry,” a bestselling journalist Jon Ronson, propelled by a mysterious hoax played on the world’s leading scientists, dives into the world of madness to explore just how mad we really are. During his two-year journey, Ronson not only interviews a bunch of madmen as well as several influential psychologists, psychiatrists and anti-psychiatric Scientologists but also practices his newly gained skill of using Hare Psychopathy Checklist to spot psychopaths. Unexpectedly and quite disturbingly, the author discovers the society’s drive for the ‘right amount’ of insanity, and often detrimental tendency to define individuals by their maddest edges.THUMBS UP:1) Intriguing introduction.The first chapter of “The Psychopath Test” is THE BEST (mysterious, suspenseful and utterly captivating) introductory chapter I have ever read in a non-fiction book. The opening story is so bizarre it can be easily turned into a book itself.2) Well researched, skillfully written.Ronson’s style is quite humorous and engaging, making his non-fiction very readable and not in the least dry. Also, the author put quite some time and effort into researching and interviewing, which allowed him to explore the madness industry from multiple perspectives, which in turn enables the readers to form their own opinions on the matter. COULD BE BETTER:1) Not what I expected.I guess it’s not really the author’s fault, but I was expecting this book to be more about psychopaths and less about everything else. Instead, at least half of the book has little to do with psychopathy as the author probes multiple issues related to general insanity. It works this way as well, but I was hoping for an in-depth exploration of the psychopath’s mind and thus was a tiny bit disappointed.2) Fragmented and seemingly directionless.While I was reading “The Psychopath Test,” I felt rather confused as if the story has been patched together from several seemingly unrelated parts: at first the book seemed like a really engaging mystery, then it became psychopath-oriented, but soon enough the chapters became quite independent, loosely connected by the general madness theme. Honestly, up until the final chapters I wasn’t sure where the story was going. Although at the very end the author’s intentions became more or less clear, Ronson could have done a better job guiding the reader throughout the whole book.VERDICT: 4 out of 5Although “The Psychopath Test” might seem a little fragmented and directionless, it is nonetheless a very entertaining non-fiction that carries an important message."
115,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7232207-fiona,3,"I had a run-in with a psychopath once. I definitely came out worse from that encounter.But that's the thing that I just can't get my head around: once upon a time, I met a bona fide psychopath and in hindsight it was really, really noticeable! But if, according to Jon Ronson and his sources, psychopaths make up a little less than 1% of the population, where are all the rest of them? Are one in ten Londoners psychopathic? (Apparently they head for big cities.) Are prisons disproportionately full of them? I mean, I imagine so, but even that wouldn't account for the fact that I've identifiably met considerably fewer of them than I would expect to. Where've I been? Mostly (in my adult life) legal academia, the construction industry, and musical theatre. Hardly hotbeds of the empathetic.So something is a bit off, and I think Jon Ronson also knows this: his book is not just called Psychopaths, but The Psychopath Test - it's also partly about diagnosis of mental health problems. It's really engaging, and Ronson is a great writer, but it's hardly in depth. He's got a really light touch, skipping from prison populations to business management, to the writing of DSM-III, to the potential for misdiagnosis of childhood ADHD. This is a 250-page book! I feel like the book poses more questions than it answers, mainly because there's not enough time, and Ronson has no apparent inclination, to go into anything in any depth. He's just spotted something shiny and moved on.So what do I want to know about psychopaths? Well, what I'm missing, for a start. I don't believe that nearly one in a hundred people on this earth are incurably heinous, robot-hearted monsters with no souls and an aptitude on the London Stock Exchange. So is the percentage smaller, or does psychopathy actually mean something different to that? Is it possible to have all these traits and still have a meaningful life, loving relationships and friendships, and do some good in the world? I'm sure it must be; coming out of this book, I saw no indication of it. Have a bit of optimism, Jon! The world's not completely up the creek. It can't be as totally hopeless as you make it out to be. Which means - what aren't you telling me?"
116,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526809-donna,4,"Saw the interview on 'John Stewart', then ordered it like a cubic zirconia tennis bracelet from The Shopping Channel. I got a slow start with it. The Kindle app formatting is kinda shitty. stray lines. Typos. I kept asking myself whether anybody checked it out beforehand. Then again, maybe they wanted it to look that way. Once I got used to this clash of esthetics, I found it a great deal of fun. Wha? A book about psychopathy fun? He doesn't just seek out the usual suspects. He talks to Bob Hare who came up with the oft used checklist to spot it. I was worried at first, that Ronson would turn out to be one of tthose 'it all comes back to me' sorts of interviewers, but he asked many of the questions I would have liked to ask. He doesn't give the impression of being thorough, but he is. So he talked with Bob Hare, which resulted in his seeing psychopaths everywhere. He visited Al Dunlap, dismantler of Sunbeam to wonder whether he might be one. ""He pointed at a sculpture of four sharks encircling the planet. 'I believe in predators,' he said. 'Their spirit will enable you to succeed. Over there you've got falcons. Alligators. Alligators. More alligators. Tigers.' 'It's As if both Midas and also the Queen of Narnia were here,' I said, 'and the Queen of Narnia flew above a particularly fierce zoo and turned everything there to stone and then transported everything here.' 'What?' said Al. 'Nothing,' I said. 'No,' he said, 'What did you just say?' He shot me a steely, blue-eyed stare, which I found quite debilitating. ""I appreciated how he took the subject out of prison where we, the still living prey can really relate to it. Of course,I liked this because it's really all about me. Without seeming to, he also gets into some searching questions about journalism and madness. "
117,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4636758-vanessa,4,"I really enjoyed this book. I have for a while now had an interest in psychology and mental disorders of various kinds, finding them absolutely fascinating to read about. Psychopathy (or sociopathy) was something, however, that I didn't really know much about prior to reading this book. I certainly hadn't heard of The Psychopath Test, created by Bob Hare, a Canadian criminal psychologist.In his book, Ronson shares his encounters with various people that may or may not be classified as psychopaths, from a man known only as ""Tony"" who 'fakes' madness to get out of a prison sentence, to Al Dunlap, a retired corporate executive with a tendency to see factors on the Psychopath Test as positive in the eyes of business. All is told from the humorous and objective viewpoint of Ronson, whilst over-analysing his own motivations in true anxiety-related style.Ronson reminded me a lot of myself at points in this book, and I really enjoyed the way he structured his book and the interviews he conducted. I will definitely be seeking out more of his work, and if you have any interest in the topic of psychopathy, or are a fan of gonzo-style journalism, then I would highly recommend this."
118,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3659939-bree,4,"Really, really enjoyed this. First of all, I listened to the audiobook and Jon Ronson's voice reminds me of Neil Gaiman's, so already it's a win. It's fascinating to consider how psychopathy is diagnosed and what that diagnosis means. Most human beings display some psychopathic traits from time to time, but how do you determine when someone displays enough to be considered a danger to society? Jon Ronson's writing is humorous, fun, and completely engaging. At times the structure of the book felt a little disjointed, but I appreciated how it all came together at the end. Because much of the book consists of interviews with various psychiatrists and psychopaths (and maybe-psychopaths), the reader is able to come to their own conclusions rather than relying on the author to tell you what to think. "
119,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,4,"This is the sort of book that I tend to enjoy – a journalist tells amusing stories about his investigations into a particular topic – but which readers with a more focused interest in the purported subject may find frustrating. Ronson portrays himself as a cheerfully unmethodical explorer of the world of craziness, meeting with experts, prisoners, and potentially psychotic retired executives and presenting their stories and his responses in a lively, vivid style. Some of the stories involved, almost necessarily, are rather horrible, but he keeps the gruesome stuff to a minimum and finds the absurd humor in situations where you might not expect to find it. As engaging and entertaining a book on psychopaths as you are likely to find, and I particularly enjoyed the way he concluded his story. Four and a half stars."
120,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,4,"Ok, first of all, I have to admit I have a soft spot in my heart for the pop-psy. That being said, I really enjoyed this well-rounded take on psychopathy; from the use of labels to the tests to determine if a person is one. He did not take a position and try to convince us, except as a story technique, but that was also done as a full circle. Very good writing for what it is. I loved the same style turned on scientologists and their crusade against psychiatry, the psychopharmacology industry, and the creators of the DSM III through IV (although I would have loved him to take on V as well).He's the same writer of The Men Who Stare At Goats, which I thought was a very funny movie, and I'll have to read that book now. I've become a fan of the author. :)"

“Suddenly, madness was everywhere, and I was determined to learn about the impact it had on the way society evolves. I've always believed society to be a fundamentally rational thing, but what if it isn't? What if it is built on insanity?”

 The book was engaging, I enjoyed reading it, however I couldn't help being a little disappointed. While Ronson makes a few good points and raises some good questions, I was hoping the book would go deeper into the world of psychopaths, instead it was mainly focused on his journey of researching the topic. However, I can't hold this too hard against the book as Jon Ronson is an investigative journalist, not a mental health care specialist."
122,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7022024-mike,4,"For a book about psychopaths this was a surprisingly light(ish, come on, we're still talking about psychopaths here) read. The author is a journalist and it covers a wide range of the topic from interviewing a few (suspected) psychopaths, to speaking with psychiatrists who are involved in psychopathy and the classification there of, to scientologists, to neurologists who examined the brains of normal people and psychopaths. It is a fast read of a book that I think does a good job being honest and truth seeking.The psychopath test in this book, called Hare Psychopathy Checklist presents a set of characteristics a person can be graded on. Score too high and you just might be a psychopath. Once the author had learned of this test and taken a seminar about it he started to see it both in his own behavior and others, annotating his interactions with others with various qualities on the test. Instead of narrowly focusing on just psychopaths (and mostly avoiding the lurid details of the more famous/horrifying ones) Ronson presents the reader with a broad, if shallow, survey of the field. He also does an excellent job of linking together different parts of the history of psychology and how those events impact the modern world (such as the explosion of psychological disorder classifications, the massive expansion of pharmaceuticals to ""treat"" these conditions, and how the entertainment industry, especially reality TV, benefits from just the right amount of madness). I found his writing style very accessible and the presentation of the interviews and facts well conveyed without becoming too dry or boring.The animating force behind the book was a weird event where a bunch of scientists from all over the world get a strange, cryptic book. They banded to together over the internet to try and figure it out but were flummoxed. One of the scientists in question contacted Ronson to help and he eventually tracked down the person he thought was responsible. Turns out it likely wasn't some genius mystery maker but likely a slightly off kilter Swede. But Ronson was intrigued by how much this solitary person caused the world to change and wondered how much of the state of the world was due to psychopaths. While he doesn't answer the question (many others, including folks he interviewed, have delved into this) he does write about how psychopathy did appear to be more prevalent in business circles. Given how much havoc financial decisions can make (shutting down manufacturing plants, crashing the economy, putting profits before people, etc.). All in all a fast and interesting read, but not one for people looking for a deeper understanding of psychopathy. I devoured it in the course of an intercontinental (unless you are one of those people who think the Americas are just one continent) and was found the experience both entertaining and enlightening."
123,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76697789-ryan-krueger,5,"** The Psychopath Test by Jon Robson is an informative non-fiction book. The book was written with intent to inform readers about the abundance of psychopaths in our world and how they impact our daily lives. The author is a journalist who has traveled the world to meet with professors, scientists, psychologists and more to find information on this subject to create a strong basis for the book. Ronson makes plenty of flights around the globe to meet with researchers as well as psychopaths themselves. His main point in this is to display how psychopaths are common in our lives whether it be the workplace or interacting with someone who seems in an everyday environment. The work discusses psychopaths lack of emotions such as fear or remorse and how that can lead some people to be at the top of the business chain. Due to them not having remorse they can be willing to fire half of their staff in one day with no regards to how it may affect their lives, while the boss’s mind is only focused on financial gains. A quote in the book goes, “Serial killers ruin families, corporate and political and religious psychopaths ruin economies. They ruin societies.”This is a very interesting book in my opinion as I have always had an interest in the wiring of people’s brains. The details included and quoted from psychopaths that he interviewed were intriguing as they would say stuff along the lines of them wanting to kill to see what blood looks like or what the insides of someone else looks like. The book raises issues on how psychopaths can ruin families, societies, and economies. It covers a wide range of topics and goes into detail on each area including how psychopaths can affect these issues. I agree with everything in this book except that the words psychopath and sociopath can be used interchangeably. After looking into this I’ve found various sources as well as teachers who stated that psychopaths are born the way they are and it’s genetics, while sociopaths are born through traumatic experiences and have capabilities of feeling remorse as well as developing relationships or bonds with others. This book answered a lot of questions I have had. There are two people in my life who I always wondered why they act the way they do but I realized that they are most likely a psychopath. However, it made me realize how easy it can be to target someone as a psychopath due to the bob hare psychopath test and how normal actions can be misinterpreted into a biased stance. As someone who has an interest in helping soldiers suffering from PTSD this relates to my personal agenda due to me having the possibility of preventing someone from becoming a sociopath. "

126,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,4,"While Jon Ronson reveals a great deal about his own neuroses in this book, he casts little light on the psychopaths he is allegedly researching, though he does give some interesting insights into the ""madness industry"" of psychologists who have studied, categorized, labeled, and tried to treat psychopaths, mostly without success.Ronson begins with a strange introduction to the field of psychology and mental illness thanks to a group of Scientologists, who chose him to ""expose"" the evils of psychology. Scientologists believe that all mental disorders are because of engrams accumulated from past lives or space aliens or some shit like that. L. Ron Hubbard had a particular hatred of psychologists. Ronson spends a little time discussing the peculiarities of Scientology, but this book is primarily about psychopaths and what makes them tick... and what makes the people who study them tick.After reading The Psychopath Test, it is not hard to believe that you have to be a little bit crazy to study crazy people. (Look out for those Abnormal Psychology majors...) From the arbitrariness of what goes into the DSM (did you know that far more copies are sold to interested non-academics/non-practitioners than to mental health professionals?) to the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, a diagnostic tool that's become a quick and dirty way to label someone a psychopath, to the Rosenhan Experiment, the history of psychology is filled with enough self-reinforcing bumbling and egomania to make one think the Scientologists may have a point.While Ronson's book is a collection of interesting anecdotes and observations, digressing into the overmedication of children, misdiagnoses of autism, and the brutality of capitalist devotion to ""shareholder value,"" between interviews with ex-death squad leaders and allegedly psychopathic CEO Al Dunlap, it's a bit weak in its critique of science, and sheds little light on his subjects.Martha Stout's book The Sociopath Next Door was more illuminating. Ronson does, however, give a bit of a glimpse into the mind of a sociopath in a way that Stout only addressed abstractly: how do sociopaths/psychopaths (there is no technical difference between them) see themselves? Do they recognize that they are ""broken""? Do they ever want to be cured, and can they be? (Short answer: no.)Ronson's interview with Al Dunlap was particularly interesting, as he actually confronted Dunlap with the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, and the allegations that Dunlap, according to this tool, scored high on the psychopathy scale. Dunlap proceeded to point out that every behavior presented as evidence of being a psychopath could also be interpreted as someone who has a forceful and driven personality who gets things done. True enough, there is a lot of evidence that psychopathy is an asset in positions of power, like boardrooms.Ronson is able to see how some of his subjects ape normal human reactions and manipulate people the way they'd handle a TV remote control, but others, like Al Dunlap, are more ambiguous. Is Dunlap really a psychopath, or just a merciless asshole? As both Stout and Ronson point out, even genuine psychopaths are rarely serial killers; most live law-abiding, respectable lives, though never out of any actual respect for the law or society.An interesting if somewhat meandering trip into the perilous world of diagnosing psychopaths, The Psychopath Test is not exactly a weighty, heavily-researched book, but it will be of interest to anyone who has an, ahem, clinical interest in psychopaths."

This book will leave you diagnosing everyone you know and becoming all powerful with your new amazing psychopath detection skills, just like Jon Ronson. The book really made me think about how mental illness is defined. Sure there are clear cut cases of insanity and sanity, but there's a huge area in the middle, with a range of diagnoses that are possible to be made and indeed are being sweepingly made and medicated for across the world. Quite apart from the issues of psychopath detection and detention, there were some interesting stories. A wide range of people were interviewed for his research and I was fascinated by several of their lives, whether they were the professionals, or the patients. This was my first Jon Ronson book and I haven't read any of his journalistic material so his style of writing is all new to me. I appreciated the humour and details about himself that were included, which broke up some pretty heavy content at times. I also liked how the book came full circle and re-visited the people at the beginning of his journey, which gave closure to their own stories. Much recommended and I can't wait to read more of his books now! "
128,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37830213-zuky-the-bookbum,5,Final rating: 4.5This was a really fun and intriguing read! I love Ronson's writing and journalistic style.
129,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4529669-willow,4,"Jon Ronson is a hoot. It would be great to have lunch with him. He puts so much of himself into his writing, bringing up his own little insecurities and observations, pretty much showing that he’ll be happy to go anywhere or do anything provided there’s a good story. This book is all over the place following Jon around and he brings up different case studies after another. In fact, I’m not sure they had that much in common with each other except that Jon decided they were worth investigating. This ‘all over the place’ is the book’s weakness and the reason I knocked a star. You see, I’m not sure Jon really proved his point. That doesn’t mean it wasn’t informative and entertaining. I definitely learned a lot about the psychopath test, which is here by the way: http://thinkcreatedesign.wordpress.co...Some of the provocative ideas this book brings up is that psychopaths may actually have a brain abnormality that has to do with their amygdale. They don’t feel the full range of emotions like most people. This makes them fearless, lacking in empathy and they gravitate toward positions of power because they are missing regular emotional stimulation. There could be one psychopath in every hundred people. Jon even jokes that he started seeing psychopaths everywhere once he acquired his new psychopath spotting skills. Obviously he’s not the only one with psychopath spotting skills. One of the reviews on GR even suggested that pretty much everybody in the GOP is a psychopath, posting pictures. Judging by the seriousness of her review, and the lack of seriousness in Jon’s book, I can’t help but think that she ignored the last quarter of the book. That’s because by the end, Jon is rethinking what he’s learned about psychopaths and the psychopath test, suggesting that nothing is cut and dried, and scoring high on a test shouldn’t get you locked away forever. He takes a look at criminal profilers and some of their serious blunders (something crime shows rarely show on TV). If the police are convinced you are the culprit, or a doctor wants to slap a diagnosis on you, they will find a way, because that’s what they want to find. Both the media, the pharmaceutical companies, and the public want to promote mental illness for different reasons. Categorizing is something humans love to do. We look for order in a chaotic world. It’s comforting. And sometimes when people are trying to fit someone in a personality box, we ignore all the things that make them not fit there. Psychology is not an exact science I’ve read that The Society for the Scientific Study of Psychopathy (SSSP) published a statement regarding this book stating that certain interviews in it were exaggerated or fictionalised and that they ""think that Ronson’s book trivializes a serious personality disorder and its measurement, which is not helpful to those who have the disorder or to their unfortunate victims"".This statement made me laugh, because I don’t think this book was ever meant to be a deep serious study of psychopaths. It’s more about Jon investigating them, and coming up with different conclusions. He’s a thoughtful writer and I enjoyed reading his observations. I think this book raises more questions than it answers. I love that. "
130,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1016626-tim-pendry,3,"This book is being promoted as 'comic'. Sadly, it is not. It is quite a sad read. I laughed once out loud and smiled twice but only in the first chapter. If you end this book laughing, you have not ‘got it’. You should leave it a little angry and troubled.Ronson exhibits all the graces and the flaws of modern British journalism. It is an easy read. The man is self-questioning (though clearly not too deeply lest he cease to function) and he is honest. But he is also skimming the surface of issues that require a far tougher and better book than this.Perhaps he is being cleverer than I think. Perhaps his periodic questioning of the way his profession turns reality into narratives, into modern folk tales, will create a suspicion in the public's mind about how it receives information, how its mental world is structured. I think not.The book is about the phenomenon of the psychopath which operates at so many levels as part of our cultural self-definition. As a species, we tend to need a scapegoat for structural ills that derive from our own nature - so, why not the 'psychopath' in our culture.Perhaps 1% of the population is 'psychopathic' in the sense of presenting a reasonable danger to others under certain conditions. Perhaps another 5% have traits that could be dangerous under yet other more extreme conditions. I suspect 88% are just a danger to themselves as ‘normals’.Political fear (I speak as a radical empath who is in the 'other' 6%, potentially equally dangerous to society for completely different reasons) seems to be determining that media headlines must ensure that 'psychopaths' are defined for incarceration by their nature rather than by their deeds.Yet, as Charlie Chaplin’s M. Verdoux so eloquently put it in the film of that name, it is not the single psychopath whose default mode is tolerance for enormous crimes against humanity but the vast ‘normal’ mass who vote, work and play without much of a thought in their little minds.Ronson opens the door to such subversive thinking but he only peeks in. The psychopath in Broadmoor is judged fit for release and we know it is a gamble. The corporate boss targeted as a psychopath turns out to be depressingly conventional in his private life. So far, so ‘normal’.But Scientologists prove to be champions of human rights and psychiatrists appear to be at forefront of new sociologies of population control, aided by pharmaceuticals interests who turn any mild abnormality from a genetic variant of possible evolutionary value into a diagnosed disease.Some of the most ethically filthy conduct in the book, leading to suicide and death in their victims, come from ‘normals’, the same sort of ‘normal’ who obeys an order in a war or who thinks corporate career progression is a substitute for personal responsibility.The book deserves better than its jokey style. Perhaps the jokey style will build more understanding amongst the general population and that is its justification. Unfortunately, it will probably just flow off most ‘normal’s backs like that of the proverbial duck.So let us try the analysis here that Ronson seems nervous of attempting – that hoary old business, no doubt, in his case, of just being a reporter, just telling a story.First, as he rightly points out, there really are very dangerous persons which we have termed psychopaths but which are simply at one genetic and personality end of our human Bell Curve. They are not monsters, they are human. They are simply accentuations of aspects of our normal selves.Society needs protection but it also needs to recognize, in different ecological circumstances, that they may be more important to us than ourselves in the future of our own species. We have to hope we hang on to civilization long enough to ensure that they are never needed.Second, these dangerous ones are there but they are rare. We cannot build our entire social structure around protecting ourselves from what amounts to a force of nature any more than we should be degenerating as a free and questioning culture because of a few terrorists.Faced with nature, sometimes bad things happen. They will continue to happen. ‘The bomber will always get through’. This is what we are as humans. It is dreadful for the victim but these cases are still rare and we should concentrate on a society that polices itself and is not policed.What is happening is that the existence of the genuine psychopath and the genuine terrorist is being used by the authoritarian bureaucrat to introduce ever-increasing controls on our movement, conduct and language (aspirationally, on our minds) in an attempt to manage the unmanageable.Without the ‘noble lie’ of a religion, with no Pope to serve Constantine, the bureaucrats are turning to definitional analysis and what they like to call science but which is no more scientific than was Lysenko under Stalin. If this book does one service, it is to cast doubt on the more radical scientific credentials of psychology.Over the last two decades, the psychologists and social scientists have found themselves riding on a lucrative gravy train medicalising ‘misbehaviour’ and unhappiness and offering cures based on chemicals and incarceration. The sick are becoming overwhelmed by the worried and the inconvenient.These new priests of the mind are now busy perpetrating the lie of there being no free will (a spurious philosophical conclusion from consciousness studies by people who could usefully spend some time reading the great existentialists) and the even worse lie of a beneficent normality.It was men in white coats who murdered the physically abnormal in euthanasia programmes under national-socialism. It is now men in white coats who are engaged in soul murder against the mentally different. There are throw-away stories in the book of how gays and feminists could lobby successfully to ensure that certain psychological definitions were abandoned. Either science is science or it is not. Scientific decision-making in physics would not allow the peer review to include a lobbyist.‘Conditions’ that have no politically powerful lobbies against them also have many commercial and family interests seeking their establishment. But we have to keep our feet on the ground. If social science and psychology are socio-political tools, there are still things to be cured or managed.There are people seriously suffering pain (yet the system still refuses to let psychiatrists test low dosage levels of psychedelics for depression and trauma). There is certainly work to be done on re-engineering society for relief from anxiety and self empowerment.What is grossly unacceptable is to allow social or family order requirements to permit collusion between drug companies, a morally degenerate professional class and the state or parents in the use of drugs for social control of behaviours that are merely inconvenient or embarrassing.We live in monstrous times. This book, to its credit, opens the door on the monsters – psychopathic and professional alike. We have a choice to go through the door and see what our society has become or shut it and pretend it is not happening. So, my regret about this well-written, entertaining and thought-provoking book is that Ronson limits himself to anecdotes and questions. ‘Normals’ will pick this up, be entertained and go back to being ‘normal’ again. ‘Normal’ people are the shills for the men in white coats and grey suits. What we really need now are writers who show people that just being ‘normal’ (and certainly being ‘normalised’) is damned dangerous to them and to their kids’ future and that ‘normal’ now means little more than manageable and controllable. Ronson merely skims the surface of this story."
131,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara,5,"I couldn't imagine that a book about psychopaths would be so good! Ronson interviews lots of people including people in institutions for the criminally insane, Scientologists, psychiatrists and conspiracy theorists. Ronson also has a very engaging narrating style. We all encounter psychopaths, and sometimes it takes time for us to realize the person has a personality disorder. They may be work colleagues, neighbors, and other people we interact with. It has helped me at times to realize that someone's behavior fits the parameters of psychopathy. Of course, Ronson also explores cases where individuals have been institutionalized for years or even a lifetime without adequate evidence that they continue to be a threat to others. I recommend this to anyone interested in the topic of psychopathic behavior but don't want a technical treatment for the subject."
132,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"Entertaining and a surprisingly breezy read, The Psychopath Test is a somewhat rambling and ultimately non-conclusive record of an investigative journey into the mental health industry, conspiracy theories and scientology. The author meets some very interesting people -- about whom you can form your own conclusions: I was never exactly happy about Bob Hare.I enjoyed reading it, but oddly I'm not sure I can recommend it. Looking back at it, there's not much substance, and isn't as hilariously funny as the blurb and reviews on the back would have you believe -- then again, I don't think it was a waste of time either."
133,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62761616-imane,4,"This was an enjoyable read. In addition to defining and describing the traits of psychopathy, the author raises some questions regarding the sanity of the industry of psychiatry .Overall it was informative, funny and sometimes disturbing; reading about the brutal murders was not my favorite part but if you are looking for ways to spot a psychopath then this book is the one. "
134,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5487874-g,3,"3.5/5Less of ""a journey through the madness industry"" and more of a random romp. Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable one. The Psychopath Test didn't bring me any greater clarity on the subject. Instead, it gave me more to think about. And, frankly, I'm not not mad about that. I'd actually like to read more of Jon Ronson's work."
135,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,4,"4.5 starsJon Ronson is one of those writers - like David Sedaris - whose voice you hear as you read his words; the soft, slightly effete, often uncertain lilt of his sounding in the reader's inner ear. This is one of the things that makes him such an engaging writer, along with his style of placing himself (and his neuroses, which are particularly apposite in this context) directly in view, a method which rather than obscuring his subjects illuminates them, by giving us such an upfront view. The very subjectivity of Ronson's journalistic style allows us to see the complexity of the tale with clarity.In this book Ronson stitches together, as usual, stories that illuminate a single theme - initially tied loosely but bound tighter and tighter as the book progresses. The chapters each involve a way in which we view madness, starting with his own rather off-hand description of an interviewee as a ""psychopath"" and his involvement in an entirely unrelated mystery (which is ultimately used to bookend the volume) which then spirals off from his increasing fascination with the diagnosis of mental disorders following delving into the DSM-IV (and subsequent self diagnosis of a dozen disorders). We meet a patient at Broadmoor high security psychiatric hospital, committed following an insanity plea when on trial for GBH and a subsequent diagnosis as a psychopath, a history of that disorder and its diagnosis and treatment, and then on to a gallery of cases involving both people Ronson has interviewed (psychologists, psychiatrists, a former Haitian paramilitary leader, a corporate CEO famous for his glee in downsizing for fun and profit, former MI5 agent David Shayler) and others whose lives have been changed by direct or indirect contact either those who may have psychiatric disorders or with the madness industry tat has grown around them.The connecting thread is this; that over recent decades we have become increasingly fond of defining behaviours that lay on the spectrum of human personality as 'disorders', using methods which may or may not be scientific and may or may not be accurate. There is plenty of questioning of those methods in this book, but the criticism is largely leveled at those people and organisations that are too ready to use these blunt tools for their own ends - whether it is the pharmaceutical industry and their ever increasing push to medicate human difference or the Metropolitan Police entrapping a neat suspect in a murder case despite a complete lack of evidence, while possibly allowing the actual killer the freedom to kill again.Ronson is sometimes described as a humorist (as does Will Self in his Guardian review quoted on the blurb) but I think this is entirely misleading. Ronson is and always has been a journalist, albeit one who uses his wit and humour to allow us insights to the things about which he writes, a technique which is also effective when he drops it to highlight the sad or horrific - the town of Shubuta, Mississippi, devastated when the local toaster factory was closed to increase the manufacturing company's share price, the murders committed by actual violent psychopaths, the deaths and harm caused by the 'reality' TV industry when they have focused on a distorted view of what is not 'normal'. And, unlike much journalism, this does not attempt to give definite answers; the threads Ronson has drawn together are tied neatly enough to make sense but with enough frayed, trailing lines to leave the reader pondering long after closing the book."
136,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,4,"So Jon Ronson, the man who brought the theory that the world is run by extraterrestrial lizard people to the world's attention, turns his worried gaze to psychopaths. He wrote something like a deeply ambivalent travelogue of his time writing this book. We meet death squad leaders and CEOs who love firing people. We meet a man wrongly picked by a criminal profiler as a brutal killer and we meet Scientologists. We meet the man who helped get homosexuality out of the DSM as a psychiatric condition and we meet a guy who tried nude LSD-assisted psychotherapy for criminal psychopaths. We meet a man who believes no one blew themselves up in subway cars in London one July day and we meet a woman on one of those subway cars. And what do we learn? I’m not sure. That psychiatry started using check lists to standardize diagnoses and the pharmacologization of psychiatry followed, yes. That now in three days, you too can diagnose psychopaths with a handy dandy 40 question check list, yes. But those are headlines, not books. That psychopaths are both like, and unlike, extraterrestrial lizard people, maybe. I quite enjoyed this book. I’m struggling to find something useful to say about it. As foreshadowed above, ambivalent travelogue is the best I’ve come up with. I thought at first the thesis was that psychopaths are everywhere, disproportionately in positions of power, and how they use that power destroys the world. Bob Hare, the man who developed the psychopath test itself, told Ronson he regretted doing so much of his work in prisons instead of on the stock exchange. When Ronson protested that serial killers were worse than psychopathic stock brokers, Hare said:‘“Serial killers ruin families.’ Bob shrugged. ‘Corporate and political and religious psychopaths ruin economies. They ruin societies.’	“This – Bob was saying – was the straightforward solution to the greatest mystery of all: why is the world so unfair? Why all that savage economic injustice, those brutal wars, the everyday corporate cruelty? The answer: psychopaths. The part of the brain that doesn’t function right. . . . . We aren’t all good people just trying to do good. Some of us are psychopaths. And psychopaths are to blame for this brutal, misshapen society. They’re the jagged rocks thrown into the still pond.” (112)And that moved me deeply. But Ronson doesn’t develop that thesis. Instead, he travelogues his earnest conversations with marginal nutball after marginal nutball, takes a brief foray into how the modern psychiatric profession became what it is today, then returns us to a secure psychiatric facility to watch a man committed for years after faking madness be released. Maybe there’s nothing more to be said on that. The idea that psychopaths drive the action on the world stage may be just too depressing to stare at for too long, even if you do have a BBC film crew with you. It was a good book. Well worth reading. I have the nagging feeling there was a better one inchoate in the source material, but I’m dead certain Ronson did better than I would have writing it. "
137,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3397530-lea,4,"I am a huuuuuge Jon Ronson fan, so it's no surprise that I enjoyed this book too. The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry lives up to its title -- Ronson really does take the reader on a journey through the ""madness industry"". The book opens with a bit of a mystery concerning an unusual book that was mailed to various academics throughout the world. At first it doesn't seem to fit the theme of the book, but Ronson ties it in eventually. His typical style is to jump around between subjects, finding common themes, and this book is no different -- we meet an incarcerated psychopath (who may not, in fact, be a psychopath at all), learn about the methods of diagnosing psychopathy, investigate current psychological diagnoses (especially those in children), and see another possible psychopath's positive spin on those ""negative"" traits. The book also looks at Scientology's war on psychiatry, the experimental psychiatric treatments of the 1970s, and criminal profiling. The author covers a lot of ground here, but it's a very fast read. There are several parts that are unsettling -- some crime descriptions, the kafka-esque plight of those stuck in a psychiatric catch-22, a child's accidental overdose of psychiatric medication -- although that could be more indicative of my sensitivity than anythng else.As usual, Ronson explores his own feelings and anxieties as well. Some readers may find this annoying, although his fans most likely won't -- I enjoy those parts of his books!All in all, I really enjoyed this book, and I would recommend it, especially if you've read and liked his previous books."
138,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948275-josh,3,"Let me begin by saying that the title is deceiving. While it does go into the subject of psychopaths and eventually ends with it, there are many points at which I felt like Ronson's main objective was the critique the overall approach to mental disorders that this country (and other researchers from other countries around the world) have taken over the years. We've gotten ourselves into the habit of classifying every little oddity in our personalities as something strange and unwanted, rather than looking at people as individuals with individualistic tendencies -- and this is especially true when it comes to differences of the mind and its inner workings. So, the fact that I was reading this book as a way into psychopaths and psychopaths alone left me with a unsavory taste once I started to realize that there was much more going on here that I wasn't prepared for. Which isn't to say that I disliked any of what was in the book. There are some very interesting (and entertaining) takes on issues such as Scientology, childhood psychiatry, and even conspiracy theorists. However, that's not what the title of the book leads you to believe the book is about. And I call that false advertisement. And no matter how entertaining this book ended up being (and it was -- Ronson tells a story here, with a plot and everything, rather than reporting like a journalist), no matter how drawn in I was into the story he created, the fact still remains that I don't feel like I learned nearly enough about psychopaths as I should have from a book titled, ""The Psychopath Test."""

Listened to the audiobook read by the author himself, and was hooked after only a few minutes; then when Ronson started talking about Douglas Hofstadter and Scientologists I had to think ""I am so lucky to be listening to this book!"" I learned about how the original DSM was created - how arbitrary all those diagnoses are - and that's (can I say:) depressing. I should write a thoughtful review but I am pressed for time, so I will quote Laura Miller at Salon: [Ronson is] not afraid to play the feckless neurotic for laughs, but that doesn't obscure the serious questions raise by his investigations. Psychiatric diagnoses (and, these days, the medications that follow) really can become fads, with certain experts suddenly deciding that multiple personality disorder or childhood bipolar disorder are far more common that ever before suspected. Ronson even finds the occasion for a little professional soul-searching; he accuses himself and other journalists of being the Goldilocks of craziness, seeking out people to write about who are just nuts enough to be colorful but not so disturbed that they're downright sad."
141,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4845040-gregory,5,"Mr. Ronson puts forth ideas, scenarios, and real life observations in a easily read format. He writes so fluently that reading this book is like breathing. I just started it yesternight and about a 1/3 of the way through, he also highlights certain aspects of the study of the mind in relation to its historcal perspective(s).Although the subject/topics are a bit challenging, if you think you may be interested in this book, It is well worth your time. Also, I think his paradigm exposes/shows us concepts perhaps that may have permeated some of our current and past leaders in all walks of life. Something to consider and think about.My hats off to Mr. Ronson, Great job.This is an excellent book and it is excellently written. I believe I will read it again very soon just to see what I missed: even dispite the topic difficulty.It really gives you a great deal to think about, and seems related to Brightsided, in terms of some modern moras."
142,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/326263-patrick,4,"I blame Ronson for turning me on to mega-nut David Icke and his endlessly entertaining Lizard people conspiracy theory in ""Them: Adventures with Extremists.""In this one he's asked to investigate an elaborate and weird hoax involving a book called ""Being or Nothingness,"" by Joe K. - which takes him to Indiana and Douglas Hofstadter (""Godel, Escher, Bach"").That in turn sets him off on psychopaths, the Hare Psychopathy Checklist. Lots of oddballs emerge.Ronson's got a funny style, and apparently a real knack for tracking down the world's screwballs. Very interesting and enjoyable.Also uncomfortable at times, especially when the reader starts considering the psychopath checklist in terms of himself or his friends."
143,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina,2,"This is actually a 1.5 stars book. Meh. The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson has absolutely nothing of interest to say. It's been on my ""to read"" shelf for a while so when I impulsively bought it one day while sitting bored in a doctor's office, I couldn't remember why I had wanted to read it, just that I did. Why can't I learn my lesson about impulsive book-buying? It rarely turns out well. Ronson starts the book by recounting the Mystery of the Mysterious Book. An expensively produced, attractive hard bound book was sent to various academics around the world and none of them can figure out why they received the book or what its purpose is. The sender is unknown, but the books were sent from Sweden. Ronson is recruited to solve the mystery. Along the way, he gets interested in the idea of mental illness and psychopaths and also begins pursing the idea of what it means to be diagnosed as a psychopath and how they are diagnosed. Ronson interviews various psychologists in the field, including Robert Hare, creator of the PCL-R (the Hare Checklist for psychopathology). Ronson also talks with people who doubt the accuracy of the PCL-R (Scientologists...ha ha ha ha), discusses his own neuroses and anxieties, muses on the tendency of psychologists these days to over-analyze, abuses the exclamation mark and makes a lot of lame jokes. This is an idiotic book. I would not recommend it to anyone who is interested in psychopathology and either has a good layperson's understanding of psychopathology or is a professional in the field of psychology (unless that person wants a good laugh). Some of the books Ronson lists as research sources I've already read (plus Harvey Cleckley's Mask of Sanity which Ronson mentions but didn't read) so I already knew more about psychopathology than the author; this revelation did not make me happy. When Ronson begins to explore the subject, he has only the vaguest (Hollywood-influenced) idea of psychopaths and who does he turn to first? Why, Scientologists of course. I mean, if I wanted an understanding of any topic in the field of psychology, I would automatically turn to a group of nutbars who believe in aliens but think psychology is nonsense. A group within Scientologists called the CCHR (Citizens Commission on Human Rights) have made it their mission to ""prove to the world that psychiatrists are wicked and must be stopped"" (28). Ronson is impressed by their record of exposing some very bad psychiatrists...well, yes, they did expose some bad ones, but the examples that Ronson provides (provided to him by the CCHR) are fairly obvious quacks (or mentally ill individuals) who were in the field for reasons other than to honestly practice the profession. Eventually Ronson decides that talking to actual psychologists instead of Scientologists is a good idea. I got fairly disgusted early on when a Scientologist took him to Broadmoor (insane asylum in England) to meet a psychopath (Tony) who isn't really a psychopath--he just pretended to be one so he could avoid prison. Once in Broadmoor, surprise surprise, Tony is diagnosed as a psychopath. Ronson listens to Tony's story of woe without (seemingly) a critical thought in his head. Because at this point Ronson still hasn't done any research about psychopaths, he is completely taken in by Tony's story and believes he is wrongly incarcerated. It's not until later when he talks with Tony's doctor does he have a more informed view of Tony and why he is at Broadmoor. This whole book irritates me because I can't decide if Ronson is really such an idiot or if he possesses some sly sense of humor I can't perceive. When Ronson finally gets to Robert Hare and his pathology checklist, I'm again annoyed. He walks around with the checklist and interviews people whose behavior suggests psychopathology (most notable: Al Dunlap, former CEO--and destroyer--of the Sunbeam Corporation and Emmanuel ""Toto"" Constant, leader of the paramilitary group FRAPH in Haiti). Ronson mentally checks off each psychopath characteristic (Item 6: Lack of Remorse or Guilt, Item 7: Shallow Affect) he thinks they display as he interviews them. With Dunlap, Ronson goes straight through the list and directly asks him about each item. Ronson describes himself as feeling powerful because he has this secret knowledge and can identify psychopaths. What Ronson (willfully?) forgets (ignores?) is that it's not enough to say, yeah, this person seems to not have empathy or sympathy, but an interviewee also has to determine to what degree this person doesn't have sympathy. Maybe some things do bother him and others don't. I understand that at least one of Ronson's objectives of the book is to say, hey, it's way too easy to diagnose someone with a mental illness by going through a list. Well, yeah. This is not a revelation. The fact that Ronson thinks this state of affairs within the psychology/psychiatry field is shocking is, in itself, shocking. What field doesn't have its instances of abuse and misuse? He has a chapter discussing how children are diagnosed with bipolar disorders and then prescribed drugs to treat this (as many psychologists think) imaginary children's condition. It's apparently the latest fad. Parents with kids who are moody or restless or high-energy and don't have the time to deal with them get their children diagnosed with something (for a while ADHD was huge; maybe it still is) and doped up. Parents aren't necessarily to blame; there are the professionals who misdiagnose and the pharmaceutical industry eager to make money any way it can. Many factors create and exacerbate the abuse of Hare's PCL-R and the way anyone is misdiagnosed and over-medicated. The Psychopath Test is generally a mess of a book. There's no clear thesis/objective for the book. What exactly is Ronson investigating? What is he trying to prove? His discussion of the PCL-R is thrown off track by the chapter detailing how the DSM is created (a rather haphazard and unscientific process if Ronson's information is correct) and the misdiagnosis of children. If Ronson wanted to explore the abuses of psychology and psychiatry (combined with the shady connection between psychiatrists and the pharmaceutical industry), then why didn't he do that? This book is merely a glib commentary on several topics combined with the author's (non-humorous) observations of his own anxieties and neuroses. Although I did not like how he approached the topic nor how he wrote it, I am still interested in reading (if not buying) Ronson's other books. It's clear that Ronson was out of his depth with this subject. "
144,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22440207-agn,4,"WHAT IS IT ABOUT?In his book “The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry,” a bestselling journalist Jon Ronson, propelled by a mysterious hoax played on the world’s leading scientists, dives into the world of madness to explore just how mad we really are. During his two-year journey, Ronson not only interviews a bunch of madmen as well as several influential psychologists, psychiatrists and anti-psychiatric Scientologists but also practices his newly gained skill of using Hare Psychopathy Checklist to spot psychopaths. Unexpectedly and quite disturbingly, the author discovers the society’s drive for the ‘right amount’ of insanity, and often detrimental tendency to define individuals by their maddest edges.THUMBS UP:1) Intriguing introduction.The first chapter of “The Psychopath Test” is THE BEST (mysterious, suspenseful and utterly captivating) introductory chapter I have ever read in a non-fiction book. The opening story is so bizarre it can be easily turned into a book itself.2) Well researched, skillfully written.Ronson’s style is quite humorous and engaging, making his non-fiction very readable and not in the least dry. Also, the author put quite some time and effort into researching and interviewing, which allowed him to explore the madness industry from multiple perspectives, which in turn enables the readers to form their own opinions on the matter. COULD BE BETTER:1) Not what I expected.I guess it’s not really the author’s fault, but I was expecting this book to be more about psychopaths and less about everything else. Instead, at least half of the book has little to do with psychopathy as the author probes multiple issues related to general insanity. It works this way as well, but I was hoping for an in-depth exploration of the psychopath’s mind and thus was a tiny bit disappointed.2) Fragmented and seemingly directionless.While I was reading “The Psychopath Test,” I felt rather confused as if the story has been patched together from several seemingly unrelated parts: at first the book seemed like a really engaging mystery, then it became psychopath-oriented, but soon enough the chapters became quite independent, loosely connected by the general madness theme. Honestly, up until the final chapters I wasn’t sure where the story was going. Although at the very end the author’s intentions became more or less clear, Ronson could have done a better job guiding the reader throughout the whole book.VERDICT: 4 out of 5Although “The Psychopath Test” might seem a little fragmented and directionless, it is nonetheless a very entertaining non-fiction that carries an important message."
145,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7232207-fiona,3,"I had a run-in with a psychopath once. I definitely came out worse from that encounter.But that's the thing that I just can't get my head around: once upon a time, I met a bona fide psychopath and in hindsight it was really, really noticeable! But if, according to Jon Ronson and his sources, psychopaths make up a little less than 1% of the population, where are all the rest of them? Are one in ten Londoners psychopathic? (Apparently they head for big cities.) Are prisons disproportionately full of them? I mean, I imagine so, but even that wouldn't account for the fact that I've identifiably met considerably fewer of them than I would expect to. Where've I been? Mostly (in my adult life) legal academia, the construction industry, and musical theatre. Hardly hotbeds of the empathetic.So something is a bit off, and I think Jon Ronson also knows this: his book is not just called Psychopaths, but The Psychopath Test - it's also partly about diagnosis of mental health problems. It's really engaging, and Ronson is a great writer, but it's hardly in depth. He's got a really light touch, skipping from prison populations to business management, to the writing of DSM-III, to the potential for misdiagnosis of childhood ADHD. This is a 250-page book! I feel like the book poses more questions than it answers, mainly because there's not enough time, and Ronson has no apparent inclination, to go into anything in any depth. He's just spotted something shiny and moved on.So what do I want to know about psychopaths? Well, what I'm missing, for a start. I don't believe that nearly one in a hundred people on this earth are incurably heinous, robot-hearted monsters with no souls and an aptitude on the London Stock Exchange. So is the percentage smaller, or does psychopathy actually mean something different to that? Is it possible to have all these traits and still have a meaningful life, loving relationships and friendships, and do some good in the world? I'm sure it must be; coming out of this book, I saw no indication of it. Have a bit of optimism, Jon! The world's not completely up the creek. It can't be as totally hopeless as you make it out to be. Which means - what aren't you telling me?"
146,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526809-donna,4,"Saw the interview on 'John Stewart', then ordered it like a cubic zirconia tennis bracelet from The Shopping Channel. I got a slow start with it. The Kindle app formatting is kinda shitty. stray lines. Typos. I kept asking myself whether anybody checked it out beforehand. Then again, maybe they wanted it to look that way. Once I got used to this clash of esthetics, I found it a great deal of fun. Wha? A book about psychopathy fun? He doesn't just seek out the usual suspects. He talks to Bob Hare who came up with the oft used checklist to spot it. I was worried at first, that Ronson would turn out to be one of tthose 'it all comes back to me' sorts of interviewers, but he asked many of the questions I would have liked to ask. He doesn't give the impression of being thorough, but he is. So he talked with Bob Hare, which resulted in his seeing psychopaths everywhere. He visited Al Dunlap, dismantler of Sunbeam to wonder whether he might be one. ""He pointed at a sculpture of four sharks encircling the planet. 'I believe in predators,' he said. 'Their spirit will enable you to succeed. Over there you've got falcons. Alligators. Alligators. More alligators. Tigers.' 'It's As if both Midas and also the Queen of Narnia were here,' I said, 'and the Queen of Narnia flew above a particularly fierce zoo and turned everything there to stone and then transported everything here.' 'What?' said Al. 'Nothing,' I said. 'No,' he said, 'What did you just say?' He shot me a steely, blue-eyed stare, which I found quite debilitating. ""I appreciated how he took the subject out of prison where we, the still living prey can really relate to it. Of course,I liked this because it's really all about me. Without seeming to, he also gets into some searching questions about journalism and madness. "
147,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4636758-vanessa,4,"I really enjoyed this book. I have for a while now had an interest in psychology and mental disorders of various kinds, finding them absolutely fascinating to read about. Psychopathy (or sociopathy) was something, however, that I didn't really know much about prior to reading this book. I certainly hadn't heard of The Psychopath Test, created by Bob Hare, a Canadian criminal psychologist.In his book, Ronson shares his encounters with various people that may or may not be classified as psychopaths, from a man known only as ""Tony"" who 'fakes' madness to get out of a prison sentence, to Al Dunlap, a retired corporate executive with a tendency to see factors on the Psychopath Test as positive in the eyes of business. All is told from the humorous and objective viewpoint of Ronson, whilst over-analysing his own motivations in true anxiety-related style.Ronson reminded me a lot of myself at points in this book, and I really enjoyed the way he structured his book and the interviews he conducted. I will definitely be seeking out more of his work, and if you have any interest in the topic of psychopathy, or are a fan of gonzo-style journalism, then I would highly recommend this."
148,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3659939-bree,4,"Really, really enjoyed this. First of all, I listened to the audiobook and Jon Ronson's voice reminds me of Neil Gaiman's, so already it's a win. It's fascinating to consider how psychopathy is diagnosed and what that diagnosis means. Most human beings display some psychopathic traits from time to time, but how do you determine when someone displays enough to be considered a danger to society? Jon Ronson's writing is humorous, fun, and completely engaging. At times the structure of the book felt a little disjointed, but I appreciated how it all came together at the end. Because much of the book consists of interviews with various psychiatrists and psychopaths (and maybe-psychopaths), the reader is able to come to their own conclusions rather than relying on the author to tell you what to think. "
149,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,4,"This is the sort of book that I tend to enjoy – a journalist tells amusing stories about his investigations into a particular topic – but which readers with a more focused interest in the purported subject may find frustrating. Ronson portrays himself as a cheerfully unmethodical explorer of the world of craziness, meeting with experts, prisoners, and potentially psychotic retired executives and presenting their stories and his responses in a lively, vivid style. Some of the stories involved, almost necessarily, are rather horrible, but he keeps the gruesome stuff to a minimum and finds the absurd humor in situations where you might not expect to find it. As engaging and entertaining a book on psychopaths as you are likely to find, and I particularly enjoyed the way he concluded his story. Four and a half stars."
150,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,4,"Ok, first of all, I have to admit I have a soft spot in my heart for the pop-psy. That being said, I really enjoyed this well-rounded take on psychopathy; from the use of labels to the tests to determine if a person is one. He did not take a position and try to convince us, except as a story technique, but that was also done as a full circle. Very good writing for what it is. I loved the same style turned on scientologists and their crusade against psychiatry, the psychopharmacology industry, and the creators of the DSM III through IV (although I would have loved him to take on V as well).He's the same writer of The Men Who Stare At Goats, which I thought was a very funny movie, and I'll have to read that book now. I've become a fan of the author. :)"

“Suddenly, madness was everywhere, and I was determined to learn about the impact it had on the way society evolves. I've always believed society to be a fundamentally rational thing, but what if it isn't? What if it is built on insanity?”

 The book was engaging, I enjoyed reading it, however I couldn't help being a little disappointed. While Ronson makes a few good points and raises some good questions, I was hoping the book would go deeper into the world of psychopaths, instead it was mainly focused on his journey of researching the topic. However, I can't hold this too hard against the book as Jon Ronson is an investigative journalist, not a mental health care specialist."
152,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7022024-mike,4,"For a book about psychopaths this was a surprisingly light(ish, come on, we're still talking about psychopaths here) read. The author is a journalist and it covers a wide range of the topic from interviewing a few (suspected) psychopaths, to speaking with psychiatrists who are involved in psychopathy and the classification there of, to scientologists, to neurologists who examined the brains of normal people and psychopaths. It is a fast read of a book that I think does a good job being honest and truth seeking.The psychopath test in this book, called Hare Psychopathy Checklist presents a set of characteristics a person can be graded on. Score too high and you just might be a psychopath. Once the author had learned of this test and taken a seminar about it he started to see it both in his own behavior and others, annotating his interactions with others with various qualities on the test. Instead of narrowly focusing on just psychopaths (and mostly avoiding the lurid details of the more famous/horrifying ones) Ronson presents the reader with a broad, if shallow, survey of the field. He also does an excellent job of linking together different parts of the history of psychology and how those events impact the modern world (such as the explosion of psychological disorder classifications, the massive expansion of pharmaceuticals to ""treat"" these conditions, and how the entertainment industry, especially reality TV, benefits from just the right amount of madness). I found his writing style very accessible and the presentation of the interviews and facts well conveyed without becoming too dry or boring.The animating force behind the book was a weird event where a bunch of scientists from all over the world get a strange, cryptic book. They banded to together over the internet to try and figure it out but were flummoxed. One of the scientists in question contacted Ronson to help and he eventually tracked down the person he thought was responsible. Turns out it likely wasn't some genius mystery maker but likely a slightly off kilter Swede. But Ronson was intrigued by how much this solitary person caused the world to change and wondered how much of the state of the world was due to psychopaths. While he doesn't answer the question (many others, including folks he interviewed, have delved into this) he does write about how psychopathy did appear to be more prevalent in business circles. Given how much havoc financial decisions can make (shutting down manufacturing plants, crashing the economy, putting profits before people, etc.). All in all a fast and interesting read, but not one for people looking for a deeper understanding of psychopathy. I devoured it in the course of an intercontinental (unless you are one of those people who think the Americas are just one continent) and was found the experience both entertaining and enlightening."
153,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76697789-ryan-krueger,5,"** The Psychopath Test by Jon Robson is an informative non-fiction book. The book was written with intent to inform readers about the abundance of psychopaths in our world and how they impact our daily lives. The author is a journalist who has traveled the world to meet with professors, scientists, psychologists and more to find information on this subject to create a strong basis for the book. Ronson makes plenty of flights around the globe to meet with researchers as well as psychopaths themselves. His main point in this is to display how psychopaths are common in our lives whether it be the workplace or interacting with someone who seems in an everyday environment. The work discusses psychopaths lack of emotions such as fear or remorse and how that can lead some people to be at the top of the business chain. Due to them not having remorse they can be willing to fire half of their staff in one day with no regards to how it may affect their lives, while the boss’s mind is only focused on financial gains. A quote in the book goes, “Serial killers ruin families, corporate and political and religious psychopaths ruin economies. They ruin societies.”This is a very interesting book in my opinion as I have always had an interest in the wiring of people’s brains. The details included and quoted from psychopaths that he interviewed were intriguing as they would say stuff along the lines of them wanting to kill to see what blood looks like or what the insides of someone else looks like. The book raises issues on how psychopaths can ruin families, societies, and economies. It covers a wide range of topics and goes into detail on each area including how psychopaths can affect these issues. I agree with everything in this book except that the words psychopath and sociopath can be used interchangeably. After looking into this I’ve found various sources as well as teachers who stated that psychopaths are born the way they are and it’s genetics, while sociopaths are born through traumatic experiences and have capabilities of feeling remorse as well as developing relationships or bonds with others. This book answered a lot of questions I have had. There are two people in my life who I always wondered why they act the way they do but I realized that they are most likely a psychopath. However, it made me realize how easy it can be to target someone as a psychopath due to the bob hare psychopath test and how normal actions can be misinterpreted into a biased stance. As someone who has an interest in helping soldiers suffering from PTSD this relates to my personal agenda due to me having the possibility of preventing someone from becoming a sociopath. "
154,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49105612-leah-craig,5,"Spending the next two weeks researching psychopathic case studies. Thanks a lot, Ronson. Byeeeeeeeeeee! "
155,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6296289-tyler-j-gray,4,Very thought-provoking and well worth a read!
156,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,4,"While Jon Ronson reveals a great deal about his own neuroses in this book, he casts little light on the psychopaths he is allegedly researching, though he does give some interesting insights into the ""madness industry"" of psychologists who have studied, categorized, labeled, and tried to treat psychopaths, mostly without success.Ronson begins with a strange introduction to the field of psychology and mental illness thanks to a group of Scientologists, who chose him to ""expose"" the evils of psychology. Scientologists believe that all mental disorders are because of engrams accumulated from past lives or space aliens or some shit like that. L. Ron Hubbard had a particular hatred of psychologists. Ronson spends a little time discussing the peculiarities of Scientology, but this book is primarily about psychopaths and what makes them tick... and what makes the people who study them tick.After reading The Psychopath Test, it is not hard to believe that you have to be a little bit crazy to study crazy people. (Look out for those Abnormal Psychology majors...) From the arbitrariness of what goes into the DSM (did you know that far more copies are sold to interested non-academics/non-practitioners than to mental health professionals?) to the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, a diagnostic tool that's become a quick and dirty way to label someone a psychopath, to the Rosenhan Experiment, the history of psychology is filled with enough self-reinforcing bumbling and egomania to make one think the Scientologists may have a point.While Ronson's book is a collection of interesting anecdotes and observations, digressing into the overmedication of children, misdiagnoses of autism, and the brutality of capitalist devotion to ""shareholder value,"" between interviews with ex-death squad leaders and allegedly psychopathic CEO Al Dunlap, it's a bit weak in its critique of science, and sheds little light on his subjects.Martha Stout's book The Sociopath Next Door was more illuminating. Ronson does, however, give a bit of a glimpse into the mind of a sociopath in a way that Stout only addressed abstractly: how do sociopaths/psychopaths (there is no technical difference between them) see themselves? Do they recognize that they are ""broken""? Do they ever want to be cured, and can they be? (Short answer: no.)Ronson's interview with Al Dunlap was particularly interesting, as he actually confronted Dunlap with the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, and the allegations that Dunlap, according to this tool, scored high on the psychopathy scale. Dunlap proceeded to point out that every behavior presented as evidence of being a psychopath could also be interpreted as someone who has a forceful and driven personality who gets things done. True enough, there is a lot of evidence that psychopathy is an asset in positions of power, like boardrooms.Ronson is able to see how some of his subjects ape normal human reactions and manipulate people the way they'd handle a TV remote control, but others, like Al Dunlap, are more ambiguous. Is Dunlap really a psychopath, or just a merciless asshole? As both Stout and Ronson point out, even genuine psychopaths are rarely serial killers; most live law-abiding, respectable lives, though never out of any actual respect for the law or society.An interesting if somewhat meandering trip into the perilous world of diagnosing psychopaths, The Psychopath Test is not exactly a weighty, heavily-researched book, but it will be of interest to anyone who has an, ahem, clinical interest in psychopaths."
157,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14084605-pink,4,"A real thought provoker. What is a psychopath? Are you a psychopath? How about your friends or co-workers? This book will leave you diagnosing everyone you know and becoming all powerful with your new amazing psychopath detection skills, just like Jon Ronson. The book really made me think about how mental illness is defined. Sure there are clear cut cases of insanity and sanity, but there's a huge area in the middle, with a range of diagnoses that are possible to be made and indeed are being sweepingly made and medicated for across the world. Quite apart from the issues of psychopath detection and detention, there were some interesting stories. A wide range of people were interviewed for his research and I was fascinated by several of their lives, whether they were the professionals, or the patients. This was my first Jon Ronson book and I haven't read any of his journalistic material so his style of writing is all new to me. I appreciated the humour and details about himself that were included, which broke up some pretty heavy content at times. I also liked how the book came full circle and re-visited the people at the beginning of his journey, which gave closure to their own stories. Much recommended and I can't wait to read more of his books now! "

159,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4529669-willow,4,"Jon Ronson is a hoot. It would be great to have lunch with him. He puts so much of himself into his writing, bringing up his own little insecurities and observations, pretty much showing that he’ll be happy to go anywhere or do anything provided there’s a good story. This book is all over the place following Jon around and he brings up different case studies after another. In fact, I’m not sure they had that much in common with each other except that Jon decided they were worth investigating. This ‘all over the place’ is the book’s weakness and the reason I knocked a star. You see, I’m not sure Jon really proved his point. That doesn’t mean it wasn’t informative and entertaining. I definitely learned a lot about the psychopath test, which is here by the way: http://thinkcreatedesign.wordpress.co...Some of the provocative ideas this book brings up is that psychopaths may actually have a brain abnormality that has to do with their amygdale. They don’t feel the full range of emotions like most people. This makes them fearless, lacking in empathy and they gravitate toward positions of power because they are missing regular emotional stimulation. There could be one psychopath in every hundred people. Jon even jokes that he started seeing psychopaths everywhere once he acquired his new psychopath spotting skills. Obviously he’s not the only one with psychopath spotting skills. One of the reviews on GR even suggested that pretty much everybody in the GOP is a psychopath, posting pictures. Judging by the seriousness of her review, and the lack of seriousness in Jon’s book, I can’t help but think that she ignored the last quarter of the book. That’s because by the end, Jon is rethinking what he’s learned about psychopaths and the psychopath test, suggesting that nothing is cut and dried, and scoring high on a test shouldn’t get you locked away forever. He takes a look at criminal profilers and some of their serious blunders (something crime shows rarely show on TV). If the police are convinced you are the culprit, or a doctor wants to slap a diagnosis on you, they will find a way, because that’s what they want to find. Both the media, the pharmaceutical companies, and the public want to promote mental illness for different reasons. Categorizing is something humans love to do. We look for order in a chaotic world. It’s comforting. And sometimes when people are trying to fit someone in a personality box, we ignore all the things that make them not fit there. Psychology is not an exact science I’ve read that The Society for the Scientific Study of Psychopathy (SSSP) published a statement regarding this book stating that certain interviews in it were exaggerated or fictionalised and that they ""think that Ronson’s book trivializes a serious personality disorder and its measurement, which is not helpful to those who have the disorder or to their unfortunate victims"".This statement made me laugh, because I don’t think this book was ever meant to be a deep serious study of psychopaths. It’s more about Jon investigating them, and coming up with different conclusions. He’s a thoughtful writer and I enjoyed reading his observations. I think this book raises more questions than it answers. I love that. "
160,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1016626-tim-pendry,3,"This book is being promoted as 'comic'. Sadly, it is not. It is quite a sad read. I laughed once out loud and smiled twice but only in the first chapter. If you end this book laughing, you have not ‘got it’. You should leave it a little angry and troubled.Ronson exhibits all the graces and the flaws of modern British journalism. It is an easy read. The man is self-questioning (though clearly not too deeply lest he cease to function) and he is honest. But he is also skimming the surface of issues that require a far tougher and better book than this.Perhaps he is being cleverer than I think. Perhaps his periodic questioning of the way his profession turns reality into narratives, into modern folk tales, will create a suspicion in the public's mind about how it receives information, how its mental world is structured. I think not.The book is about the phenomenon of the psychopath which operates at so many levels as part of our cultural self-definition. As a species, we tend to need a scapegoat for structural ills that derive from our own nature - so, why not the 'psychopath' in our culture.Perhaps 1% of the population is 'psychopathic' in the sense of presenting a reasonable danger to others under certain conditions. Perhaps another 5% have traits that could be dangerous under yet other more extreme conditions. I suspect 88% are just a danger to themselves as ‘normals’.Political fear (I speak as a radical empath who is in the 'other' 6%, potentially equally dangerous to society for completely different reasons) seems to be determining that media headlines must ensure that 'psychopaths' are defined for incarceration by their nature rather than by their deeds.Yet, as Charlie Chaplin’s M. Verdoux so eloquently put it in the film of that name, it is not the single psychopath whose default mode is tolerance for enormous crimes against humanity but the vast ‘normal’ mass who vote, work and play without much of a thought in their little minds.Ronson opens the door to such subversive thinking but he only peeks in. The psychopath in Broadmoor is judged fit for release and we know it is a gamble. The corporate boss targeted as a psychopath turns out to be depressingly conventional in his private life. So far, so ‘normal’.But Scientologists prove to be champions of human rights and psychiatrists appear to be at forefront of new sociologies of population control, aided by pharmaceuticals interests who turn any mild abnormality from a genetic variant of possible evolutionary value into a diagnosed disease.Some of the most ethically filthy conduct in the book, leading to suicide and death in their victims, come from ‘normals’, the same sort of ‘normal’ who obeys an order in a war or who thinks corporate career progression is a substitute for personal responsibility.The book deserves better than its jokey style. Perhaps the jokey style will build more understanding amongst the general population and that is its justification. Unfortunately, it will probably just flow off most ‘normal’s backs like that of the proverbial duck.So let us try the analysis here that Ronson seems nervous of attempting – that hoary old business, no doubt, in his case, of just being a reporter, just telling a story.First, as he rightly points out, there really are very dangerous persons which we have termed psychopaths but which are simply at one genetic and personality end of our human Bell Curve. They are not monsters, they are human. They are simply accentuations of aspects of our normal selves.Society needs protection but it also needs to recognize, in different ecological circumstances, that they may be more important to us than ourselves in the future of our own species. We have to hope we hang on to civilization long enough to ensure that they are never needed.Second, these dangerous ones are there but they are rare. We cannot build our entire social structure around protecting ourselves from what amounts to a force of nature any more than we should be degenerating as a free and questioning culture because of a few terrorists.Faced with nature, sometimes bad things happen. They will continue to happen. ‘The bomber will always get through’. This is what we are as humans. It is dreadful for the victim but these cases are still rare and we should concentrate on a society that polices itself and is not policed.What is happening is that the existence of the genuine psychopath and the genuine terrorist is being used by the authoritarian bureaucrat to introduce ever-increasing controls on our movement, conduct and language (aspirationally, on our minds) in an attempt to manage the unmanageable.Without the ‘noble lie’ of a religion, with no Pope to serve Constantine, the bureaucrats are turning to definitional analysis and what they like to call science but which is no more scientific than was Lysenko under Stalin. If this book does one service, it is to cast doubt on the more radical scientific credentials of psychology.Over the last two decades, the psychologists and social scientists have found themselves riding on a lucrative gravy train medicalising ‘misbehaviour’ and unhappiness and offering cures based on chemicals and incarceration. The sick are becoming overwhelmed by the worried and the inconvenient.These new priests of the mind are now busy perpetrating the lie of there being no free will (a spurious philosophical conclusion from consciousness studies by people who could usefully spend some time reading the great existentialists) and the even worse lie of a beneficent normality.It was men in white coats who murdered the physically abnormal in euthanasia programmes under national-socialism. It is now men in white coats who are engaged in soul murder against the mentally different. There are throw-away stories in the book of how gays and feminists could lobby successfully to ensure that certain psychological definitions were abandoned. Either science is science or it is not. Scientific decision-making in physics would not allow the peer review to include a lobbyist.‘Conditions’ that have no politically powerful lobbies against them also have many commercial and family interests seeking their establishment. But we have to keep our feet on the ground. If social science and psychology are socio-political tools, there are still things to be cured or managed.There are people seriously suffering pain (yet the system still refuses to let psychiatrists test low dosage levels of psychedelics for depression and trauma). There is certainly work to be done on re-engineering society for relief from anxiety and self empowerment.What is grossly unacceptable is to allow social or family order requirements to permit collusion between drug companies, a morally degenerate professional class and the state or parents in the use of drugs for social control of behaviours that are merely inconvenient or embarrassing.We live in monstrous times. This book, to its credit, opens the door on the monsters – psychopathic and professional alike. We have a choice to go through the door and see what our society has become or shut it and pretend it is not happening. So, my regret about this well-written, entertaining and thought-provoking book is that Ronson limits himself to anecdotes and questions. ‘Normals’ will pick this up, be entertained and go back to being ‘normal’ again. ‘Normal’ people are the shills for the men in white coats and grey suits. What we really need now are writers who show people that just being ‘normal’ (and certainly being ‘normalised’) is damned dangerous to them and to their kids’ future and that ‘normal’ now means little more than manageable and controllable. Ronson merely skims the surface of this story."
161,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara,5,"I couldn't imagine that a book about psychopaths would be so good! Ronson interviews lots of people including people in institutions for the criminally insane, Scientologists, psychiatrists and conspiracy theorists. Ronson also has a very engaging narrating style. We all encounter psychopaths, and sometimes it takes time for us to realize the person has a personality disorder. They may be work colleagues, neighbors, and other people we interact with. It has helped me at times to realize that someone's behavior fits the parameters of psychopathy. Of course, Ronson also explores cases where individuals have been institutionalized for years or even a lifetime without adequate evidence that they continue to be a threat to others. I recommend this to anyone interested in the topic of psychopathic behavior but don't want a technical treatment for the subject."
162,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"Entertaining and a surprisingly breezy read, The Psychopath Test is a somewhat rambling and ultimately non-conclusive record of an investigative journey into the mental health industry, conspiracy theories and scientology. The author meets some very interesting people -- about whom you can form your own conclusions: I was never exactly happy about Bob Hare.I enjoyed reading it, but oddly I'm not sure I can recommend it. Looking back at it, there's not much substance, and isn't as hilariously funny as the blurb and reviews on the back would have you believe -- then again, I don't think it was a waste of time either."

In addition to defining and describing the traits of psychopathy, the author raises some questions regarding the sanity of the industry of psychiatry .Overall it was informative, funny and sometimes disturbing; reading about the brutal murders was not my favorite part but if you are looking for ways to spot a psychopath then this book is the one. "
164,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5487874-g,3,"3.5/5Less of ""a journey through the madness industry"" and more of a random romp. Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable one. The Psychopath Test didn't bring me any greater clarity on the subject. Instead, it gave me more to think about. And, frankly, I'm not not mad about that. I'd actually like to read more of Jon Ronson's work."
165,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,4,"4.5 starsJon Ronson is one of those writers - like David Sedaris - whose voice you hear as you read his words; the soft, slightly effete, often uncertain lilt of his sounding in the reader's inner ear. This is one of the things that makes him such an engaging writer, along with his style of placing himself (and his neuroses, which are particularly apposite in this context) directly in view, a method which rather than obscuring his subjects illuminates them, by giving us such an upfront view. The very subjectivity of Ronson's journalistic style allows us to see the complexity of the tale with clarity.In this book Ronson stitches together, as usual, stories that illuminate a single theme - initially tied loosely but bound tighter and tighter as the book progresses. The chapters each involve a way in which we view madness, starting with his own rather off-hand description of an interviewee as a ""psychopath"" and his involvement in an entirely unrelated mystery (which is ultimately used to bookend the volume) which then spirals off from his increasing fascination with the diagnosis of mental disorders following delving into the DSM-IV (and subsequent self diagnosis of a dozen disorders). We meet a patient at Broadmoor high security psychiatric hospital, committed following an insanity plea when on trial for GBH and a subsequent diagnosis as a psychopath, a history of that disorder and its diagnosis and treatment, and then on to a gallery of cases involving both people Ronson has interviewed (psychologists, psychiatrists, a former Haitian paramilitary leader, a corporate CEO famous for his glee in downsizing for fun and profit, former MI5 agent David Shayler) and others whose lives have been changed by direct or indirect contact either those who may have psychiatric disorders or with the madness industry tat has grown around them.The connecting thread is this; that over recent decades we have become increasingly fond of defining behaviours that lay on the spectrum of human personality as 'disorders', using methods which may or may not be scientific and may or may not be accurate. There is plenty of questioning of those methods in this book, but the criticism is largely leveled at those people and organisations that are too ready to use these blunt tools for their own ends - whether it is the pharmaceutical industry and their ever increasing push to medicate human difference or the Metropolitan Police entrapping a neat suspect in a murder case despite a complete lack of evidence, while possibly allowing the actual killer the freedom to kill again.Ronson is sometimes described as a humorist (as does Will Self in his Guardian review quoted on the blurb) but I think this is entirely misleading. Ronson is and always has been a journalist, albeit one who uses his wit and humour to allow us insights to the things about which he writes, a technique which is also effective when he drops it to highlight the sad or horrific - the town of Shubuta, Mississippi, devastated when the local toaster factory was closed to increase the manufacturing company's share price, the murders committed by actual violent psychopaths, the deaths and harm caused by the 'reality' TV industry when they have focused on a distorted view of what is not 'normal'. And, unlike much journalism, this does not attempt to give definite answers; the threads Ronson has drawn together are tied neatly enough to make sense but with enough frayed, trailing lines to leave the reader pondering long after closing the book."
166,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,4,"So Jon Ronson, the man who brought the theory that the world is run by extraterrestrial lizard people to the world's attention, turns his worried gaze to psychopaths. He wrote something like a deeply ambivalent travelogue of his time writing this book. We meet death squad leaders and CEOs who love firing people. We meet a man wrongly picked by a criminal profiler as a brutal killer and we meet Scientologists. We meet the man who helped get homosexuality out of the DSM as a psychiatric condition and we meet a guy who tried nude LSD-assisted psychotherapy for criminal psychopaths. We meet a man who believes no one blew themselves up in subway cars in London one July day and we meet a woman on one of those subway cars. And what do we learn? I’m not sure. That psychiatry started using check lists to standardize diagnoses and the pharmacologization of psychiatry followed, yes. That now in three days, you too can diagnose psychopaths with a handy dandy 40 question check list, yes. But those are headlines, not books. That psychopaths are both like, and unlike, extraterrestrial lizard people, maybe. I quite enjoyed this book. I’m struggling to find something useful to say about it. As foreshadowed above, ambivalent travelogue is the best I’ve come up with. I thought at first the thesis was that psychopaths are everywhere, disproportionately in positions of power, and how they use that power destroys the world. Bob Hare, the man who developed the psychopath test itself, told Ronson he regretted doing so much of his work in prisons instead of on the stock exchange. When Ronson protested that serial killers were worse than psychopathic stock brokers, Hare said:‘“Serial killers ruin families.’ Bob shrugged. ‘Corporate and political and religious psychopaths ruin economies. They ruin societies.’	“This – Bob was saying – was the straightforward solution to the greatest mystery of all: why is the world so unfair? Why all that savage economic injustice, those brutal wars, the everyday corporate cruelty? The answer: psychopaths. The part of the brain that doesn’t function right. . . . . We aren’t all good people just trying to do good. Some of us are psychopaths. And psychopaths are to blame for this brutal, misshapen society. They’re the jagged rocks thrown into the still pond.” (112)And that moved me deeply. But Ronson doesn’t develop that thesis. Instead, he travelogues his earnest conversations with marginal nutball after marginal nutball, takes a brief foray into how the modern psychiatric profession became what it is today, then returns us to a secure psychiatric facility to watch a man committed for years after faking madness be released. Maybe there’s nothing more to be said on that. The idea that psychopaths drive the action on the world stage may be just too depressing to stare at for too long, even if you do have a BBC film crew with you. It was a good book. Well worth reading. I have the nagging feeling there was a better one inchoate in the source material, but I’m dead certain Ronson did better than I would have writing it. "
167,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3397530-lea,4,"I am a huuuuuge Jon Ronson fan, so it's no surprise that I enjoyed this book too. The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry lives up to its title -- Ronson really does take the reader on a journey through the ""madness industry"". The book opens with a bit of a mystery concerning an unusual book that was mailed to various academics throughout the world. At first it doesn't seem to fit the theme of the book, but Ronson ties it in eventually. His typical style is to jump around between subjects, finding common themes, and this book is no different -- we meet an incarcerated psychopath (who may not, in fact, be a psychopath at all), learn about the methods of diagnosing psychopathy, investigate current psychological diagnoses (especially those in children), and see another possible psychopath's positive spin on those ""negative"" traits. The book also looks at Scientology's war on psychiatry, the experimental psychiatric treatments of the 1970s, and criminal profiling. The author covers a lot of ground here, but it's a very fast read. There are several parts that are unsettling -- some crime descriptions, the kafka-esque plight of those stuck in a psychiatric catch-22, a child's accidental overdose of psychiatric medication -- although that could be more indicative of my sensitivity than anythng else.As usual, Ronson explores his own feelings and anxieties as well. Some readers may find this annoying, although his fans most likely won't -- I enjoy those parts of his books!All in all, I really enjoyed this book, and I would recommend it, especially if you've read and liked his previous books."
168,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948275-josh,3,"Let me begin by saying that the title is deceiving. While it does go into the subject of psychopaths and eventually ends with it, there are many points at which I felt like Ronson's main objective was the critique the overall approach to mental disorders that this country (and other researchers from other countries around the world) have taken over the years. We've gotten ourselves into the habit of classifying every little oddity in our personalities as something strange and unwanted, rather than looking at people as individuals with individualistic tendencies -- and this is especially true when it comes to differences of the mind and its inner workings. So, the fact that I was reading this book as a way into psychopaths and psychopaths alone left me with a unsavory taste once I started to realize that there was much more going on here that I wasn't prepared for. Which isn't to say that I disliked any of what was in the book. There are some very interesting (and entertaining) takes on issues such as Scientology, childhood psychiatry, and even conspiracy theorists. However, that's not what the title of the book leads you to believe the book is about. And I call that false advertisement. And no matter how entertaining this book ended up being (and it was -- Ronson tells a story here, with a plot and everything, rather than reporting like a journalist), no matter how drawn in I was into the story he created, the fact still remains that I don't feel like I learned nearly enough about psychopaths as I should have from a book titled, ""The Psychopath Test."""

Listened to the audiobook read by the author himself, and was hooked after only a few minutes; then when Ronson started talking about Douglas Hofstadter and Scientologists I had to think ""I am so lucky to be listening to this book!"" I learned about how the original DSM was created - how arbitrary all those diagnoses are - and that's (can I say:) depressing. I should write a thoughtful review but I am pressed for time, so I will quote Laura Miller at Salon: [Ronson is] not afraid to play the feckless neurotic for laughs, but that doesn't obscure the serious questions raise by his investigations. Psychiatric diagnoses (and, these days, the medications that follow) really can become fads, with certain experts suddenly deciding that multiple personality disorder or childhood bipolar disorder are far more common that ever before suspected. Ronson even finds the occasion for a little professional soul-searching; he accuses himself and other journalists of being the Goldilocks of craziness, seeking out people to write about who are just nuts enough to be colorful but not so disturbed that they're downright sad."
171,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4845040-gregory,5,"Mr. Ronson puts forth ideas, scenarios, and real life observations in a easily read format. He writes so fluently that reading this book is like breathing. I just started it yesternight and about a 1/3 of the way through, he also highlights certain aspects of the study of the mind in relation to its historcal perspective(s).Although the subject/topics are a bit challenging, if you think you may be interested in this book, It is well worth your time. Also, I think his paradigm exposes/shows us concepts perhaps that may have permeated some of our current and past leaders in all walks of life. Something to consider and think about.My hats off to Mr. Ronson, Great job.This is an excellent book and it is excellently written. I believe I will read it again very soon just to see what I missed: even dispite the topic difficulty.It really gives you a great deal to think about, and seems related to Brightsided, in terms of some modern moras."
172,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/326263-patrick,4,"I blame Ronson for turning me on to mega-nut David Icke and his endlessly entertaining Lizard people conspiracy theory in ""Them: Adventures with Extremists.""In this one he's asked to investigate an elaborate and weird hoax involving a book called ""Being or Nothingness,"" by Joe K. - which takes him to Indiana and Douglas Hofstadter (""Godel, Escher, Bach"").That in turn sets him off on psychopaths, the Hare Psychopathy Checklist. Lots of oddballs emerge.Ronson's got a funny style, and apparently a real knack for tracking down the world's screwballs. Very interesting and enjoyable.Also uncomfortable at times, especially when the reader starts considering the psychopath checklist in terms of himself or his friends."
173,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina,2,"This is actually a 1.5 stars book. Meh. The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson has absolutely nothing of interest to say. It's been on my ""to read"" shelf for a while so when I impulsively bought it one day while sitting bored in a doctor's office, I couldn't remember why I had wanted to read it, just that I did. Why can't I learn my lesson about impulsive book-buying? It rarely turns out well. Ronson starts the book by recounting the Mystery of the Mysterious Book. An expensively produced, attractive hard bound book was sent to various academics around the world and none of them can figure out why they received the book or what its purpose is. The sender is unknown, but the books were sent from Sweden. Ronson is recruited to solve the mystery. Along the way, he gets interested in the idea of mental illness and psychopaths and also begins pursing the idea of what it means to be diagnosed as a psychopath and how they are diagnosed. Ronson interviews various psychologists in the field, including Robert Hare, creator of the PCL-R (the Hare Checklist for psychopathology). Ronson also talks with people who doubt the accuracy of the PCL-R (Scientologists...ha ha ha ha), discusses his own neuroses and anxieties, muses on the tendency of psychologists these days to over-analyze, abuses the exclamation mark and makes a lot of lame jokes. This is an idiotic book. I would not recommend it to anyone who is interested in psychopathology and either has a good layperson's understanding of psychopathology or is a professional in the field of psychology (unless that person wants a good laugh). Some of the books Ronson lists as research sources I've already read (plus Harvey Cleckley's Mask of Sanity which Ronson mentions but didn't read) so I already knew more about psychopathology than the author; this revelation did not make me happy. When Ronson begins to explore the subject, he has only the vaguest (Hollywood-influenced) idea of psychopaths and who does he turn to first? Why, Scientologists of course. I mean, if I wanted an understanding of any topic in the field of psychology, I would automatically turn to a group of nutbars who believe in aliens but think psychology is nonsense. A group within Scientologists called the CCHR (Citizens Commission on Human Rights) have made it their mission to ""prove to the world that psychiatrists are wicked and must be stopped"" (28). Ronson is impressed by their record of exposing some very bad psychiatrists...well, yes, they did expose some bad ones, but the examples that Ronson provides (provided to him by the CCHR) are fairly obvious quacks (or mentally ill individuals) who were in the field for reasons other than to honestly practice the profession. Eventually Ronson decides that talking to actual psychologists instead of Scientologists is a good idea. I got fairly disgusted early on when a Scientologist took him to Broadmoor (insane asylum in England) to meet a psychopath (Tony) who isn't really a psychopath--he just pretended to be one so he could avoid prison. Once in Broadmoor, surprise surprise, Tony is diagnosed as a psychopath. Ronson listens to Tony's story of woe without (seemingly) a critical thought in his head. Because at this point Ronson still hasn't done any research about psychopaths, he is completely taken in by Tony's story and believes he is wrongly incarcerated. It's not until later when he talks with Tony's doctor does he have a more informed view of Tony and why he is at Broadmoor. This whole book irritates me because I can't decide if Ronson is really such an idiot or if he possesses some sly sense of humor I can't perceive. When Ronson finally gets to Robert Hare and his pathology checklist, I'm again annoyed. He walks around with the checklist and interviews people whose behavior suggests psychopathology (most notable: Al Dunlap, former CEO--and destroyer--of the Sunbeam Corporation and Emmanuel ""Toto"" Constant, leader of the paramilitary group FRAPH in Haiti). Ronson mentally checks off each psychopath characteristic (Item 6: Lack of Remorse or Guilt, Item 7: Shallow Affect) he thinks they display as he interviews them. With Dunlap, Ronson goes straight through the list and directly asks him about each item. Ronson describes himself as feeling powerful because he has this secret knowledge and can identify psychopaths. What Ronson (willfully?) forgets (ignores?) is that it's not enough to say, yeah, this person seems to not have empathy or sympathy, but an interviewee also has to determine to what degree this person doesn't have sympathy. Maybe some things do bother him and others don't. I understand that at least one of Ronson's objectives of the book is to say, hey, it's way too easy to diagnose someone with a mental illness by going through a list. Well, yeah. This is not a revelation. The fact that Ronson thinks this state of affairs within the psychology/psychiatry field is shocking is, in itself, shocking. What field doesn't have its instances of abuse and misuse? He has a chapter discussing how children are diagnosed with bipolar disorders and then prescribed drugs to treat this (as many psychologists think) imaginary children's condition. It's apparently the latest fad. Parents with kids who are moody or restless or high-energy and don't have the time to deal with them get their children diagnosed with something (for a while ADHD was huge; maybe it still is) and doped up. Parents aren't necessarily to blame; there are the professionals who misdiagnose and the pharmaceutical industry eager to make money any way it can. Many factors create and exacerbate the abuse of Hare's PCL-R and the way anyone is misdiagnosed and over-medicated. The Psychopath Test is generally a mess of a book. There's no clear thesis/objective for the book. What exactly is Ronson investigating? What is he trying to prove? His discussion of the PCL-R is thrown off track by the chapter detailing how the DSM is created (a rather haphazard and unscientific process if Ronson's information is correct) and the misdiagnosis of children. If Ronson wanted to explore the abuses of psychology and psychiatry (combined with the shady connection between psychiatrists and the pharmaceutical industry), then why didn't he do that? This book is merely a glib commentary on several topics combined with the author's (non-humorous) observations of his own anxieties and neuroses. Although I did not like how he approached the topic nor how he wrote it, I am still interested in reading (if not buying) Ronson's other books. It's clear that Ronson was out of his depth with this subject. "
174,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22440207-agn,4,"WHAT IS IT ABOUT?In his book “The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry,” a bestselling journalist Jon Ronson, propelled by a mysterious hoax played on the world’s leading scientists, dives into the world of madness to explore just how mad we really are. During his two-year journey, Ronson not only interviews a bunch of madmen as well as several influential psychologists, psychiatrists and anti-psychiatric Scientologists but also practices his newly gained skill of using Hare Psychopathy Checklist to spot psychopaths. Unexpectedly and quite disturbingly, the author discovers the society’s drive for the ‘right amount’ of insanity, and often detrimental tendency to define individuals by their maddest edges.THUMBS UP:1) Intriguing introduction.The first chapter of “The Psychopath Test” is THE BEST (mysterious, suspenseful and utterly captivating) introductory chapter I have ever read in a non-fiction book. The opening story is so bizarre it can be easily turned into a book itself.2) Well researched, skillfully written.Ronson’s style is quite humorous and engaging, making his non-fiction very readable and not in the least dry. Also, the author put quite some time and effort into researching and interviewing, which allowed him to explore the madness industry from multiple perspectives, which in turn enables the readers to form their own opinions on the matter. COULD BE BETTER:1) Not what I expected.I guess it’s not really the author’s fault, but I was expecting this book to be more about psychopaths and less about everything else. Instead, at least half of the book has little to do with psychopathy as the author probes multiple issues related to general insanity. It works this way as well, but I was hoping for an in-depth exploration of the psychopath’s mind and thus was a tiny bit disappointed.2) Fragmented and seemingly directionless.While I was reading “The Psychopath Test,” I felt rather confused as if the story has been patched together from several seemingly unrelated parts: at first the book seemed like a really engaging mystery, then it became psychopath-oriented, but soon enough the chapters became quite independent, loosely connected by the general madness theme. Honestly, up until the final chapters I wasn’t sure where the story was going. Although at the very end the author’s intentions became more or less clear, Ronson could have done a better job guiding the reader throughout the whole book.VERDICT: 4 out of 5Although “The Psychopath Test” might seem a little fragmented and directionless, it is nonetheless a very entertaining non-fiction that carries an important message."
175,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7232207-fiona,3,"I had a run-in with a psychopath once. I definitely came out worse from that encounter.But that's the thing that I just can't get my head around: once upon a time, I met a bona fide psychopath and in hindsight it was really, really noticeable! But if, according to Jon Ronson and his sources, psychopaths make up a little less than 1% of the population, where are all the rest of them? Are one in ten Londoners psychopathic? (Apparently they head for big cities.) Are prisons disproportionately full of them? I mean, I imagine so, but even that wouldn't account for the fact that I've identifiably met considerably fewer of them than I would expect to. Where've I been? Mostly (in my adult life) legal academia, the construction industry, and musical theatre. Hardly hotbeds of the empathetic.So something is a bit off, and I think Jon Ronson also knows this: his book is not just called Psychopaths, but The Psychopath Test - it's also partly about diagnosis of mental health problems. It's really engaging, and Ronson is a great writer, but it's hardly in depth. He's got a really light touch, skipping from prison populations to business management, to the writing of DSM-III, to the potential for misdiagnosis of childhood ADHD. This is a 250-page book! I feel like the book poses more questions than it answers, mainly because there's not enough time, and Ronson has no apparent inclination, to go into anything in any depth. He's just spotted something shiny and moved on.So what do I want to know about psychopaths? Well, what I'm missing, for a start. I don't believe that nearly one in a hundred people on this earth are incurably heinous, robot-hearted monsters with no souls and an aptitude on the London Stock Exchange. So is the percentage smaller, or does psychopathy actually mean something different to that? Is it possible to have all these traits and still have a meaningful life, loving relationships and friendships, and do some good in the world? I'm sure it must be; coming out of this book, I saw no indication of it. Have a bit of optimism, Jon! The world's not completely up the creek. It can't be as totally hopeless as you make it out to be. Which means - what aren't you telling me?"
176,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526809-donna,4,"Saw the interview on 'John Stewart', then ordered it like a cubic zirconia tennis bracelet from The Shopping Channel.

Then again, maybe they wanted it to look that way. Once I got used to this clash of esthetics, I found it a great deal of fun. Wha? A book about psychopathy fun? He doesn't just seek out the usual suspects. He talks to Bob Hare who came up with the oft used checklist to spot it. I was worried at first, that Ronson would turn out to be one of tthose 'it all comes back to me' sorts of interviewers, but he asked many of the questions I would have liked to ask. He doesn't give the impression of being thorough, but he is. So he talked with Bob Hare, which resulted in his seeing psychopaths everywhere. He visited Al Dunlap, dismantler of Sunbeam to wonder whether he might be one. ""He pointed at a sculpture of four sharks encircling the planet. 'I believe in predators,' he said. 'Their spirit will enable you to succeed. Over there you've got falcons. Alligators. Alligators. More alligators. Tigers.' 'It's As if both Midas and also the Queen of Narnia were here,' I said, 'and the Queen of Narnia flew above a particularly fierce zoo and turned everything there to stone and then transported everything here.' 'What?' said Al. 'Nothing,' I said. 'No,' he said, 'What did you just say?' He shot me a steely, blue-eyed stare, which I found quite debilitating. ""I appreciated how he took the subject out of prison where we, the still living prey can really relate to it. Of course,I liked this because it's really all about me. Without seeming to, he also gets into some searching questions about journalism and madness. "

I have for a while now had an interest in psychology and mental disorders of various kinds, finding them absolutely fascinating to read about. Psychopathy (or sociopathy) was something, however, that I didn't really know much about prior to reading this book. I certainly hadn't heard of The Psychopath Test, created by Bob Hare, a Canadian criminal psychologist.In his book, Ronson shares his encounters with various people that may or may not be classified as psychopaths, from a man known only as ""Tony"" who 'fakes' madness to get out of a prison sentence, to Al Dunlap, a retired corporate executive with a tendency to see factors on the Psychopath Test as positive in the eyes of business. All is told from the humorous and objective viewpoint of Ronson, whilst over-analysing his own motivations in true anxiety-related style.Ronson reminded me a lot of myself at points in this book, and I really enjoyed the way he structured his book and the interviews he conducted. I will definitely be seeking out more of his work, and if you have any interest in the topic of psychopathy, or are a fan of gonzo-style journalism, then I would highly recommend this."

First of all, I listened to the audiobook and Jon Ronson's voice reminds me of Neil Gaiman's, so already it's a win. It's fascinating to consider how psychopathy is diagnosed and what that diagnosis means. Most human beings display some psychopathic traits from time to time, but how do you determine when someone displays enough to be considered a danger to society? Jon Ronson's writing is humorous, fun, and completely engaging. At times the structure of the book felt a little disjointed, but I appreciated how it all came together at the end. Because much of the book consists of interviews with various psychiatrists and psychopaths (and maybe-psychopaths), the reader is able to come to their own conclusions rather than relying on the author to tell you what to think. "
179,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,4,"This is the sort of book that I tend to enjoy – a journalist tells amusing stories about his investigations into a particular topic – but which readers with a more focused interest in the purported subject may find frustrating. Ronson portrays himself as a cheerfully unmethodical explorer of the world of craziness, meeting with experts, prisoners, and potentially psychotic retired executives and presenting their stories and his responses in a lively, vivid style. Some of the stories involved, almost necessarily, are rather horrible, but he keeps the gruesome stuff to a minimum and finds the absurd humor in situations where you might not expect to find it. As engaging and entertaining a book on psychopaths as you are likely to find, and I particularly enjoyed the way he concluded his story. Four and a half stars."

That being said, I really enjoyed this well-rounded take on psychopathy; from the use of labels to the tests to determine if a person is one. He did not take a position and try to convince us, except as a story technique, but that was also done as a full circle. Very good writing for what it is. I loved the same style turned on scientologists and their crusade against psychiatry, the psychopharmacology industry, and the creators of the DSM III through IV (although I would have loved him to take on V as well).He's the same writer of The Men Who Stare At Goats, which I thought was a very funny movie, and I'll have to read that book now.

“Suddenly, madness was everywhere, and I was determined to learn about the impact it had on the way society evolves. I've always believed society to be a fundamentally rational thing, but what if it isn't? What if it is built on insanity?”

 The book was engaging, I enjoyed reading it, however I couldn't help being a little disappointed. While Ronson makes a few good points and raises some good questions, I was hoping the book would go deeper into the world of psychopaths, instead it was mainly focused on his journey of researching the topic. However, I can't hold this too hard against the book as Jon Ronson is an investigative journalist, not a mental health care specialist."
182,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7022024-mike,4,"For a book about psychopaths this was a surprisingly light(ish, come on, we're still talking about psychopaths here) read. The author is a journalist and it covers a wide range of the topic from interviewing a few (suspected) psychopaths, to speaking with psychiatrists who are involved in psychopathy and the classification there of, to scientologists, to neurologists who examined the brains of normal people and psychopaths. It is a fast read of a book that I think does a good job being honest and truth seeking.The psychopath test in this book, called Hare Psychopathy Checklist presents a set of characteristics a person can be graded on. Score too high and you just might be a psychopath. Once the author had learned of this test and taken a seminar about it he started to see it both in his own behavior and others, annotating his interactions with others with various qualities on the test. Instead of narrowly focusing on just psychopaths (and mostly avoiding the lurid details of the more famous/horrifying ones) Ronson presents the reader with a broad, if shallow, survey of the field. He also does an excellent job of linking together different parts of the history of psychology and how those events impact the modern world (such as the explosion of psychological disorder classifications, the massive expansion of pharmaceuticals to ""treat"" these conditions, and how the entertainment industry, especially reality TV, benefits from just the right amount of madness). I found his writing style very accessible and the presentation of the interviews and facts well conveyed without becoming too dry or boring.The animating force behind the book was a weird event where a bunch of scientists from all over the world get a strange, cryptic book. They banded to together over the internet to try and figure it out but were flummoxed. One of the scientists in question contacted Ronson to help and he eventually tracked down the person he thought was responsible. Turns out it likely wasn't some genius mystery maker but likely a slightly off kilter Swede. But Ronson was intrigued by how much this solitary person caused the world to change and wondered how much of the state of the world was due to psychopaths. While he doesn't answer the question (many others, including folks he interviewed, have delved into this) he does write about how psychopathy did appear to be more prevalent in business circles. Given how much havoc financial decisions can make (shutting down manufacturing plants, crashing the economy, putting profits before people, etc.). All in all a fast and interesting read, but not one for people looking for a deeper understanding of psychopathy. I devoured it in the course of an intercontinental (unless you are one of those people who think the Americas are just one continent) and was found the experience both entertaining and enlightening."
183,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76697789-ryan-krueger,5,"** The Psychopath Test by Jon Robson is an informative non-fiction book. The book was written with intent to inform readers about the abundance of psychopaths in our world and how they impact our daily lives. The author is a journalist who has traveled the world to meet with professors, scientists, psychologists and more to find information on this subject to create a strong basis for the book. Ronson makes plenty of flights around the globe to meet with researchers as well as psychopaths themselves. His main point in this is to display how psychopaths are common in our lives whether it be the workplace or interacting with someone who seems in an everyday environment. The work discusses psychopaths lack of emotions such as fear or remorse and how that can lead some people to be at the top of the business chain. Due to them not having remorse they can be willing to fire half of their staff in one day with no regards to how it may affect their lives, while the boss’s mind is only focused on financial gains. A quote in the book goes, “Serial killers ruin families, corporate and political and religious psychopaths ruin economies. They ruin societies.”This is a very interesting book in my opinion as I have always had an interest in the wiring of people’s brains. The details included and quoted from psychopaths that he interviewed were intriguing as they would say stuff along the lines of them wanting to kill to see what blood looks like or what the insides of someone else looks like. The book raises issues on how psychopaths can ruin families, societies, and economies. It covers a wide range of topics and goes into detail on each area including how psychopaths can affect these issues. I agree with everything in this book except that the words psychopath and sociopath can be used interchangeably. After looking into this I’ve found various sources as well as teachers who stated that psychopaths are born the way they are and it’s genetics, while sociopaths are born through traumatic experiences and have capabilities of feeling remorse as well as developing relationships or bonds with others. This book answered a lot of questions I have had. There are two people in my life who I always wondered why they act the way they do but I realized that they are most likely a psychopath. However, it made me realize how easy it can be to target someone as a psychopath due to the bob hare psychopath test and how normal actions can be misinterpreted into a biased stance. As someone who has an interest in helping soldiers suffering from PTSD this relates to my personal agenda due to me having the possibility of preventing someone from becoming a sociopath. "

186,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,4,"While Jon Ronson reveals a great deal about his own neuroses in this book, he casts little light on the psychopaths he is allegedly researching, though he does give some interesting insights into the ""madness industry"" of psychologists who have studied, categorized, labeled, and tried to treat psychopaths, mostly without success.Ronson begins with a strange introduction to the field of psychology and mental illness thanks to a group of Scientologists, who chose him to ""expose"" the evils of psychology. Scientologists believe that all mental disorders are because of engrams accumulated from past lives or space aliens or some shit like that. L. Ron Hubbard had a particular hatred of psychologists. Ronson spends a little time discussing the peculiarities of Scientology, but this book is primarily about psychopaths and what makes them tick... and what makes the people who study them tick.After reading The Psychopath Test, it is not hard to believe that you have to be a little bit crazy to study crazy people. (Look out for those Abnormal Psychology majors...) From the arbitrariness of what goes into the DSM (did you know that far more copies are sold to interested non-academics/non-practitioners than to mental health professionals?) to the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, a diagnostic tool that's become a quick and dirty way to label someone a psychopath, to the Rosenhan Experiment, the history of psychology is filled with enough self-reinforcing bumbling and egomania to make one think the Scientologists may have a point.While Ronson's book is a collection of interesting anecdotes and observations, digressing into the overmedication of children, misdiagnoses of autism, and the brutality of capitalist devotion to ""shareholder value,"" between interviews with ex-death squad leaders and allegedly psychopathic CEO Al Dunlap, it's a bit weak in its critique of science, and sheds little light on his subjects.Martha Stout's book The Sociopath Next Door was more illuminating. Ronson does, however, give a bit of a glimpse into the mind of a sociopath in a way that Stout only addressed abstractly: how do sociopaths/psychopaths (there is no technical difference between them) see themselves? Do they recognize that they are ""broken""? Do they ever want to be cured, and can they be? (Short answer: no.)Ronson's interview with Al Dunlap was particularly interesting, as he actually confronted Dunlap with the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, and the allegations that Dunlap, according to this tool, scored high on the psychopathy scale. Dunlap proceeded to point out that every behavior presented as evidence of being a psychopath could also be interpreted as someone who has a forceful and driven personality who gets things done. True enough, there is a lot of evidence that psychopathy is an asset in positions of power, like boardrooms.Ronson is able to see how some of his subjects ape normal human reactions and manipulate people the way they'd handle a TV remote control, but others, like Al Dunlap, are more ambiguous. Is Dunlap really a psychopath, or just a merciless asshole? As both Stout and Ronson point out, even genuine psychopaths are rarely serial killers; most live law-abiding, respectable lives, though never out of any actual respect for the law or society.An interesting if somewhat meandering trip into the perilous world of diagnosing psychopaths, The Psychopath Test is not exactly a weighty, heavily-researched book, but it will be of interest to anyone who has an, ahem, clinical interest in psychopaths."
187,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14084605-pink,4,"A real thought provoker. What is a psychopath? Are you a psychopath? How about your friends or co-workers? This book will leave you diagnosing everyone you know and becoming all powerful with your new amazing psychopath detection skills, just like Jon Ronson. The book really made me think about how mental illness is defined. Sure there are clear cut cases of insanity and sanity, but there's a huge area in the middle, with a range of diagnoses that are possible to be made and indeed are being sweepingly made and medicated for across the world. Quite apart from the issues of psychopath detection and detention, there were some interesting stories. A wide range of people were interviewed for his research and I was fascinated by several of their lives, whether they were the professionals, or the patients. This was my first Jon Ronson book and I haven't read any of his journalistic material so his style of writing is all new to me. I appreciated the humour and details about himself that were included, which broke up some pretty heavy content at times. I also liked how the book came full circle and re-visited the people at the beginning of his journey, which gave closure to their own stories. Much recommended and I can't wait to read more of his books now! "

189,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4529669-willow,4,"Jon Ronson is a hoot. It would be great to have lunch with him. He puts so much of himself into his writing, bringing up his own little insecurities and observations, pretty much showing that he’ll be happy to go anywhere or do anything provided there’s a good story. This book is all over the place following Jon around and he brings up different case studies after another. In fact, I’m not sure they had that much in common with each other except that Jon decided they were worth investigating. This ‘all over the place’ is the book’s weakness and the reason I knocked a star. You see, I’m not sure Jon really proved his point. That doesn’t mean it wasn’t informative and entertaining. I definitely learned a lot about the psychopath test, which is here by the way: http://thinkcreatedesign.wordpress.co...Some of the provocative ideas this book brings up is that psychopaths may actually have a brain abnormality that has to do with their amygdale. They don’t feel the full range of emotions like most people. This makes them fearless, lacking in empathy and they gravitate toward positions of power because they are missing regular emotional stimulation. There could be one psychopath in every hundred people. Jon even jokes that he started seeing psychopaths everywhere once he acquired his new psychopath spotting skills. Obviously he’s not the only one with psychopath spotting skills. One of the reviews on GR even suggested that pretty much everybody in the GOP is a psychopath, posting pictures. Judging by the seriousness of her review, and the lack of seriousness in Jon’s book, I can’t help but think that she ignored the last quarter of the book. That’s because by the end, Jon is rethinking what he’s learned about psychopaths and the psychopath test, suggesting that nothing is cut and dried, and scoring high on a test shouldn’t get you locked away forever. He takes a look at criminal profilers and some of their serious blunders (something crime shows rarely show on TV). If the police are convinced you are the culprit, or a doctor wants to slap a diagnosis on you, they will find a way, because that’s what they want to find. Both the media, the pharmaceutical companies, and the public want to promote mental illness for different reasons. Categorizing is something humans love to do. We look for order in a chaotic world. It’s comforting. And sometimes when people are trying to fit someone in a personality box, we ignore all the things that make them not fit there. Psychology is not an exact science I’ve read that The Society for the Scientific Study of Psychopathy (SSSP) published a statement regarding this book stating that certain interviews in it were exaggerated or fictionalised and that they ""think that Ronson’s book trivializes a serious personality disorder and its measurement, which is not helpful to those who have the disorder or to their unfortunate victims"".This statement made me laugh, because I don’t think this book was ever meant to be a deep serious study of psychopaths. It’s more about Jon investigating them, and coming up with different conclusions. He’s a thoughtful writer and I enjoyed reading his observations. I think this book raises more questions than it answers. I love that. "
190,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1016626-tim-pendry,3,"This book is being promoted as 'comic'. Sadly, it is not. It is quite a sad read. I laughed once out loud and smiled twice but only in the first chapter. If you end this book laughing, you have not ‘got it’. You should leave it a little angry and troubled.Ronson exhibits all the graces and the flaws of modern British journalism. It is an easy read. The man is self-questioning (though clearly not too deeply lest he cease to function) and he is honest. But he is also skimming the surface of issues that require a far tougher and better book than this.Perhaps he is being cleverer than I think. Perhaps his periodic questioning of the way his profession turns reality into narratives, into modern folk tales, will create a suspicion in the public's mind about how it receives information, how its mental world is structured. I think not.The book is about the phenomenon of the psychopath which operates at so many levels as part of our cultural self-definition. As a species, we tend to need a scapegoat for structural ills that derive from our own nature - so, why not the 'psychopath' in our culture.Perhaps 1% of the population is 'psychopathic' in the sense of presenting a reasonable danger to others under certain conditions. Perhaps another 5% have traits that could be dangerous under yet other more extreme conditions. I suspect 88% are just a danger to themselves as ‘normals’.Political fear (I speak as a radical empath who is in the 'other' 6%, potentially equally dangerous to society for completely different reasons) seems to be determining that media headlines must ensure that 'psychopaths' are defined for incarceration by their nature rather than by their deeds.Yet, as Charlie Chaplin’s M. Verdoux so eloquently put it in the film of that name, it is not the single psychopath whose default mode is tolerance for enormous crimes against humanity but the vast ‘normal’ mass who vote, work and play without much of a thought in their little minds.Ronson opens the door to such subversive thinking but he only peeks in. The psychopath in Broadmoor is judged fit for release and we know it is a gamble. The corporate boss targeted as a psychopath turns out to be depressingly conventional in his private life. So far, so ‘normal’.But Scientologists prove to be champions of human rights and psychiatrists appear to be at forefront of new sociologies of population control, aided by pharmaceuticals interests who turn any mild abnormality from a genetic variant of possible evolutionary value into a diagnosed disease.Some of the most ethically filthy conduct in the book, leading to suicide and death in their victims, come from ‘normals’, the same sort of ‘normal’ who obeys an order in a war or who thinks corporate career progression is a substitute for personal responsibility.The book deserves better than its jokey style. Perhaps the jokey style will build more understanding amongst the general population and that is its justification. Unfortunately, it will probably just flow off most ‘normal’s backs like that of the proverbial duck.So let us try the analysis here that Ronson seems nervous of attempting – that hoary old business, no doubt, in his case, of just being a reporter, just telling a story.First, as he rightly points out, there really are very dangerous persons which we have termed psychopaths but which are simply at one genetic and personality end of our human Bell Curve. They are not monsters, they are human. They are simply accentuations of aspects of our normal selves.Society needs protection but it also needs to recognize, in different ecological circumstances, that they may be more important to us than ourselves in the future of our own species. We have to hope we hang on to civilization long enough to ensure that they are never needed.Second, these dangerous ones are there but they are rare. We cannot build our entire social structure around protecting ourselves from what amounts to a force of nature any more than we should be degenerating as a free and questioning culture because of a few terrorists.Faced with nature, sometimes bad things happen. They will continue to happen. ‘The bomber will always get through’. This is what we are as humans. It is dreadful for the victim but these cases are still rare and we should concentrate on a society that polices itself and is not policed.What is happening is that the existence of the genuine psychopath and the genuine terrorist is being used by the authoritarian bureaucrat to introduce ever-increasing controls on our movement, conduct and language (aspirationally, on our minds) in an attempt to manage the unmanageable.Without the ‘noble lie’ of a religion, with no Pope to serve Constantine, the bureaucrats are turning to definitional analysis and what they like to call science but which is no more scientific than was Lysenko under Stalin. If this book does one service, it is to cast doubt on the more radical scientific credentials of psychology.Over the last two decades, the psychologists and social scientists have found themselves riding on a lucrative gravy train medicalising ‘misbehaviour’ and unhappiness and offering cures based on chemicals and incarceration. The sick are becoming overwhelmed by the worried and the inconvenient.These new priests of the mind are now busy perpetrating the lie of there being no free will (a spurious philosophical conclusion from consciousness studies by people who could usefully spend some time reading the great existentialists) and the even worse lie of a beneficent normality.It was men in white coats who murdered the physically abnormal in euthanasia programmes under national-socialism. It is now men in white coats who are engaged in soul murder against the mentally different. There are throw-away stories in the book of how gays and feminists could lobby successfully to ensure that certain psychological definitions were abandoned. Either science is science or it is not. Scientific decision-making in physics would not allow the peer review to include a lobbyist.‘Conditions’ that have no politically powerful lobbies against them also have many commercial and family interests seeking their establishment. But we have to keep our feet on the ground. If social science and psychology are socio-political tools, there are still things to be cured or managed.There are people seriously suffering pain (yet the system still refuses to let psychiatrists test low dosage levels of psychedelics for depression and trauma). There is certainly work to be done on re-engineering society for relief from anxiety and self empowerment.What is grossly unacceptable is to allow social or family order requirements to permit collusion between drug companies, a morally degenerate professional class and the state or parents in the use of drugs for social control of behaviours that are merely inconvenient or embarrassing.We live in monstrous times. This book, to its credit, opens the door on the monsters – psychopathic and professional alike. We have a choice to go through the door and see what our society has become or shut it and pretend it is not happening. So, my regret about this well-written, entertaining and thought-provoking book is that Ronson limits himself to anecdotes and questions. ‘Normals’ will pick this up, be entertained and go back to being ‘normal’ again. ‘Normal’ people are the shills for the men in white coats and grey suits. What we really need now are writers who show people that just being ‘normal’ (and certainly being ‘normalised’) is damned dangerous to them and to their kids’ future and that ‘normal’ now means little more than manageable and controllable. Ronson merely skims the surface of this story."
191,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara,5,"I couldn't imagine that a book about psychopaths would be so good! Ronson interviews lots of people including people in institutions for the criminally insane, Scientologists, psychiatrists and conspiracy theorists. Ronson also has a very engaging narrating style. We all encounter psychopaths, and sometimes it takes time for us to realize the person has a personality disorder. They may be work colleagues, neighbors, and other people we interact with. It has helped me at times to realize that someone's behavior fits the parameters of psychopathy. Of course, Ronson also explores cases where individuals have been institutionalized for years or even a lifetime without adequate evidence that they continue to be a threat to others. I recommend this to anyone interested in the topic of psychopathic behavior but don't want a technical treatment for the subject."
192,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"Entertaining and a surprisingly breezy read, The Psychopath Test is a somewhat rambling and ultimately non-conclusive record of an investigative journey into the mental health industry, conspiracy theories and scientology. The author meets some very interesting people -- about whom you can form your own conclusions: I was never exactly happy about Bob Hare.I enjoyed reading it, but oddly I'm not sure I can recommend it. Looking back at it, there's not much substance, and isn't as hilariously funny as the blurb and reviews on the back would have you believe -- then again, I don't think it was a waste of time either."
193,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62761616-imane,4,"This was an enjoyable read. In addition to defining and describing the traits of psychopathy, the author raises some questions regarding the sanity of the industry of psychiatry .Overall it was informative, funny and sometimes disturbing; reading about the brutal murders was not my favorite part but if you are looking for ways to spot a psychopath then this book is the one. "
194,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5487874-g,3,"3.5/5Less of ""a journey through the madness industry"" and more of a random romp. Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable one. The Psychopath Test didn't bring me any greater clarity on the subject. Instead, it gave me more to think about. And, frankly, I'm not not mad about that. I'd actually like to read more of Jon Ronson's work."
195,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,4,"4.5 starsJon Ronson is one of those writers - like David Sedaris - whose voice you hear as you read his words; the soft, slightly effete, often uncertain lilt of his sounding in the reader's inner ear. This is one of the things that makes him such an engaging writer, along with his style of placing himself (and his neuroses, which are particularly apposite in this context) directly in view, a method which rather than obscuring his subjects illuminates them, by giving us such an upfront view. The very subjectivity of Ronson's journalistic style allows us to see the complexity of the tale with clarity.In this book Ronson stitches together, as usual, stories that illuminate a single theme - initially tied loosely but bound tighter and tighter as the book progresses. The chapters each involve a way in which we view madness, starting with his own rather off-hand description of an interviewee as a ""psychopath"" and his involvement in an entirely unrelated mystery (which is ultimately used to bookend the volume) which then spirals off from his increasing fascination with the diagnosis of mental disorders following delving into the DSM-IV (and subsequent self diagnosis of a dozen disorders). We meet a patient at Broadmoor high security psychiatric hospital, committed following an insanity plea when on trial for GBH and a subsequent diagnosis as a psychopath, a history of that disorder and its diagnosis and treatment, and then on to a gallery of cases involving both people Ronson has interviewed (psychologists, psychiatrists, a former Haitian paramilitary leader, a corporate CEO famous for his glee in downsizing for fun and profit, former MI5 agent David Shayler) and others whose lives have been changed by direct or indirect contact either those who may have psychiatric disorders or with the madness industry tat has grown around them.The connecting thread is this; that over recent decades we have become increasingly fond of defining behaviours that lay on the spectrum of human personality as 'disorders', using methods which may or may not be scientific and may or may not be accurate. There is plenty of questioning of those methods in this book, but the criticism is largely leveled at those people and organisations that are too ready to use these blunt tools for their own ends - whether it is the pharmaceutical industry and their ever increasing push to medicate human difference or the Metropolitan Police entrapping a neat suspect in a murder case despite a complete lack of evidence, while possibly allowing the actual killer the freedom to kill again.Ronson is sometimes described as a humorist (as does Will Self in his Guardian review quoted on the blurb) but I think this is entirely misleading. Ronson is and always has been a journalist, albeit one who uses his wit and humour to allow us insights to the things about which he writes, a technique which is also effective when he drops it to highlight the sad or horrific - the town of Shubuta, Mississippi, devastated when the local toaster factory was closed to increase the manufacturing company's share price, the murders committed by actual violent psychopaths, the deaths and harm caused by the 'reality' TV industry when they have focused on a distorted view of what is not 'normal'. And, unlike much journalism, this does not attempt to give definite answers; the threads Ronson has drawn together are tied neatly enough to make sense but with enough frayed, trailing lines to leave the reader pondering long after closing the book."
196,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,4,"So Jon Ronson, the man who brought the theory that the world is run by extraterrestrial lizard people to the world's attention, turns his worried gaze to psychopaths. He wrote something like a deeply ambivalent travelogue of his time writing this book. We meet death squad leaders and CEOs who love firing people. We meet a man wrongly picked by a criminal profiler as a brutal killer and we meet Scientologists. We meet the man who helped get homosexuality out of the DSM as a psychiatric condition and we meet a guy who tried nude LSD-assisted psychotherapy for criminal psychopaths. We meet a man who believes no one blew themselves up in subway cars in London one July day and we meet a woman on one of those subway cars. And what do we learn? I’m not sure. That psychiatry started using check lists to standardize diagnoses and the pharmacologization of psychiatry followed, yes. That now in three days, you too can diagnose psychopaths with a handy dandy 40 question check list, yes. But those are headlines, not books. That psychopaths are both like, and unlike, extraterrestrial lizard people, maybe. I quite enjoyed this book. I’m struggling to find something useful to say about it. As foreshadowed above, ambivalent travelogue is the best I’ve come up with. I thought at first the thesis was that psychopaths are everywhere, disproportionately in positions of power, and how they use that power destroys the world. Bob Hare, the man who developed the psychopath test itself, told Ronson he regretted doing so much of his work in prisons instead of on the stock exchange. When Ronson protested that serial killers were worse than psychopathic stock brokers, Hare said:‘“Serial killers ruin families.’ Bob shrugged. ‘Corporate and political and religious psychopaths ruin economies. They ruin societies.’	“This – Bob was saying – was the straightforward solution to the greatest mystery of all: why is the world so unfair? Why all that savage economic injustice, those brutal wars, the everyday corporate cruelty? The answer: psychopaths. The part of the brain that doesn’t function right. . . . . We aren’t all good people just trying to do good. Some of us are psychopaths. And psychopaths are to blame for this brutal, misshapen society. They’re the jagged rocks thrown into the still pond.” (112)And that moved me deeply. But Ronson doesn’t develop that thesis. Instead, he travelogues his earnest conversations with marginal nutball after marginal nutball, takes a brief foray into how the modern psychiatric profession became what it is today, then returns us to a secure psychiatric facility to watch a man committed for years after faking madness be released. Maybe there’s nothing more to be said on that. The idea that psychopaths drive the action on the world stage may be just too depressing to stare at for too long, even if you do have a BBC film crew with you. It was a good book. Well worth reading. I have the nagging feeling there was a better one inchoate in the source material, but I’m dead certain Ronson did better than I would have writing it. "
197,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3397530-lea,4,"I am a huuuuuge Jon Ronson fan, so it's no surprise that I enjoyed this book too. The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry lives up to its title -- Ronson really does take the reader on a journey through the ""madness industry"". The book opens with a bit of a mystery concerning an unusual book that was mailed to various academics throughout the world. At first it doesn't seem to fit the theme of the book, but Ronson ties it in eventually. His typical style is to jump around between subjects, finding common themes, and this book is no different -- we meet an incarcerated psychopath (who may not, in fact, be a psychopath at all), learn about the methods of diagnosing psychopathy, investigate current psychological diagnoses (especially those in children), and see another possible psychopath's positive spin on those ""negative"" traits. The book also looks at Scientology's war on psychiatry, the experimental psychiatric treatments of the 1970s, and criminal profiling. The author covers a lot of ground here, but it's a very fast read. There are several parts that are unsettling -- some crime descriptions, the kafka-esque plight of those stuck in a psychiatric catch-22, a child's accidental overdose of psychiatric medication -- although that could be more indicative of my sensitivity than anythng else.As usual, Ronson explores his own feelings and anxieties as well. Some readers may find this annoying, although his fans most likely won't -- I enjoy those parts of his books!All in all, I really enjoyed this book, and I would recommend it, especially if you've read and liked his previous books."
198,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948275-josh,3,"Let me begin by saying that the title is deceiving. While it does go into the subject of psychopaths and eventually ends with it, there are many points at which I felt like Ronson's main objective was the critique the overall approach to mental disorders that this country (and other researchers from other countries around the world) have taken over the years. We've gotten ourselves into the habit of classifying every little oddity in our personalities as something strange and unwanted, rather than looking at people as individuals with individualistic tendencies -- and this is especially true when it comes to differences of the mind and its inner workings. So, the fact that I was reading this book as a way into psychopaths and psychopaths alone left me with a unsavory taste once I started to realize that there was much more going on here that I wasn't prepared for. Which isn't to say that I disliked any of what was in the book. There are some very interesting (and entertaining) takes on issues such as Scientology, childhood psychiatry, and even conspiracy theorists. However, that's not what the title of the book leads you to believe the book is about. And I call that false advertisement. And no matter how entertaining this book ended up being (and it was -- Ronson tells a story here, with a plot and everything, rather than reporting like a journalist), no matter how drawn in I was into the story he created, the fact still remains that I don't feel like I learned nearly enough about psychopaths as I should have from a book titled, ""The Psychopath Test."""

Listened to the audiobook read by the author himself, and was hooked after only a few minutes; then when Ronson started talking about Douglas Hofstadter and Scientologists I had to think ""I am so lucky to be listening to this book!"" I learned about how the original DSM was created - how arbitrary all those diagnoses are - and that's (can I say:) depressing. I should write a thoughtful review but I am pressed for time, so I will quote Laura Miller at Salon: [Ronson is] not afraid to play the feckless neurotic for laughs, but that doesn't obscure the serious questions raise by his investigations. Psychiatric diagnoses (and, these days, the medications that follow) really can become fads, with certain experts suddenly deciding that multiple personality disorder or childhood bipolar disorder are far more common that ever before suspected. Ronson even finds the occasion for a little professional soul-searching; he accuses himself and other journalists of being the Goldilocks of craziness, seeking out people to write about who are just nuts enough to be colorful but not so disturbed that they're downright sad."
201,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4845040-gregory,5,"Mr. Ronson puts forth ideas, scenarios, and real life observations in a easily read format. He writes so fluently that reading this book is like breathing. I just started it yesternight and about a 1/3 of the way through, he also highlights certain aspects of the study of the mind in relation to its historcal perspective(s).Although the subject/topics are a bit challenging, if you think you may be interested in this book, It is well worth your time. Also, I think his paradigm exposes/shows us concepts perhaps that may have permeated some of our current and past leaders in all walks of life. Something to consider and think about.My hats off to Mr. Ronson, Great job.This is an excellent book and it is excellently written. I believe I will read it again very soon just to see what I missed: even dispite the topic difficulty.It really gives you a great deal to think about, and seems related to Brightsided, in terms of some modern moras."
202,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/326263-patrick,4,"I blame Ronson for turning me on to mega-nut David Icke and his endlessly entertaining Lizard people conspiracy theory in ""Them: Adventures with Extremists.""In this one he's asked to investigate an elaborate and weird hoax involving a book called ""Being or Nothingness,"" by Joe K. - which takes him to Indiana and Douglas Hofstadter (""Godel, Escher, Bach"").That in turn sets him off on psychopaths, the Hare Psychopathy Checklist. Lots of oddballs emerge.Ronson's got a funny style, and apparently a real knack for tracking down the world's screwballs. Very interesting and enjoyable.Also uncomfortable at times, especially when the reader starts considering the psychopath checklist in terms of himself or his friends."
203,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina,2,"This is actually a 1.5 stars book. Meh. The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson has absolutely nothing of interest to say. It's been on my ""to read"" shelf for a while so when I impulsively bought it one day while sitting bored in a doctor's office, I couldn't remember why I had wanted to read it, just that I did. Why can't I learn my lesson about impulsive book-buying? It rarely turns out well. Ronson starts the book by recounting the Mystery of the Mysterious Book. An expensively produced, attractive hard bound book was sent to various academics around the world and none of them can figure out why they received the book or what its purpose is. The sender is unknown, but the books were sent from Sweden. Ronson is recruited to solve the mystery. Along the way, he gets interested in the idea of mental illness and psychopaths and also begins pursing the idea of what it means to be diagnosed as a psychopath and how they are diagnosed. Ronson interviews various psychologists in the field, including Robert Hare, creator of the PCL-R (the Hare Checklist for psychopathology). Ronson also talks with people who doubt the accuracy of the PCL-R (Scientologists...ha ha ha ha), discusses his own neuroses and anxieties, muses on the tendency of psychologists these days to over-analyze, abuses the exclamation mark and makes a lot of lame jokes. This is an idiotic book. I would not recommend it to anyone who is interested in psychopathology and either has a good layperson's understanding of psychopathology or is a professional in the field of psychology (unless that person wants a good laugh). Some of the books Ronson lists as research sources I've already read (plus Harvey Cleckley's Mask of Sanity which Ronson mentions but didn't read) so I already knew more about psychopathology than the author; this revelation did not make me happy. When Ronson begins to explore the subject, he has only the vaguest (Hollywood-influenced) idea of psychopaths and who does he turn to first? Why, Scientologists of course. I mean, if I wanted an understanding of any topic in the field of psychology, I would automatically turn to a group of nutbars who believe in aliens but think psychology is nonsense. A group within Scientologists called the CCHR (Citizens Commission on Human Rights) have made it their mission to ""prove to the world that psychiatrists are wicked and must be stopped"" (28). Ronson is impressed by their record of exposing some very bad psychiatrists...well, yes, they did expose some bad ones, but the examples that Ronson provides (provided to him by the CCHR) are fairly obvious quacks (or mentally ill individuals) who were in the field for reasons other than to honestly practice the profession. Eventually Ronson decides that talking to actual psychologists instead of Scientologists is a good idea. I got fairly disgusted early on when a Scientologist took him to Broadmoor (insane asylum in England) to meet a psychopath (Tony) who isn't really a psychopath--he just pretended to be one so he could avoid prison. Once in Broadmoor, surprise surprise, Tony is diagnosed as a psychopath. Ronson listens to Tony's story of woe without (seemingly) a critical thought in his head. Because at this point Ronson still hasn't done any research about psychopaths, he is completely taken in by Tony's story and believes he is wrongly incarcerated. It's not until later when he talks with Tony's doctor does he have a more informed view of Tony and why he is at Broadmoor. This whole book irritates me because I can't decide if Ronson is really such an idiot or if he possesses some sly sense of humor I can't perceive. When Ronson finally gets to Robert Hare and his pathology checklist, I'm again annoyed. He walks around with the checklist and interviews people whose behavior suggests psychopathology (most notable: Al Dunlap, former CEO--and destroyer--of the Sunbeam Corporation and Emmanuel ""Toto"" Constant, leader of the paramilitary group FRAPH in Haiti). Ronson mentally checks off each psychopath characteristic (Item 6: Lack of Remorse or Guilt, Item 7: Shallow Affect) he thinks they display as he interviews them. With Dunlap, Ronson goes straight through the list and directly asks him about each item. Ronson describes himself as feeling powerful because he has this secret knowledge and can identify psychopaths. What Ronson (willfully?) forgets (ignores?) is that it's not enough to say, yeah, this person seems to not have empathy or sympathy, but an interviewee also has to determine to what degree this person doesn't have sympathy. Maybe some things do bother him and others don't. I understand that at least one of Ronson's objectives of the book is to say, hey, it's way too easy to diagnose someone with a mental illness by going through a list. Well, yeah. This is not a revelation. The fact that Ronson thinks this state of affairs within the psychology/psychiatry field is shocking is, in itself, shocking. What field doesn't have its instances of abuse and misuse? He has a chapter discussing how children are diagnosed with bipolar disorders and then prescribed drugs to treat this (as many psychologists think) imaginary children's condition. It's apparently the latest fad. Parents with kids who are moody or restless or high-energy and don't have the time to deal with them get their children diagnosed with something (for a while ADHD was huge; maybe it still is) and doped up. Parents aren't necessarily to blame; there are the professionals who misdiagnose and the pharmaceutical industry eager to make money any way it can. Many factors create and exacerbate the abuse of Hare's PCL-R and the way anyone is misdiagnosed and over-medicated. The Psychopath Test is generally a mess of a book. There's no clear thesis/objective for the book. What exactly is Ronson investigating? What is he trying to prove? His discussion of the PCL-R is thrown off track by the chapter detailing how the DSM is created (a rather haphazard and unscientific process if Ronson's information is correct) and the misdiagnosis of children. If Ronson wanted to explore the abuses of psychology and psychiatry (combined with the shady connection between psychiatrists and the pharmaceutical industry), then why didn't he do that? This book is merely a glib commentary on several topics combined with the author's (non-humorous) observations of his own anxieties and neuroses. Although I did not like how he approached the topic nor how he wrote it, I am still interested in reading (if not buying) Ronson's other books. It's clear that Ronson was out of his depth with this subject. "
204,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22440207-agn,4,"WHAT IS IT ABOUT?In his book “The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry,” a bestselling journalist Jon Ronson, propelled by a mysterious hoax played on the world’s leading scientists, dives into the world of madness to explore just how mad we really are. During his two-year journey, Ronson not only interviews a bunch of madmen as well as several influential psychologists, psychiatrists and anti-psychiatric Scientologists but also practices his newly gained skill of using Hare Psychopathy Checklist to spot psychopaths. Unexpectedly and quite disturbingly, the author discovers the society’s drive for the ‘right amount’ of insanity, and often detrimental tendency to define individuals by their maddest edges.THUMBS UP:1) Intriguing introduction.The first chapter of “The Psychopath Test” is THE BEST (mysterious, suspenseful and utterly captivating) introductory chapter I have ever read in a non-fiction book. The opening story is so bizarre it can be easily turned into a book itself.2) Well researched, skillfully written.Ronson’s style is quite humorous and engaging, making his non-fiction very readable and not in the least dry. Also, the author put quite some time and effort into researching and interviewing, which allowed him to explore the madness industry from multiple perspectives, which in turn enables the readers to form their own opinions on the matter. COULD BE BETTER:1) Not what I expected.I guess it’s not really the author’s fault, but I was expecting this book to be more about psychopaths and less about everything else. Instead, at least half of the book has little to do with psychopathy as the author probes multiple issues related to general insanity. It works this way as well, but I was hoping for an in-depth exploration of the psychopath’s mind and thus was a tiny bit disappointed.2) Fragmented and seemingly directionless.While I was reading “The Psychopath Test,” I felt rather confused as if the story has been patched together from several seemingly unrelated parts: at first the book seemed like a really engaging mystery, then it became psychopath-oriented, but soon enough the chapters became quite independent, loosely connected by the general madness theme. Honestly, up until the final chapters I wasn’t sure where the story was going. Although at the very end the author’s intentions became more or less clear, Ronson could have done a better job guiding the reader throughout the whole book.VERDICT: 4 out of 5Although “The Psychopath Test” might seem a little fragmented and directionless, it is nonetheless a very entertaining non-fiction that carries an important message."
205,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7232207-fiona,3,"I had a run-in with a psychopath once. I definitely came out worse from that encounter.But that's the thing that I just can't get my head around: once upon a time, I met a bona fide psychopath and in hindsight it was really, really noticeable! But if, according to Jon Ronson and his sources, psychopaths make up a little less than 1% of the population, where are all the rest of them? Are one in ten Londoners psychopathic? (Apparently they head for big cities.) Are prisons disproportionately full of them? I mean, I imagine so, but even that wouldn't account for the fact that I've identifiably met considerably fewer of them than I would expect to. Where've I been? Mostly (in my adult life) legal academia, the construction industry, and musical theatre. Hardly hotbeds of the empathetic.So something is a bit off, and I think Jon Ronson also knows this: his book is not just called Psychopaths, but The Psychopath Test - it's also partly about diagnosis of mental health problems. It's really engaging, and Ronson is a great writer, but it's hardly in depth. He's got a really light touch, skipping from prison populations to business management, to the writing of DSM-III, to the potential for misdiagnosis of childhood ADHD. This is a 250-page book! I feel like the book poses more questions than it answers, mainly because there's not enough time, and Ronson has no apparent inclination, to go into anything in any depth. He's just spotted something shiny and moved on.So what do I want to know about psychopaths? Well, what I'm missing, for a start. I don't believe that nearly one in a hundred people on this earth are incurably heinous, robot-hearted monsters with no souls and an aptitude on the London Stock Exchange. So is the percentage smaller, or does psychopathy actually mean something different to that? Is it possible to have all these traits and still have a meaningful life, loving relationships and friendships, and do some good in the world? I'm sure it must be; coming out of this book, I saw no indication of it. Have a bit of optimism, Jon! The world's not completely up the creek. It can't be as totally hopeless as you make it out to be. Which means - what aren't you telling me?"
206,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526809-donna,4,"Saw the interview on 'John Stewart', then ordered it like a cubic zirconia tennis bracelet from The Shopping Channel. I got a slow start with it. The Kindle app formatting is kinda shitty. stray lines. Typos. I kept asking myself whether anybody checked it out beforehand. Then again, maybe they wanted it to look that way. Once I got used to this clash of esthetics, I found it a great deal of fun. Wha? A book about psychopathy fun? He doesn't just seek out the usual suspects. He talks to Bob Hare who came up with the oft used checklist to spot it. I was worried at first, that Ronson would turn out to be one of tthose 'it all comes back to me' sorts of interviewers, but he asked many of the questions I would have liked to ask. He doesn't give the impression of being thorough, but he is. So he talked with Bob Hare, which resulted in his seeing psychopaths everywhere. He visited Al Dunlap, dismantler of Sunbeam to wonder whether he might be one. ""He pointed at a sculpture of four sharks encircling the planet. 'I believe in predators,' he said. 'Their spirit will enable you to succeed. Over there you've got falcons. Alligators. Alligators. More alligators. Tigers.' 'It's As if both Midas and also the Queen of Narnia were here,' I said, 'and the Queen of Narnia flew above a particularly fierce zoo and turned everything there to stone and then transported everything here.' 'What?' said Al. 'Nothing,' I said. 'No,' he said, 'What did you just say?' He shot me a steely, blue-eyed stare, which I found quite debilitating. ""I appreciated how he took the subject out of prison where we, the still living prey can really relate to it. Of course,I liked this because it's really all about me. Without seeming to, he also gets into some searching questions about journalism and madness. "
207,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4636758-vanessa,4,"I really enjoyed this book. I have for a while now had an interest in psychology and mental disorders of various kinds, finding them absolutely fascinating to read about. Psychopathy (or sociopathy) was something, however, that I didn't really know much about prior to reading this book. I certainly hadn't heard of The Psychopath Test, created by Bob Hare, a Canadian criminal psychologist.In his book, Ronson shares his encounters with various people that may or may not be classified as psychopaths, from a man known only as ""Tony"" who 'fakes' madness to get out of a prison sentence, to Al Dunlap, a retired corporate executive with a tendency to see factors on the Psychopath Test as positive in the eyes of business. All is told from the humorous and objective viewpoint of Ronson, whilst over-analysing his own motivations in true anxiety-related style.Ronson reminded me a lot of myself at points in this book, and I really enjoyed the way he structured his book and the interviews he conducted. I will definitely be seeking out more of his work, and if you have any interest in the topic of psychopathy, or are a fan of gonzo-style journalism, then I would highly recommend this."
208,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3659939-bree,4,"Really, really enjoyed this. First of all, I listened to the audiobook and Jon Ronson's voice reminds me of Neil Gaiman's, so already it's a win. It's fascinating to consider how psychopathy is diagnosed and what that diagnosis means. Most human beings display some psychopathic traits from time to time, but how do you determine when someone displays enough to be considered a danger to society? Jon Ronson's writing is humorous, fun, and completely engaging. At times the structure of the book felt a little disjointed, but I appreciated how it all came together at the end. Because much of the book consists of interviews with various psychiatrists and psychopaths (and maybe-psychopaths), the reader is able to come to their own conclusions rather than relying on the author to tell you what to think. "
209,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,4,"This is the sort of book that I tend to enjoy – a journalist tells amusing stories about his investigations into a particular topic – but which readers with a more focused interest in the purported subject may find frustrating. Ronson portrays himself as a cheerfully unmethodical explorer of the world of craziness, meeting with experts, prisoners, and potentially psychotic retired executives and presenting their stories and his responses in a lively, vivid style. Some of the stories involved, almost necessarily, are rather horrible, but he keeps the gruesome stuff to a minimum and finds the absurd humor in situations where you might not expect to find it. As engaging and entertaining a book on psychopaths as you are likely to find, and I particularly enjoyed the way he concluded his story. Four and a half stars."
210,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,4,"Ok, first of all, I have to admit I have a soft spot in my heart for the pop-psy. That being said, I really enjoyed this well-rounded take on psychopathy; from the use of labels to the tests to determine if a person is one. He did not take a position and try to convince us, except as a story technique, but that was also done as a full circle. Very good writing for what it is. I loved the same style turned on scientologists and their crusade against psychiatry, the psychopharmacology industry, and the creators of the DSM III through IV (although I would have loved him to take on V as well).He's the same writer of The Men Who Stare At Goats, which I thought was a very funny movie, and I'll have to read that book now. I've become a fan of the author. :)"

“Suddenly, madness was everywhere, and I was determined to learn about the impact it had on the way society evolves. I've always believed society to be a fundamentally rational thing, but what if it isn't? What if it is built on insanity?”

 The book was engaging, I enjoyed reading it, however I couldn't help being a little disappointed. While Ronson makes a few good points and raises some good questions, I was hoping the book would go deeper into the world of psychopaths, instead it was mainly focused on his journey of researching the topic. However, I can't hold this too hard against the book as Jon Ronson is an investigative journalist, not a mental health care specialist."
212,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7022024-mike,4,"For a book about psychopaths this was a surprisingly light(ish, come on, we're still talking about psychopaths here) read. The author is a journalist and it covers a wide range of the topic from interviewing a few (suspected) psychopaths, to speaking with psychiatrists who are involved in psychopathy and the classification there of, to scientologists, to neurologists who examined the brains of normal people and psychopaths. It is a fast read of a book that I think does a good job being honest and truth seeking.The psychopath test in this book, called Hare Psychopathy Checklist presents a set of characteristics a person can be graded on. Score too high and you just might be a psychopath. Once the author had learned of this test and taken a seminar about it he started to see it both in his own behavior and others, annotating his interactions with others with various qualities on the test. Instead of narrowly focusing on just psychopaths (and mostly avoiding the lurid details of the more famous/horrifying ones) Ronson presents the reader with a broad, if shallow, survey of the field. He also does an excellent job of linking together different parts of the history of psychology and how those events impact the modern world (such as the explosion of psychological disorder classifications, the massive expansion of pharmaceuticals to ""treat"" these conditions, and how the entertainment industry, especially reality TV, benefits from just the right amount of madness). I found his writing style very accessible and the presentation of the interviews and facts well conveyed without becoming too dry or boring.The animating force behind the book was a weird event where a bunch of scientists from all over the world get a strange, cryptic book. They banded to together over the internet to try and figure it out but were flummoxed. One of the scientists in question contacted Ronson to help and he eventually tracked down the person he thought was responsible. Turns out it likely wasn't some genius mystery maker but likely a slightly off kilter Swede. But Ronson was intrigued by how much this solitary person caused the world to change and wondered how much of the state of the world was due to psychopaths. While he doesn't answer the question (many others, including folks he interviewed, have delved into this) he does write about how psychopathy did appear to be more prevalent in business circles. Given how much havoc financial decisions can make (shutting down manufacturing plants, crashing the economy, putting profits before people, etc.). All in all a fast and interesting read, but not one for people looking for a deeper understanding of psychopathy. I devoured it in the course of an intercontinental (unless you are one of those people who think the Americas are just one continent) and was found the experience both entertaining and enlightening."
213,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76697789-ryan-krueger,5,"** The Psychopath Test by Jon Robson is an informative non-fiction book. The book was written with intent to inform readers about the abundance of psychopaths in our world and how they impact our daily lives. The author is a journalist who has traveled the world to meet with professors, scientists, psychologists and more to find information on this subject to create a strong basis for the book. Ronson makes plenty of flights around the globe to meet with researchers as well as psychopaths themselves. His main point in this is to display how psychopaths are common in our lives whether it be the workplace or interacting with someone who seems in an everyday environment. The work discusses psychopaths lack of emotions such as fear or remorse and how that can lead some people to be at the top of the business chain. Due to them not having remorse they can be willing to fire half of their staff in one day with no regards to how it may affect their lives, while the boss’s mind is only focused on financial gains. A quote in the book goes, “Serial killers ruin families, corporate and political and religious psychopaths ruin economies. They ruin societies.”This is a very interesting book in my opinion as I have always had an interest in the wiring of people’s brains. The details included and quoted from psychopaths that he interviewed were intriguing as they would say stuff along the lines of them wanting to kill to see what blood looks like or what the insides of someone else looks like. The book raises issues on how psychopaths can ruin families, societies, and economies. It covers a wide range of topics and goes into detail on each area including how psychopaths can affect these issues. I agree with everything in this book except that the words psychopath and sociopath can be used interchangeably. After looking into this I’ve found various sources as well as teachers who stated that psychopaths are born the way they are and it’s genetics, while sociopaths are born through traumatic experiences and have capabilities of feeling remorse as well as developing relationships or bonds with others. This book answered a lot of questions I have had. There are two people in my life who I always wondered why they act the way they do but I realized that they are most likely a psychopath. However, it made me realize how easy it can be to target someone as a psychopath due to the bob hare psychopath test and how normal actions can be misinterpreted into a biased stance. As someone who has an interest in helping soldiers suffering from PTSD this relates to my personal agenda due to me having the possibility of preventing someone from becoming a sociopath. "
214,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49105612-leah-craig,5,"Spending the next two weeks researching psychopathic case studies. Thanks a lot, Ronson. Byeeeeeeeeeee! "
215,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6296289-tyler-j-gray,4,Very thought-provoking and well worth a read!
216,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,4,"While Jon Ronson reveals a great deal about his own neuroses in this book, he casts little light on the psychopaths he is allegedly researching, though he does give some interesting insights into the ""madness industry"" of psychologists who have studied, categorized, labeled, and tried to treat psychopaths, mostly without success.Ronson begins with a strange introduction to the field of psychology and mental illness thanks to a group of Scientologists, who chose him to ""expose"" the evils of psychology. Scientologists believe that all mental disorders are because of engrams accumulated from past lives or space aliens or some shit like that. L. Ron Hubbard had a particular hatred of psychologists. Ronson spends a little time discussing the peculiarities of Scientology, but this book is primarily about psychopaths and what makes them tick... and what makes the people who study them tick.After reading The Psychopath Test, it is not hard to believe that you have to be a little bit crazy to study crazy people. (Look out for those Abnormal Psychology majors...) From the arbitrariness of what goes into the DSM (did you know that far more copies are sold to interested non-academics/non-practitioners than to mental health professionals?) to the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, a diagnostic tool that's become a quick and dirty way to label someone a psychopath, to the Rosenhan Experiment, the history of psychology is filled with enough self-reinforcing bumbling and egomania to make one think the Scientologists may have a point.While Ronson's book is a collection of interesting anecdotes and observations, digressing into the overmedication of children, misdiagnoses of autism, and the brutality of capitalist devotion to ""shareholder value,"" between interviews with ex-death squad leaders and allegedly psychopathic CEO Al Dunlap, it's a bit weak in its critique of science, and sheds little light on his subjects.Martha Stout's book The Sociopath Next Door was more illuminating. Ronson does, however, give a bit of a glimpse into the mind of a sociopath in a way that Stout only addressed abstractly: how do sociopaths/psychopaths (there is no technical difference between them) see themselves? Do they recognize that they are ""broken""? Do they ever want to be cured, and can they be? (Short answer: no.)Ronson's interview with Al Dunlap was particularly interesting, as he actually confronted Dunlap with the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, and the allegations that Dunlap, according to this tool, scored high on the psychopathy scale. Dunlap proceeded to point out that every behavior presented as evidence of being a psychopath could also be interpreted as someone who has a forceful and driven personality who gets things done. True enough, there is a lot of evidence that psychopathy is an asset in positions of power, like boardrooms.Ronson is able to see how some of his subjects ape normal human reactions and manipulate people the way they'd handle a TV remote control, but others, like Al Dunlap, are more ambiguous. Is Dunlap really a psychopath, or just a merciless asshole? As both Stout and Ronson point out, even genuine psychopaths are rarely serial killers; most live law-abiding, respectable lives, though never out of any actual respect for the law or society.An interesting if somewhat meandering trip into the perilous world of diagnosing psychopaths, The Psychopath Test is not exactly a weighty, heavily-researched book, but it will be of interest to anyone who has an, ahem, clinical interest in psychopaths."
217,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14084605-pink,4,"A real thought provoker. What is a psychopath? Are you a psychopath? How about your friends or co-workers? This book will leave you diagnosing everyone you know and becoming all powerful with your new amazing psychopath detection skills, just like Jon Ronson. The book really made me think about how mental illness is defined. Sure there are clear cut cases of insanity and sanity, but there's a huge area in the middle, with a range of diagnoses that are possible to be made and indeed are being sweepingly made and medicated for across the world. Quite apart from the issues of psychopath detection and detention, there were some interesting stories. A wide range of people were interviewed for his research and I was fascinated by several of their lives, whether they were the professionals, or the patients. This was my first Jon Ronson book and I haven't read any of his journalistic material so his style of writing is all new to me. I appreciated the humour and details about himself that were included, which broke up some pretty heavy content at times. I also liked how the book came full circle and re-visited the people at the beginning of his journey, which gave closure to their own stories. Much recommended and I can't wait to read more of his books now! "

219,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4529669-willow,4,"Jon Ronson is a hoot. It would be great to have lunch with him. He puts so much of himself into his writing, bringing up his own little insecurities and observations, pretty much showing that he’ll be happy to go anywhere or do anything provided there’s a good story. This book is all over the place following Jon around and he brings up different case studies after another. In fact, I’m not sure they had that much in common with each other except that Jon decided they were worth investigating. This ‘all over the place’ is the book’s weakness and the reason I knocked a star. You see, I’m not sure Jon really proved his point. That doesn’t mean it wasn’t informative and entertaining. I definitely learned a lot about the psychopath test, which is here by the way: http://thinkcreatedesign.wordpress.co...Some of the provocative ideas this book brings up is that psychopaths may actually have a brain abnormality that has to do with their amygdale. They don’t feel the full range of emotions like most people. This makes them fearless, lacking in empathy and they gravitate toward positions of power because they are missing regular emotional stimulation. There could be one psychopath in every hundred people. Jon even jokes that he started seeing psychopaths everywhere once he acquired his new psychopath spotting skills. Obviously he’s not the only one with psychopath spotting skills. One of the reviews on GR even suggested that pretty much everybody in the GOP is a psychopath, posting pictures. Judging by the seriousness of her review, and the lack of seriousness in Jon’s book, I can’t help but think that she ignored the last quarter of the book. That’s because by the end, Jon is rethinking what he’s learned about psychopaths and the psychopath test, suggesting that nothing is cut and dried, and scoring high on a test shouldn’t get you locked away forever. He takes a look at criminal profilers and some of their serious blunders (something crime shows rarely show on TV). If the police are convinced you are the culprit, or a doctor wants to slap a diagnosis on you, they will find a way, because that’s what they want to find. Both the media, the pharmaceutical companies, and the public want to promote mental illness for different reasons. Categorizing is something humans love to do. We look for order in a chaotic world. It’s comforting. And sometimes when people are trying to fit someone in a personality box, we ignore all the things that make them not fit there. Psychology is not an exact science I’ve read that The Society for the Scientific Study of Psychopathy (SSSP) published a statement regarding this book stating that certain interviews in it were exaggerated or fictionalised and that they ""think that Ronson’s book trivializes a serious personality disorder and its measurement, which is not helpful to those who have the disorder or to their unfortunate victims"".This statement made me laugh, because I don’t think this book was ever meant to be a deep serious study of psychopaths. It’s more about Jon investigating them, and coming up with different conclusions. He’s a thoughtful writer and I enjoyed reading his observations. I think this book raises more questions than it answers. I love that. "
220,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1016626-tim-pendry,3,"This book is being promoted as 'comic'. Sadly, it is not. It is quite a sad read. I laughed once out loud and smiled twice but only in the first chapter. If you end this book laughing, you have not ‘got it’. You should leave it a little angry and troubled.Ronson exhibits all the graces and the flaws of modern British journalism. It is an easy read. The man is self-questioning (though clearly not too deeply lest he cease to function) and he is honest. But he is also skimming the surface of issues that require a far tougher and better book than this.Perhaps he is being cleverer than I think. Perhaps his periodic questioning of the way his profession turns reality into narratives, into modern folk tales, will create a suspicion in the public's mind about how it receives information, how its mental world is structured. I think not.The book is about the phenomenon of the psychopath which operates at so many levels as part of our cultural self-definition. As a species, we tend to need a scapegoat for structural ills that derive from our own nature - so, why not the 'psychopath' in our culture.Perhaps 1% of the population is 'psychopathic' in the sense of presenting a reasonable danger to others under certain conditions. Perhaps another 5% have traits that could be dangerous under yet other more extreme conditions. I suspect 88% are just a danger to themselves as ‘normals’.Political fear (I speak as a radical empath who is in the 'other' 6%, potentially equally dangerous to society for completely different reasons) seems to be determining that media headlines must ensure that 'psychopaths' are defined for incarceration by their nature rather than by their deeds.Yet, as Charlie Chaplin’s M. Verdoux so eloquently put it in the film of that name, it is not the single psychopath whose default mode is tolerance for enormous crimes against humanity but the vast ‘normal’ mass who vote, work and play without much of a thought in their little minds.Ronson opens the door to such subversive thinking but he only peeks in. The psychopath in Broadmoor is judged fit for release and we know it is a gamble. The corporate boss targeted as a psychopath turns out to be depressingly conventional in his private life. So far, so ‘normal’.But Scientologists prove to be champions of human rights and psychiatrists appear to be at forefront of new sociologies of population control, aided by pharmaceuticals interests who turn any mild abnormality from a genetic variant of possible evolutionary value into a diagnosed disease.Some of the most ethically filthy conduct in the book, leading to suicide and death in their victims, come from ‘normals’, the same sort of ‘normal’ who obeys an order in a war or who thinks corporate career progression is a substitute for personal responsibility.The book deserves better than its jokey style. Perhaps the jokey style will build more understanding amongst the general population and that is its justification. Unfortunately, it will probably just flow off most ‘normal’s backs like that of the proverbial duck.So let us try the analysis here that Ronson seems nervous of attempting – that hoary old business, no doubt, in his case, of just being a reporter, just telling a story.First, as he rightly points out, there really are very dangerous persons which we have termed psychopaths but which are simply at one genetic and personality end of our human Bell Curve. They are not monsters, they are human. They are simply accentuations of aspects of our normal selves.Society needs protection but it also needs to recognize, in different ecological circumstances, that they may be more important to us than ourselves in the future of our own species. We have to hope we hang on to civilization long enough to ensure that they are never needed.Second, these dangerous ones are there but they are rare. We cannot build our entire social structure around protecting ourselves from what amounts to a force of nature any more than we should be degenerating as a free and questioning culture because of a few terrorists.Faced with nature, sometimes bad things happen. They will continue to happen. ‘The bomber will always get through’. This is what we are as humans. It is dreadful for the victim but these cases are still rare and we should concentrate on a society that polices itself and is not policed.What is happening is that the existence of the genuine psychopath and the genuine terrorist is being used by the authoritarian bureaucrat to introduce ever-increasing controls on our movement, conduct and language (aspirationally, on our minds) in an attempt to manage the unmanageable.Without the ‘noble lie’ of a religion, with no Pope to serve Constantine, the bureaucrats are turning to definitional analysis and what they like to call science but which is no more scientific than was Lysenko under Stalin. If this book does one service, it is to cast doubt on the more radical scientific credentials of psychology.Over the last two decades, the psychologists and social scientists have found themselves riding on a lucrative gravy train medicalising ‘misbehaviour’ and unhappiness and offering cures based on chemicals and incarceration. The sick are becoming overwhelmed by the worried and the inconvenient.These new priests of the mind are now busy perpetrating the lie of there being no free will (a spurious philosophical conclusion from consciousness studies by people who could usefully spend some time reading the great existentialists) and the even worse lie of a beneficent normality.It was men in white coats who murdered the physically abnormal in euthanasia programmes under national-socialism. It is now men in white coats who are engaged in soul murder against the mentally different. There are throw-away stories in the book of how gays and feminists could lobby successfully to ensure that certain psychological definitions were abandoned. Either science is science or it is not. Scientific decision-making in physics would not allow the peer review to include a lobbyist.‘Conditions’ that have no politically powerful lobbies against them also have many commercial and family interests seeking their establishment. But we have to keep our feet on the ground. If social science and psychology are socio-political tools, there are still things to be cured or managed.There are people seriously suffering pain (yet the system still refuses to let psychiatrists test low dosage levels of psychedelics for depression and trauma). There is certainly work to be done on re-engineering society for relief from anxiety and self empowerment.What is grossly unacceptable is to allow social or family order requirements to permit collusion between drug companies, a morally degenerate professional class and the state or parents in the use of drugs for social control of behaviours that are merely inconvenient or embarrassing.We live in monstrous times. This book, to its credit, opens the door on the monsters – psychopathic and professional alike. We have a choice to go through the door and see what our society has become or shut it and pretend it is not happening. So, my regret about this well-written, entertaining and thought-provoking book is that Ronson limits himself to anecdotes and questions. ‘Normals’ will pick this up, be entertained and go back to being ‘normal’ again. ‘Normal’ people are the shills for the men in white coats and grey suits. What we really need now are writers who show people that just being ‘normal’ (and certainly being ‘normalised’) is damned dangerous to them and to their kids’ future and that ‘normal’ now means little more than manageable and controllable. Ronson merely skims the surface of this story."
221,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara,5,"I couldn't imagine that a book about psychopaths would be so good! Ronson interviews lots of people including people in institutions for the criminally insane, Scientologists, psychiatrists and conspiracy theorists. Ronson also has a very engaging narrating style. We all encounter psychopaths, and sometimes it takes time for us to realize the person has a personality disorder. They may be work colleagues, neighbors, and other people we interact with. It has helped me at times to realize that someone's behavior fits the parameters of psychopathy. Of course, Ronson also explores cases where individuals have been institutionalized for years or even a lifetime without adequate evidence that they continue to be a threat to others. I recommend this to anyone interested in the topic of psychopathic behavior but don't want a technical treatment for the subject."
222,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"Entertaining and a surprisingly breezy read, The Psychopath Test is a somewhat rambling and ultimately non-conclusive record of an investigative journey into the mental health industry, conspiracy theories and scientology. The author meets some very interesting people -- about whom you can form your own conclusions: I was never exactly happy about Bob Hare.I enjoyed reading it, but oddly I'm not sure I can recommend it. Looking back at it, there's not much substance, and isn't as hilariously funny as the blurb and reviews on the back would have you believe -- then again, I don't think it was a waste of time either."

In addition to defining and describing the traits of psychopathy, the author raises some questions regarding the sanity of the industry of psychiatry .Overall it was informative, funny and sometimes disturbing; reading about the brutal murders was not my favorite part but if you are looking for ways to spot a psychopath then this book is the one.

The Psychopath Test didn't bring me any greater clarity on the subject. Instead, it gave me more to think about. And, frankly, I'm not not mad about that. I'd actually like to read more of Jon Ronson's work."
225,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,4,"4.5 starsJon Ronson is one of those writers - like David Sedaris - whose voice you hear as you read his words; the soft, slightly effete, often uncertain lilt of his sounding in the reader's inner ear. This is one of the things that makes him such an engaging writer, along with his style of placing himself (and his neuroses, which are particularly apposite in this context) directly in view, a method which rather than obscuring his subjects illuminates them, by giving us such an upfront view. The very subjectivity of Ronson's journalistic style allows us to see the complexity of the tale with clarity.In this book Ronson stitches together, as usual, stories that illuminate a single theme - initially tied loosely but bound tighter and tighter as the book progresses. The chapters each involve a way in which we view madness, starting with his own rather off-hand description of an interviewee as a ""psychopath"" and his involvement in an entirely unrelated mystery (which is ultimately used to bookend the volume) which then spirals off from his increasing fascination with the diagnosis of mental disorders following delving into the DSM-IV (and subsequent self diagnosis of a dozen disorders). We meet a patient at Broadmoor high security psychiatric hospital, committed following an insanity plea when on trial for GBH and a subsequent diagnosis as a psychopath, a history of that disorder and its diagnosis and treatment, and then on to a gallery of cases involving both people Ronson has interviewed (psychologists, psychiatrists, a former Haitian paramilitary leader, a corporate CEO famous for his glee in downsizing for fun and profit, former MI5 agent David Shayler) and others whose lives have been changed by direct or indirect contact either those who may have psychiatric disorders or with the madness industry tat has grown around them.The connecting thread is this; that over recent decades we have become increasingly fond of defining behaviours that lay on the spectrum of human personality as 'disorders', using methods which may or may not be scientific and may or may not be accurate. There is plenty of questioning of those methods in this book, but the criticism is largely leveled at those people and organisations that are too ready to use these blunt tools for their own ends - whether it is the pharmaceutical industry and their ever increasing push to medicate human difference or the Metropolitan Police entrapping a neat suspect in a murder case despite a complete lack of evidence, while possibly allowing the actual killer the freedom to kill again.Ronson is sometimes described as a humorist (as does Will Self in his Guardian review quoted on the blurb) but I think this is entirely misleading. Ronson is and always has been a journalist, albeit one who uses his wit and humour to allow us insights to the things about which he writes, a technique which is also effective when he drops it to highlight the sad or horrific - the town of Shubuta, Mississippi, devastated when the local toaster factory was closed to increase the manufacturing company's share price, the murders committed by actual violent psychopaths, the deaths and harm caused by the 'reality' TV industry when they have focused on a distorted view of what is not 'normal'. And, unlike much journalism, this does not attempt to give definite answers; the threads Ronson has drawn together are tied neatly enough to make sense but with enough frayed, trailing lines to leave the reader pondering long after closing the book."
226,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,4,"So Jon Ronson, the man who brought the theory that the world is run by extraterrestrial lizard people to the world's attention, turns his worried gaze to psychopaths. He wrote something like a deeply ambivalent travelogue of his time writing this book. We meet death squad leaders and CEOs who love firing people. We meet a man wrongly picked by a criminal profiler as a brutal killer and we meet Scientologists. We meet the man who helped get homosexuality out of the DSM as a psychiatric condition and we meet a guy who tried nude LSD-assisted psychotherapy for criminal psychopaths. We meet a man who believes no one blew themselves up in subway cars in London one July day and we meet a woman on one of those subway cars. And what do we learn? I’m not sure. That psychiatry started using check lists to standardize diagnoses and the pharmacologization of psychiatry followed, yes. That now in three days, you too can diagnose psychopaths with a handy dandy 40 question check list, yes. But those are headlines, not books. That psychopaths are both like, and unlike, extraterrestrial lizard people, maybe. I quite enjoyed this book. I’m struggling to find something useful to say about it. As foreshadowed above, ambivalent travelogue is the best I’ve come up with. I thought at first the thesis was that psychopaths are everywhere, disproportionately in positions of power, and how they use that power destroys the world. Bob Hare, the man who developed the psychopath test itself, told Ronson he regretted doing so much of his work in prisons instead of on the stock exchange. When Ronson protested that serial killers were worse than psychopathic stock brokers, Hare said:‘“Serial killers ruin families.’ Bob shrugged. ‘Corporate and political and religious psychopaths ruin economies. They ruin societies.’	“This – Bob was saying – was the straightforward solution to the greatest mystery of all: why is the world so unfair? Why all that savage economic injustice, those brutal wars, the everyday corporate cruelty? The answer: psychopaths. The part of the brain that doesn’t function right. . . . . We aren’t all good people just trying to do good. Some of us are psychopaths. And psychopaths are to blame for this brutal, misshapen society. They’re the jagged rocks thrown into the still pond.” (112)And that moved me deeply. But Ronson doesn’t develop that thesis. Instead, he travelogues his earnest conversations with marginal nutball after marginal nutball, takes a brief foray into how the modern psychiatric profession became what it is today, then returns us to a secure psychiatric facility to watch a man committed for years after faking madness be released. Maybe there’s nothing more to be said on that. The idea that psychopaths drive the action on the world stage may be just too depressing to stare at for too long, even if you do have a BBC film crew with you. It was a good book. Well worth reading. I have the nagging feeling there was a better one inchoate in the source material, but I’m dead certain Ronson did better than I would have writing it. "
227,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3397530-lea,4,"I am a huuuuuge Jon Ronson fan, so it's no surprise that I enjoyed this book too. The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry lives up to its title -- Ronson really does take the reader on a journey through the ""madness industry"". The book opens with a bit of a mystery concerning an unusual book that was mailed to various academics throughout the world. At first it doesn't seem to fit the theme of the book, but Ronson ties it in eventually. His typical style is to jump around between subjects, finding common themes, and this book is no different -- we meet an incarcerated psychopath (who may not, in fact, be a psychopath at all), learn about the methods of diagnosing psychopathy, investigate current psychological diagnoses (especially those in children), and see another possible psychopath's positive spin on those ""negative"" traits. The book also looks at Scientology's war on psychiatry, the experimental psychiatric treatments of the 1970s, and criminal profiling. The author covers a lot of ground here, but it's a very fast read. There are several parts that are unsettling -- some crime descriptions, the kafka-esque plight of those stuck in a psychiatric catch-22, a child's accidental overdose of psychiatric medication -- although that could be more indicative of my sensitivity than anythng else.As usual, Ronson explores his own feelings and anxieties as well. Some readers may find this annoying, although his fans most likely won't -- I enjoy those parts of his books!All in all, I really enjoyed this book, and I would recommend it, especially if you've read and liked his previous books."
228,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948275-josh,3,"Let me begin by saying that the title is deceiving. While it does go into the subject of psychopaths and eventually ends with it, there are many points at which I felt like Ronson's main objective was the critique the overall approach to mental disorders that this country (and other researchers from other countries around the world) have taken over the years. We've gotten ourselves into the habit of classifying every little oddity in our personalities as something strange and unwanted, rather than looking at people as individuals with individualistic tendencies -- and this is especially true when it comes to differences of the mind and its inner workings. So, the fact that I was reading this book as a way into psychopaths and psychopaths alone left me with a unsavory taste once I started to realize that there was much more going on here that I wasn't prepared for. Which isn't to say that I disliked any of what was in the book. There are some very interesting (and entertaining) takes on issues such as Scientology, childhood psychiatry, and even conspiracy theorists. However, that's not what the title of the book leads you to believe the book is about. And I call that false advertisement. And no matter how entertaining this book ended up being (and it was -- Ronson tells a story here, with a plot and everything, rather than reporting like a journalist), no matter how drawn in I was into the story he created, the fact still remains that I don't feel like I learned nearly enough about psychopaths as I should have from a book titled, ""The Psychopath Test."""

Listened to the audiobook read by the author himself, and was hooked after only a few minutes; then when Ronson started talking about Douglas Hofstadter and Scientologists I had to think ""I am so lucky to be listening to this book!"" I learned about how the original DSM was created - how arbitrary all those diagnoses are - and that's (can I say:) depressing. I should write a thoughtful review but I am pressed for time, so I will quote Laura Miller at Salon: [Ronson is] not afraid to play the feckless neurotic for laughs, but that doesn't obscure the serious questions raise by his investigations. Psychiatric diagnoses (and, these days, the medications that follow) really can become fads, with certain experts suddenly deciding that multiple personality disorder or childhood bipolar disorder are far more common that ever before suspected. Ronson even finds the occasion for a little professional soul-searching; he accuses himself and other journalists of being the Goldilocks of craziness, seeking out people to write about who are just nuts enough to be colorful but not so disturbed that they're downright sad."
231,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4845040-gregory,5,"Mr. Ronson puts forth ideas, scenarios, and real life observations in a easily read format. He writes so fluently that reading this book is like breathing. I just started it yesternight and about a 1/3 of the way through, he also highlights certain aspects of the study of the mind in relation to its historcal perspective(s).Although the subject/topics are a bit challenging, if you think you may be interested in this book, It is well worth your time. Also, I think his paradigm exposes/shows us concepts perhaps that may have permeated some of our current and past leaders in all walks of life. Something to consider and think about.My hats off to Mr. Ronson, Great job.This is an excellent book and it is excellently written. I believe I will read it again very soon just to see what I missed: even dispite the topic difficulty.It really gives you a great deal to think about, and seems related to Brightsided, in terms of some modern moras."
232,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/326263-patrick,4,"I blame Ronson for turning me on to mega-nut David Icke and his endlessly entertaining Lizard people conspiracy theory in ""Them: Adventures with Extremists.""In this one he's asked to investigate an elaborate and weird hoax involving a book called ""Being or Nothingness,"" by Joe K. - which takes him to Indiana and Douglas Hofstadter (""Godel, Escher, Bach"").That in turn sets him off on psychopaths, the Hare Psychopathy Checklist. Lots of oddballs emerge.Ronson's got a funny style, and apparently a real knack for tracking down the world's screwballs. Very interesting and enjoyable.Also uncomfortable at times, especially when the reader starts considering the psychopath checklist in terms of himself or his friends."
233,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina,2,"This is actually a 1.5 stars book. Meh. The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson has absolutely nothing of interest to say. It's been on my ""to read"" shelf for a while so when I impulsively bought it one day while sitting bored in a doctor's office, I couldn't remember why I had wanted to read it, just that I did. Why can't I learn my lesson about impulsive book-buying? It rarely turns out well. Ronson starts the book by recounting the Mystery of the Mysterious Book. An expensively produced, attractive hard bound book was sent to various academics around the world and none of them can figure out why they received the book or what its purpose is. The sender is unknown, but the books were sent from Sweden. Ronson is recruited to solve the mystery. Along the way, he gets interested in the idea of mental illness and psychopaths and also begins pursing the idea of what it means to be diagnosed as a psychopath and how they are diagnosed. Ronson interviews various psychologists in the field, including Robert Hare, creator of the PCL-R (the Hare Checklist for psychopathology). Ronson also talks with people who doubt the accuracy of the PCL-R (Scientologists...ha ha ha ha), discusses his own neuroses and anxieties, muses on the tendency of psychologists these days to over-analyze, abuses the exclamation mark and makes a lot of lame jokes. This is an idiotic book. I would not recommend it to anyone who is interested in psychopathology and either has a good layperson's understanding of psychopathology or is a professional in the field of psychology (unless that person wants a good laugh). Some of the books Ronson lists as research sources I've already read (plus Harvey Cleckley's Mask of Sanity which Ronson mentions but didn't read) so I already knew more about psychopathology than the author; this revelation did not make me happy. When Ronson begins to explore the subject, he has only the vaguest (Hollywood-influenced) idea of psychopaths and who does he turn to first? Why, Scientologists of course. I mean, if I wanted an understanding of any topic in the field of psychology, I would automatically turn to a group of nutbars who believe in aliens but think psychology is nonsense. A group within Scientologists called the CCHR (Citizens Commission on Human Rights) have made it their mission to ""prove to the world that psychiatrists are wicked and must be stopped"" (28). Ronson is impressed by their record of exposing some very bad psychiatrists...well, yes, they did expose some bad ones, but the examples that Ronson provides (provided to him by the CCHR) are fairly obvious quacks (or mentally ill individuals) who were in the field for reasons other than to honestly practice the profession. Eventually Ronson decides that talking to actual psychologists instead of Scientologists is a good idea. I got fairly disgusted early on when a Scientologist took him to Broadmoor (insane asylum in England) to meet a psychopath (Tony) who isn't really a psychopath--he just pretended to be one so he could avoid prison. Once in Broadmoor, surprise surprise, Tony is diagnosed as a psychopath. Ronson listens to Tony's story of woe without (seemingly) a critical thought in his head. Because at this point Ronson still hasn't done any research about psychopaths, he is completely taken in by Tony's story and believes he is wrongly incarcerated. It's not until later when he talks with Tony's doctor does he have a more informed view of Tony and why he is at Broadmoor. This whole book irritates me because I can't decide if Ronson is really such an idiot or if he possesses some sly sense of humor I can't perceive. When Ronson finally gets to Robert Hare and his pathology checklist, I'm again annoyed. He walks around with the checklist and interviews people whose behavior suggests psychopathology (most notable: Al Dunlap, former CEO--and destroyer--of the Sunbeam Corporation and Emmanuel ""Toto"" Constant, leader of the paramilitary group FRAPH in Haiti). Ronson mentally checks off each psychopath characteristic (Item 6: Lack of Remorse or Guilt, Item 7: Shallow Affect) he thinks they display as he interviews them. With Dunlap, Ronson goes straight through the list and directly asks him about each item. Ronson describes himself as feeling powerful because he has this secret knowledge and can identify psychopaths. What Ronson (willfully?) forgets (ignores?) is that it's not enough to say, yeah, this person seems to not have empathy or sympathy, but an interviewee also has to determine to what degree this person doesn't have sympathy. Maybe some things do bother him and others don't. I understand that at least one of Ronson's objectives of the book is to say, hey, it's way too easy to diagnose someone with a mental illness by going through a list. Well, yeah. This is not a revelation. The fact that Ronson thinks this state of affairs within the psychology/psychiatry field is shocking is, in itself, shocking. What field doesn't have its instances of abuse and misuse? He has a chapter discussing how children are diagnosed with bipolar disorders and then prescribed drugs to treat this (as many psychologists think) imaginary children's condition. It's apparently the latest fad. Parents with kids who are moody or restless or high-energy and don't have the time to deal with them get their children diagnosed with something (for a while ADHD was huge; maybe it still is) and doped up. Parents aren't necessarily to blame; there are the professionals who misdiagnose and the pharmaceutical industry eager to make money any way it can. Many factors create and exacerbate the abuse of Hare's PCL-R and the way anyone is misdiagnosed and over-medicated. The Psychopath Test is generally a mess of a book. There's no clear thesis/objective for the book. What exactly is Ronson investigating? What is he trying to prove? His discussion of the PCL-R is thrown off track by the chapter detailing how the DSM is created (a rather haphazard and unscientific process if Ronson's information is correct) and the misdiagnosis of children. If Ronson wanted to explore the abuses of psychology and psychiatry (combined with the shady connection between psychiatrists and the pharmaceutical industry), then why didn't he do that? This book is merely a glib commentary on several topics combined with the author's (non-humorous) observations of his own anxieties and neuroses. Although I did not like how he approached the topic nor how he wrote it, I am still interested in reading (if not buying) Ronson's other books. It's clear that Ronson was out of his depth with this subject. "
234,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22440207-agn,4,"WHAT IS IT ABOUT?In his book “The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry,” a bestselling journalist Jon Ronson, propelled by a mysterious hoax played on the world’s leading scientists, dives into the world of madness to explore just how mad we really are. During his two-year journey, Ronson not only interviews a bunch of madmen as well as several influential psychologists, psychiatrists and anti-psychiatric Scientologists but also practices his newly gained skill of using Hare Psychopathy Checklist to spot psychopaths. Unexpectedly and quite disturbingly, the author discovers the society’s drive for the ‘right amount’ of insanity, and often detrimental tendency to define individuals by their maddest edges.THUMBS UP:1) Intriguing introduction.The first chapter of “The Psychopath Test” is THE BEST (mysterious, suspenseful and utterly captivating) introductory chapter I have ever read in a non-fiction book. The opening story is so bizarre it can be easily turned into a book itself.2) Well researched, skillfully written.Ronson’s style is quite humorous and engaging, making his non-fiction very readable and not in the least dry. Also, the author put quite some time and effort into researching and interviewing, which allowed him to explore the madness industry from multiple perspectives, which in turn enables the readers to form their own opinions on the matter. COULD BE BETTER:1) Not what I expected.I guess it’s not really the author’s fault, but I was expecting this book to be more about psychopaths and less about everything else. Instead, at least half of the book has little to do with psychopathy as the author probes multiple issues related to general insanity. It works this way as well, but I was hoping for an in-depth exploration of the psychopath’s mind and thus was a tiny bit disappointed.2) Fragmented and seemingly directionless.While I was reading “The Psychopath Test,” I felt rather confused as if the story has been patched together from several seemingly unrelated parts: at first the book seemed like a really engaging mystery, then it became psychopath-oriented, but soon enough the chapters became quite independent, loosely connected by the general madness theme. Honestly, up until the final chapters I wasn’t sure where the story was going. Although at the very end the author’s intentions became more or less clear, Ronson could have done a better job guiding the reader throughout the whole book.VERDICT: 4 out of 5Although “The Psychopath Test” might seem a little fragmented and directionless, it is nonetheless a very entertaining non-fiction that carries an important message."
235,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7232207-fiona,3,"I had a run-in with a psychopath once. I definitely came out worse from that encounter.But that's the thing that I just can't get my head around: once upon a time, I met a bona fide psychopath and in hindsight it was really, really noticeable! But if, according to Jon Ronson and his sources, psychopaths make up a little less than 1% of the population, where are all the rest of them? Are one in ten Londoners psychopathic? (Apparently they head for big cities.) Are prisons disproportionately full of them? I mean, I imagine so, but even that wouldn't account for the fact that I've identifiably met considerably fewer of them than I would expect to. Where've I been? Mostly (in my adult life) legal academia, the construction industry, and musical theatre. Hardly hotbeds of the empathetic.So something is a bit off, and I think Jon Ronson also knows this: his book is not just called Psychopaths, but The Psychopath Test - it's also partly about diagnosis of mental health problems. It's really engaging, and Ronson is a great writer, but it's hardly in depth. He's got a really light touch, skipping from prison populations to business management, to the writing of DSM-III, to the potential for misdiagnosis of childhood ADHD. This is a 250-page book! I feel like the book poses more questions than it answers, mainly because there's not enough time, and Ronson has no apparent inclination, to go into anything in any depth. He's just spotted something shiny and moved on.So what do I want to know about psychopaths? Well, what I'm missing, for a start. I don't believe that nearly one in a hundred people on this earth are incurably heinous, robot-hearted monsters with no souls and an aptitude on the London Stock Exchange. So is the percentage smaller, or does psychopathy actually mean something different to that? Is it possible to have all these traits and still have a meaningful life, loving relationships and friendships, and do some good in the world? I'm sure it must be; coming out of this book, I saw no indication of it. Have a bit of optimism, Jon! The world's not completely up the creek. It can't be as totally hopeless as you make it out to be. Which means - what aren't you telling me?"
236,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526809-donna,4,"Saw the interview on 'John Stewart', then ordered it like a cubic zirconia tennis bracelet from The Shopping Channel. I got a slow start with it. The Kindle app formatting is kinda shitty. stray lines. Typos. I kept asking myself whether anybody checked it out beforehand. Then again, maybe they wanted it to look that way. Once I got used to this clash of esthetics, I found it a great deal of fun. Wha? A book about psychopathy fun? He doesn't just seek out the usual suspects. He talks to Bob Hare who came up with the oft used checklist to spot it. I was worried at first, that Ronson would turn out to be one of tthose 'it all comes back to me' sorts of interviewers, but he asked many of the questions I would have liked to ask. He doesn't give the impression of being thorough, but he is. So he talked with Bob Hare, which resulted in his seeing psychopaths everywhere. He visited Al Dunlap, dismantler of Sunbeam to wonder whether he might be one. ""He pointed at a sculpture of four sharks encircling the planet. 'I believe in predators,' he said. 'Their spirit will enable you to succeed. Over there you've got falcons. Alligators. Alligators. More alligators. Tigers.' 'It's As if both Midas and also the Queen of Narnia were here,' I said, 'and the Queen of Narnia flew above a particularly fierce zoo and turned everything there to stone and then transported everything here.' 'What?' said Al. 'Nothing,' I said. 'No,' he said, 'What did you just say?' He shot me a steely, blue-eyed stare, which I found quite debilitating. ""I appreciated how he took the subject out of prison where we, the still living prey can really relate to it. Of course,I liked this because it's really all about me. Without seeming to, he also gets into some searching questions about journalism and madness. "
237,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4636758-vanessa,4,"I really enjoyed this book. I have for a while now had an interest in psychology and mental disorders of various kinds, finding them absolutely fascinating to read about. Psychopathy (or sociopathy) was something, however, that I didn't really know much about prior to reading this book. I certainly hadn't heard of The Psychopath Test, created by Bob Hare, a Canadian criminal psychologist.In his book, Ronson shares his encounters with various people that may or may not be classified as psychopaths, from a man known only as ""Tony"" who 'fakes' madness to get out of a prison sentence, to Al Dunlap, a retired corporate executive with a tendency to see factors on the Psychopath Test as positive in the eyes of business. All is told from the humorous and objective viewpoint of Ronson, whilst over-analysing his own motivations in true anxiety-related style.Ronson reminded me a lot of myself at points in this book, and I really enjoyed the way he structured his book and the interviews he conducted. I will definitely be seeking out more of his work, and if you have any interest in the topic of psychopathy, or are a fan of gonzo-style journalism, then I would highly recommend this."
238,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3659939-bree,4,"Really, really enjoyed this. First of all, I listened to the audiobook and Jon Ronson's voice reminds me of Neil Gaiman's, so already it's a win. It's fascinating to consider how psychopathy is diagnosed and what that diagnosis means. Most human beings display some psychopathic traits from time to time, but how do you determine when someone displays enough to be considered a danger to society? Jon Ronson's writing is humorous, fun, and completely engaging. At times the structure of the book felt a little disjointed, but I appreciated how it all came together at the end. Because much of the book consists of interviews with various psychiatrists and psychopaths (and maybe-psychopaths), the reader is able to come to their own conclusions rather than relying on the author to tell you what to think. "
239,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,4,"This is the sort of book that I tend to enjoy – a journalist tells amusing stories about his investigations into a particular topic – but which readers with a more focused interest in the purported subject may find frustrating. Ronson portrays himself as a cheerfully unmethodical explorer of the world of craziness, meeting with experts, prisoners, and potentially psychotic retired executives and presenting their stories and his responses in a lively, vivid style. Some of the stories involved, almost necessarily, are rather horrible, but he keeps the gruesome stuff to a minimum and finds the absurd humor in situations where you might not expect to find it. As engaging and entertaining a book on psychopaths as you are likely to find, and I particularly enjoyed the way he concluded his story. Four and a half stars."
240,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,4,"Ok, first of all, I have to admit I have a soft spot in my heart for the pop-psy. That being said, I really enjoyed this well-rounded take on psychopathy; from the use of labels to the tests to determine if a person is one. He did not take a position and try to convince us, except as a story technique, but that was also done as a full circle. Very good writing for what it is. I loved the same style turned on scientologists and their crusade against psychiatry, the psychopharmacology industry, and the creators of the DSM III through IV (although I would have loved him to take on V as well).He's the same writer of The Men Who Stare At Goats, which I thought was a very funny movie, and I'll have to read that book now. I've become a fan of the author. :)"

“Suddenly, madness was everywhere, and I was determined to learn about the impact it had on the way society evolves. I've always believed society to be a fundamentally rational thing, but what if it isn't? What if it is built on insanity?”

 The book was engaging, I enjoyed reading it, however I couldn't help being a little disappointed. While Ronson makes a few good points and raises some good questions, I was hoping the book would go deeper into the world of psychopaths, instead it was mainly focused on his journey of researching the topic. However, I can't hold this too hard against the book as Jon Ronson is an investigative journalist, not a mental health care specialist."
242,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7022024-mike,4,"For a book about psychopaths this was a surprisingly light(ish, come on, we're still talking about psychopaths here) read. The author is a journalist and it covers a wide range of the topic from interviewing a few (suspected) psychopaths, to speaking with psychiatrists who are involved in psychopathy and the classification there of, to scientologists, to neurologists who examined the brains of normal people and psychopaths. It is a fast read of a book that I think does a good job being honest and truth seeking.The psychopath test in this book, called Hare Psychopathy Checklist presents a set of characteristics a person can be graded on. Score too high and you just might be a psychopath. Once the author had learned of this test and taken a seminar about it he started to see it both in his own behavior and others, annotating his interactions with others with various qualities on the test. Instead of narrowly focusing on just psychopaths (and mostly avoiding the lurid details of the more famous/horrifying ones) Ronson presents the reader with a broad, if shallow, survey of the field. He also does an excellent job of linking together different parts of the history of psychology and how those events impact the modern world (such as the explosion of psychological disorder classifications, the massive expansion of pharmaceuticals to ""treat"" these conditions, and how the entertainment industry, especially reality TV, benefits from just the right amount of madness). I found his writing style very accessible and the presentation of the interviews and facts well conveyed without becoming too dry or boring.The animating force behind the book was a weird event where a bunch of scientists from all over the world get a strange, cryptic book. They banded to together over the internet to try and figure it out but were flummoxed. One of the scientists in question contacted Ronson to help and he eventually tracked down the person he thought was responsible. Turns out it likely wasn't some genius mystery maker but likely a slightly off kilter Swede. But Ronson was intrigued by how much this solitary person caused the world to change and wondered how much of the state of the world was due to psychopaths. While he doesn't answer the question (many others, including folks he interviewed, have delved into this) he does write about how psychopathy did appear to be more prevalent in business circles. Given how much havoc financial decisions can make (shutting down manufacturing plants, crashing the economy, putting profits before people, etc.). All in all a fast and interesting read, but not one for people looking for a deeper understanding of psychopathy. I devoured it in the course of an intercontinental (unless you are one of those people who think the Americas are just one continent) and was found the experience both entertaining and enlightening."
243,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76697789-ryan-krueger,5,"** The Psychopath Test by Jon Robson is an informative non-fiction book. The book was written with intent to inform readers about the abundance of psychopaths in our world and how they impact our daily lives. The author is a journalist who has traveled the world to meet with professors, scientists, psychologists and more to find information on this subject to create a strong basis for the book. Ronson makes plenty of flights around the globe to meet with researchers as well as psychopaths themselves. His main point in this is to display how psychopaths are common in our lives whether it be the workplace or interacting with someone who seems in an everyday environment. The work discusses psychopaths lack of emotions such as fear or remorse and how that can lead some people to be at the top of the business chain. Due to them not having remorse they can be willing to fire half of their staff in one day with no regards to how it may affect their lives, while the boss’s mind is only focused on financial gains. A quote in the book goes, “Serial killers ruin families, corporate and political and religious psychopaths ruin economies. They ruin societies.”This is a very interesting book in my opinion as I have always had an interest in the wiring of people’s brains. The details included and quoted from psychopaths that he interviewed were intriguing as they would say stuff along the lines of them wanting to kill to see what blood looks like or what the insides of someone else looks like. The book raises issues on how psychopaths can ruin families, societies, and economies. It covers a wide range of topics and goes into detail on each area including how psychopaths can affect these issues. I agree with everything in this book except that the words psychopath and sociopath can be used interchangeably. After looking into this I’ve found various sources as well as teachers who stated that psychopaths are born the way they are and it’s genetics, while sociopaths are born through traumatic experiences and have capabilities of feeling remorse as well as developing relationships or bonds with others. This book answered a lot of questions I have had. There are two people in my life who I always wondered why they act the way they do but I realized that they are most likely a psychopath. However, it made me realize how easy it can be to target someone as a psychopath due to the bob hare psychopath test and how normal actions can be misinterpreted into a biased stance. As someone who has an interest in helping soldiers suffering from PTSD this relates to my personal agenda due to me having the possibility of preventing someone from becoming a sociopath. "

245,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6296289-tyler-j-gray,4,Very thought-provoking and well worth a read!
246,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,4,"While Jon Ronson reveals a great deal about his own neuroses in this book, he casts little light on the psychopaths he is allegedly researching, though he does give some interesting insights into the ""madness industry"" of psychologists who have studied, categorized, labeled, and tried to treat psychopaths, mostly without success.Ronson begins with a strange introduction to the field of psychology and mental illness thanks to a group of Scientologists, who chose him to ""expose"" the evils of psychology. Scientologists believe that all mental disorders are because of engrams accumulated from past lives or space aliens or some shit like that. L. Ron Hubbard had a particular hatred of psychologists. Ronson spends a little time discussing the peculiarities of Scientology, but this book is primarily about psychopaths and what makes them tick... and what makes the people who study them tick.After reading The Psychopath Test, it is not hard to believe that you have to be a little bit crazy to study crazy people. (Look out for those Abnormal Psychology majors...) From the arbitrariness of what goes into the DSM (did you know that far more copies are sold to interested non-academics/non-practitioners than to mental health professionals?) to the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, a diagnostic tool that's become a quick and dirty way to label someone a psychopath, to the Rosenhan Experiment, the history of psychology is filled with enough self-reinforcing bumbling and egomania to make one think the Scientologists may have a point.While Ronson's book is a collection of interesting anecdotes and observations, digressing into the overmedication of children, misdiagnoses of autism, and the brutality of capitalist devotion to ""shareholder value,"" between interviews with ex-death squad leaders and allegedly psychopathic CEO Al Dunlap, it's a bit weak in its critique of science, and sheds little light on his subjects.Martha Stout's book The Sociopath Next Door was more illuminating. Ronson does, however, give a bit of a glimpse into the mind of a sociopath in a way that Stout only addressed abstractly: how do sociopaths/psychopaths (there is no technical difference between them) see themselves? Do they recognize that they are ""broken""? Do they ever want to be cured, and can they be? (Short answer: no.)Ronson's interview with Al Dunlap was particularly interesting, as he actually confronted Dunlap with the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, and the allegations that Dunlap, according to this tool, scored high on the psychopathy scale. Dunlap proceeded to point out that every behavior presented as evidence of being a psychopath could also be interpreted as someone who has a forceful and driven personality who gets things done. True enough, there is a lot of evidence that psychopathy is an asset in positions of power, like boardrooms.Ronson is able to see how some of his subjects ape normal human reactions and manipulate people the way they'd handle a TV remote control, but others, like Al Dunlap, are more ambiguous. Is Dunlap really a psychopath, or just a merciless asshole? As both Stout and Ronson point out, even genuine psychopaths are rarely serial killers; most live law-abiding, respectable lives, though never out of any actual respect for the law or society.An interesting if somewhat meandering trip into the perilous world of diagnosing psychopaths, The Psychopath Test is not exactly a weighty, heavily-researched book, but it will be of interest to anyone who has an, ahem, clinical interest in psychopaths."
247,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14084605-pink,4,"A real thought provoker. What is a psychopath? Are you a psychopath? How about your friends or co-workers? This book will leave you diagnosing everyone you know and becoming all powerful with your new amazing psychopath detection skills, just like Jon Ronson. The book really made me think about how mental illness is defined. Sure there are clear cut cases of insanity and sanity, but there's a huge area in the middle, with a range of diagnoses that are possible to be made and indeed are being sweepingly made and medicated for across the world. Quite apart from the issues of psychopath detection and detention, there were some interesting stories. A wide range of people were interviewed for his research and I was fascinated by several of their lives, whether they were the professionals, or the patients. This was my first Jon Ronson book and I haven't read any of his journalistic material so his style of writing is all new to me. I appreciated the humour and details about himself that were included, which broke up some pretty heavy content at times. I also liked how the book came full circle and re-visited the people at the beginning of his journey, which gave closure to their own stories. Much recommended and I can't wait to read more of his books now! "

249,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4529669-willow,4,"Jon Ronson is a hoot. It would be great to have lunch with him. He puts so much of himself into his writing, bringing up his own little insecurities and observations, pretty much showing that he’ll be happy to go anywhere or do anything provided there’s a good story. This book is all over the place following Jon around and he brings up different case studies after another. In fact, I’m not sure they had that much in common with each other except that Jon decided they were worth investigating. This ‘all over the place’ is the book’s weakness and the reason I knocked a star. You see, I’m not sure Jon really proved his point. That doesn’t mean it wasn’t informative and entertaining. I definitely learned a lot about the psychopath test, which is here by the way: http://thinkcreatedesign.wordpress.co...Some of the provocative ideas this book brings up is that psychopaths may actually have a brain abnormality that has to do with their amygdale. They don’t feel the full range of emotions like most people. This makes them fearless, lacking in empathy and they gravitate toward positions of power because they are missing regular emotional stimulation. There could be one psychopath in every hundred people. Jon even jokes that he started seeing psychopaths everywhere once he acquired his new psychopath spotting skills. Obviously he’s not the only one with psychopath spotting skills. One of the reviews on GR even suggested that pretty much everybody in the GOP is a psychopath, posting pictures. Judging by the seriousness of her review, and the lack of seriousness in Jon’s book, I can’t help but think that she ignored the last quarter of the book. That’s because by the end, Jon is rethinking what he’s learned about psychopaths and the psychopath test, suggesting that nothing is cut and dried, and scoring high on a test shouldn’t get you locked away forever. He takes a look at criminal profilers and some of their serious blunders (something crime shows rarely show on TV). If the police are convinced you are the culprit, or a doctor wants to slap a diagnosis on you, they will find a way, because that’s what they want to find. Both the media, the pharmaceutical companies, and the public want to promote mental illness for different reasons. Categorizing is something humans love to do. We look for order in a chaotic world. It’s comforting. And sometimes when people are trying to fit someone in a personality box, we ignore all the things that make them not fit there. Psychology is not an exact science I’ve read that The Society for the Scientific Study of Psychopathy (SSSP) published a statement regarding this book stating that certain interviews in it were exaggerated or fictionalised and that they ""think that Ronson’s book trivializes a serious personality disorder and its measurement, which is not helpful to those who have the disorder or to their unfortunate victims"".This statement made me laugh, because I don’t think this book was ever meant to be a deep serious study of psychopaths. It’s more about Jon investigating them, and coming up with different conclusions. He’s a thoughtful writer and I enjoyed reading his observations. I think this book raises more questions than it answers. I love that. "
250,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1016626-tim-pendry,3,"This book is being promoted as 'comic'. Sadly, it is not. It is quite a sad read. I laughed once out loud and smiled twice but only in the first chapter. If you end this book laughing, you have not ‘got it’. You should leave it a little angry and troubled.Ronson exhibits all the graces and the flaws of modern British journalism. It is an easy read. The man is self-questioning (though clearly not too deeply lest he cease to function) and he is honest. But he is also skimming the surface of issues that require a far tougher and better book than this.Perhaps he is being cleverer than I think. Perhaps his periodic questioning of the way his profession turns reality into narratives, into modern folk tales, will create a suspicion in the public's mind about how it receives information, how its mental world is structured. I think not.The book is about the phenomenon of the psychopath which operates at so many levels as part of our cultural self-definition. As a species, we tend to need a scapegoat for structural ills that derive from our own nature - so, why not the 'psychopath' in our culture.Perhaps 1% of the population is 'psychopathic' in the sense of presenting a reasonable danger to others under certain conditions. Perhaps another 5% have traits that could be dangerous under yet other more extreme conditions. I suspect 88% are just a danger to themselves as ‘normals’.Political fear (I speak as a radical empath who is in the 'other' 6%, potentially equally dangerous to society for completely different reasons) seems to be determining that media headlines must ensure that 'psychopaths' are defined for incarceration by their nature rather than by their deeds.Yet, as Charlie Chaplin’s M. Verdoux so eloquently put it in the film of that name, it is not the single psychopath whose default mode is tolerance for enormous crimes against humanity but the vast ‘normal’ mass who vote, work and play without much of a thought in their little minds.Ronson opens the door to such subversive thinking but he only peeks in. The psychopath in Broadmoor is judged fit for release and we know it is a gamble. The corporate boss targeted as a psychopath turns out to be depressingly conventional in his private life. So far, so ‘normal’.But Scientologists prove to be champions of human rights and psychiatrists appear to be at forefront of new sociologies of population control, aided by pharmaceuticals interests who turn any mild abnormality from a genetic variant of possible evolutionary value into a diagnosed disease.Some of the most ethically filthy conduct in the book, leading to suicide and death in their victims, come from ‘normals’, the same sort of ‘normal’ who obeys an order in a war or who thinks corporate career progression is a substitute for personal responsibility.The book deserves better than its jokey style. Perhaps the jokey style will build more understanding amongst the general population and that is its justification. Unfortunately, it will probably just flow off most ‘normal’s backs like that of the proverbial duck.So let us try the analysis here that Ronson seems nervous of attempting – that hoary old business, no doubt, in his case, of just being a reporter, just telling a story.First, as he rightly points out, there really are very dangerous persons which we have termed psychopaths but which are simply at one genetic and personality end of our human Bell Curve. They are not monsters, they are human. They are simply accentuations of aspects of our normal selves.Society needs protection but it also needs to recognize, in different ecological circumstances, that they may be more important to us than ourselves in the future of our own species. We have to hope we hang on to civilization long enough to ensure that they are never needed.Second, these dangerous ones are there but they are rare. We cannot build our entire social structure around protecting ourselves from what amounts to a force of nature any more than we should be degenerating as a free and questioning culture because of a few terrorists.Faced with nature, sometimes bad things happen. They will continue to happen. ‘The bomber will always get through’. This is what we are as humans. It is dreadful for the victim but these cases are still rare and we should concentrate on a society that polices itself and is not policed.What is happening is that the existence of the genuine psychopath and the genuine terrorist is being used by the authoritarian bureaucrat to introduce ever-increasing controls on our movement, conduct and language (aspirationally, on our minds) in an attempt to manage the unmanageable.Without the ‘noble lie’ of a religion, with no Pope to serve Constantine, the bureaucrats are turning to definitional analysis and what they like to call science but which is no more scientific than was Lysenko under Stalin. If this book does one service, it is to cast doubt on the more radical scientific credentials of psychology.Over the last two decades, the psychologists and social scientists have found themselves riding on a lucrative gravy train medicalising ‘misbehaviour’ and unhappiness and offering cures based on chemicals and incarceration. The sick are becoming overwhelmed by the worried and the inconvenient.These new priests of the mind are now busy perpetrating the lie of there being no free will (a spurious philosophical conclusion from consciousness studies by people who could usefully spend some time reading the great existentialists) and the even worse lie of a beneficent normality.It was men in white coats who murdered the physically abnormal in euthanasia programmes under national-socialism. It is now men in white coats who are engaged in soul murder against the mentally different. There are throw-away stories in the book of how gays and feminists could lobby successfully to ensure that certain psychological definitions were abandoned. Either science is science or it is not. Scientific decision-making in physics would not allow the peer review to include a lobbyist.‘Conditions’ that have no politically powerful lobbies against them also have many commercial and family interests seeking their establishment. But we have to keep our feet on the ground. If social science and psychology are socio-political tools, there are still things to be cured or managed.There are people seriously suffering pain (yet the system still refuses to let psychiatrists test low dosage levels of psychedelics for depression and trauma). There is certainly work to be done on re-engineering society for relief from anxiety and self empowerment.What is grossly unacceptable is to allow social or family order requirements to permit collusion between drug companies, a morally degenerate professional class and the state or parents in the use of drugs for social control of behaviours that are merely inconvenient or embarrassing.We live in monstrous times. This book, to its credit, opens the door on the monsters – psychopathic and professional alike. We have a choice to go through the door and see what our society has become or shut it and pretend it is not happening. So, my regret about this well-written, entertaining and thought-provoking book is that Ronson limits himself to anecdotes and questions. ‘Normals’ will pick this up, be entertained and go back to being ‘normal’ again. ‘Normal’ people are the shills for the men in white coats and grey suits. What we really need now are writers who show people that just being ‘normal’ (and certainly being ‘normalised’) is damned dangerous to them and to their kids’ future and that ‘normal’ now means little more than manageable and controllable. Ronson merely skims the surface of this story."
251,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara,5,"I couldn't imagine that a book about psychopaths would be so good! Ronson interviews lots of people including people in institutions for the criminally insane, Scientologists, psychiatrists and conspiracy theorists. Ronson also has a very engaging narrating style. We all encounter psychopaths, and sometimes it takes time for us to realize the person has a personality disorder. They may be work colleagues, neighbors, and other people we interact with. It has helped me at times to realize that someone's behavior fits the parameters of psychopathy. Of course, Ronson also explores cases where individuals have been institutionalized for years or even a lifetime without adequate evidence that they continue to be a threat to others. I recommend this to anyone interested in the topic of psychopathic behavior but don't want a technical treatment for the subject."
252,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"Entertaining and a surprisingly breezy read, The Psychopath Test is a somewhat rambling and ultimately non-conclusive record of an investigative journey into the mental health industry, conspiracy theories and scientology. The author meets some very interesting people -- about whom you can form your own conclusions: I was never exactly happy about Bob Hare.I enjoyed reading it, but oddly I'm not sure I can recommend it. Looking back at it, there's not much substance, and isn't as hilariously funny as the blurb and reviews on the back would have you believe -- then again, I don't think it was a waste of time either."

In addition to defining and describing the traits of psychopathy, the author raises some questions regarding the sanity of the industry of psychiatry .Overall it was informative, funny and sometimes disturbing; reading about the brutal murders was not my favorite part but if you are looking for ways to spot a psychopath then this book is the one.

I'd actually like to read more of Jon Ronson's work."
255,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,4,"4.5 starsJon Ronson is one of those writers - like David Sedaris - whose voice you hear as you read his words; the soft, slightly effete, often uncertain lilt of his sounding in the reader's inner ear. This is one of the things that makes him such an engaging writer, along with his style of placing himself (and his neuroses, which are particularly apposite in this context) directly in view, a method which rather than obscuring his subjects illuminates them, by giving us such an upfront view. The very subjectivity of Ronson's journalistic style allows us to see the complexity of the tale with clarity.In this book Ronson stitches together, as usual, stories that illuminate a single theme - initially tied loosely but bound tighter and tighter as the book progresses. The chapters each involve a way in which we view madness, starting with his own rather off-hand description of an interviewee as a ""psychopath"" and his involvement in an entirely unrelated mystery (which is ultimately used to bookend the volume) which then spirals off from his increasing fascination with the diagnosis of mental disorders following delving into the DSM-IV (and subsequent self diagnosis of a dozen disorders). We meet a patient at Broadmoor high security psychiatric hospital, committed following an insanity plea when on trial for GBH and a subsequent diagnosis as a psychopath, a history of that disorder and its diagnosis and treatment, and then on to a gallery of cases involving both people Ronson has interviewed (psychologists, psychiatrists, a former Haitian paramilitary leader, a corporate CEO famous for his glee in downsizing for fun and profit, former MI5 agent David Shayler) and others whose lives have been changed by direct or indirect contact either those who may have psychiatric disorders or with the madness industry tat has grown around them.The connecting thread is this; that over recent decades we have become increasingly fond of defining behaviours that lay on the spectrum of human personality as 'disorders', using methods which may or may not be scientific and may or may not be accurate. There is plenty of questioning of those methods in this book, but the criticism is largely leveled at those people and organisations that are too ready to use these blunt tools for their own ends - whether it is the pharmaceutical industry and their ever increasing push to medicate human difference or the Metropolitan Police entrapping a neat suspect in a murder case despite a complete lack of evidence, while possibly allowing the actual killer the freedom to kill again.Ronson is sometimes described as a humorist (as does Will Self in his Guardian review quoted on the blurb) but I think this is entirely misleading. Ronson is and always has been a journalist, albeit one who uses his wit and humour to allow us insights to the things about which he writes, a technique which is also effective when he drops it to highlight the sad or horrific - the town of Shubuta, Mississippi, devastated when the local toaster factory was closed to increase the manufacturing company's share price, the murders committed by actual violent psychopaths, the deaths and harm caused by the 'reality' TV industry when they have focused on a distorted view of what is not 'normal'. And, unlike much journalism, this does not attempt to give definite answers; the threads Ronson has drawn together are tied neatly enough to make sense but with enough frayed, trailing lines to leave the reader pondering long after closing the book."
256,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,4,"So Jon Ronson, the man who brought the theory that the world is run by extraterrestrial lizard people to the world's attention, turns his worried gaze to psychopaths. He wrote something like a deeply ambivalent travelogue of his time writing this book. We meet death squad leaders and CEOs who love firing people. We meet a man wrongly picked by a criminal profiler as a brutal killer and we meet Scientologists. We meet the man who helped get homosexuality out of the DSM as a psychiatric condition and we meet a guy who tried nude LSD-assisted psychotherapy for criminal psychopaths. We meet a man who believes no one blew themselves up in subway cars in London one July day and we meet a woman on one of those subway cars. And what do we learn? I’m not sure. That psychiatry started using check lists to standardize diagnoses and the pharmacologization of psychiatry followed, yes. That now in three days, you too can diagnose psychopaths with a handy dandy 40 question check list, yes. But those are headlines, not books. That psychopaths are both like, and unlike, extraterrestrial lizard people, maybe. I quite enjoyed this book. I’m struggling to find something useful to say about it. As foreshadowed above, ambivalent travelogue is the best I’ve come up with. I thought at first the thesis was that psychopaths are everywhere, disproportionately in positions of power, and how they use that power destroys the world. Bob Hare, the man who developed the psychopath test itself, told Ronson he regretted doing so much of his work in prisons instead of on the stock exchange. When Ronson protested that serial killers were worse than psychopathic stock brokers, Hare said:‘“Serial killers ruin families.’ Bob shrugged. ‘Corporate and political and religious psychopaths ruin economies. They ruin societies.’	“This – Bob was saying – was the straightforward solution to the greatest mystery of all: why is the world so unfair? Why all that savage economic injustice, those brutal wars, the everyday corporate cruelty? The answer: psychopaths. The part of the brain that doesn’t function right. . . . . We aren’t all good people just trying to do good. Some of us are psychopaths. And psychopaths are to blame for this brutal, misshapen society. They’re the jagged rocks thrown into the still pond.” (112)And that moved me deeply. But Ronson doesn’t develop that thesis. Instead, he travelogues his earnest conversations with marginal nutball after marginal nutball, takes a brief foray into how the modern psychiatric profession became what it is today, then returns us to a secure psychiatric facility to watch a man committed for years after faking madness be released. Maybe there’s nothing more to be said on that. The idea that psychopaths drive the action on the world stage may be just too depressing to stare at for too long, even if you do have a BBC film crew with you. It was a good book. Well worth reading. I have the nagging feeling there was a better one inchoate in the source material, but I’m dead certain Ronson did better than I would have writing it. "
257,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3397530-lea,4,"I am a huuuuuge Jon Ronson fan, so it's no surprise that I enjoyed this book too. The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry lives up to its title -- Ronson really does take the reader on a journey through the ""madness industry"". The book opens with a bit of a mystery concerning an unusual book that was mailed to various academics throughout the world. At first it doesn't seem to fit the theme of the book, but Ronson ties it in eventually. His typical style is to jump around between subjects, finding common themes, and this book is no different -- we meet an incarcerated psychopath (who may not, in fact, be a psychopath at all), learn about the methods of diagnosing psychopathy, investigate current psychological diagnoses (especially those in children), and see another possible psychopath's positive spin on those ""negative"" traits. The book also looks at Scientology's war on psychiatry, the experimental psychiatric treatments of the 1970s, and criminal profiling. The author covers a lot of ground here, but it's a very fast read. There are several parts that are unsettling -- some crime descriptions, the kafka-esque plight of those stuck in a psychiatric catch-22, a child's accidental overdose of psychiatric medication -- although that could be more indicative of my sensitivity than anythng else.As usual, Ronson explores his own feelings and anxieties as well. Some readers may find this annoying, although his fans most likely won't -- I enjoy those parts of his books!All in all, I really enjoyed this book, and I would recommend it, especially if you've read and liked his previous books."
258,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948275-josh,3,"Let me begin by saying that the title is deceiving. While it does go into the subject of psychopaths and eventually ends with it, there are many points at which I felt like Ronson's main objective was the critique the overall approach to mental disorders that this country (and other researchers from other countries around the world) have taken over the years. We've gotten ourselves into the habit of classifying every little oddity in our personalities as something strange and unwanted, rather than looking at people as individuals with individualistic tendencies -- and this is especially true when it comes to differences of the mind and its inner workings. So, the fact that I was reading this book as a way into psychopaths and psychopaths alone left me with a unsavory taste once I started to realize that there was much more going on here that I wasn't prepared for. Which isn't to say that I disliked any of what was in the book. There are some very interesting (and entertaining) takes on issues such as Scientology, childhood psychiatry, and even conspiracy theorists. However, that's not what the title of the book leads you to believe the book is about. And I call that false advertisement. And no matter how entertaining this book ended up being (and it was -- Ronson tells a story here, with a plot and everything, rather than reporting like a journalist), no matter how drawn in I was into the story he created, the fact still remains that I don't feel like I learned nearly enough about psychopaths as I should have from a book titled, ""The Psychopath Test."""

Listened to the audiobook read by the author himself, and was hooked after only a few minutes; then when Ronson started talking about Douglas Hofstadter and Scientologists I had to think ""I am so lucky to be listening to this book!"" I learned about how the original DSM was created - how arbitrary all those diagnoses are - and that's (can I say:) depressing. I should write a thoughtful review but I am pressed for time, so I will quote Laura Miller at Salon: [Ronson is] not afraid to play the feckless neurotic for laughs, but that doesn't obscure the serious questions raise by his investigations. Psychiatric diagnoses (and, these days, the medications that follow) really can become fads, with certain experts suddenly deciding that multiple personality disorder or childhood bipolar disorder are far more common that ever before suspected. Ronson even finds the occasion for a little professional soul-searching; he accuses himself and other journalists of being the Goldilocks of craziness, seeking out people to write about who are just nuts enough to be colorful but not so disturbed that they're downright sad."
261,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4845040-gregory,5,"Mr. Ronson puts forth ideas, scenarios, and real life observations in a easily read format. He writes so fluently that reading this book is like breathing. I just started it yesternight and about a 1/3 of the way through, he also highlights certain aspects of the study of the mind in relation to its historcal perspective(s).Although the subject/topics are a bit challenging, if you think you may be interested in this book, It is well worth your time. Also, I think his paradigm exposes/shows us concepts perhaps that may have permeated some of our current and past leaders in all walks of life. Something to consider and think about.My hats off to Mr. Ronson, Great job.This is an excellent book and it is excellently written. I believe I will read it again very soon just to see what I missed: even dispite the topic difficulty.It really gives you a great deal to think about, and seems related to Brightsided, in terms of some modern moras."
262,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/326263-patrick,4,"I blame Ronson for turning me on to mega-nut David Icke and his endlessly entertaining Lizard people conspiracy theory in ""Them: Adventures with Extremists.""In this one he's asked to investigate an elaborate and weird hoax involving a book called ""Being or Nothingness,"" by Joe K. - which takes him to Indiana and Douglas Hofstadter (""Godel, Escher, Bach"").That in turn sets him off on psychopaths, the Hare Psychopathy Checklist. Lots of oddballs emerge.Ronson's got a funny style, and apparently a real knack for tracking down the world's screwballs. Very interesting and enjoyable.Also uncomfortable at times, especially when the reader starts considering the psychopath checklist in terms of himself or his friends."
263,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina,2,"This is actually a 1.5 stars book. Meh. The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson has absolutely nothing of interest to say. It's been on my ""to read"" shelf for a while so when I impulsively bought it one day while sitting bored in a doctor's office, I couldn't remember why I had wanted to read it, just that I did. Why can't I learn my lesson about impulsive book-buying? It rarely turns out well. Ronson starts the book by recounting the Mystery of the Mysterious Book. An expensively produced, attractive hard bound book was sent to various academics around the world and none of them can figure out why they received the book or what its purpose is. The sender is unknown, but the books were sent from Sweden. Ronson is recruited to solve the mystery. Along the way, he gets interested in the idea of mental illness and psychopaths and also begins pursing the idea of what it means to be diagnosed as a psychopath and how they are diagnosed. Ronson interviews various psychologists in the field, including Robert Hare, creator of the PCL-R (the Hare Checklist for psychopathology). Ronson also talks with people who doubt the accuracy of the PCL-R (Scientologists...ha ha ha ha), discusses his own neuroses and anxieties, muses on the tendency of psychologists these days to over-analyze, abuses the exclamation mark and makes a lot of lame jokes. This is an idiotic book. I would not recommend it to anyone who is interested in psychopathology and either has a good layperson's understanding of psychopathology or is a professional in the field of psychology (unless that person wants a good laugh). Some of the books Ronson lists as research sources I've already read (plus Harvey Cleckley's Mask of Sanity which Ronson mentions but didn't read) so I already knew more about psychopathology than the author; this revelation did not make me happy. When Ronson begins to explore the subject, he has only the vaguest (Hollywood-influenced) idea of psychopaths and who does he turn to first? Why, Scientologists of course. I mean, if I wanted an understanding of any topic in the field of psychology, I would automatically turn to a group of nutbars who believe in aliens but think psychology is nonsense. A group within Scientologists called the CCHR (Citizens Commission on Human Rights) have made it their mission to ""prove to the world that psychiatrists are wicked and must be stopped"" (28). Ronson is impressed by their record of exposing some very bad psychiatrists...well, yes, they did expose some bad ones, but the examples that Ronson provides (provided to him by the CCHR) are fairly obvious quacks (or mentally ill individuals) who were in the field for reasons other than to honestly practice the profession. Eventually Ronson decides that talking to actual psychologists instead of Scientologists is a good idea. I got fairly disgusted early on when a Scientologist took him to Broadmoor (insane asylum in England) to meet a psychopath (Tony) who isn't really a psychopath--he just pretended to be one so he could avoid prison. Once in Broadmoor, surprise surprise, Tony is diagnosed as a psychopath. Ronson listens to Tony's story of woe without (seemingly) a critical thought in his head. Because at this point Ronson still hasn't done any research about psychopaths, he is completely taken in by Tony's story and believes he is wrongly incarcerated. It's not until later when he talks with Tony's doctor does he have a more informed view of Tony and why he is at Broadmoor. This whole book irritates me because I can't decide if Ronson is really such an idiot or if he possesses some sly sense of humor I can't perceive. When Ronson finally gets to Robert Hare and his pathology checklist, I'm again annoyed. He walks around with the checklist and interviews people whose behavior suggests psychopathology (most notable: Al Dunlap, former CEO--and destroyer--of the Sunbeam Corporation and Emmanuel ""Toto"" Constant, leader of the paramilitary group FRAPH in Haiti). Ronson mentally checks off each psychopath characteristic (Item 6: Lack of Remorse or Guilt, Item 7: Shallow Affect) he thinks they display as he interviews them. With Dunlap, Ronson goes straight through the list and directly asks him about each item. Ronson describes himself as feeling powerful because he has this secret knowledge and can identify psychopaths. What Ronson (willfully?) forgets (ignores?) is that it's not enough to say, yeah, this person seems to not have empathy or sympathy, but an interviewee also has to determine to what degree this person doesn't have sympathy. Maybe some things do bother him and others don't. I understand that at least one of Ronson's objectives of the book is to say, hey, it's way too easy to diagnose someone with a mental illness by going through a list. Well, yeah. This is not a revelation. The fact that Ronson thinks this state of affairs within the psychology/psychiatry field is shocking is, in itself, shocking. What field doesn't have its instances of abuse and misuse? He has a chapter discussing how children are diagnosed with bipolar disorders and then prescribed drugs to treat this (as many psychologists think) imaginary children's condition. It's apparently the latest fad. Parents with kids who are moody or restless or high-energy and don't have the time to deal with them get their children diagnosed with something (for a while ADHD was huge; maybe it still is) and doped up. Parents aren't necessarily to blame; there are the professionals who misdiagnose and the pharmaceutical industry eager to make money any way it can. Many factors create and exacerbate the abuse of Hare's PCL-R and the way anyone is misdiagnosed and over-medicated. The Psychopath Test is generally a mess of a book. There's no clear thesis/objective for the book. What exactly is Ronson investigating? What is he trying to prove? His discussion of the PCL-R is thrown off track by the chapter detailing how the DSM is created (a rather haphazard and unscientific process if Ronson's information is correct) and the misdiagnosis of children. If Ronson wanted to explore the abuses of psychology and psychiatry (combined with the shady connection between psychiatrists and the pharmaceutical industry), then why didn't he do that? This book is merely a glib commentary on several topics combined with the author's (non-humorous) observations of his own anxieties and neuroses. Although I did not like how he approached the topic nor how he wrote it, I am still interested in reading (if not buying) Ronson's other books. It's clear that Ronson was out of his depth with this subject. "
264,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22440207-agn,4,"WHAT IS IT ABOUT?In his book “The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry,” a bestselling journalist Jon Ronson, propelled by a mysterious hoax played on the world’s leading scientists, dives into the world of madness to explore just how mad we really are. During his two-year journey, Ronson not only interviews a bunch of madmen as well as several influential psychologists, psychiatrists and anti-psychiatric Scientologists but also practices his newly gained skill of using Hare Psychopathy Checklist to spot psychopaths. Unexpectedly and quite disturbingly, the author discovers the society’s drive for the ‘right amount’ of insanity, and often detrimental tendency to define individuals by their maddest edges.THUMBS UP:1) Intriguing introduction.The first chapter of “The Psychopath Test” is THE BEST (mysterious, suspenseful and utterly captivating) introductory chapter I have ever read in a non-fiction book. The opening story is so bizarre it can be easily turned into a book itself.2) Well researched, skillfully written.Ronson’s style is quite humorous and engaging, making his non-fiction very readable and not in the least dry. Also, the author put quite some time and effort into researching and interviewing, which allowed him to explore the madness industry from multiple perspectives, which in turn enables the readers to form their own opinions on the matter. COULD BE BETTER:1) Not what I expected.I guess it’s not really the author’s fault, but I was expecting this book to be more about psychopaths and less about everything else. Instead, at least half of the book has little to do with psychopathy as the author probes multiple issues related to general insanity. It works this way as well, but I was hoping for an in-depth exploration of the psychopath’s mind and thus was a tiny bit disappointed.2) Fragmented and seemingly directionless.While I was reading “The Psychopath Test,” I felt rather confused as if the story has been patched together from several seemingly unrelated parts: at first the book seemed like a really engaging mystery, then it became psychopath-oriented, but soon enough the chapters became quite independent, loosely connected by the general madness theme. Honestly, up until the final chapters I wasn’t sure where the story was going. Although at the very end the author’s intentions became more or less clear, Ronson could have done a better job guiding the reader throughout the whole book.VERDICT: 4 out of 5Although “The Psychopath Test” might seem a little fragmented and directionless, it is nonetheless a very entertaining non-fiction that carries an important message."
265,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7232207-fiona,3,"I had a run-in with a psychopath once. I definitely came out worse from that encounter.But that's the thing that I just can't get my head around: once upon a time, I met a bona fide psychopath and in hindsight it was really, really noticeable! But if, according to Jon Ronson and his sources, psychopaths make up a little less than 1% of the population, where are all the rest of them? Are one in ten Londoners psychopathic? (Apparently they head for big cities.) Are prisons disproportionately full of them? I mean, I imagine so, but even that wouldn't account for the fact that I've identifiably met considerably fewer of them than I would expect to. Where've I been? Mostly (in my adult life) legal academia, the construction industry, and musical theatre. Hardly hotbeds of the empathetic.So something is a bit off, and I think Jon Ronson also knows this: his book is not just called Psychopaths, but The Psychopath Test - it's also partly about diagnosis of mental health problems. It's really engaging, and Ronson is a great writer, but it's hardly in depth. He's got a really light touch, skipping from prison populations to business management, to the writing of DSM-III, to the potential for misdiagnosis of childhood ADHD. This is a 250-page book! I feel like the book poses more questions than it answers, mainly because there's not enough time, and Ronson has no apparent inclination, to go into anything in any depth. He's just spotted something shiny and moved on.So what do I want to know about psychopaths? Well, what I'm missing, for a start. I don't believe that nearly one in a hundred people on this earth are incurably heinous, robot-hearted monsters with no souls and an aptitude on the London Stock Exchange. So is the percentage smaller, or does psychopathy actually mean something different to that? Is it possible to have all these traits and still have a meaningful life, loving relationships and friendships, and do some good in the world? I'm sure it must be; coming out of this book, I saw no indication of it. Have a bit of optimism, Jon! The world's not completely up the creek. It can't be as totally hopeless as you make it out to be. Which means - what aren't you telling me?"
266,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526809-donna,4,"Saw the interview on 'John Stewart', then ordered it like a cubic zirconia tennis bracelet from The Shopping Channel. I got a slow start with it. The Kindle app formatting is kinda shitty. stray lines. Typos. I kept asking myself whether anybody checked it out beforehand. Then again, maybe they wanted it to look that way. Once I got used to this clash of esthetics, I found it a great deal of fun. Wha? A book about psychopathy fun? He doesn't just seek out the usual suspects. He talks to Bob Hare who came up with the oft used checklist to spot it. I was worried at first, that Ronson would turn out to be one of tthose 'it all comes back to me' sorts of interviewers, but he asked many of the questions I would have liked to ask. He doesn't give the impression of being thorough, but he is. So he talked with Bob Hare, which resulted in his seeing psychopaths everywhere. He visited Al Dunlap, dismantler of Sunbeam to wonder whether he might be one. ""He pointed at a sculpture of four sharks encircling the planet. 'I believe in predators,' he said. 'Their spirit will enable you to succeed. Over there you've got falcons. Alligators. Alligators. More alligators. Tigers.' 'It's As if both Midas and also the Queen of Narnia were here,' I said, 'and the Queen of Narnia flew above a particularly fierce zoo and turned everything there to stone and then transported everything here.' 'What?' said Al. 'Nothing,' I said. 'No,' he said, 'What did you just say?' He shot me a steely, blue-eyed stare, which I found quite debilitating. ""I appreciated how he took the subject out of prison where we, the still living prey can really relate to it. Of course,I liked this because it's really all about me. Without seeming to, he also gets into some searching questions about journalism and madness. "

I have for a while now had an interest in psychology and mental disorders of various kinds, finding them absolutely fascinating to read about. Psychopathy (or sociopathy) was something, however, that I didn't really know much about prior to reading this book. I certainly hadn't heard of The Psychopath Test, created by Bob Hare, a Canadian criminal psychologist.In his book, Ronson shares his encounters with various people that may or may not be classified as psychopaths, from a man known only as ""Tony"" who 'fakes' madness to get out of a prison sentence, to Al Dunlap, a retired corporate executive with a tendency to see factors on the Psychopath Test as positive in the eyes of business. All is told from the humorous and objective viewpoint of Ronson, whilst over-analysing his own motivations in true anxiety-related style.Ronson reminded me a lot of myself at points in this book, and I really enjoyed the way he structured his book and the interviews he conducted. I will definitely be seeking out more of his work, and if you have any interest in the topic of psychopathy, or are a fan of gonzo-style journalism, then I would highly recommend this."

First of all, I listened to the audiobook and Jon Ronson's voice reminds me of Neil Gaiman's, so already it's a win. It's fascinating to consider how psychopathy is diagnosed and what that diagnosis means. Most human beings display some psychopathic traits from time to time, but how do you determine when someone displays enough to be considered a danger to society? Jon Ronson's writing is humorous, fun, and completely engaging. At times the structure of the book felt a little disjointed, but I appreciated how it all came together at the end. Because much of the book consists of interviews with various psychiatrists and psychopaths (and maybe-psychopaths), the reader is able to come to their own conclusions rather than relying on the author to tell you what to think. "
269,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,4,"This is the sort of book that I tend to enjoy – a journalist tells amusing stories about his investigations into a particular topic – but which readers with a more focused interest in the purported subject may find frustrating. Ronson portrays himself as a cheerfully unmethodical explorer of the world of craziness, meeting with experts, prisoners, and potentially psychotic retired executives and presenting their stories and his responses in a lively, vivid style. Some of the stories involved, almost necessarily, are rather horrible, but he keeps the gruesome stuff to a minimum and finds the absurd humor in situations where you might not expect to find it. As engaging and entertaining a book on psychopaths as you are likely to find, and I particularly enjoyed the way he concluded his story. Four and a half stars."

That being said, I really enjoyed this well-rounded take on psychopathy; from the use of labels to the tests to determine if a person is one. He did not take a position and try to convince us, except as a story technique, but that was also done as a full circle. Very good writing for what it is. I loved the same style turned on scientologists and their crusade against psychiatry, the psychopharmacology industry, and the creators of the DSM III through IV (although I would have loved him to take on V as well).He's the same writer of The Men Who Stare At Goats, which I thought was a very funny movie, and I'll have to read that book now.

“Suddenly, madness was everywhere, and I was determined to learn about the impact it had on the way society evolves. I've always believed society to be a fundamentally rational thing, but what if it isn't? What if it is built on insanity?”

 The book was engaging, I enjoyed reading it, however I couldn't help being a little disappointed. While Ronson makes a few good points and raises some good questions, I was hoping the book would go deeper into the world of psychopaths, instead it was mainly focused on his journey of researching the topic. However, I can't hold this too hard against the book as Jon Ronson is an investigative journalist, not a mental health care specialist."
272,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7022024-mike,4,"For a book about psychopaths this was a surprisingly light(ish, come on, we're still talking about psychopaths here) read. The author is a journalist and it covers a wide range of the topic from interviewing a few (suspected) psychopaths, to speaking with psychiatrists who are involved in psychopathy and the classification there of, to scientologists, to neurologists who examined the brains of normal people and psychopaths. It is a fast read of a book that I think does a good job being honest and truth seeking.The psychopath test in this book, called Hare Psychopathy Checklist presents a set of characteristics a person can be graded on. Score too high and you just might be a psychopath. Once the author had learned of this test and taken a seminar about it he started to see it both in his own behavior and others, annotating his interactions with others with various qualities on the test. Instead of narrowly focusing on just psychopaths (and mostly avoiding the lurid details of the more famous/horrifying ones) Ronson presents the reader with a broad, if shallow, survey of the field. He also does an excellent job of linking together different parts of the history of psychology and how those events impact the modern world (such as the explosion of psychological disorder classifications, the massive expansion of pharmaceuticals to ""treat"" these conditions, and how the entertainment industry, especially reality TV, benefits from just the right amount of madness). I found his writing style very accessible and the presentation of the interviews and facts well conveyed without becoming too dry or boring.The animating force behind the book was a weird event where a bunch of scientists from all over the world get a strange, cryptic book. They banded to together over the internet to try and figure it out but were flummoxed. One of the scientists in question contacted Ronson to help and he eventually tracked down the person he thought was responsible. Turns out it likely wasn't some genius mystery maker but likely a slightly off kilter Swede. But Ronson was intrigued by how much this solitary person caused the world to change and wondered how much of the state of the world was due to psychopaths. While he doesn't answer the question (many others, including folks he interviewed, have delved into this) he does write about how psychopathy did appear to be more prevalent in business circles. Given how much havoc financial decisions can make (shutting down manufacturing plants, crashing the economy, putting profits before people, etc.). All in all a fast and interesting read, but not one for people looking for a deeper understanding of psychopathy. I devoured it in the course of an intercontinental (unless you are one of those people who think the Americas are just one continent) and was found the experience both entertaining and enlightening."
273,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76697789-ryan-krueger,5,"** The Psychopath Test by Jon Robson is an informative non-fiction book. The book was written with intent to inform readers about the abundance of psychopaths in our world and how they impact our daily lives. The author is a journalist who has traveled the world to meet with professors, scientists, psychologists and more to find information on this subject to create a strong basis for the book. Ronson makes plenty of flights around the globe to meet with researchers as well as psychopaths themselves. His main point in this is to display how psychopaths are common in our lives whether it be the workplace or interacting with someone who seems in an everyday environment. The work discusses psychopaths lack of emotions such as fear or remorse and how that can lead some people to be at the top of the business chain. Due to them not having remorse they can be willing to fire half of their staff in one day with no regards to how it may affect their lives, while the boss’s mind is only focused on financial gains. A quote in the book goes, “Serial killers ruin families, corporate and political and religious psychopaths ruin economies. They ruin societies.”This is a very interesting book in my opinion as I have always had an interest in the wiring of people’s brains. The details included and quoted from psychopaths that he interviewed were intriguing as they would say stuff along the lines of them wanting to kill to see what blood looks like or what the insides of someone else looks like. The book raises issues on how psychopaths can ruin families, societies, and economies. It covers a wide range of topics and goes into detail on each area including how psychopaths can affect these issues. I agree with everything in this book except that the words psychopath and sociopath can be used interchangeably. After looking into this I’ve found various sources as well as teachers who stated that psychopaths are born the way they are and it’s genetics, while sociopaths are born through traumatic experiences and have capabilities of feeling remorse as well as developing relationships or bonds with others. This book answered a lot of questions I have had. There are two people in my life who I always wondered why they act the way they do but I realized that they are most likely a psychopath. However, it made me realize how easy it can be to target someone as a psychopath due to the bob hare psychopath test and how normal actions can be misinterpreted into a biased stance. As someone who has an interest in helping soldiers suffering from PTSD this relates to my personal agenda due to me having the possibility of preventing someone from becoming a sociopath. "

276,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,4,"While Jon Ronson reveals a great deal about his own neuroses in this book, he casts little light on the psychopaths he is allegedly researching, though he does give some interesting insights into the ""madness industry"" of psychologists who have studied, categorized, labeled, and tried to treat psychopaths, mostly without success.Ronson begins with a strange introduction to the field of psychology and mental illness thanks to a group of Scientologists, who chose him to ""expose"" the evils of psychology. Scientologists believe that all mental disorders are because of engrams accumulated from past lives or space aliens or some shit like that. L. Ron Hubbard had a particular hatred of psychologists. Ronson spends a little time discussing the peculiarities of Scientology, but this book is primarily about psychopaths and what makes them tick... and what makes the people who study them tick.After reading The Psychopath Test, it is not hard to believe that you have to be a little bit crazy to study crazy people. (Look out for those Abnormal Psychology majors...) From the arbitrariness of what goes into the DSM (did you know that far more copies are sold to interested non-academics/non-practitioners than to mental health professionals?) to the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, a diagnostic tool that's become a quick and dirty way to label someone a psychopath, to the Rosenhan Experiment, the history of psychology is filled with enough self-reinforcing bumbling and egomania to make one think the Scientologists may have a point.While Ronson's book is a collection of interesting anecdotes and observations, digressing into the overmedication of children, misdiagnoses of autism, and the brutality of capitalist devotion to ""shareholder value,"" between interviews with ex-death squad leaders and allegedly psychopathic CEO Al Dunlap, it's a bit weak in its critique of science, and sheds little light on his subjects.Martha Stout's book The Sociopath Next Door was more illuminating. Ronson does, however, give a bit of a glimpse into the mind of a sociopath in a way that Stout only addressed abstractly: how do sociopaths/psychopaths (there is no technical difference between them) see themselves? Do they recognize that they are ""broken""? Do they ever want to be cured, and can they be? (Short answer: no.)Ronson's interview with Al Dunlap was particularly interesting, as he actually confronted Dunlap with the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, and the allegations that Dunlap, according to this tool, scored high on the psychopathy scale. Dunlap proceeded to point out that every behavior presented as evidence of being a psychopath could also be interpreted as someone who has a forceful and driven personality who gets things done. True enough, there is a lot of evidence that psychopathy is an asset in positions of power, like boardrooms.Ronson is able to see how some of his subjects ape normal human reactions and manipulate people the way they'd handle a TV remote control, but others, like Al Dunlap, are more ambiguous. Is Dunlap really a psychopath, or just a merciless asshole? As both Stout and Ronson point out, even genuine psychopaths are rarely serial killers; most live law-abiding, respectable lives, though never out of any actual respect for the law or society.An interesting if somewhat meandering trip into the perilous world of diagnosing psychopaths, The Psychopath Test is not exactly a weighty, heavily-researched book, but it will be of interest to anyone who has an, ahem, clinical interest in psychopaths."
277,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14084605-pink,4,"A real thought provoker. What is a psychopath? Are you a psychopath? How about your friends or co-workers? This book will leave you diagnosing everyone you know and becoming all powerful with your new amazing psychopath detection skills, just like Jon Ronson. The book really made me think about how mental illness is defined. Sure there are clear cut cases of insanity and sanity, but there's a huge area in the middle, with a range of diagnoses that are possible to be made and indeed are being sweepingly made and medicated for across the world. Quite apart from the issues of psychopath detection and detention, there were some interesting stories. A wide range of people were interviewed for his research and I was fascinated by several of their lives, whether they were the professionals, or the patients. This was my first Jon Ronson book and I haven't read any of his journalistic material so his style of writing is all new to me. I appreciated the humour and details about himself that were included, which broke up some pretty heavy content at times. I also liked how the book came full circle and re-visited the people at the beginning of his journey, which gave closure to their own stories. Much recommended and I can't wait to read more of his books now! "
278,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37830213-zuky-the-bookbum,5,Final rating: 4.5This was a really fun and intriguing read! I love Ronson's writing and journalistic style.
279,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4529669-willow,4,"Jon Ronson is a hoot. It would be great to have lunch with him. He puts so much of himself into his writing, bringing up his own little insecurities and observations, pretty much showing that he’ll be happy to go anywhere or do anything provided there’s a good story. This book is all over the place following Jon around and he brings up different case studies after another. In fact, I’m not sure they had that much in common with each other except that Jon decided they were worth investigating. This ‘all over the place’ is the book’s weakness and the reason I knocked a star. You see, I’m not sure Jon really proved his point. That doesn’t mean it wasn’t informative and entertaining. I definitely learned a lot about the psychopath test, which is here by the way: http://thinkcreatedesign.wordpress.co...Some of the provocative ideas this book brings up is that psychopaths may actually have a brain abnormality that has to do with their amygdale. They don’t feel the full range of emotions like most people. This makes them fearless, lacking in empathy and they gravitate toward positions of power because they are missing regular emotional stimulation. There could be one psychopath in every hundred people. Jon even jokes that he started seeing psychopaths everywhere once he acquired his new psychopath spotting skills. Obviously he’s not the only one with psychopath spotting skills. One of the reviews on GR even suggested that pretty much everybody in the GOP is a psychopath, posting pictures. Judging by the seriousness of her review, and the lack of seriousness in Jon’s book, I can’t help but think that she ignored the last quarter of the book. That’s because by the end, Jon is rethinking what he’s learned about psychopaths and the psychopath test, suggesting that nothing is cut and dried, and scoring high on a test shouldn’t get you locked away forever. He takes a look at criminal profilers and some of their serious blunders (something crime shows rarely show on TV). If the police are convinced you are the culprit, or a doctor wants to slap a diagnosis on you, they will find a way, because that’s what they want to find. Both the media, the pharmaceutical companies, and the public want to promote mental illness for different reasons. Categorizing is something humans love to do. We look for order in a chaotic world. It’s comforting. And sometimes when people are trying to fit someone in a personality box, we ignore all the things that make them not fit there. Psychology is not an exact science I’ve read that The Society for the Scientific Study of Psychopathy (SSSP) published a statement regarding this book stating that certain interviews in it were exaggerated or fictionalised and that they ""think that Ronson’s book trivializes a serious personality disorder and its measurement, which is not helpful to those who have the disorder or to their unfortunate victims"".This statement made me laugh, because I don’t think this book was ever meant to be a deep serious study of psychopaths. It’s more about Jon investigating them, and coming up with different conclusions. He’s a thoughtful writer and I enjoyed reading his observations. I think this book raises more questions than it answers. I love that. "
280,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1016626-tim-pendry,3,"This book is being promoted as 'comic'. Sadly, it is not. It is quite a sad read. I laughed once out loud and smiled twice but only in the first chapter. If you end this book laughing, you have not ‘got it’. You should leave it a little angry and troubled.Ronson exhibits all the graces and the flaws of modern British journalism. It is an easy read. The man is self-questioning (though clearly not too deeply lest he cease to function) and he is honest. But he is also skimming the surface of issues that require a far tougher and better book than this.Perhaps he is being cleverer than I think. Perhaps his periodic questioning of the way his profession turns reality into narratives, into modern folk tales, will create a suspicion in the public's mind about how it receives information, how its mental world is structured. I think not.The book is about the phenomenon of the psychopath which operates at so many levels as part of our cultural self-definition. As a species, we tend to need a scapegoat for structural ills that derive from our own nature - so, why not the 'psychopath' in our culture.Perhaps 1% of the population is 'psychopathic' in the sense of presenting a reasonable danger to others under certain conditions. Perhaps another 5% have traits that could be dangerous under yet other more extreme conditions. I suspect 88% are just a danger to themselves as ‘normals’.Political fear (I speak as a radical empath who is in the 'other' 6%, potentially equally dangerous to society for completely different reasons) seems to be determining that media headlines must ensure that 'psychopaths' are defined for incarceration by their nature rather than by their deeds.Yet, as Charlie Chaplin’s M. Verdoux so eloquently put it in the film of that name, it is not the single psychopath whose default mode is tolerance for enormous crimes against humanity but the vast ‘normal’ mass who vote, work and play without much of a thought in their little minds.Ronson opens the door to such subversive thinking but he only peeks in. The psychopath in Broadmoor is judged fit for release and we know it is a gamble. The corporate boss targeted as a psychopath turns out to be depressingly conventional in his private life. So far, so ‘normal’.But Scientologists prove to be champions of human rights and psychiatrists appear to be at forefront of new sociologies of population control, aided by pharmaceuticals interests who turn any mild abnormality from a genetic variant of possible evolutionary value into a diagnosed disease.Some of the most ethically filthy conduct in the book, leading to suicide and death in their victims, come from ‘normals’, the same sort of ‘normal’ who obeys an order in a war or who thinks corporate career progression is a substitute for personal responsibility.The book deserves better than its jokey style. Perhaps the jokey style will build more understanding amongst the general population and that is its justification. Unfortunately, it will probably just flow off most ‘normal’s backs like that of the proverbial duck.So let us try the analysis here that Ronson seems nervous of attempting – that hoary old business, no doubt, in his case, of just being a reporter, just telling a story.First, as he rightly points out, there really are very dangerous persons which we have termed psychopaths but which are simply at one genetic and personality end of our human Bell Curve. They are not monsters, they are human. They are simply accentuations of aspects of our normal selves.Society needs protection but it also needs to recognize, in different ecological circumstances, that they may be more important to us than ourselves in the future of our own species. We have to hope we hang on to civilization long enough to ensure that they are never needed.Second, these dangerous ones are there but they are rare. We cannot build our entire social structure around protecting ourselves from what amounts to a force of nature any more than we should be degenerating as a free and questioning culture because of a few terrorists.Faced with nature, sometimes bad things happen. They will continue to happen. ‘The bomber will always get through’. This is what we are as humans. It is dreadful for the victim but these cases are still rare and we should concentrate on a society that polices itself and is not policed.What is happening is that the existence of the genuine psychopath and the genuine terrorist is being used by the authoritarian bureaucrat to introduce ever-increasing controls on our movement, conduct and language (aspirationally, on our minds) in an attempt to manage the unmanageable.Without the ‘noble lie’ of a religion, with no Pope to serve Constantine, the bureaucrats are turning to definitional analysis and what they like to call science but which is no more scientific than was Lysenko under Stalin. If this book does one service, it is to cast doubt on the more radical scientific credentials of psychology.Over the last two decades, the psychologists and social scientists have found themselves riding on a lucrative gravy train medicalising ‘misbehaviour’ and unhappiness and offering cures based on chemicals and incarceration. The sick are becoming overwhelmed by the worried and the inconvenient.These new priests of the mind are now busy perpetrating the lie of there being no free will (a spurious philosophical conclusion from consciousness studies by people who could usefully spend some time reading the great existentialists) and the even worse lie of a beneficent normality.It was men in white coats who murdered the physically abnormal in euthanasia programmes under national-socialism. It is now men in white coats who are engaged in soul murder against the mentally different. There are throw-away stories in the book of how gays and feminists could lobby successfully to ensure that certain psychological definitions were abandoned. Either science is science or it is not. Scientific decision-making in physics would not allow the peer review to include a lobbyist.‘Conditions’ that have no politically powerful lobbies against them also have many commercial and family interests seeking their establishment. But we have to keep our feet on the ground. If social science and psychology are socio-political tools, there are still things to be cured or managed.There are people seriously suffering pain (yet the system still refuses to let psychiatrists test low dosage levels of psychedelics for depression and trauma). There is certainly work to be done on re-engineering society for relief from anxiety and self empowerment.What is grossly unacceptable is to allow social or family order requirements to permit collusion between drug companies, a morally degenerate professional class and the state or parents in the use of drugs for social control of behaviours that are merely inconvenient or embarrassing.We live in monstrous times. This book, to its credit, opens the door on the monsters – psychopathic and professional alike. We have a choice to go through the door and see what our society has become or shut it and pretend it is not happening. So, my regret about this well-written, entertaining and thought-provoking book is that Ronson limits himself to anecdotes and questions. ‘Normals’ will pick this up, be entertained and go back to being ‘normal’ again. ‘Normal’ people are the shills for the men in white coats and grey suits. What we really need now are writers who show people that just being ‘normal’ (and certainly being ‘normalised’) is damned dangerous to them and to their kids’ future and that ‘normal’ now means little more than manageable and controllable. Ronson merely skims the surface of this story."
281,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara,5,"I couldn't imagine that a book about psychopaths would be so good! Ronson interviews lots of people including people in institutions for the criminally insane, Scientologists, psychiatrists and conspiracy theorists. Ronson also has a very engaging narrating style. We all encounter psychopaths, and sometimes it takes time for us to realize the person has a personality disorder. They may be work colleagues, neighbors, and other people we interact with. It has helped me at times to realize that someone's behavior fits the parameters of psychopathy. Of course, Ronson also explores cases where individuals have been institutionalized for years or even a lifetime without adequate evidence that they continue to be a threat to others. I recommend this to anyone interested in the topic of psychopathic behavior but don't want a technical treatment for the subject."
282,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"Entertaining and a surprisingly breezy read, The Psychopath Test is a somewhat rambling and ultimately non-conclusive record of an investigative journey into the mental health industry, conspiracy theories and scientology. The author meets some very interesting people -- about whom you can form your own conclusions: I was never exactly happy about Bob Hare.I enjoyed reading it, but oddly I'm not sure I can recommend it. Looking back at it, there's not much substance, and isn't as hilariously funny as the blurb and reviews on the back would have you believe -- then again, I don't think it was a waste of time either."
283,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62761616-imane,4,"This was an enjoyable read. In addition to defining and describing the traits of psychopathy, the author raises some questions regarding the sanity of the industry of psychiatry .Overall it was informative, funny and sometimes disturbing; reading about the brutal murders was not my favorite part but if you are looking for ways to spot a psychopath then this book is the one. "
284,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5487874-g,3,"3.5/5Less of ""a journey through the madness industry"" and more of a random romp. Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable one. The Psychopath Test didn't bring me any greater clarity on the subject. Instead, it gave me more to think about. And, frankly, I'm not not mad about that. I'd actually like to read more of Jon Ronson's work."
285,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,4,"4.5 starsJon Ronson is one of those writers - like David Sedaris - whose voice you hear as you read his words; the soft, slightly effete, often uncertain lilt of his sounding in the reader's inner ear. This is one of the things that makes him such an engaging writer, along with his style of placing himself (and his neuroses, which are particularly apposite in this context) directly in view, a method which rather than obscuring his subjects illuminates them, by giving us such an upfront view. The very subjectivity of Ronson's journalistic style allows us to see the complexity of the tale with clarity.In this book Ronson stitches together, as usual, stories that illuminate a single theme - initially tied loosely but bound tighter and tighter as the book progresses. The chapters each involve a way in which we view madness, starting with his own rather off-hand description of an interviewee as a ""psychopath"" and his involvement in an entirely unrelated mystery (which is ultimately used to bookend the volume) which then spirals off from his increasing fascination with the diagnosis of mental disorders following delving into the DSM-IV (and subsequent self diagnosis of a dozen disorders). We meet a patient at Broadmoor high security psychiatric hospital, committed following an insanity plea when on trial for GBH and a subsequent diagnosis as a psychopath, a history of that disorder and its diagnosis and treatment, and then on to a gallery of cases involving both people Ronson has interviewed (psychologists, psychiatrists, a former Haitian paramilitary leader, a corporate CEO famous for his glee in downsizing for fun and profit, former MI5 agent David Shayler) and others whose lives have been changed by direct or indirect contact either those who may have psychiatric disorders or with the madness industry tat has grown around them.The connecting thread is this; that over recent decades we have become increasingly fond of defining behaviours that lay on the spectrum of human personality as 'disorders', using methods which may or may not be scientific and may or may not be accurate. There is plenty of questioning of those methods in this book, but the criticism is largely leveled at those people and organisations that are too ready to use these blunt tools for their own ends - whether it is the pharmaceutical industry and their ever increasing push to medicate human difference or the Metropolitan Police entrapping a neat suspect in a murder case despite a complete lack of evidence, while possibly allowing the actual killer the freedom to kill again.Ronson is sometimes described as a humorist (as does Will Self in his Guardian review quoted on the blurb) but I think this is entirely misleading. Ronson is and always has been a journalist, albeit one who uses his wit and humour to allow us insights to the things about which he writes, a technique which is also effective when he drops it to highlight the sad or horrific - the town of Shubuta, Mississippi, devastated when the local toaster factory was closed to increase the manufacturing company's share price, the murders committed by actual violent psychopaths, the deaths and harm caused by the 'reality' TV industry when they have focused on a distorted view of what is not 'normal'. And, unlike much journalism, this does not attempt to give definite answers; the threads Ronson has drawn together are tied neatly enough to make sense but with enough frayed, trailing lines to leave the reader pondering long after closing the book."
286,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,4,"So Jon Ronson, the man who brought the theory that the world is run by extraterrestrial lizard people to the world's attention, turns his worried gaze to psychopaths. He wrote something like a deeply ambivalent travelogue of his time writing this book. We meet death squad leaders and CEOs who love firing people. We meet a man wrongly picked by a criminal profiler as a brutal killer and we meet Scientologists. We meet the man who helped get homosexuality out of the DSM as a psychiatric condition and we meet a guy who tried nude LSD-assisted psychotherapy for criminal psychopaths. We meet a man who believes no one blew themselves up in subway cars in London one July day and we meet a woman on one of those subway cars. And what do we learn? I’m not sure. That psychiatry started using check lists to standardize diagnoses and the pharmacologization of psychiatry followed, yes. That now in three days, you too can diagnose psychopaths with a handy dandy 40 question check list, yes. But those are headlines, not books. That psychopaths are both like, and unlike, extraterrestrial lizard people, maybe. I quite enjoyed this book. I’m struggling to find something useful to say about it. As foreshadowed above, ambivalent travelogue is the best I’ve come up with. I thought at first the thesis was that psychopaths are everywhere, disproportionately in positions of power, and how they use that power destroys the world. Bob Hare, the man who developed the psychopath test itself, told Ronson he regretted doing so much of his work in prisons instead of on the stock exchange. When Ronson protested that serial killers were worse than psychopathic stock brokers, Hare said:‘“Serial killers ruin families.’ Bob shrugged. ‘Corporate and political and religious psychopaths ruin economies. They ruin societies.’	“This – Bob was saying – was the straightforward solution to the greatest mystery of all: why is the world so unfair? Why all that savage economic injustice, those brutal wars, the everyday corporate cruelty? The answer: psychopaths. The part of the brain that doesn’t function right. . . . . We aren’t all good people just trying to do good. Some of us are psychopaths. And psychopaths are to blame for this brutal, misshapen society. They’re the jagged rocks thrown into the still pond.” (112)And that moved me deeply. But Ronson doesn’t develop that thesis. Instead, he travelogues his earnest conversations with marginal nutball after marginal nutball, takes a brief foray into how the modern psychiatric profession became what it is today, then returns us to a secure psychiatric facility to watch a man committed for years after faking madness be released. Maybe there’s nothing more to be said on that. The idea that psychopaths drive the action on the world stage may be just too depressing to stare at for too long, even if you do have a BBC film crew with you. It was a good book. Well worth reading. I have the nagging feeling there was a better one inchoate in the source material, but I’m dead certain Ronson did better than I would have writing it. "
287,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3397530-lea,4,"I am a huuuuuge Jon Ronson fan, so it's no surprise that I enjoyed this book too. The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry lives up to its title -- Ronson really does take the reader on a journey through the ""madness industry"". The book opens with a bit of a mystery concerning an unusual book that was mailed to various academics throughout the world. At first it doesn't seem to fit the theme of the book, but Ronson ties it in eventually. His typical style is to jump around between subjects, finding common themes, and this book is no different -- we meet an incarcerated psychopath (who may not, in fact, be a psychopath at all), learn about the methods of diagnosing psychopathy, investigate current psychological diagnoses (especially those in children), and see another possible psychopath's positive spin on those ""negative"" traits. The book also looks at Scientology's war on psychiatry, the experimental psychiatric treatments of the 1970s, and criminal profiling. The author covers a lot of ground here, but it's a very fast read. There are several parts that are unsettling -- some crime descriptions, the kafka-esque plight of those stuck in a psychiatric catch-22, a child's accidental overdose of psychiatric medication -- although that could be more indicative of my sensitivity than anythng else.As usual, Ronson explores his own feelings and anxieties as well. Some readers may find this annoying, although his fans most likely won't -- I enjoy those parts of his books!All in all, I really enjoyed this book, and I would recommend it, especially if you've read and liked his previous books."
288,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948275-josh,3,"Let me begin by saying that the title is deceiving. While it does go into the subject of psychopaths and eventually ends with it, there are many points at which I felt like Ronson's main objective was the critique the overall approach to mental disorders that this country (and other researchers from other countries around the world) have taken over the years. We've gotten ourselves into the habit of classifying every little oddity in our personalities as something strange and unwanted, rather than looking at people as individuals with individualistic tendencies -- and this is especially true when it comes to differences of the mind and its inner workings. So, the fact that I was reading this book as a way into psychopaths and psychopaths alone left me with a unsavory taste once I started to realize that there was much more going on here that I wasn't prepared for. Which isn't to say that I disliked any of what was in the book. There are some very interesting (and entertaining) takes on issues such as Scientology, childhood psychiatry, and even conspiracy theorists. However, that's not what the title of the book leads you to believe the book is about. And I call that false advertisement. And no matter how entertaining this book ended up being (and it was -- Ronson tells a story here, with a plot and everything, rather than reporting like a journalist), no matter how drawn in I was into the story he created, the fact still remains that I don't feel like I learned nearly enough about psychopaths as I should have from a book titled, ""The Psychopath Test."""

Listened to the audiobook read by the author himself, and was hooked after only a few minutes; then when Ronson started talking about Douglas Hofstadter and Scientologists I had to think ""I am so lucky to be listening to this book!"" I learned about how the original DSM was created - how arbitrary all those diagnoses are - and that's (can I say:) depressing. I should write a thoughtful review but I am pressed for time, so I will quote Laura Miller at Salon: [Ronson is] not afraid to play the feckless neurotic for laughs, but that doesn't obscure the serious questions raise by his investigations. Psychiatric diagnoses (and, these days, the medications that follow) really can become fads, with certain experts suddenly deciding that multiple personality disorder or childhood bipolar disorder are far more common that ever before suspected. Ronson even finds the occasion for a little professional soul-searching; he accuses himself and other journalists of being the Goldilocks of craziness, seeking out people to write about who are just nuts enough to be colorful but not so disturbed that they're downright sad."

He writes so fluently that reading this book is like breathing. I just started it yesternight and about a 1/3 of the way through, he also highlights certain aspects of the study of the mind in relation to its historcal perspective(s).Although the subject/topics are a bit challenging, if you think you may be interested in this book, It is well worth your time. Also, I think his paradigm exposes/shows us concepts perhaps that may have permeated some of our current and past leaders in all walks of life. Something to consider and think about.My hats off to Mr. Ronson, Great job.This is an excellent book and it is excellently written. I believe I will read it again very soon just to see what I missed: even dispite the topic difficulty.It really gives you a great deal to think about, and seems related to Brightsided, in terms of some modern moras."

Lots of oddballs emerge.Ronson's got a funny style, and apparently a real knack for tracking down the world's screwballs.

Why can't I learn my lesson about impulsive book-buying? It rarely turns out well. Ronson starts the book by recounting the Mystery of the Mysterious Book. An expensively produced, attractive hard bound book was sent to various academics around the world and none of them can figure out why they received the book or what its purpose is. The sender is unknown, but the books were sent from Sweden. Ronson is recruited to solve the mystery. Along the way, he gets interested in the idea of mental illness and psychopaths and also begins pursing the idea of what it means to be diagnosed as a psychopath and how they are diagnosed. Ronson interviews various psychologists in the field, including Robert Hare, creator of the PCL-R (the Hare Checklist for psychopathology). Ronson also talks with people who doubt the accuracy of the PCL-R (Scientologists...ha ha ha ha), discusses his own neuroses and anxieties, muses on the tendency of psychologists these days to over-analyze, abuses the exclamation mark and makes a lot of lame jokes. This is an idiotic book. I would not recommend it to anyone who is interested in psychopathology and either has a good layperson's understanding of psychopathology or is a professional in the field of psychology (unless that person wants a good laugh). Some of the books Ronson lists as research sources I've already read (plus Harvey Cleckley's Mask of Sanity which Ronson mentions but didn't read) so I already knew more about psychopathology than the author; this revelation did not make me happy. When Ronson begins to explore the subject, he has only the vaguest (Hollywood-influenced) idea of psychopaths and who does he turn to first? Why, Scientologists of course. I mean, if I wanted an understanding of any topic in the field of psychology, I would automatically turn to a group of nutbars who believe in aliens but think psychology is nonsense. A group within Scientologists called the CCHR (Citizens Commission on Human Rights) have made it their mission to ""prove to the world that psychiatrists are wicked and must be stopped"" (28). Ronson is impressed by their record of exposing some very bad psychiatrists...well, yes, they did expose some bad ones, but the examples that Ronson provides (provided to him by the CCHR) are fairly obvious quacks (or mentally ill individuals) who were in the field for reasons other than to honestly practice the profession. Eventually Ronson decides that talking to actual psychologists instead of Scientologists is a good idea. I got fairly disgusted early on when a Scientologist took him to Broadmoor (insane asylum in England) to meet a psychopath (Tony) who isn't really a psychopath--he just pretended to be one so he could avoid prison. Once in Broadmoor, surprise surprise, Tony is diagnosed as a psychopath. Ronson listens to Tony's story of woe without (seemingly) a critical thought in his head. Because at this point Ronson still hasn't done any research about psychopaths, he is completely taken in by Tony's story and believes he is wrongly incarcerated. It's not until later when he talks with Tony's doctor does he have a more informed view of Tony and why he is at Broadmoor. This whole book irritates me because I can't decide if Ronson is really such an idiot or if he possesses some sly sense of humor I can't perceive. When Ronson finally gets to Robert Hare and his pathology checklist, I'm again annoyed. He walks around with the checklist and interviews people whose behavior suggests psychopathology (most notable: Al Dunlap, former CEO--and destroyer--of the Sunbeam Corporation and Emmanuel ""Toto"" Constant, leader of the paramilitary group FRAPH in Haiti). Ronson mentally checks off each psychopath characteristic (Item 6: Lack of Remorse or Guilt, Item 7: Shallow Affect) he thinks they display as he interviews them. With Dunlap, Ronson goes straight through the list and directly asks him about each item. Ronson describes himself as feeling powerful because he has this secret knowledge and can identify psychopaths. What Ronson (willfully?) forgets (ignores?) is that it's not enough to say, yeah, this person seems to not have empathy or sympathy, but an interviewee also has to determine to what degree this person doesn't have sympathy. Maybe some things do bother him and others don't. I understand that at least one of Ronson's objectives of the book is to say, hey, it's way too easy to diagnose someone with a mental illness by going through a list. Well, yeah. This is not a revelation. The fact that Ronson thinks this state of affairs within the psychology/psychiatry field is shocking is, in itself, shocking. What field doesn't have its instances of abuse and misuse? He has a chapter discussing how children are diagnosed with bipolar disorders and then prescribed drugs to treat this (as many psychologists think) imaginary children's condition. It's apparently the latest fad. Parents with kids who are moody or restless or high-energy and don't have the time to deal with them get their children diagnosed with something (for a while ADHD was huge; maybe it still is) and doped up. Parents aren't necessarily to blame; there are the professionals who misdiagnose and the pharmaceutical industry eager to make money any way it can. Many factors create and exacerbate the abuse of Hare's PCL-R and the way anyone is misdiagnosed and over-medicated. The Psychopath Test is generally a mess of a book. There's no clear thesis/objective for the book. What exactly is Ronson investigating? What is he trying to prove? His discussion of the PCL-R is thrown off track by the chapter detailing how the DSM is created (a rather haphazard and unscientific process if Ronson's information is correct) and the misdiagnosis of children. If Ronson wanted to explore the abuses of psychology and psychiatry (combined with the shady connection between psychiatrists and the pharmaceutical industry), then why didn't he do that? This book is merely a glib commentary on several topics combined with the author's (non-humorous) observations of his own anxieties and neuroses. Although I did not like how he approached the topic nor how he wrote it, I am still interested in reading (if not buying) Ronson's other books. It's clear that Ronson was out of his depth with this subject. "
294,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22440207-agn,4,"WHAT IS IT ABOUT?In his book “The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry,” a bestselling journalist Jon Ronson, propelled by a mysterious hoax played on the world’s leading scientists, dives into the world of madness to explore just how mad we really are. During his two-year journey, Ronson not only interviews a bunch of madmen as well as several influential psychologists, psychiatrists and anti-psychiatric Scientologists but also practices his newly gained skill of using Hare Psychopathy Checklist to spot psychopaths. Unexpectedly and quite disturbingly, the author discovers the society’s drive for the ‘right amount’ of insanity, and often detrimental tendency to define individuals by their maddest edges.THUMBS UP:1) Intriguing introduction.The first chapter of “The Psychopath Test” is THE BEST (mysterious, suspenseful and utterly captivating) introductory chapter I have ever read in a non-fiction book. The opening story is so bizarre it can be easily turned into a book itself.2) Well researched, skillfully written.Ronson’s style is quite humorous and engaging, making his non-fiction very readable and not in the least dry. Also, the author put quite some time and effort into researching and interviewing, which allowed him to explore the madness industry from multiple perspectives, which in turn enables the readers to form their own opinions on the matter. COULD BE BETTER:1) Not what I expected.I guess it’s not really the author’s fault, but I was expecting this book to be more about psychopaths and less about everything else. Instead, at least half of the book has little to do with psychopathy as the author probes multiple issues related to general insanity. It works this way as well, but I was hoping for an in-depth exploration of the psychopath’s mind and thus was a tiny bit disappointed.2) Fragmented and seemingly directionless.While I was reading “The Psychopath Test,” I felt rather confused as if the story has been patched together from several seemingly unrelated parts: at first the book seemed like a really engaging mystery, then it became psychopath-oriented, but soon enough the chapters became quite independent, loosely connected by the general madness theme. Honestly, up until the final chapters I wasn’t sure where the story was going. Although at the very end the author’s intentions became more or less clear, Ronson could have done a better job guiding the reader throughout the whole book.VERDICT: 4 out of 5Although “The Psychopath Test” might seem a little fragmented and directionless, it is nonetheless a very entertaining non-fiction that carries an important message."
295,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7232207-fiona,3,"I had a run-in with a psychopath once. I definitely came out worse from that encounter.But that's the thing that I just can't get my head around: once upon a time, I met a bona fide psychopath and in hindsight it was really, really noticeable! But if, according to Jon Ronson and his sources, psychopaths make up a little less than 1% of the population, where are all the rest of them? Are one in ten Londoners psychopathic? (Apparently they head for big cities.) Are prisons disproportionately full of them? I mean, I imagine so, but even that wouldn't account for the fact that I've identifiably met considerably fewer of them than I would expect to. Where've I been? Mostly (in my adult life) legal academia, the construction industry, and musical theatre. Hardly hotbeds of the empathetic.So something is a bit off, and I think Jon Ronson also knows this: his book is not just called Psychopaths, but The Psychopath Test - it's also partly about diagnosis of mental health problems. It's really engaging, and Ronson is a great writer, but it's hardly in depth. He's got a really light touch, skipping from prison populations to business management, to the writing of DSM-III, to the potential for misdiagnosis of childhood ADHD. This is a 250-page book! I feel like the book poses more questions than it answers, mainly because there's not enough time, and Ronson has no apparent inclination, to go into anything in any depth. He's just spotted something shiny and moved on.So what do I want to know about psychopaths? Well, what I'm missing, for a start. I don't believe that nearly one in a hundred people on this earth are incurably heinous, robot-hearted monsters with no souls and an aptitude on the London Stock Exchange. So is the percentage smaller, or does psychopathy actually mean something different to that? Is it possible to have all these traits and still have a meaningful life, loving relationships and friendships, and do some good in the world? I'm sure it must be; coming out of this book, I saw no indication of it. Have a bit of optimism, Jon! The world's not completely up the creek. It can't be as totally hopeless as you make it out to be. Which means - what aren't you telling me?"
296,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526809-donna,4,"Saw the interview on 'John Stewart', then ordered it like a cubic zirconia tennis bracelet from The Shopping Channel. I got a slow start with it. The Kindle app formatting is kinda shitty. stray lines. Typos. I kept asking myself whether anybody checked it out beforehand. Then again, maybe they wanted it to look that way. Once I got used to this clash of esthetics, I found it a great deal of fun. Wha? A book about psychopathy fun? He doesn't just seek out the usual suspects. He talks to Bob Hare who came up with the oft used checklist to spot it. I was worried at first, that Ronson would turn out to be one of tthose 'it all comes back to me' sorts of interviewers, but he asked many of the questions I would have liked to ask. He doesn't give the impression of being thorough, but he is. So he talked with Bob Hare, which resulted in his seeing psychopaths everywhere. He visited Al Dunlap, dismantler of Sunbeam to wonder whether he might be one. ""He pointed at a sculpture of four sharks encircling the planet. 'I believe in predators,' he said. 'Their spirit will enable you to succeed. Over there you've got falcons. Alligators. Alligators. More alligators. Tigers.' 'It's As if both Midas and also the Queen of Narnia were here,' I said, 'and the Queen of Narnia flew above a particularly fierce zoo and turned everything there to stone and then transported everything here.' 'What?' said Al. 'Nothing,' I said. 'No,' he said, 'What did you just say?' He shot me a steely, blue-eyed stare, which I found quite debilitating. ""I appreciated how he took the subject out of prison where we, the still living prey can really relate to it. Of course,I liked this because it's really all about me. Without seeming to, he also gets into some searching questions about journalism and madness. "
297,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4636758-vanessa,4,"I really enjoyed this book. I have for a while now had an interest in psychology and mental disorders of various kinds, finding them absolutely fascinating to read about. Psychopathy (or sociopathy) was something, however, that I didn't really know much about prior to reading this book. I certainly hadn't heard of The Psychopath Test, created by Bob Hare, a Canadian criminal psychologist.In his book, Ronson shares his encounters with various people that may or may not be classified as psychopaths, from a man known only as ""Tony"" who 'fakes' madness to get out of a prison sentence, to Al Dunlap, a retired corporate executive with a tendency to see factors on the Psychopath Test as positive in the eyes of business. All is told from the humorous and objective viewpoint of Ronson, whilst over-analysing his own motivations in true anxiety-related style.Ronson reminded me a lot of myself at points in this book, and I really enjoyed the way he structured his book and the interviews he conducted. I will definitely be seeking out more of his work, and if you have any interest in the topic of psychopathy, or are a fan of gonzo-style journalism, then I would highly recommend this."
298,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3659939-bree,4,"Really, really enjoyed this. First of all, I listened to the audiobook and Jon Ronson's voice reminds me of Neil Gaiman's, so already it's a win. It's fascinating to consider how psychopathy is diagnosed and what that diagnosis means. Most human beings display some psychopathic traits from time to time, but how do you determine when someone displays enough to be considered a danger to society? Jon Ronson's writing is humorous, fun, and completely engaging. At times the structure of the book felt a little disjointed, but I appreciated how it all came together at the end. Because much of the book consists of interviews with various psychiatrists and psychopaths (and maybe-psychopaths), the reader is able to come to their own conclusions rather than relying on the author to tell you what to think. "
299,1594485755,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,4,"This is the sort of book that I tend to enjoy – a journalist tells amusing stories about his investigations into a particular topic – but which readers with a more focused interest in the purported subject may find frustrating. Ronson portrays himself as a cheerfully unmethodical explorer of the world of craziness, meeting with experts, prisoners, and potentially psychotic retired executives and presenting their stories and his responses in a lively, vivid style. Some of the stories involved, almost necessarily, are rather horrible, but he keeps the gruesome stuff to a minimum and finds the absurd humor in situations where you might not expect to find it. As engaging and entertaining a book on psychopaths as you are likely to find, and I particularly enjoyed the way he concluded his story. Four and a half stars."
