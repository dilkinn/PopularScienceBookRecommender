0,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,4,"Let me begin this review by saying that I am not, and never have been, a runner. Despite that fact, I was surprisingly fascinated by Chrisopher McDougall's account of how his desire to run without pain started him on a quest that led him both deep into Mexico's remote Copper Canyons and human evolutionary past.Born to Run begins as an adventure story. While trying to figure out how to get his own foot to stop hurting, he saw an article about a tribe of Mexican Indians called the Tarahumara. These people were said to be able to run for days at a time through unforgiving terrain wearing nothing more on their feet than sandals made from thin strips of tire rubber. So McDougall set out to find these mysterious people, but doing so was not easy. The Copper Canyons where they live are extremely difficult to get to, and the trip is made even more hazardous by having to pass through drug farming country on the way. In addition to being a sometimes nail-biting tale about the author's quest to find the Tarahumara, Born to Run also weaves in the fascinating history of the sport of ultra-running. Ultra-marathons are races consisting of any distance longer than a marathon. McDougall discusses how this crazy sport first came into being, highlighting along the way the stories of the participants who have slowly begun to make it famous.McDougall narrates this history in real time, resulting in descriptions of several races that were so gripping I couldn't put the book down. One of these races was the Leadville Trail 100, a 100-mile race at 11,000 feet in which the Tarahumara faced off against an ultra-running prodigy named Ann Trason.As McDougall weaves together the story of ultra-running's past with his own quest to find the Tarahumara and become a better runner, he also relays a fascinating tale about scientific discoveries into our evolutionary past suggesting that it was our ability to run long distances without getting winded, and thus get all that extra protein from the bounding antelope we were able to outlast, that gave us the evolutionary edge needed to grow our huge brains. These sections also point out that we did not evolve to run on cushions with arch support, and that expensive running shoes may actually make runners more prone to injury than running in the bare feet nature so elegantly designed for us.The book concludes with the tale of a joint venture between McDougall and a character named Caballo Blanco, a gringo who had befriended the Tarahumara and made the Copper Canyons his home. Though the Tarahumara had wowed people at Leadville, Caballo longed to see them race against America's ultra-running best on their own turf. So McDougall helped him get together a half-dozen racers and they made the dangerous trek down into the canyons. The resulting race and the sportsmanship described therein is very moving, and I finished this odd combination of memoir, sports history, adventure tale and evolutionary science with damp eyes. AddendumNot quite a year after reading this book, I've been contemplating that question GR asks in the review process – ""How did this book change your life?"" because, quite unexpectedly, this book has arguably changed my life more than any I've ever read.It started because my geekish husband, a runner, decided he needed to figure out how to make huaraches, the thin, rubber-and-lace sandals worn for long races by the Tarahumara. He made some for himself, and for me, and a few other people in the Boulder Barefoot Club, and then a lot more people in the Boulder Barefoot Club, until finally, the BB Club's founder Michael Sandler, said, ""Why don’t you just put up a web site?"" Steven hemmed and hawed, but Michael, who was about to publish his own comprehensive book on barefoot running (called, appropriately enough, Barefoot Running: How to Run Light and Free by Getting in Touch with the Earth, said if we had a website, he'd put it in his book. And of course, who doesn't want to be in a book?Via the magic of the Interwebs, we soon found ourselves selling huaraches and DIY kits at http://Xeroshoes.com (which, in the decade since I first wrote this, has now grown to include a full line of minimalist shoes, boots and sandals in both casual and performance styles) to people in all 50 states and countries on six out of seven continents (we'd like to go for seven out of seven, but I'm not holding out much hope for barefoot-style running taking off in Antarctica). In the process, I, a walker, not a runner, have found that wearing these shoes, which allow me to intimately feel the ground and get the immediate feedback that forces me to adjust my slightly lopsided gait and have better form, have forever ruined me for other footwear, which now feels like wearing bricks on my feet. So in less than 12 months, our lives have completely reorganized themselves around the process of doing everything we can to get the word out about huaraches and the overall ""natural movement"" movement and its recognition that expensive, highly structured athletic shoes are not your friend. It's a huge project, one that has me working harder than I have in a decade. And, irony of ironies, it is also one that has left me with far less time to read than I had a year ago.Damned life-changing books."
1,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2993027-dougal,1,"I realise I'm in minority here but I really didn't enjoy this book at all. As a result of all the rave reviews I bought a copy for both myself and a friend - we were both hugely disappointed.The author, Christopher McDougall, is an American magazine correspondent and this perhaps goes someway to explain a lot of what I didn't like about the book. To begin with, it is written in a totally 'omniscient' manner, ie McDougall can see inside everyone's head. This is excessive, continuous, and extends right across the board from events to which he was privy, through events to which he was not, on to imagined `eureka moments' of various research scientists. In a similar manner, he describes events from the past, where he wasn't present, in a way he clearly feels will paint some sort of picture: eg `Then she wiped her greasy mouth on her sports bra, burped up some Dew, and bounded off'. Maybe she did wipe her mouth on her sports bra, but it seems doubtful, and I feel quite sure she never gave him an account, years later, of her burp. In a similar vein I confess that I didn't like the continuous use of words like `chomp' instead of `eat' and `chug' instead of `drink'. I imagine that is just a difference in usage when comparing opposite sides of the Atlantic but I did find myself wishing someone would just 'eat' something! And I do wonder if the use of block capitals as well as italics was really necessary. I am not talking about the start of each chapter but sentences like:'...I remember thinking What in the HELL? How in the HELL is this possible? That was the first thing, the first CHINK IN THE WALL, that MAYYYBEE modern shoe companies don't have all the answers...' (nine of those lowercase words are in italics, which I can't format here).So, we clearly have a very fictionalised account. But is any of it complete fiction? Well, yes it is. We are told on page 16 that the Tarahumara `barely eat any protein at all'. Well, with a physiology degree to back it up, I can tell you that leads only one way... to wasting and eventual death. It comes as a bit of a surprise then to be told on page 209 that `the traditional Tarahumara diet exceeds the United Nations' recommended daily intake [for protein] by more than 50 percent'. Perhaps by page 209 we are expected to have forgotten what he wrote earlier.On page 157 we are told, in relation to qualifying for the Boston Marathon that `...99.9 percent of all runners never will...'. Really? And how was that figure arrived at? For any average runner who puts in training, qualifying for Boston (like me!) is not difficult: 20,000 runners run it every year -- not qualify, which will be many, many times more -- actually run it. The implication behind his figure is that only 1 in 1000 marathoners who would specifically like to qualify do, ie 19,980,000 don't, which is clearly rubbish. His misuse of percentages crops up several times. It is patronising to the reader to assume that he doesn't understand what a percentage means. And it makes one more than doubt when we are told figures like '...70 to 80 percent..'. A particular problem with this is that it sounds as if he is being authorative when, in fact, he's not.His problem with Math(s) unfortunately isn't limited to the use of hyperbole with percentages. He unwittingly shows his problem, in typical journalistic style, in rather stark detail! On page 239, to work out how much older than 27 is an age that is equivalent to the increase in age from 19 to 27, he has to get out his notebook!!: `All righty. I flipped my notebook to a blank page and started jotting numbers. It takes....[I'll spare you the next four lines]...' He comes up with 36. Point made.But it is the disingenuous nature of much of his writing that I really took exception to. I will give two examples:One: who do you think ran the fastest?(a)	Page 15: `Lance Armstrong is one of the greatest endurance athletes of all time, and he could barely shuffle through his first marathon despite sucking down an energy gel nearly every mile.'(b)	Page 157: `...Ted...transformed himself...into...a barefoot marathoner with such speed that he was able to accomplish something that 99.9 percent of all runners never will: he qualified for the Boston Marathon.' [I've already talked about the 99.9 percent]Answer: We don't know because we aren't told their times. Well, I can tell you: Lance Armstrong, by a long way. In 2006 his 'shuffle' resulted in a time of 2:59:36 and he came 868th out of 37,866 finishers; a brilliant result for a first marathon (and ten minutes under the very fastest age group Boston qualifying time)! And Barefoot Ted? In 2006 he completed the Boston Marathon in 3:20:16, coming in 3,848th out of 19,682 finishers. Not a shuffle either, but in a completely different, and slower, league. In fact, to refer to a result under three hours (faster than seven minutes a mile) as a shuffle is just gratuitiously insulting. McDougall seems to have a downer on Armstrong, as he slates him elsewhere in the book - the reason never becomes apparent.Two: Why do you think `...Abele Bikila - the Ethiopian marathoner who ran barefoot over the cobblestones of Rome to win the 1960 Olympic marathon...' didn't wear shoes? - we are told this interesting fact in a paragraph about Barefoot Ted researching the benefits of barefoot running. Well, I can tell you, although the book doesn't, that it wasn't anything to do with the benefits of barefoot running. What we aren't told in the book is that Abele Bikila had an upset before the 1960 marathon and couldn't find a pair of shoes to fit and decided to chance running barefoot as he had trained that way; nor are we told that he chose to run in shoes at the subsequent 1964 Olympics.On the subject of barefoot running, it's interesting that the photograph on the back of the hardback edition shows five runners, presumably principal characters from the book, all wearing running shoes.Turning to the so called `scientific research' that McDougall is fond of reporting, again we must doubt a lot of what we are told. Why? Because it is presented in a way we can't trust. Yes, some of it may be true, but how much? And how much are we being presented with information that is propounded as fact or we are led to believe shows one thing, but may show something else? Just one set of examples will make the general point:Page 170: `...no matter how much you run, your odds of getting hurt are the same.' This is utter rubbish and is clearly so, using reductio ad absurdum, apart from all the evidence to the contrary.Page 171: `Is any shoe manufacturer prepared to claim that wearing their distance running shoes will decrease your risk of...injuries...[or]...improve your distance running performance?' No shoe manufacturer followed up the [Dr Richard's] challenge. The conclusion is drawn that `running shoes don't make you go faster and don't stop you from getting hurt..' This is absolute twaddle and I won't insult anyone's intelligence by explaining why.Page 172: The conclusion that McDougall draws from a study that found that ""Wearers of expensive running shoes...are injured significantly more frequently than runners wearing expensive shoes..."" is the following: `What a cruel joke: for double the price, you get double the pain.' Possibly, possibly. Could it just be that the buyers of more expensive shoes are those runners who push the boundaries of their training more aggressively? Unfortunately, the whole book is stuffed with this sort of biased writing dressed up as 'scientific fact'; we are used to it in the popular press -- we get a bookful here. For those of you interested in the 'science', I recommend reading this: http://www.hfs-clinics.co.uk/blog/pod...I could go on, about the very dubious anthropological details, nutrition and hydration anomalies etc, but I have written too much already.The book is just an adventure story, fiction based on fact; enjoy it if you can stomach the style; just take everything with a very big pinch of salt![For anyone considering it, at the very least don't purchase the Kindle edition: there is a spelling mistake on the first page that doesn't bode well for the rest of the book (the spelling mistake is not there in the print edition).]"
2,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3397530-lea,5,"So I picked this book up, thinking it would be a cool story about this lost tribe of distance runners -- which it was -- but I got soooo much more than I bargained for.Yes, I did learn about the Tarahumara tribe, but I also learned about the biomechanics of running and how shoe manufacturers disregard runner safety in preference of turning a profit, ultramarathons and the hardcore runners who participate in them, the lawless culture of Copper Canyon, the nearly lost techniques of persistence hunting, the evolution of the human body, and on and on and on.This is my all-time favourite kind of book -- entertaining, sure, but chock full of information I've never even thought about before. I'm kind of a geek -- I just love to learn new stuff!I went into this thinking that it would probably be a pretty good book, but maybe best for super athletes, but nothing could be further from the truth. This book is for anyone who enjoys discovering new ideas and information. It also might inspire you to pick up your running shoes (or not!) and hit the trails for a nice long run."
3,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/233448-aaron,3,"With its excessive hyperbole, convenient omissions, misleading statistics, logical inconsistencies and plain old errors, I stopped thinking about this book as actual journalism after fifty pages. Trying to read it as a novel wasn't that satisfying either because the book reads like several magazine pieces glued together rather than one continuous work. The personality profiles of Jenn and Billy and the screed against running shoes felt particularly extraneous. However, the book has a fun core of semi-mystical lost knowledge and its someone-recently-brainwashed-to-a-weird-secular-cult tone made the book enjoyable."
4,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-again,2,"Painful as it was, I stayed with this until slightly past the halfway mark. I kept hoping I might learn more about the Tarahumara people, but it was not to be. There's very little about the Tarahumara, and almost everything about a bunch of self-absorbed, obsessive long-distance runners. I have no patience with extreme athletes. They need to strive for some balance in their lives. The sport is not everything. I also got tired of the ""gee golly wow ain't it all just lipsmackingly wild and amazing!!!"" reporting style. A little more objectivity and a lot less hipness, Mr. McDougall."
5,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/372363-books-ring-mah-bell,5,"Truly, I cannot recall the last time I read a book that I loved as much as this.Should you think this book is for serious runners alone, please think again. I am not by any means a runner. I ran track in high school, but the runs I did were short, sweet, sprints. After high school, I had a difficult time finding 200 yard dashes to race in, so I did a few 5k's... I didn't love them much at all. There was no way I was going to win a 5k, not ever. The distance just sucked. (In retrospect, some training may have helped.) I looked at most distance runners as mentally ill - something was wrong with those people. They were running from something, I decided, maybe from being fat, or being sad, maybe running from addictions or desires. Nuts. All of them. (Maybe I was just jealous of their slow twitch muscle fibers.) Most of the time I found the races to be miserable, and looking at most of the runners, it seemed they did too. Grimaces, frowns, bloody nipples, knee braces... yeah, FUN!This book jogged my memory of those few times I did find running to be fun. One of those times was during a 5K called ""Hair of the Frog"", put on by a local brewery. It was early spring, it was cold, raining ice, There was thunder and lightning. I'm not sure if it was oxygen deprivation, or perhaps that amazing runner's high, but midway through the race, I was in nirvana. The trees around me looked beautiful encased in ice. I felt.... amazing. Alive. Primal. It did not matter that I was not going to win this race. (In fact, this race even had an award for finishing DFL, Dead F-ing Last.) It was then that I got it. I understood why some people really love to run. Had it not been for the pints of beer waiting at the finish line, I'm pretty sure I would have rerun the course with glee. Over time, I forgot about that sensation, busy with life, I rarely ran. I remember now. Author Christopher McDougall writes about and participates in extreme adventure sports. He struggles with running injuries. The doctors suggest shots, orthotics, and offer the advice, ""if it hurts, stop doing it."". While in Mexico on an assignment, McDougall discovers the Tarahumara, an anthropological gem - a superhuman species, hidden deep in the formidable Sierra Madres. These people run extreme distances, and they run into old age, when the rest of the world resigns to rocking chairs. McDougall sets out to find these people, to discover how they run without injury, how they continue to run into old age. In the process, meets a man, Caballo Blanco, who wants to set up a race between these superhumans and the elite ultra runners of the United States.There is so much more to this book than people running. This book talks about culture, society, obsession, science. One of the most compelling parts of the book - the evidence presented that we are indeed born to run. One scientist points to the nuchal ligament on the back of our skulls, which fast moving animals have to keep the head in place while running. The topic of persistence hunting comes in to support the point and it is utterly fascinating. Running on two legs may not make us as fast as the quadripeds, but it does allow us to breathe more efficiently. And all these fabulous sweat glands we have? We can run longer without overheating, unlike the mammals not as well equipped with such a cooling system. we may not be fast enough to run down a deer in minutes, but after enduring for several miles, we can overtake the deer as it drops from overheating and exhaustion.The cast of characters is simply amazing. I have already mentioned my thought that serious runners are a bit off in the head. The group of ultrarunners mentioned in the book may make the case for me. We meet Jenn and Billy, two surfer kids turned ultrarunners, that party all night to the point of puking, and get a few hours of sleep (by passing out) and rise, ready to go for a VERY long run. Jack Kirk, an elderly trail runner, is mentioned briefly, but was so fascinating I had to google him. ( http://runtrails.blogspot.com/2007/02... ) There's Barefoot Ted, running trails sans shoes (or if his feet need protection, he uses Vibram Five Fingers). And the mastermind behind the race, Caballo Blanco, a gringo who indeed was running from something.This story is so, SO worth reading.The only thing that could have improved the book... pictures.Now, if you'll excuse me, there's a trail calling me to run.Maybe I am a runner after all."
6,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"You don't stop running because you get old; you get old because you stop running.After hearing my running friends rave about this book for years, I finally got around to reading it. And now I owe them an apology, because I had gotten so sick of being preached at about chia seeds and running barefoot and vegetarianism and ultramarathons that I have been quietly rolling my eyes whenever anyone mentioned this friggin book. But once I got into the story, all of my eye rolls stopped. Sure, there were a few groans about McDougall's punchy, magazine-writing style that doesn't always translate well to book form, but overall, this was an engrossing read. It covers a motley cast of outdoorsy characters from America and Mexico, including the elite runners of the elusive Tarahumara Indian tribe, several incredible foot races, research on running and training methods, and there is even a captivating digression into how the Bushmen of the Kalahari go hunting. At its heart, the story is about human endurance, compassion for others, and the theory that our bodies were ""born to run."" There is a thoughtful chapter on the evolution of homo sapiens from other mammals, and the ways in which the human form is designed to be able to cover an incredible amount of distance. ""Know why people run marathons? Because running is rooted in our collective imagination, and our imagination is rooted in running. Language, art, science; space shuttles, Starry Night, intravascular surgery; they all had their roots in our ability to run. Running was the superpower that made us human -- which means it's a superpower all humans possess.""As mentioned, there are also sections on the nutritional power of chia seeds, vegetarianism, and a training theory that runners should spend more time barefoot to build up their strength. I won't lecture you about any of that as I had found it exhausting when others preached to me (there is a line between enthusiasm and evangelism), but I did find the information interesting and will take it under advisement. Along the way, McDougall shares his own stories of running injuries and how he found different trainers to teach him ways to run more efficiently and with more joy. Yes, joy. ""How do you flip the internal switch that changes us all back into the Natural Born Runners we once were? Not just in history, but in our own lifetimes. Remember? Back when you were a kid and you had to be yelled at to slow down? Every game you played, you played at top speed, sprinting like crazy as you kicked cans, freed all, and attacked jungle outposts in your neighbors' backyards ... That was the real secret of the Tarahumara: they'd never forgotten what it felt like to love running. They remembered that running was mankind's first fine art, our original act of inspired creation. Way before we were scratching pictures on caves or beating rhythms on hollow trees, we were perfecting the art of combining our breath and mind and muscles into fluid self-propulsion over wild terrain ... Distance running was revered because it was indispensable; it was the way we survived and thrived and spread across the planet. You ran to eat and to avoid being eaten; you ran to find a mate and impress her, and with her you ran off to start a new life together. You had to love running, or you wouldn't live to love anything else.""The narrative builds to an amazing foot race in the blazing hot Copper Canyons of Mexico, with some top American athletes competing against a group of Tarahumara runners. Friends, I would be lying if I said I made it through that incredible story without getting choked up by the beauty of what happened that day. I could share quotes, but I think you need to read it in context and experience the grit and grace and humanity for yourself. This book was so inspiring that I vowed to make an effort to go running more often. And I shall run with joy and compassion in my heart."
7,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8721294-nicholas-sparks,5,"This has to be one of my favorite books of the last few years. It's non-fiction, but it reads like a thrilling adventure, complete with a high-octane conclusion, all with a bit of science thrown in. It's a fantastic look at the sport of ultra-distance running, but trust me when I say that once you start reading, it's impossible to put down."
8,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"While I am not a runner, I found this book to be quite engaging. I can recommend it to anyone interested in running, indigenous peoples, or wacky characters!This book is about long-distance races over rugged, desert terrain. It is about a hidden tribe, the Tarahumara, who live in the Copper Canyone area of the Sierra Madre, a remote, desert region in Mexico. The tribe is very wary of strangers. They speak their own native language. They live in a rugged, wild country that takes days to reach. Just getting there is dangerous, as it involves evading drug runners and rugged, roadless desert terrain. It is a wonder that the tribe flourishes, because just getting from one village to another requires enormous athleticism and stamina. But this seems to be no problem for the Tarahumara, many of whom are superathletes. They frequently run enormous distances, over 100 miles, without a problem. They don't wear running shoes; they usually wear homemade sandals made of a thin strip of rubber.The main story is about a 50-mile race through Copper Canyon in a heat-scorching sun. Many colorful characters compete in the race. Their attitudes toward life and toward running are fun and often funny. I cannot imagine how some of them could have made it out of the desert alive at all, let alone made it across the finish line. The most surprising part of the book is the description of how high-end running shoes tend to slow runners down and make runners twice as prone to injuries as low-end shoes. Imagine their surprise when Nike employees visited a college track team, and saw that they were practicing barefoot. Running barefoot is less conducive to injuries that top-of-the-line running shoes!The antics of a couple of the characters in the book started to make me feel like this was just a sophomoric book about happy-go-lucky college kids. But there was enough interest in the book to keep me engaged to the very last page.I didn't read this book; I listened to the audiobook version. Fred Sanders is a very good reader, and his accents sounded realistic and help propel the story forward."
9,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"Nearly five years ago I started walking. As I got stronger, I progressed to running. Then came the winter of 2015-2016 when I had a cough that would not let up and consecutive colds. Plus I had a young dog. I went back to walking. Although my hikes were long, it wasn't quite the same and I started to regain the weight I had lost. Two months ago, I decided that enough was enough. If I wanted to avoid buying bigger clothes I would have to do something. Either run and see if that helps, or if that hadn't helped by Christmas, start going to the gym. Horror of horrors for an outdoors person such as myself. I exchanged my walks for interval runs and the effect was immediate. Within two weeks I could button all my blouses again and the black pants I couldn't button I had to wear a belt for. That was really as far as my weight loss scheme went, although I keep an eye on it still. What I discovered too was that rather than taking my usual routes faster, I would simply be out for my usual hour, hour and half - difference being that I covered a lot more ground. I found a world beyond my usual routes. I went up new trails in the woods I knew well. I went further. I discovered that after about ten kilometers, a joy surfaces that I didn't know I could feel. My weekend trail runs are now twenty km - a day. Not because it makes me thin, but because it makes me happy. It's the lull of the rythm while keeping an eye on roots and stones. It's the falling leaves, the landscape, the lakes. Today I came to a lake that had just frozen and frost had blown across the newly formed ice. The trees and moss and grass were white from frost. It was so incredibly beautiful that I teared up with gratitude for being able to be there and see it.This book ""Born to run"" is a fantastic story that confirms what I have discovered. We are, indeed, born to run long distances. It's a story about crazy ultra runners, for whom marathons are too short - they go much further. What they have found is a joy of running. There is also this funny chapter about how shoes have caused so much damage to us. It is better to run with cheap shoes that aren't padded because then the running style - landing on your padded forefoot - is easy on the body. Landing on your heels causes all kinds of problems, whether you are running with air padded shoes or not. I loved this book because it was an affirmation of what I have found on my cross country trails: happiness. "
10,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/671638-sharon,4,"What a weird, wonderful (true!) story. Upon finishing this, I spent the better part of the day on YouTube, looking for any additional information I could find on the Tarahumara tribe, chia seeds, Caballo Blanco, Scott Jurek, Ann Trason, the Leadville Trail Race, running barefoot, persistence hunting, even the author Christopher McDougall. It was everything I didn't know I needed to know about ultra-running, why we run, and the legends in the sport. The novel takes the reader on a wild and random trip, down multiple rabbit-holes, all subjects equally fascinating and Google-worthy. The cast of characters are unforgettable (runners/party animals Jenn Shelton and Billy Barnett—particularly Jenny—were an absolute delight). It culminates in one of the most interesting races I had never heard of.Terrific audiobook. I was sad when it was over.Note: Caballo Blanco passed away in 2012 (this is not mentioned in the book). Rest in Peace. What a beautiful soul. Reports say he was found in a canyon in New Mexico, very close to the way he said he hoped we would pass in the novel."
11,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10273177-suanne-laqueur,5,"I am not a runner. I hate to run. I would rather die than run. I have zero interest in ever becoming a runner. Yet I've read this book three times. It's about so much more than running. It's interesting as hell, funny as fuck, engrossing, fascinating... I will read it again. You could say I will go running back to it. Many times."
12,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1209727-mike,1,"Oh man, did this book stink. In the words of Eric Cartman, ""Goddamn hippies!"" This book was a weird mixup of topics: Mexican-Indian runners, American ultrarunners, humans evolution is based on running, running shoes are bad for you, salad for breakfast is the way to go, Nike is evil, everything in life would be better if we all ran way more, etc... You get the idea. I think I would have liked this book if it had been an history of the Mexican tribal runners. Instead McDougall makes an effort to show how every facet of life is or should revolve around running. Classic case of ""way too immersed in a subject to have any perspective."" Also, the ""hero"" of the book is a guy who spent some time in Boulder (shocking!), gets divorced, drops out of life, moves to Mexico, lives in a hut, runs a lot, and returns to Boulder during the summer to do some ""freelance furniture-moving jobs"" (hilarious description, the author's words) for cash. I was impressed by his ability to organize the race that is the focus of the book, but was so annoyed by the way the author portrayed him as some kind of modern anti-hero who really has life figured out. The last line of the book is his; ""Running should be free, man."" I'm guessing he's really bummed that drugs aren't.I've edited this review several times, because it's gotten way too long.

14,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2882666-dan,3,"A compelling read, brilliant story and fascinating subject matter, but somehow falls short of being a great book.I'm not sure where it goes wrong exactly, but for me it might have been the number of characters which I struggled to keep track of, the slightly preachy tone of the anti-shoe chapters (persuasive though they are) or the negative coverage of apparently less worthy ultra runners who dared to accept sponsorship or promote their own books. None of these, or other faults, completely spoil the experience of discovering the inspiring characters and insights contained within, but they detracted from it a bit for me at least. Despite its faults, I'm pumped up and ready to run having just put the book down. Given that it's midnight and I'm knackered, I think that means it has done something right. The case against overpriced running shoes is also extremely persuasive and has got me thinking about what my first pair of 'barefoot' shoes should be.All in all, well worth reading for the subject matter, but not quite the great book it could have been.

Because if you don't think you were born to run, you're not only denying history. You're denying who you are."" --Born to Run. This book is really, really simple. If you're not a runner, the book will entertain you like the best of any of Krakauer's stories. If you do run, it will change your life. Actually, if you don't run and this book doesn't change your life, something is wrong with you. The ""I can't run because of my knee/back/feet/Achilles tendons/whatever you-fill-in-the-blank"" excuses no longer hold water after you read this book.

16,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,4,"Fascinating tales of super runners, and some of the science of why some humans can do 100 mile running races, and even how we evolved from being a running race.The book starts with an investigation of why ""Up to eight out of every ten runners are hurt every year."", a notion that stands at odds with the fact that some people can run, and even compete in, races that are 26, 50, 100, and even 150 miles long. In particular, there is a race of people in Mexico, the Tarahumara who regularly do runs of those distances, over crazy hard terrain and in crazy hot temperatures. Clearly, these people have figured out how to run without injuring themselves, and how to do it while having FUN! Both of those are key.I'd heard about and read a little about proper running form being to not heel strike, but this put that into a new light. Aside from the Tarahumara running crazy distances in rubber sandals, there was this quote from legendary Stanford running coach Vin Lananna:""Coach Lananna walked over to explain. “I can’t prove this,” he explained, “but I believe when my runners train barefoot, they run faster and suffer fewer injuries.""Between that and the publication of this book, thus began the explosion of barefoot shoes (side note: anyone know how those things are selling these days?). Basically barefoot training forces your feet to land more gently, is how we evolved to run, and mucking with that by putting on big cushioned running shoes is why so many runners get injured. Thanks, Nike. Certainly worth trying.The Running Theory of Evolution was interesting too - what if humans became upright because we had evolved into the ultimate distance running machines, using that for millennia to hunt before we invented tools like the bow and arrow. It is possible to hunt a deer by running it down, but it takes ~4-6 hours - basically, marathon distance - hmmm... Also interesting is that all running animals (cheetah, dogs, horses, etc) can only take one breathe per stride because of the way their lungs work - we humans are the only ones who can take multiple.""Because if David was right, he’d just solved the greatest mystery in human evolution. No one had ever figured out why early humans had separated themselves from all creation by taking their knuckles off the ground and standing up. It was to breathe! To open their throats, swell out their chests, and suck in air better than any other creature on the planet.""So basically, we evolved into a running species and it's in our genes. Not all of us love it anymore because... well we don't need to run to survive anymore. But if you can dig in and discover how to do it properly, you might unlock a love of something that our bodies possibly actually ARE designed to do, despite a lot opinions to the contrary. Some distance runners and endurance athletes do what they do because they are trying to punish some demon inside themselves. But I think that running for the love of it is really the best message this book contains. That's why the Tarahumara have smiles on their faces as they run - something I'm going to keep in mind.""That was the real secret of the Tarahumara: they’d never forgotten what it felt like to love running."""
17,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1674518-laura-avellaneda-cruz,4,"Written in 2015: I read and wrote the review below in 2012. Since then, I've given it some more thought and had a few years now of running in huaraches (when trail conditions permit). My personal, anecdotal experience is that huaraches do make my recurrent ankle pain way less of a problem, and it just feels good. But I wear trails shoes when the trails have lots of little rocks. Also, I am still --and now, more -- annoyed at how little depth we got on the individual people of the Rarámuri, and how much we got of the intolerable Scott Jureck and Barefoot Ted. (Side note: When I went to buy running huaraches online, I considered Luna Sandals, but when I learned that Barefoot Ted, the owner, who learned to make them from Miguel Luna, as we learn in this book, does not share his profits with Miguel Luna or the RarámuI people, I was so pissed. Yay, more white people committing intellectual property theft from indigenous people, profiting off of their traditional knowledge...so I bought Xero Shoes instead, which give 10% of profits to schools in Rarámuri communities) And lastly, read the 1-star review of this book here on GoodReads by Dougal. It's great. It is very carefully researched and thought out so he noticed a lot of inconsistencies that I did not. Anyway, this book still did have a positive influence on my running and I really enjoyed it, so here is my 2012 review...Written in 2012: was spellbound by this book, and it has made me a much better runner. I have a lot of good things to say about why I enjoyed this book and how it is useful, but being the critical social thought major, feminist anti-racist indigenist social worker I am, I also have to share what I didn't like. I'll do that first to get it out of the way so I can return to why I loved it. Critique:Christopher McDougall is an incredibly skillful and beautiful writer, but he has an arrogant voice in much of the book, or at least the first part. It reminded me of Kai (sp?) Risdahl from NPR's Marketplace, who always sounds far too sure of himself. Sort of cocky and masculine and white American in a very un-self aware way. The arrogance faded as McDougall talked more about other people and revealed his own vulnerabilities as a runner and as a man, but some of the voice issues continued to irk me along the way. It was the way he described every running woman with some variation of wispy blond hair streaming off her face and bright blue eyes and gorgeous face... It was the way he didn't talk about his own wife and daughter barely at all (I kept wondering--how does this guy manage to do all this and be a partner and dad? How does his wife feel about him risking his life? I wanted him to address these things as a woman probably would in her book). It was the way he occasionally made casual comments that othered the Tarahumara (or Rarámuri, as they call themselves in their language) people about whom he otherwise wrote with great respect. And I guess I wish he got to know more of the Rarámuri more closely to be able to describe them as the complex individual parents/sons/daughters/farmers/runners/community members they are, in the way that he described so intimately the self-obsessed individual American ultra marathoners and the (in my opinion, quite lovable) gringo-indio, Caballo Blanco. So, I'd love to sit down with McDougall and talk some about gender and race and then send him on his way. Because I enjoyed what he was able to do with this book and I love the way he wrote it, for the most part. So on to that. Love:I love that this is the first book about sports that I've been able to get through and actually care deeply about the final race scene and almost cheer and applaud when the race was won. (I am an athlete, but generally don't like reading about athletics because I find most discussions very one-track-minded. This book, however, wove athletics into a much larger narrative and kept me on the edge of seat.) I loved the way McDougall wove scientific and historical journalism in with storytelling back and forth, back and forth. I loved--and was impacted by--the way he used the stories of The Rarámuri runners and the American and International runners to explore the research on running shoes and how we've been fooled into spending lots of money to get more injuries. I've been running barefoot more and more often these days when I can find the right kind of trails, a sort of return to my childhood, with the hope that this will lessen the likelihood of injury. I loved how he described his own journey to run better and particularly the discussion on form--it has made me far more conscious of my form as I run, and I notice that I too feel lighter and quicker and hurt less as a result. I loved especially how he tied what seems kind of ridiculous--marathon and ultra-marathon running--into a basic need for survival, making the argument, through anthropology and biology and history, that humans evolved to run long distances, to run down and tire out our prey. I love this. This idea in itself rejuvenates me as a runner, as did the engrossing story of the great race in the Barrancas del Cobre (Copper Canyon) of Northern México and all of the stories he shared of the races and runners that made the race possible. I should also note that I read this book as a runner, as someone who works with and for indigenous people, and as someone who was trying to make sense of her experience in las Barrancas del Cobre back in 2002. I was 20 years old and studying Spanish. My parents and sister and I went on a trip to las Barrancas. At the little modest lodge we stayed, they asked a local Rarámuri man named José to guide us on a hike. He took us (cold weather Alaskan athletes) on an 18 mile hike up and down mountains and through farms and yards and mud shacks and corn fields and mountain trails and past one abandoned cave dwelling in the heat of summer. We were hot and exhausted. He was not in the least bit phased. He was wearing cowboy boots and jeans, which, I didn't realize until I read Born to Run, I guess made him quite the assimilated Rarámuri man. I kept returning to those memories as I read this book, trying to piece together my brief experience with what McDougall describes, and with the reality of what narcotraficantes have done to the Barrancas since then. I didn't come out with clear answers, but McDougall's description of the history of the Rarámuri/Tarahumara people and of las Barrancas, and the ways he told his own stories of traveling there and of the race there, did help me make sense of it. In addition to worrying about the narcos and the Tarahuma, there is one thing that is left unsettled for me: I am worried about Jenn, ""la brujita,"" the young party girl utramarathoner from Virginia Beach. I am worried about her drinking and the danger she is in. I came to like her and worry about her, and wonder if McDougall worried too but didn't write it in the book, or didn't notice how unhealthy she was. Will have to research that one on my own. "

Since elementary or let me say since the day I was born, I'm not really into running. I'm weak physically but I can do things simple and I can play table tennis, more than that, I'm like a weakling of our generation. I always ask myself, what does it feels to be running in a field or grass and flowers or in a place where orange sand, cactus and animals that spits poison can be found? Reading books was like running, it was like lifting every pages, every foot stomp on its way to the end or the finish line, waiting for something nice in the end with unexpected journey.While reading Born to Run, your journey and perspective of running will forever be change wanting to be free to all sickness and tragedy of your past. Running infinite; no tracks, no road, no turns. But to continue running horizontally in a black room with sparkling dots and shapes. Ended in a journey with life busted, wanting to do it again and again.My last running experience was when my PE teacher asked us to run in the field for 30 minutes and it was one of the worst thing happened to me. I forgot to bring something important, something I needed most of that time, water. Seriously, if my sister reminded me of bringing some I won't be in the clinic for the whole day. That was the last and the most unforgettable moment these college years. Well, I was hoping for more running experience after reading this book. Hell, if you only read the part were Christopher McDougall explains why human were born to ultra-runners.In our generation most of the time, researchers are now interested in making running as one of the most interesting sports in the world. Using our bare feet to run in the field and how far can it handle? They invented too many shoes to be enjoyed by the consumers; they are well-equipped, well-researched and well-designed for us to enjoy something while running. Not only shoes, sport's scientists also invented something that boost our body while doing exhausting works that are rich with artificial sugars at the same time dangerous and addicting. But how far can these things help us in running? Nobody knows.But when this epic runners goes in public running, underground marathon and all night drinking. This so called new generation of runners were awake of losing their foot from the hands of the tribe that I and all the readers may not know their name before and they were called the Tarahumaras. They are well described as super-athletes Indians that can be found in Mexico, invented a liquid that can boost their body capacity at the same time running without shoes. Imagine, scientists doing preliminary examinations and research for year that cost thousands that only give us limited results and sometimes failed us.This super-athletes that we are looking for are waiting for us to discover them but the most important is, are this endangered runners are worth losing in the end? Christopher Mcdougall, entrails his readers to go run for their freedom to discover things far from what been expected. Natural science is worth discovering at the same time knowing ourselves and our history for us to discover things that God given us in the beginning.

Is that a violin or a somehow related to it? I can't believe Tarahumaras wear clothes I thought they were naked and wearing short skirt. I can't believe it, I was imagining those things until I finish reading the book. The Rarámuri or Tarahumara are an indigenous people of northern Mexico who are renowned for their long-distance running ability. - Wikipedia

"
19,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/764994-rick,2,"McDougall is a journalist, a former war correspondent and current feature writer on extreme sports, like ultra-marathons. Born to Run has the virtues and faults of feature magazine writing, particularly when articles are either exploded to book length or several with thematic links are knitted together to comprise a single book. The book is by turns fascinating and aggravating. Part of the problem is McDougall’s tendency to hyperbole, which given the dramatic nature of the potential consequences to running 100 miles in a desert or the drama that should be inherent in top competitors racing each other in circumstance of high risk or landscape changes in evolutionary understanding, is a technique that seems not just unnecessary but undermining. Everyone can’t be the greatest, the toughest, the fastest. Every circumstance can’t be life-changing, world shattering, life or death. Instead of a journalist he comes across as a marketing man.Another part of the problem is McDougall has a school yard bully approach to storytelling—he uses the story-teller’s long arm advantage over the reader (he knows what’s coming; we’re reading to find out) to hold us at a distance, while he taunts with digressions, sidebars, and postponed payoffs, we swing away at the pages not getting where we want to get. The description of a Leadville ultra-marathon race that took place some years before the main events of the book goes on and on and several times I nearly went to the internet to find out the result because I was tired of flailing away while McDougall kept me waiting to indulge his sense of narrative fun. But there is fascinating stuff, often engrossingly told, about the Tarahumara, a remote tribe of Native Americans in Mexico who are capable of running non-stop and never are injured; about how running shoes contribute to running injuries, about how world-class ultra-marathon races are competitively coed, and about the theory that lends itself to the book’s title, that humans evolved to run, contrary to what most experts claim. So there is enough here to keep most readers going who are interested in running (my fiancée, who is not interested in running but was interested in the Tarahumara gave up half-way through the book) and this kind of pop-journalism. I liked what I learned but didn’t enjoy the learning all that much."
20,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2448436-andy-miller,5,"My only complaint was that the book was too short, or that it was so interesting and well written that I read it too fast or that I liked the characters so much that I wanted to go out for a run and have a beer with themBook is written by a runner whose legs are beat up and told he shouldn't run anymore. He researchs alternatives and learns about the Tahahumara Indians who live in the remote and inaccessible copper canyon in Mexico.One of my favorite chapters was about the year a few of the Tahahumara came north to run the Ledville 100. I won't tell who won, I was in more suspense in reading that chapter than I have been watching any game on tv.But the author also talks about running in general. Thoughts like allowing long distance runners to go pro was the worst thing for American runners, it caused American marathon times to get much slower due to sponsor concerns about shoes, mileage, coaching etc..on Bill Bowerman and whether he was disillusioned at the end of the life with changes he wrought with Nike, coaching tips, the effect of expensive running shoes(the stanford cross country coach won't allow his runners to wear expensive shoes--and there's studies that back him upBut it is the author's trip to Copper Canyon that is the highlight. And the last chapters that describe the American elite ultra runners going down to Copper Canyon for a race against the Tahumura on their own turf--with no media coverage, no real prize money, no ego, well, it was great. Absolutely great.THIS IS A GREAT READ!!"
21,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32669562-thomas-str-mquist,0,"DNF at about 10 %I'm actually happy to finally giving in to the nagging and trying this book. Because, really, who does not enjoy being able to honestly say ""told you so"" once in a while?McDougall is a snake oil salesman, with all the expressions and vocabulary of his trade. I did endure a minute or so of one of his ""lectures"" on YouTube and boy did his writing fall right into place! Uninformed, argumentative and unscientific bull about the simple task if running. My fear is that he hurt people who could have been happily jogging along now, my hope is that he inspired someone who since have figured it out...This seems to be the kind of book to either get a ""1"" or a ""5"". I know lots of people ignore the ""hated it"" ones and therefore it is most likely that my review is going to be buried in the small pool of critics of this one. I could really not give another opinion, though; first, I lasted about 25 pages and second, they were crap. "
22,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2447803-jason,4,"Born to Run is one of the most compelling books I've read in the last few years. And without a doubt, chapter 28 is THE most compelling 30 pages of non-fiction I've read in 8 years.I'm not a runner. But reading this book dumped the same endorphins into my veins that marathoners get at mile 24, leaving me with a runner's 'high.' It also left me with a nasty distaste of athletic shoe companies for wielding the biggest scam in the market bonanza of athletic shoe sales since Nike glued rubber and foam to canvas.McDougall's absolute bottom line thesis is that running has become worse over the years. This, despite technological advances to enhance the science of long distance running (studies about form, ergometrics, anatomy, physiology, diet, gear, psyche, and training for altitude, endurance, speed, pace and incline). Injuries have increased. Speed has decreased. Form has worsened. Pleasure has declined. Running has become more and more foreign to how our bodies actually want to move along the ground.The author illustrates his thesis from several angles. He plows into scientific data. He introduces some of the most eccentric, yet successful ultra-distance runners in America. He describes the sudden, recent spike in global ultra marathons. He digs into the most recent--and most explosive--anthropological data. He reveals evolutionary trends. He explains how different cultures think about distance running. He ruminates about his own long discouraging experience with running. He uncovers stories from the past about runners and their techniques. Ultimately though, he underscores the entire book with his exploration of the mythic aura about a Native American Indian tribe called the Tarahumara whose members easily run hundreds of miles at a time in the Copper Canyons of central Mexico.A special shout-out to Chapter 28. Why and how did homo sapiens evolve away from chimpanzees and bypass Australopithecus and Neanderthals to exist on earth as the prolific human plague we are today? Early homo sapiens, with their weak, slender, hairless body frames couldn't compete with the strength of chimps and apes. They couldn't compete with the weathered compactness of Neanderthals and Cro-Magnon Man. They weren't fast enough to hunt, and not yet smart enough for tools. They couldn't cultivate, couldn't farm. They were not omnivores; they definitely needed animal protein. What was our advantage 2 million years ago against our potential prey? What? What was the advantage, beginning eons ago, that carried forward until about 1970 when Nike starting making--specifically--running shoes?***SPOILER ALERT***It was our freakin' endurance, man. We're the only mammal on earth whose respiration is not anatomically locked into a 1:1 ratio with our stride. We have stamina that lasts 40-60 miles, and there isn't an animal in Africa that can outlast a sprawling cordon of homo sapiens running like a curtain across the Serengeti. Humans can outrun any horse on the planet in 50 miles. As a tribe, homo sapiens can certainly outlast a gazelle, a cape water buffalo, a zebra, a dik-dik, a wildebeest. It may take 16 hours and end up on another watershed area, but that tribe will most definitely eat meat tonight. Simply cut a herd animal out of the pack, and run it into the ground. Man hits his running peak at age 27. But he's physiologically equal at age 19 and 61, so there's a long taper off period after man hits his peak. Man; woman; child; old or young; the tribe would set off after the runners, eventually meeting the kill and regrouping until the meat was gone. I'll be damn, huh?***END SPOILER ALERT*** Most primitive people around the world today run long distances barefooted, with less running injuries than suburban American richies. The human foot is an anatomical arch, and the angles at the ankle, knee and hip act as perfect dampeners to a mid-foot strike. Nike has added the gel, absorbers, padding and the arch support to encourage a heel-strike: viola...plantar fascitits, heel spurs, restricted pronation and supination, shin splints, and torn achilles tendon. Comfortable shoes--my God, man!--have turned us into runners with perverted form, causing inevitable problems with our lower backs, and hamstrings, and toenails, and knee and hip inflammation.  The Tarahumara Indians have never purposely trained for ultra marathons, yet in 1986 they were yanked out of obscurity by a running promoter and beat all the world's best athletes at the Leadville 100-Miler, run exclulsively at 9,000-12,000 feet in altitude. They ran in sandles. They returned to obscurity and never came back. Why? Read the book. A bit about the writing. Christopher McDougall writes like Jon Krakauer. He doesn't overload the science. There's a human story here, and he purposefully stays away from being too academic. There's also momentum in the story, and a bit of mystery the reader must unravel. Overall, though, I could only award 4-stars because I think he avoided hard science to the book's detriment. I'm as much a non-fiction reader as a fiction reader, and this book screams out to be more heavily laden with pure science. There were no pictures, graphs, industry numbers, personal interviews, footnotes to academic works, or anatomical plates in a story that certainly warranted more than the written word. In the end Born to Run left me just short of a sui generis work of revealing, compelling science."
23,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9573719-lisa-dunckley,5,"Born To Run is a fascinating book. As always, I love books where the author presents new information in an engaging fashion!! The interwoven themes include:1) The history of Ultra-Marathons and the Ultra-Runners who compete in them. Ultra-Marathons are any races longer than a regular marathon (just over 26 miles). Most of them are 50km, 100km, 50 miles, or 100 miles (although they can be much longer). The marathoners themselves are...insane—I mean, incredible, athletes. There's Ann, for example, a short, slender, community college teacher, who was the female champion of the Western States 100 FOURTEEN TIMES, and during one fun four year stretch, she ran an ultramarathon every other month. Yet she seemed to get stronger and faster the more she ran. Why doesn't she get injuries, like most runners do?2) The Tarahumara Indians from Mexico have this inexplicable ability to run hundreds of miles without becoming exhausted, and to do it constantly without any running injuries. Oh, and while barefoot or wearing homemade sandals, not fancy running shoes. 3) Why do all (normal) runners have such a huge percentage of running related injuries? Roughly 8 out of 10 runners are injured EVERY YEAR! Injuries are increasing, marathon times are not. What the heck are we doing wrong??4) The Leadville Trail 100, which is one of the scariest races imaginable. It's the highest altitude city in North America, and one of the coldest. So it's perfect for a 100 mile race. Especially when the starting line is twice as high as the altitude where airplanes pressurize their cabins, and it only goes up from there.5) Are humans designed to run without shoes, and is all our technology and sophisticated gear making things worse? Is there biological and evolutionary evidence that we were originally engineered to run? Or is that completely wrong?There are multiple ultra-marathoners and multiple (horrifying sounding) ultra races compared in here. The evolution stuff was especially interesting. The entire book was really fascinating—since I find running in general to be downright boring! So if I find a book about running to be THIS entertaining, then the author did a great job!!Recommend to anyone who runs, or anyone who is a fan of learning interesting random things (like me)!!"
24,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29075798-adam,5,"Review of the audiobook narrated by Fred Sanders.Running has been a constant and positive part of my life for more than 10 years now, so much so that I'm surprised I've never actually read a book about running. This book is for anyone truly serious about running or interested in the science of running. We are given a brief history of ultra running and the genesis of the running shoe industry along with an anthropological analysis of why humans are genetically inclined to run long distances. I was fascinated throughout, especially with the science aspects.I did some adventure racing in the late 2000's, with races being 6 hours, 12 hours and even one 24 hour race. It was more of a team fun thing (3 of us kayaking, mountain biking, trail running and orienteering) and not a push your body to the limit race like an ultra. It definitely gives me an appreciation of long distance runners and the work that they put into it, but I also think you have to be a little crazy to run an ultra-length race. This book does glorify the long distance aspect of running, where if you can't understand or appreciate why someone would want to run marathon distance (or longer) races it may take away from your enjoyment of the book.The anthropological evidence put forth in the book is extremely compelling. While I really liked the entire book, that was definitely my favorite part of the book. I can't say I was 100% convinced as there is so much we cannot know about our prehistoric ancestors, but it definitely gave me a lot to think about.Fred Sanders does a great job with the narration. There was much more dialog in this book than other nonfiction books I've listened to and he was consistently good throughout - definitely with his Spanish pronunciation.Final verdict: 5 star story, 4.5 star narration, 5 stars overall"
25,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-reader,5,"My running club recommended this read and I'm so glad that they did. It was informative, entertaining, and inspirational. Not only did it make me want to be a better runner, Born to Run left me with the feeling that it is mankind's destiny to be runners. Some bits that I want to remember:The author was getting running lessons from a mysterious ultra marathon runner in Mexico:  ""Think easy, light, smooth, and fast. You start with easy, because if that's all you get, that's not so bad. Then work on light. Make it effortless, like you don't give a **** how high the hill is or how far you've got to go. When you've practiced that so long that you forget you're practicing, you work on making it smooooooth. You won't have to worry about the last one- you get those three, and you'll be fast."" pg 111On the perfect design of the foot for running: ""Your foot's centerpiece is the arch, the greatest weight-bearing design ever created. The beauty of any arch is the way it gets stronger under stress; the harder you push down, the tighter its parts mesh. No stonemason worth his trowel would ever stick a support under an arch; push up from underneath, and you weaken the whole structure."" pg 176If you enjoyed Born to Run, you may also want to read Explorers of the Infinite: The Secret Spiritual Lives of Extreme Athletes--and What They Reveal About Near-Death Experiences, Psychic Communication, and Touching the Beyond by Maria Coffey or McDougall has a new book out called Natural Born Heroes: How a Daring Band of Misfits Mastered the Lost Secrets of Strength and Endurance which I haven't read yet, but if it's anything like this book, it's worth the read."
26,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/939615-karen,2,"Interesting, but ultimately unsatisfying. The author writes from a ""seller"" perspective--he's trying to drum up business for his writing. There were several points in the book where I was completely convinced he was going to tell me to purchase Tahitian Noni drinks, or other nonsense. The story felt very sensationalized and pick-and-choose for the points that will help the book. Yes, he gave us several examples, but many times the examples seemed contradictory--the Tarahumara eat only a diet of XYZ, but then later here they are eating ABC, too. Running shoes wreck your feet/body, but even some of the extremist runners do fine with them. It is interesting to consider what will happen with running shoes in the future. I'm not ready to chuck my Asics--even recently I've noticed that when I walk around for several miles in flip-flops, my left heel absolutely kills. I throw on my Asics and voila! Pain gone, comfort back. I'm more of a mainstreamer and less of an innovator, so I'm not ready to run like Barefoot Ted."

You need to read this book. What if I told you that elite athletes can run for 100 miles at a time? How about the fact that an average runner could beat an average horse in a distance race. Not only that they can, but they do, every year. Or that a human being is so effectively constructed for long distance running, that it is possible for a human hunter to  literally run down an antelope, exhausting his prey,and outlasting it. While most animals are faster than humans in quick bursts, few if any can out run us for the long haul. Intrigued yet? This book has everything going for it. Dangerous drug mafiosos. Serious journalism. A mystery tribe from Mexico. And a cast of characters that looks like it was drawn for the Wacky Racers cartoon show. I run, but I don't consider myself a serious runner. I loved everything about this book from McDoughal's tasty prose to his self-depreciating humor. It's been a long time since I've walked away from a book learning as much genuinely new information as I have here. Some of the material is already a little dated, (the Five Finger Shoe guys have come under some scrutiny recently for instance among other things) but none of these even slightly deterrs from the overall punch of the book. Go buy this book. Borrow it from a library. Steal it from the rotting shell of a bombed out Barnes & Nobel Bookstore. I don't care. Just read it. Then go run. http://joshuarigsby.com"
28,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1317553-julesq,4,"My four-star rating is actually a 7 on a 10-point scale, which is the composite score from my three ratings of it, my rating as an aspiring runner, its rating as a story, and its rating as journalism/non-fiction.As a runner, I give this book a solid 10. By the end of it I was so inspired about running that I wanted to just go and run 50 miles right out the gate. I'm not even kidding (however, I thought better of that and decided to stick to my 3-mile jaunts). So, way to be super inspiring, Born to Run!As a story, the book gets a nine. If this book had been billed as a novel it would have gotten really high marks. I was totally engaged in the characters, rooting for every one, loving the drama. I thought the story background chapters were well mixed into the story-propelling chapters. And the writing was clear, well paced, and fun.However, this book doesn't bill itself as a novel, it bills itself as non-fiction, and it kind of sucks at that. Like I can only give it a two, and only that high because McDougall is a journalist, and so I forgive him for not sourcing primary material like interviews and first-hand accounts. Unfortunately, there's a LOT of material in the book that isn't primary material and there were too many times when McDougall would claim something, and I would respond ""Says who?"" or ""according to what?"" The lack of sourcing and notes made me question the validity of many of his claims. Seriously, all I would have needed was a footnote, but there were none and so I'm concerned the foundation of the book is based on shoddy research or word of mouth.So, sorry Chris, I couldn't give your book a higher score because you tried to claim it was non-fiction, but then I couldn't prove that. "
29,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10386400-ryan-holiday,5,"I have a bad habit where I put off reading a book if I hear it recommended too many times. It stems from being underwhelmed by the flavor of the week long read (normally The New Yorker) or whatever blogs seem to be passing around and splooging all over. In the case of Born to Run, I made a mistake and I wish I'd read it sooner. No question it had plenty of the cringe-worthy moments I was reticent about, but it's worth reading anyway. Like The Tiger by John Valliant, there is a shocking amount of applicable and interesting evolutionary science in here, and from what I know it's all pretty legit.For a non-fiction book about running, it's very readable and interesting enough to keep you going even if you are not a runner. This is also its weakness; you can tell the writer's background as a magazine writer resigns him to a sort of pull-quote mentality and all the other obnoxious tricks that magazines employ. The idea that we evolved to run long distance (as opposed to only sprinting when fleeing predators) is something that I don't think has been properly accounted for in paleo-communities. Persistance hunting, for example, is something he discusses well in this book. That Taleb and others advocate only walking and never distance running has not sat well with me-they've never felt the accomplishment of slowly seeing your endurance grow; the rhythm your feet, lungs, music and heartbeat fall into on a long run; the commitment it takes to hit a goal day in and day out. This book is about those things and how deeply rooted they are in us. And how, ironically, the industry that surrounds running has done its best to destroy and undermine those feelings."
30,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/236411-steve,4,"This reminded me of one of those great human interest stories you might have stumbled upon in Sports Illustrated back in its heyday. The personalities were interesting, the pace was good, and the fact that it’s a fringe sport made it all the more fascinating. Hundred mile ultras at altitude are bound to attract an odd cast of characters. To the preternaturally persistent nut cases on the US side add a remote tribe of corn beer-quaffing, peace-loving, super runners from the Copper Canyons of Mexico and you’ve got the makings of a tasty ragout. And McDougall sold it well. He may have over-emphasized whole sub-cult of shoelessness, though he was great at setting the stage for the big race at the end. It seemed like he ran out of steam as he recounted the long journey through the canyons, but the lead-up was told in such a crisp and colorful way that all is forgiven. Besides, McDougall was one of the runners himself, so he had an excuse for the narrative bonk."
31,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3296078-brooke,5,"This book was so awesome that it almost made me want look at running as something other than torture, and then once I could do that, to start running for fun. Almost.There are a lot of derails (or seeming derails) in this book. So the continuity of the story gets lost semi-regularly. However, the derails are always interesting material, and almost always tie back into the overarching story really well in the end. "
32,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5477574-virgilio-pigliucci,5,"During my last interview at Goodreads I had the pleasure of meeting Otis via Skype.... and when He asked what my favorite read was I said: Born To Run.This should be enough to explain my enthusiasm for this book but here it comes my review.The very beginning of the book might be a bit confusing, the narrative is pretty scattered and for an avid Triathlete/Runner that I am It did not sound as fun to read.After the first chapters though the book picks you up in a journey of adventure, learning and discovery of topics like running, evolution and a possible new running technique that will leave you breathless. Even though I have been a runner my whole life and some of the insights about the mid-foot strike were not new to me, there were a ton of interesting stories of researchers that worked and discovered how we were literally born to run.Right after I was done with the book I went running barefoot for 1 hour and almost injured myself. After a couple years though I built tolerance to it and now most of my slow recovery runs are with minimalistic shoes to remind myself how our body is meant to be used!December 2nd I am running the North Face 50K trail run :-)"
33,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37640114-emma-scott,5,"This book is so much more than a story about a race. It’s spiritual, heartwarming, with a vein of human compassion running straight through it and that is the real plot of the book. I think too often we are told we have limitations and, even more often than that, we believe them. Knowing that we are stronger and more resilient than the thoughts in our head tell us we are (or that society lures is into believing) is the first step towards health. Reading this book is a good place to start changing that mental negativity and rediscovering our own power, along with the lesson that power does not mean conquer. Compassion and kindness and taking care of our bodies are the ancient, forgotten keys to happiness. Simple as that.And it’s entertaining as hell to boot. 😊"
34,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3701960-lisa,1,"I've heard so many great things about this book, but I wasn't a fan. If it weren't for all of the good reviews I would have stopped reading after a couple of chapters (and I'm still not sure it was worth the time to finish). Parts of the story are really interesting, but most parts are overshadowed by the author's voice. McDougall is extremely hyperbolic and overly dramatic from the beginning, which heavily damages his credibility. The best example of this might be how he spends one portion of the book going vegetarian because he believes that will make him more healthier and that it's how humans were meant to eat, and another chapter where he argues that humans were meant to be long distance runners because that's how hunters managed to kill big game until decent weapons were invented a few millenia later. Well, which is it? If we have great running skills for the purposes of eating meat on occasion, it seems that would also suggest that humans are also probably intended to actually be able to eat that meat on occasion. (Not surprisingly, this seems to conform with what we know about the average diet: most people benefit from meat but in moderation rather than the overly large quantities consumed in modern society.)The stuff on barefoot running mostly struck me as unsubstantiated here, which is a shame because there are countless numbers of good articles that support the science. McDougall's statistics on the number of runners supposedly injured every year is clearly exaggerated, and it goes without saying that some injuries (like muscle strains) have nothing to do with footwear and everything to do with other factors, like overtraining. Form is also important, but good form can be achieved regardless of footwear. If he had wanted to make a more convincing argument that runners would be better suited by using minimalist footwear, McDougall would have done better to have stuck to the facts and stop issuing pronouncements about how anyone running in stability shoes (like I do), will *definitely* be injured as a result at some point. (For the record: I've been running 10 years in stability shoes with no injuries. According to McDougall, that makes me a freak of nature--which I'd almost buy if most of my running friends weren't also wearing shoes and avoiding injury.) I'm not opposed to the minimalist movement but all he has done here is romanticize it while demonizing anyone who isn't a follower and the shoes they wear.Finally, the author's tone grated on my nerves. Besides the constant exaggeration and glossing over of facts, his language is often more vulgar than necessary and he seems shockingly condescending to many of the others profiled throughout the book. There are some orientalist issues with his portrayal of the Tarahumara (Rarámuri) and other ethnic groups whose running skills he praises, and there's a tendency for the story to jump from one topic to another, perhaps in an effort to change the topic before the reader starts asking the obvious questions about what his romanticized portrayal of these groups has left out."
35,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30911-todd-johnson,3,"This book got meh-to-negative reviews from multiple friends of mine. But it also got raves from some people, and it's a phenomenon, and I have Audible credits to burn, so I ""read"" it.The narrative bits are entertaining. When he as a series of events that he witnessed to recount, McDougall is a second-rate Krakauer and it works just fine. I burned through all 11 hours of the book in a work week, because the stories are compelling. Whenever McDougall has ""ideas"" to talk about, the book is really bad. Chapter Two stands out as fascinatingly bad. Here is a chunk that I found quoted approvingly several times on the internet: Three times, America has seen distance-running skyrocket, and it’s always in the midst of a national crisis. The first boom came during the Great Depression, when more than two hundred runners set the trend by racing forty miles a day across the country in the Great American Footrace. Running then went dormant, only to catch fire again in the early ’70s, when we were struggling to recover from Vietnam, the Cold War, race riots, a criminal president, and the murders of three beloved leaders. And the third distance boom? One year after the September 11 attacks, trail-running suddenly became the fastest-growing outdoor sport in the country. This drove me crazy while I was hearing it. It's so bad that it would embarrass even Malcolm Gladwell. (zing! lolz.) First of all, there's no clear notion of what it means for distance running to skyrocket, how that was measured or how it was decided that these were the times it had occurred. ""Trail running is growing"" and ""some people ran across the country"" seem like arbitrary selections; what about ""marathon entrance per capita"" or something as a measure? Secondly, it seems like these ""crises"" were cherry-picked to fit these weird ""booms."" Why wasn't running popular *during* the Vietnam War, or WWII even? Were the 70s really so bad, or is that just a hodgepodge of unrelated cultural misfortunes? What's really frustrating about this is that it's wholly unnecessary. You could have this whole book without this shitty paragraph and none of the impact or meaning would be lost. It's a throwaway, but because it's so awful it undermines McDougall's credibility as a person who can form or evaluate ideas, reformulate them for consumption, and present them to you. You add to this a weird mix of magical thinking (""the wisest people on earth"") and creepy racism (""the men of this culture wouldn't have sex with their wives if not for alcohol"") concerning the Tarahumara and whole swaths of this book are just not good. The barefoot running proselytization is also somewhat wearying, even though I sort of buy parts of it and already run in ""minimalist"" shoes. The ""evolved to run"" parts are probably the best-handled ""ideas"" in the book, and even that part isn't nearly as conclusive as McDougall would like it to seem. Nonetheless, I can't go lower than three stars because I was engrossed and mostly entertained. "
36,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52500467-whatireallyread,3,"I picked this up because my husband got really into running, and since I've heard a lot about the health dangers of this sport, I decided to find out more about it.WHAT I LIKEDThe book dives into a world of ultra-marathon runners. And man! these people are seriously hardcore. They go on 100-mile races in the desert (where their shoes sometimes melt off), in the mountains (where the air is thin), on up and down rocky tracks, at night, while breastfeeding, while being barefoot, while racing against horses, you name it. And a lot of the athletes setting the records are over 40, some even over 60 years old. It's a whole new world.  I never realised it existed. Granted, some of these people sounded somewhat crazy, tbh, but fascinating nonetheless.Towards the end of the book, the author got into the anthropological account of running in the history of human species and how human running is different from the way animals run and the consequences of such differences. I'm into this stuff. The theories and facts and research he mentioned were really cool.The author mentioned some helpful tips and things to look out for (as in - the way to pick out running shoes, the correct way to put your feet down while running) which I think were great and useful.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKEWhile I felt like the research was cool, my hands itched to double-check the science behind this, because somehow the book felt self-congratulatory and biased sometimes. At least the author was upfront about the fact that the scientist conducting the research was a hardcore marathoner himself. No wonder he spent decades trying to prove running was an integral part of Homo Sapiens becoming the dominant species on Earth. Sometimes things written in this book felt too crazy and/or biased and made trust the author less.A very large portion of this book felt like reading sports commentary. You know, just a loooong, very detailed account of one race and then another race. Jim was in the lead, then Ben got ahead, the Jim caught up with him and they ran side by side for a mile, etc.etc. It was boring to me. I never watch any kind of sports matches/races, but reading them like this has even less of an appeal. Maybe running fans would find it interesting? In any case, the book was pretty good. It made me go on a run with my husband even. Although running is too generous of a word for what I did:"
37,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/738118-annie,3,"I have reached a point in my life where I can say that I actually like running. Some days, I even LOVE it. This book is filled with colorful characters, races, and topics surrounding this activity. A journalist begins running and is plagued with some running injuries. After being told by two sports medicine doctors that his best option would be to quit, Christopher McDougall stubbornly chooses another path. He tries to find the Tarahumura, a super-secret hidden tribe in the Copper Canyons of Mexico, who are so skilled at running they sometimes run for three days straight just for fun. The Tarahumara also don't wear anything close to resembling our modern day technological running shoes. Yet, the incidence of running injuries is incredibly low. As McDougall discovers there are a few people who run like the Tarahumara run in the US. Soon, with the help of Caballo Blanco, a white man living among the Tarahumara, the author finds himself involved in one of the most intense races between the ultra runners of the world on an incredibly difficult course. The book had a lot of interesting information. McDougall makes a case for barefoot running and argues that the modern shoe causes a lot of problems for runners. I liked reading about the different races and couldn't believe how intense some of them were. Guess I can't really complain about running 3 miles when people run 100 miles in the Death Valley heat. Amazing. I didn't like how unorganized the book was. I felt the author jumped around so much, introduced some pointless characters and delved into side topics (like arguing we evolved into the humans we are and survived because of running) that took away from the thrill of the story and just made it a choppy read. Overall, though, it was interesting and I spent time looking stuff up on the internet because of the book. Anytime a desire is created for more information by a book's topic, I'd say it was a good read. Who knows-I might even try out barefoot running up and down my driveway. "
38,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish,4,"Bleedin' great readin'. I guess the big thing about this book is that it doesn't matter if you run or not--it's still fascinating. I mean, especially if you don't run, you probably never hear of the Leadville 100, a 100-mile race through the mountains in Colorado. It's interesting to know about it, but then you add the characters that participate in it. It's a scream. Literally.I missed my subway stops on Chapter 28, which is about the evolutionary science behind long distance running and why some animals do better than others. Now, you may think, how interesting can this be? Try it and see for yourself. The part about training in the Kalahari with the Bushmen had me enthralled. I am not a runner, but I wish I was after this. In fact, I may just try it again, especially after knowing I don't have to be able to afford those expensive shoes. I do think there are some among us that are 'built' for running and the rest of us may be built for some other kind of sport, but there usually running can be incorporated into the cross training. The final race is a vision: 100 degrees in the shade, 6000 foot peaks, the Tarahumara with their white, embroidered skirts, the ""pretty little witch"", big-mouth Ted with his green, toed socks, and a Mexican town dressed to party...it's engrossing.

The first time was pretty much around the whole barefoot and trail running hype. Doing it now that the hype has settled a bit, you look at things slightly different.There is a bit of story, a bit of competition, a bit of perseverance and some history (whether accurate or not).I did like the South African references to the Comrades, runners, and the Kalahari bushmen.The story jumps around a bit, but you seem to get into where they are again quite easily.Please don't start Ultra Trail running without shoes at the back of this book. You will die."

A friend recommended this book to me because I was interested in taking up jogging since I felt I wasn't being active enough. I never would have thought a book on running would be so interesting, but that's exactly what it turned out to be; inspirational, motivational and educational. I enjoyed reading about the different personalities in the book, especially Emil Zapotek and Caballo Blanco. A must read!"
41,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51069187-marie,4,"“You don’t stop running because you get old, you get old because you stop running”This book is an insightful, fascinating and inspirational look into the world of long distance running. There is a group of people, known as the Tarahumara, who live in the cliff sides of Copper Canyon in Mexico. This is a lawless area where Tarahumara enjoy relative isolation. The only other people who spend time in this area are the drug lords. The Tarahumara run long distances as part of their culture and tradition. They are a peaceful people who enjoy longevity and a life without crime or mental illness. They are mistrusting of the outside world, as in the past they have been exploited, enslaved and even decapitated. They eat a diet composed mostly of corn and corn beer. This novel seeks to understand the world of ultra marathoners, both of those who run as part of their culture in the case of the Tarahumara and those who are drawn to it despite their culture.I always felt that running great distances was a detriment to one’s health, that running should be done in moderation so as not to wear out one’s body. However, this book changed my thinking. The feats that the runners in this book were capable of was awe inspiring. This book makes the reader believe and understand that we were made to run, we should run and furthermore, that running should be enjoyable.A group of researchers back in the 1980s came to the realization that human beings were not evolved to be walkers like their closest relative, the chimpanzee. Human beings were evolved to be runners, to track their prey over long distances. This is why humans have nuchal ligaments, achilles tendons, an amazing foot structure, a stride greater than a horse’s, and a pattern of respiration that is not fixed to their stride. The injuries we see now from running did not exist prior to the advent of the modern running shoe. With the modern running shoe, feet become weaker. With the modern running shoe, pain signals are not sent to the brain to indicate improper form. Thus, poor form and injuries result. The modern day running shoe has led to an increase in heart disease, knee replacements, and more sedentary lifestyles. If we trained and ran more like our ancestors we would be much healthier and happier.Listening to this audio book, I was enthralled by the stories, especially of the races. Who knew that telling of an account of a 100 mile race could be so riveting and exciting? Not I. At least, not until I listened to the tales of the races in this book, including Leadville races and the ultimate race in Copper Canyons. This is one sport where women can excel and often prevail over the men. Consider this statistic: 90% of females finish ultra marathons, while only 50% of the men do. There is great psychology involved in these races according to the author. The racers often think of themselves as hunter or prey in order to motivate themselves. In the case of the Tarahumara, there is the joy of sharing a tradition, running together as a people. It is “character” that the author concludes makes a truly great runner. Scott Jurek was able to find his tribe wherever he went, transcending cultures and communities, always demonstrating tremendous character.There was were amazing pearls of advice streaming throughout this novel. I was mentally storing those I thought would be important for myself and will share some of them here. Stretching leads to more injuries. It is best to skip it. The more cushioned the sneakers, the more likely they will lead to injury. If you are running in a cushioned sneaker, try to add in some barefoot runs in dewy grass. If you start running long distances, diet should come about naturally to aid the running lifestyle. A nutrient rich vegan diet is best for a leaner, healthier body. In the beginning, especially if you are looking to take off some weight, you should run below the aerobic threshold, in the fat-burning zone. Building up endurance in this zone will make you stronger on longer runs. The best form when running is to run with a short stride and quick foot turnover. You should feel as if you have a rope tied around your middle and you are pulling something heavy. Being a good person, it seems makes you a better runner. Improving personal relationships and practicing abundance by giving back are pieces of advice given by running coaches. Vigil, a long time running coach, also advises “ask nothing from your running and you’ll get more than you ever imagined.”The Tarahumara, a culture of the greatest runners on earth share the following core virtues: patience, strength, dedication, persistence and cooperation. Other great runners seem to share these same characteristics, bringing them together in a beautiful community. The Tarahumara is perhaps the last remaining culture on earth that still incorporates long distance running into their life and culture. They reap the benefits in health, community and joyfulness. As scientists have discovered, we were evolved to be runners. As Dr. Bramble puts it, “Just move your legs. Because if you don’t think you were born to run, you’re not only denying history. You’re denying who you are.”This book convinced me that “running is our superpower, entrenched in the human imagination.” I have already started to run more because of this book. I am trying not to be obsessed with heart rate and pace, but to enjoy the meditative aspects of it more. I highly recommend this book to everyone who runs or is even thinking about running."
42,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4751040-youlia,4,Obviously went out and had my longest run of 2019 after finishing this book 🏃🏻‍♀️🙌🏻
43,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4123952-alasse,5,"I'm having a really hard time finding the words for this review.I think I should start by saying I don't do ""inspiring"" books, or sports movies of any kind. I think it's because of the same reason I never give pep talks to patients. I find it sounds corny and fake, and it reeks of self-importance. Which is probably the reason I connected with this book on such a deep level.After injuring himself repeatedly while running, Christopher McDougall did some research and heard about the Tarahumara, a lost tribe in the Mexican Barrancas del Cobre, who happen to be the world's greatest athletes - they run up to 200 miles in the blistering heat, in handmade sandals, just for fun. He decided to track them down, and eventually was able to contact Caballo Blanco, a mysterious American who has lived among the Tarahumara for years. This ends up leading to a 50-mile race along the Copper Canyons, populated by a band of distance runners so wacky and diverse it seems too good to be true.Now, this is how the book has been marketed, and that's what happens in it, mostly. But the whole ""gonzo reporter finds lost tribe of superrunners and learns their secrets"" scenario leaves out the fact that ultrarunning is, actually, a legitimate sport. Well, it's not exactly popular or respected, but it's definitely a thing, even beyond Tarahumara borders. This means that, almost from the beginning, McDougall sets out on a series of apparent detours. The Tarahumara storyline is abandoned for a good part of the book, and instead what ensues is a multilayered, panoramic view on everything surrounding running - the stories of the people who would go on to participate in the Copper Canyon Ultramarathon are intertwined with chapters on vegan diet, evil shoe companies and evolutionary biology.But the most important thing about it (or, at least, what really makes this book different and real) is that it all happens on the outskirts of the official sports scene. These supermen are the underdogs. There's a feeling of purity and amateurishness to it all, like these people have no expectations put on them, no sponsors, no inherited knowledge to accept or question. They've invented a sport from scratch, and only now are they realizing they're in fact rediscovering a long lost art.What I mean is, Born to Run reads more like a runner's personal journey of discovery than it does like, say, a special issue of Runner's World. It isn't a testosterone packed instructional book, but a heartfelt ode to endurance and zen running - that beautiful feeling of recovering the awareness of your own body and the boundaries of your own skin. It's epic joy. EPIC JOY. Can joy even be epic? Anyway, it's pure joy, and it's epic, so it's epic joy.I have never been so inspired by a book in my whole life. I've rarely been more exhilarated, either. It may actually have changed my life, though it's too soon to tell. For now, this morning I ran barefoot for the first time (4 km, no pain, absolutely LOVED it) and I'm already training for the marathon next April. Half-marathon really, potentially marathon.

But still I started this book with trepidation; everyone I know, runners and nonrunners, had raved about it, and yet the beginning left me rolling my eyes, thinking it would be yet another book about how the Author's Personal Experience led to Revelation about some Issue. Which usually bores me.Fortunately, I was wrong. This is a book about a lot of things: about evolutionary anthropology, and biomechanics, and the invention and marketing of modern running shoes; about the Tarahumara of Mexico, who run long distances over rough terrain in rubber-tire-soled sandals; about ultramarathons, and the nutcases unusual people who run them; about the self-invented crazy gringo indio El Caballo Blanco, and the epic race he organized between the best of the Tarahumara runners and the best American ultrarunners; and yes, even a little bit of the Author's Personal Experience.The story is framed by that of McDougall's trips to Mexico to meet the Tarahumara and learn about their experiences, and ultimately to race - well, not exactly alongside them, more like a good deal behind them, but you know what I mean. But the real meat is in the tangents. He talks about the druglords in Mexico, the customs of the Tarahumara people, the history of the Leadville 100 trail race, the nutritional value of chia, the differing structures that support the head of a human and the head of a pig. It's all fascinating. And best of all are the biographical bits of all sorts of people, from ultrarunner Ann Trason to ultra-huckster Rick Fisher (who, incidentally, my husband knew in college, and for whom he has not one iota of respect). By the time we have met all the players and are ready for the 50-mile race that forms the backbone of this book, we are rapt.I was equally fascinated, but less convinced, by the parts of the book that are sometimes quoted to ""prove"" that humans evolved to hunt animals by running them down, and we should do so barefoot and while eating a vegan diet. (I have read other evolutionary anthropological studies that suggest the more important development was the brain getting big enough to make the calculations needed to figure out how to throw a rock at a running animal and hit the target. And why hunt animals if you're a vegan, anyway?) Fortunately, McDougall himself doesn't present this as polemic but as support for the basic contention that running is a natural thing for humans to do and shouldn't cause injury when done properly. (I should add here that I ""read"" this book by listening to the audio version while, you guessed it, running. I know I surreptitiously adjusted my form while listening to passages about biomechanics and how the best runners glide along so effortlessly.)Maybe his more controversial conclusion is that running makes you a better person, and that being a good person makes you a better runner. I don't know if he's right. But I'm willing to give it a shot."

With breaks and all that, I still couldn't convince myself to let it down. I had homework, dammit, and I risk getting a 4 in class because I wanted to finish this so badly. It's been a long time since I read a book like I was thirsty for water after a ... 100 mile run through the Death Valley, suppose. See? Now everything comes in running terms, and I'm so far away from being a runner or even a brisk walker! It impressed me so much through it's layering, with an accent on the raw feeling that I now understand running gives; it impressed me because of the people, the men and women (or women and men) who pushed themselves further and further until there was no further to go to. so they invented it. I loved this book so much, and now I am so sad I finished it. Books like this don't come on your ... track ... every other day, so it's a treasure and a thing to be treasured.especially because it's non fiction, you'd expect it to be not so sentimental and delve in facts, not feelings. surprisingly, the best thing it does is that it instills this emotional frenzy in you when you comprehend the passion and dedication these runners have for their sport. i myself am not much an outdoorsy kind of girl; i do enjoy nature and i'm more than happy to spend time in secluded, wild places. but sport? uuuuhm, not so much. i have all the respect for these mega athletes who define what running can mean to humans. besides the emotional part, you'll also find a lot of scientific facts about running and the evolution of man when this variable was introduced."

Firstly, the book widens my view of running not as literally a sports or some hard workout to trim off some kilos, instead, it is much of a community connection. I am amazed on the story of a tribe living on running, a gringo spending his life in the wilderness to protect the pure joy of running, an elite athlete slowing down to cheer up the weary partner, ... . Running is supposed to care for others. Now I stop listening to blasting music or disassociate from others by being silent while running. It feels better to open with chitchat. Secondly, the book is full of amazing characters. I am not sure if their ""real"" version is as inspiring as they are characterized, I am happy enough believing in the story and cultivation my running motivation.On the other hand, I found myself confused and doubtful throughout the book. As Mr. McDougall took readers on journey to events/moments that he did not even presents. So I am not sure of its accountability and many things should have been exaggerated. Anyway, nothing is perfect. I am happy that it meets my expectation of finding a ""why"" for my running rather than by smaller clothes sizes :) "

Some people complained that this book is like a long magazine article. Well, I like some magazine articles. In fact, I like a lot of articles from The Atlantic, The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, etc. So, I am not sure why that is a bad thing. This book opens up a world, a people, that I didn't know existed. Why didn't I? Why doesn't everybody? And, why does everyone I see running past my house every day have such big frowns on their faces? And, why don't we all eat salads for breakfast? Why do we wear shoes and why does Nike exist? And, where can I buy pinole? Well, I learned answers to many of those questions, including, ""What is keeping me from running?"" (Answer: laziness.) The book, story, characters, information and race are fascinating. It only bogged down slightly over the course of the few pages dedicated to evolution. That aside, the book has a very nice flow to it, going back and forth between the main story, mini-stories and informational asides. I liked ""Born to Run"" so much, I may run in the morning."

50,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739465-monica,4,"Runner friends had recommended this book to me. It was in my plan to read in 2015 and it got moved up in the queue when I started to prepare for a half marathon coming up. Suffice it to say, this was exactly what I needed. Truthfully, some of McDougall's ""facts"" are questionable and definitely in my mind did not have enough evidence in the book to support it, but really that is minor. This book is a not about the anatomy of running, it's about the love of running. So much of what McDougall says, I feel. For example, I'm nursing an Achilles tendon issue and went out to buy new shoes. The shoes the running store recommended had far less support than the shoes I was training in. At first it was weird, but ultimately I feel and run better. I'm not ready to throw out my shoes for sandals, but it is a demonstrable fact (in my life) that the less supported shoe is better for me. The rationale laid out in the book behind that sentiment, makes sense to me. There were many passages that talked about the spirit and joy of running. I think McDougall catches it and encapsulates it perfectly. Running or moving your legs is quite natural, almost evolutionary. It's the ""couch potato"" that is abnormal. Moving (being active) is essential to our well being physically, physiologically, psychologically, philosophically, spiritually and emotionally. I also enjoyed the camaraderie among the athletes in the book. At runs and races, I've found that to be true. Everyone is a winner at these things and the last finisher is celebrated as well as the first. I came to this book hoping for a little motivation and inspiration for my running in general. I am quite satisfied with the results. I smiled quite a bit while reading this, not necessarily in amusement or humor but in shared emotion. Powerful and motivational. First book this year that I see myself rereading. almost 4.5"
51,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38240230-dawn,5,"Audiobook read by Fred Sanders. 'You don't stop running because you get old. You get old because you stop running.' Don't let the title deter you. It's not just a book about running. It's also about the evolution, science, physiology and biomechanics of how we have come to be upright bipeds who thousands of years ago were most likely out-running our protein for dinner to their death. It's also a book about the running culture of the Tarahumara, a hidden tribe in the Copper Canyons of Mexico, who are arguably the best athletes in the world. A few other notable characters and running athletes are featured in the book, but it is the Tarahumara who stand out among the rest. And the author simply stumbled upon all this because he had a running injury and simply asked the doctor 'Why does my foot hurt?' I tried to post pictures of the simple sandals the Tarahumara wear on their feet and the colorful shirts and the white skirts the men wear as they run, but I'm having trouble. Google the images even if you don't read this book. Simply amazing that these men and women can run faster and longer than most humans on earth in these basic 'shoes'. You will actually find yourself wanting to run in them, or even barefoot, and trash your expensive running shoes, like I have. I haven't gotten there yet, but I'm going to try a little barefoot running and see how it goes. This all culminates into, as the subtitle states, 'The Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen.' Scott Jurek, the best ultrarunner (or so he was) and some other superb ultrarunners compete in a 50 mile ultramarathon in Mexico against some of the Tarahumara tribe. I would have loved to have been a spectator. As a runner, a physical therapist, and an upright human being, I recommend this book to everyone and anyone. Well-researched and written. 5 stars.   "

""If you don't have answers to your problems after a four-hour run, you ain't getting them.""
 I've never given much thought to ultra-runners, but when I did, I felt alienated. Running fifty to a hundred miles sounds other-earthly to me. But then curiosity got the best of me, and so I picked up Born to Run, not knowing that it would feed me with a whole new surge of love for running.Born to Run is a tribute to the Tarahumara, a Mexican tribe living quietly and secluded in the canyons, while also being the best ultra-runners the world has ever seen. Wearing togas, dresses and bare sandals, they can go for miles and miles. Christopher McDougall tells their story with passion and curiosity and his style of writing is both informative and entertaining. On his own quest to becoming a better runner, his journey is relatable and I enjoyed the way the story was told in real-time. His search for answers about why he kept getting injured, while the Tarahumara seemed invincible lead him to research suggesting that we've become the humans we have due to our ability to run and that hi-tech running shoes might do more harm than good, considering our feet are designed perfectly for just that. 
""There's something so universal about that sensation, the way running unites our two most primal impulses: fear and pleasures. We run when we're scared, we run when we're ecstatic, we run away from our problems and run around for a good time.""
All in all, it's an entertaining, informative and inspiring read. I feel like going for a run now!"

The book was Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser and the paradigm shift it wrought upon me was tangible and physical. I closed the book and knew I would never eat meat again, and that I would never order fast food with ease. Similarly, Michael Pollan's The Omnivore's Dilemma forever changed how I think about processed foods and nutrition. The feeling I got when I closed Born to Run was very similar, although the topic is pretty different.In one book, McDougall 1) convinced me to stop putting more padding under my feet in the form of expensive running shoes 2) explained recent scientific discoveries that demonstrate that humans are actually evolved to run long distances and 3) opened up a whole new world of ultrarunners, male and female, indian and gringo, all striding along for hundreds of miles at a time.I can't rave enough about this book.I went for a 10 mile run on almost no sleep the day after I finished it. I was tired from staying up to read, but more than that I was excited to run. Without ever being hokey, McDougall manages to explore a side of running that borders on magical, that exceeds current scientific knowledge and transcends the running industry."

And you certainly do not have to be a runner or athlete to do the same. Author Christopher McDougall was a strictly casual runner, but he is also a writer of some repute and has been a war correspondent and journalist - he definitely knows how to tell a story. The book was a fun and easy read. I also listened to the audiobook, as narrated by Fred Sanders and can recommend it as well.McDougall tells the story of a very reclusive tribe of Mexican Indians, the Tarahumara, who live in a remote part of Mexico below El Paso - the Copper Canyons. They have phenomenal long-distance running ability, despite being dirt poor. They live on an extremely simple and spartan diet (except for a big fondness for corn beer!). They enjoy very good health, little disease, and none of the pressures or conflict that plagues modern civilization. McDougall, with the help of a small cast of ultra-distance runners, visits and comes to know and admire the Tarahumara, and ultimately participates in a 50 mile race with them in the Copper Canyons. Along the way, McDougall veers onto some very interesting and informative side ventures, including stories about Nike and running shoes, runners' health, the anthropology of running, and more. It makes for a delightful reading adventure."

I had just about given up on running entirely due to recurring shin splints that I just couldn't seem to get rid of. While at the park running one day, I got into a conversation with a guy that recommended this book to me. Having previously heard of the book, I knew it was something I'd be interested in, so I purchased it immediately, planning to read it on vacation in a couple weeks. Little did I know it wouldn't make that long! Once I started reading the book, I couldn't put it down until I finished reading it.This book gets a lot of credit for fueling the barefoot running movement. While the book doesn't really come out and advocate barefoot running, it does recommend not running in thick-soled running shoes with large heel drop measurements. The main thing I took away from Born to Run was why to run. Every time I read the book, I wanted to get out and run.So how did this book change my life? It helped me learn the proper running technique, so I no longer got shin splints from running. More importantly, however, it taught me to love running again, and why to love running."

Recommend it to all the aspiring runners, all the people that like to move, all the curious. One of my favorite quotes from the book:""Know why people run marathons? ... Because running is rooted in our collective imagination, and our imagination is rooted in running. Language, art, science; space shuttles, Starry Night, intravascular surgery; they all had their roots in our ability to run.

61,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44279821-joe-soltzberg,5,"Born to Run was an excellent read. Born to Run tells the story of a journalist that dives deep into the history and science of running and along the way ends up in a race with a group of relentless ultra-marathoners and an indigenous tribe of super runners known as the Tarahumara. Most people hate running. Even more people hate distance running. The thought of running anywhere from 5-20 miles is enough to exhaust even the more experienced runner. But, it turns out that there are a group of athletes known as ultra-marathoners that will run 50 to 100 miles in one continuous race. Further, these races can often occur in treacherous mountains or in deadly environments such as Death Valley. At first one might think this is just a natural result of the super-powered modern day athletes that have achieved feats thought to be impossible (such as the sub-4 minute mile). With all of the advanced training tools, methods, and workouts available to modern day athletes, that would be a reasonable guess. But, it is incorrect. It turns out that for hundreds if not thousands of years a tribe in northwestern Mexico have been regularly running 50 to 100 miles as part of their everyday life. So, if we can't use modern day sports science as the sole explanation for this remarkable distance running ability, then what can we use? McDougall provides a variety of different and interesting theories.The overarching theory that dominates the book is known as the Running Man Theory or the Endurance Running Hypothesis. It argues that humans, in part, evolved to be the ultimate endurance runner. Put in extremely generalized and simplified terms, the idea is that humans eventually developed larger brains because they were consuming more protein rich foods (meat). One might think this was due to the invention of spears/bows for hunting, but this only happened within the last 200,000 years or so and our brains starting getting larger millions of years ago. What did happen around that time though was our body evolved to start running distances (far, not fast). There is a ton of biological evidence (nuchal ligament, sweating, etc.) for this and it matches up with our evolutionary history for the most part. It is thought that early humans were ""endurance hunters"". That is, they chased their prey until their prey simply overheated and died of exhaustion. Humans may not be fast enough to catch an antelope, but they can run for far longer than an antelope can. It is an interesting theory and helps explain why humans are such astounding distance runners compared to other animals. This might explain why there exists a tribe of ancient distance runners such as the Tarahumara. Using this theory as a starting point, McDougall expounds a variety of related ideas about running. One of the main ideas in this book is that your $100 Nike running sneakers aren't helping you at all... In fact, they may be hurting you. If you accept the idea that humans evolved to be superb runners, then you might be wondering why we even need shoes. Humans evolved into runners well before even primitive shoes were invented. One would logically conclude that humans should be pretty good runners without shoes. McDougall presents a ton of evidence suggesting that in many cases shoes can be detrimental to ones ability to run and that if shoes are necessary for protection then one ought to use shoes that are as minimalist as possible. After all, the Tarahumara run tens of miles in primitive sandals. He argues that all of the added heel padding in modern shoes makes us run in a different way and land on our heels, resulting in damage over time and a ton of injuries. When one runs without shoes they land more fluidly and carefully. They spring off their toes and use the front of their feet. This results in less injury according to several studies. It's definitely an interesting idea and something I plan to try out myself soon. The other main idea presented in this book is that running is more ""sacred"" of an art than we as a society currently view it. Running is not just a form of exercise to burn off McDoubles and Twix Bars, nor is it just an athletic competition to see who can run the fastest or farthest. If we can consider the Running Man Theory it makes sense. We wouldn't evolve to do something we see a chore. Instead, one would imagine we would grow to like something that we evolved to do. There is some evidence to support this. McDougall writes:And when things look worst, we run the most. Three times, America has seen distance-running skyrocket, and it’s always in the midst of a national crisis. The first boom came during the Great Depression, when more than two hundred runners set the trend by racing forty miles a day across the country in the Great American Footrace. Running then went dormant, only to catch fire again in the early ‘70s, when we were struggling to recover from Vietnam, the Cold War, race riots, a criminal president, and the murders of three beloved leaders. And the third distance boom? One year after the September 11 attacks, trail-running suddenly became the fastest-growing outdoor sport in the country. Or maybe there’s a trigger in the human psyche, a coded response that activates our first and greatest survival skill when we sense the raptors approaching. When things look down, we run to make ourselves feel better. One very interesting observation McDougall had about the Tarahumara and some of the ultra-marathoners he interviewed was the mindset they had about running. Many of them didn't have super rigorous training schedules or were super competitors that were solely dialed in to beating everyone else in a race. Many of them just ran because they enjoyed it. During a race (at least until the later parts) many of them would be smiling and having a good time. They were happy just to be running. If being human and running is one in the same, then this makes sense. Perhaps this is the mindset we should all take towards running. It isn't a chore; It's human nature. In an interview with a doctor there is the following exchange:""You could literally halt epidemics in their tracks with this one remedy,"" he said. He flashed two fingers up in a peace sign, then slowly rotated them downward till they were scissoring through space. The Running Man.""So simple,"" he said. ""Just move your legs. Because if you don't think you were born to run, you're not only denying history. You're denying who you are.""So overall it was a great book in general. I'd also highly recommend it if you're already into running of any sort (especially distance). It provides some superb insight and ideas into running and human nature in general."
62,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33738834-peter,1,"Before I start ranting about why exactly this book is so bad, I want to point out that I'm aware that most, if not all, non-fiction book authors have some sort of agenda or point they want to convey. I always take any book that makes sweeping statements on what's best for you with a huge pinch of salt and I think everyone should as well. Being sceptical, especially in this internet age where anyone can create believable content, is my primary attitude when reading these kinds of books and if anything sounds too good to be true, with some basic research, you'll usually find that it is.[Warning. Ranting from here on]Stupidity might annoy me, but bad science infuriates me. In a time where there are still people who think the Earth is flat, it's really not that hard to convince most about dubious hypotheses by simply using a plausible narrative and some manipulative writing. The secret is to sprinkle actual facts in often enough to keep people hooked on to whatever conspiracy you're trying to cram down their throats. I was lucky in that many of the topics brought up in this book were ones I've had an interest in for a long time which meant that I could spot the outright bullshit more often than not. The main source of the bullshit in most cases are not the actual claims, but the way they're presented as fact when there is still a lot of scientific debate about their accuracy.Let's go into some examples. The author would have you believe that running shoes are not only inferior to barefoot running, but actively causing running injuries as well. You don't even need to do research to realise this is blatantly false. Without even going into how most elite runners do, in fact, wear shoes, simply extracting data from the book should tell you all you need to know. One person went barefoot, the running tribe people wore hard tyre rubber to protect their feet, while the best modern runners all wore modern running shoes. If those running shoes were less efficient and caused injuries then why did all those runners seem completely fine, both during the tough races and in their overall careers where some did insane feats like multiple ultras within short periods of time?Nutrition and diet are incredibly complex topics and if anyone tells you that a certain diet is the best one, you can easily dismiss them by pointing to thousands of studies that show dozens of completely different diets that have equal or even better health benefits. I'm not saying the diet proposed by the author here is bad for you, it's just that it's definitely not as great as he makes it out to be, especially when factors such as sustainability and balanced nutrition are concerned.There were a couple more highly dubious claims in this book, but I'll only touch on one more that I found particularly ridiculous. The author stated that the reason for the extinction of Neanderthals was that despite their superior strength and intellect, they died out because they couldn't run down their prey like humans could. This is just stupid on a logical level and while it might have been a factor, research points to many other, more serious and plausible factors like inbreeding, violence, pathogens and anatomical disadvantages related to climate change as the actual culprits. So while the point he was trying to make, that humans are evolutionarily designed for running, which is true, his claim that Neanderthals don't exist anymore because they weren't designed the run like us, is definitely false.Let's talk a bit about the manipulative and deceitful writing for a second. Using statistics is a common tactic to make a point, but when those statistics are disingenuous or outright false, I can't help but suspect everything else that's said in the book is probably false as well. Just take the example of the injury rates in runners (80% per year, apparently) which doesn't take into account the seriousness of the injuries. A cramp or a minor pulled muscle is technically an injury, one that most people in most sports experience. However, using those in his fear-mongering statistics paints a picture that's very far from what most runners actually experience. I won't even go into his claim that 99.9% of people can't qualify for the Boston marathon since it makes me angry just thinking about the stupidity of it. Apart from the bad use of statistics and scientific literature, I also found the pretentiousness of the writing at times incredibly annoying like describing running as the first art form humans created or trying to convince us that the running tribe would be living in some kind of utopia if it wasn't for those pesky westerners. Some parts of the book were palatable like a couple of racing sequences, but even those often felt fictionalised due to the omniscient writing perspective and constant hyperbole. I honestly found it hard to believe a single statement in this entire book. I didn't enjoy it all and I would actively discourage people who are considering reading it. There's just too much bad science and biased writing to counteract the somewhat entertaining story that I imagine some people could enjoy on its own. As it is though, you'd be better off just going for a run in your modern running shoes instead of spending your time on this 'book'."

Having finished it, I look at my current athletic accomplishments as meager at best. Clearly the author didn’t mean to belittle the average runner’s talents by spending shy of 300 pages discussing superhuman endurance. But at the book’s end, it’s difficult to avoid running away from home and running a 100-mile trail marathon – an impulsive way of saying, I loved this book.The book is part memoir, part ethnography, part adventure. During one of his trips as a journalist, he came across a pamphlet on the mythical Tarahumara, an elusive Mexican tribe famous for their remarkable endurance under extreme conditions and challenging terrain. A casual runner himself, he sets off to learn more about their peculiar knack for running, first by seeking the eccentric and unpredictable Caballo Blanco, a former fighter turned nomad and friend of the Tarahumara. It is not long before he is recruited to Caballo Blanco’s master plan: to stage a 50-mile endurance run with the best of the Tarahumara and the most talented and celebrated 21st century ultramarathoner: Scott Jurek.Along the way, McDougall takes many steps back to detail the biographies of many oddball players, including Caballo himself, Jurek, Ann Trason, Jenn Shelton, Billy “Bonehead” Barnett, Barefoot Ted (who single-handedly earned the endorsement of Vibram’s FiveFinger shoes) among others. He also engages in fun storytelling with the history of the famously brutal Leadville 100 trail marathon. But the most intriguing chapters come towards the end, where he elaborates on the scientific theory that the Great Leap Forward in human intelligence and evolution happened at the same time that we began running longer distances.McDougall also has a strong, some would say controversial point to make: the worst thing to happen to running is the invention of the running shoe. Several of his comrades, both Mexican and American, run with nothing but a thin sandal or the FiveFingers shoe, which is basically an elaborate sock. Using the research of various renowned sports scientists, he attempts to convince runners that the human foot is an astonishing work of engineering and doesn’t need the superfluous bells and whistles of modern running shoes. Since their invention in the 1970’s, running injuries have increased dramatically, keeping every manufacturer from confidently standing behind their product. Yet, so-called “conventional wisdom” tends to prevail and running shoes keep jumping off shelves.Born to Run is a fantastic read, even for those who hate running. It’s the story of adventure in unknown and dangerous lands, a tale of self-discovery in a hectic world. But most of all, in very clichéd terms, it’s about testing the human spirit and pushing it to inconceivable limits. You don’t have to bolt out the door and run a “short” 30-miler to enjoy this book, but be prepared to lace up when you’re done."
65,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39362386-cp-wayne,4,"This is an interesting book built around the sport of long distance running. It includes elements of a memoir, adventure tale, sports history and science into one. On a high level, it is separated into different segments: 1) Research and narrative on the Tarahumara people: a traditional tribe of Native Americans located in the remote mountains of Northwest Mexico known for generations of superhuman running abilities. They can run super distances (over 300kms) across rugged mountains and dangerous terrains - often in barefoot or thin sandals. 2) The research and medical history of the humans: including revolutionary science in relation to the sport of ultrarunning, discussions on how humans have evolved and developed traits for running over time. It also presents hypotheses suggesting why modern running shoes may work against us and be the cause of injuries. 3) An adventure tale through the eyes of McDougall and his cooperation with Caballo Blacno: The pair emerge on a quest to gather a group of passionate western ultra runners to race against the Tarahumara. We are introduced to various characters and sub stories, these background narratives diverge on how the sport on long distance running got popularized.Essentially, all these parts are interconnected into the buildup for the final race - a marathon between Tarahumara people and the group of ultra Runners in the dangerous trek of the canyons aka the home of the Tarahumara. Overall, this was an interesting read that surprised me - as I never imagined a book about ultrarunning can turn out to be so interesting. The ending was inspiring as it highlights the human spirit and sportsmanship of people coming together through a common passion. It also did a great job of giving us front row access to the Tarahumara people. It gives us a glimpse into the world of amazing athletes with rich history and traditions. I was amazed to learn what some of them can physically achieve. It makes me realize I have nothing to complain after one of my so -called hard workouts. Science-wise the book makes an interesting theory behind running shoes and why they might be working against us and may be the main cause of running related injuries. In that sense, I think back to my naive days where I would run outdoor in basketball shoes and wonder if that was the reason why my feet hurt so much after. Improvements on this book:There were a lot of unrelated ideas compiled into this book. I thought many of them had enough merit to have it’s own book entirely. For example, I felt like the research on the Tamahara people could been expanded into a very interesting book. I find the part written about them to be so interesting and like many others I wanted to learn more about them. At times, the book was hard to follow as there were several side stories and characters to keep track of. Lastly, the book took a while to build up the final race but the ending came abruptly which was kind of anticlimactic and not as satisfying as anticipated.

66,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2007216-peter-derk,5,"After I finished this book, someone asked me whether it’s a good book for non-runners. Honestly, I have no idea.Running has been a big part of my life for some time now. For the last ten years I’ve run. So it’s hard to say. When you put enough time into something, it’s pretty hard to separate yourself from it. I can’t write a review from a non-runner’s perspective because that would be total speculation on my part.What I can do is tell you that this is a fantastic book. If you are a runner, this is a must-read, easily the best book about running out there, and I’ve read a ton. You won’t find anything this in-depth, in touch, and you’ll never read anything else that gives you the vicarious thrills of superathletes and scientists alike.The story is about the greatest endurance race of all time, but really that’s only a small part. It’s about a man who is feeling his body age and trying to figure what he can do about it. It’s about Caballo Blanco, a living legend whose story, a tall tale, is only more incredible because it is 100% true. The story of the Leadville 100 and the Tarahumara racing against Ann Trason is one of the best sports stories on the planet, expertly told by McDougall, and as any great sports story, it brings about greater truths about who we are and why we run.More than anything, this books sets out to prove its title. Through science, through example, and through story after story of one incredible athlete after another, this book will leave no doubt in your mind that the greatest athletes in the world still like to get their drink on, that a group of humans can run down a deer, and that you and I were born to do it too.It’s motivated me to try some new things. I don’t know if chia seeds are making me faster or stronger. And I can’t say for sure that barefoot running has unchained my feet and transformed them into running machines. But I can say that the spirit of the runners, Barefoot Ted, Scott Jurek, Billy “Bonehead” and Jen, the Lunas, and the dozens of characters in this book, each one more incredible than the last, the spirit of these runners is infectious and fuck this review I’m hitting the road."

68,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites,5,"This turned out to be an awesome book, and I didn't think it would be in the first 50 pages. I thought this was heading to some mystical hippie BS, given the beginning makes it sound like this ""Stone Age"" tribe had superpowers and the author was in search of this mysterious ""gringo indio"" in Mexico's Copper Canyons known as the ""Caballo Blanco."" I should have known better given it was the Christmas gift of my favorite science geek. (Thanks Jenn!) The subtitle calls it the story of a ""hidden tribe, superathletes, and the greatest race the world has never seen"" and it lived up to its title. McDougall started with a simple question: ""Why do my feet hurt?"" And in answering that question the book looks to physicians, physiologists, evolutionary biologists, Bushmen in a ""persistence hunt""--and the strange breed known as the ""ultramarathoner"" who compete in races as much as 100 miles or 100 kilometers in length. And it takes us to that ""hidden tribe,"" the Tarahumara of Mexico, who call themselves ""the running people"" and have been able to beat elite professional athletes. Some other questions along the way? Why is it that ""no woman [has] ranked among the top fifty in the world in the mile... A woman might sneak into the top twenty in a marathon,"" yet women are competitive--even routinely win--ultramarathons. Why do aspects of our anatomy resemble horses and dogs more than chimps or pigs? And why might we be better off running barefoot than with Nike sneakers costing hundreds of dollars?The book is written like a novel, withholding and giving information skillfully in ways that come together beautifully. It was a surprisingly moving, even inspiring book. After reading some books in the past months about atrocities and the horrible things humans do to each other, this finally gave me back pride in being human."
69,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/250-mythili,3,"I understand why this book has a cult following: McDougall manages to elevate the perfectly boring, utterly commonplace modern-day pastime of recreational running to an altogether higher plane. McDougall has a men's-magazine-writer's gift for imbuing everything he does with machismo; as he explores the fascinating story of the Tarahumara (the ""hidden tribe"" of ""superathletes"" in Mexico) he makes a convincing argument that anyone who runs is participating in something urgently primal, something essential to the human experience, oh, and maybe even key to the survival of the species. The other thing about this book that's so wonderful (besides the incredible sense of superiority it allows any casual runner to bask in) are the oddball characters who populate it. I was saddened to hear about the death of Caballo Blanco recently; in the book, invincibility just seemed part of his screwball approach to running and life. I also got a huge kick out of Jenn, the star-athlete-turned-running-hippie -- she really does sound like some girl from Virginia Beach I might've known in high school. It's a fact that anyone who takes running seriously is a weirdo. But McDougall has managed to round up a thoroughly likeable set of weirdos.As for McDougall's whole barefoot running thesis: Though I have no interest in getting rid of my cushy Asics (or buying a pair of Vibrams), it seems logical enough to me. For being such a simple, intuitive activity, regular running does seem to tend to lead to chronic injury. The fact that overpriced, overbuilt shoes could be part of the problem is entirely plausible. Next time I am due for a new pair of running shoes I'll certainly check out the barefoot-inspired ""minimalist"" shoes that are all the rage."
70,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,5,"My husband and I read this book while we were in training for our maiden full marathon alongside with a couple of close running buddies (also their first). To cap it all off, the author himself was invited to the pre-race carbo-loading party to provide a talk so we managed to get his autograph and had the opportunity to have a great conversation with him. And of course he was wearing the Vibram Five Fingers. The most inspiring and accurate depiction in this book is of the running community and how it can bring people together. Our running story started about a year after we got married and we attempted the 10k first, followed by the half marathon 1 year later and then full marathon another year thereafter. During the course of these 3 years, our running group has grown from about 3-4 runners to over a dozen strong, and all of us remained a very close-knit group to-date even after we've moved from Malaysia to Singapore. And we continuously made new and close friendships forged through running. One thing that I've always experienced in my quest for the perfect running shoes is that I never did well with anything overly cushioned or built-up. In fact, my favourite pair always end up being a mid-range no-frills pair without too much heel/cushioning. And this book kind of explained why that is the case and I figured that minimalism probably suited me. It might not be the best written book there is on running but the message resonated with me so deeply that it'll be constant favourite of mine (and his)."
71,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1193774-shelah,5,"My friend Blue came over a few weeks ago, bearing this book, with the instructions that I had to read it immediately because it would change my life. It's actually several stories: the story of Christopher McDougall, aging runner, who wants to figure out why he keeps getting hurt every time he laces up his running shoes; the story of the Tarahumara Indians of Mexico, who still manage 50-mile runs in their fifties and sixties in some of the world's most challenging terrain, and do it with smiles on their faces; the story of ultra-runners, who don't find marathons challenging enough and push themselves through hundred-mile races; the story of the running industry (complete with why your running shoes might be hurting you), the story of Caballo Blanco, a gringo from Colorado who met some Tarahumara at an ultra race, followed them to Mexico, and stayed, always dreaming of getting the world's best ultra runners and the Tarahumara together to run the world's greatest race.A few weeks later, I'm still thinking about this book. When I get up in the morning to do my daily six or seven miles, I think about running light, fast, easy, and being happy while I do it. I'm making lists of books to read with titles like Chi Running. I'm very interested in the idea of running barefoot, although I haven't tried it yet. I'm even thinking about the possiblity of not being capped at 26.2 miles (seriously?). But even if my running never changes, I'm so glad that I read this story. "
72,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5361901-yolo-yearwood,5,"I wanted to read this book for the cultural aspects of the pre-Hispanic Mexicans and to learn about the crazy people who participate in ultramarathons. I walked away from it with an appreciation for Christopher McDougall as a wonderful and creative writer, as well as a lot more information regarding the social and medical history of humans as runners. What an inspirational and well written book!! Two of the most impressive things I've learned from this book:1. Watching my son run is the best way to learn how to correctly run myself. My 3-year-old speed demon on two legs has the Tarahumara way down pat! In fact all little kids do, it's the adults who get lazy and stiff.2. Go barefoot! It's the natural way humans were meant to walk and run. Forget spending $100 bucks on a pair of running kicks. In fact, the more you spend the worst off you are! Kick the cushioning gel soles and microchip self-correcting inserts to the curb. Thanks Christopher McDougall.I would suggest anyone who is interested in reading a terrifically written, nonfiction, inspirational health-based cultural expose meant to teach someone the history and method of marathon running should be reading this already.10 Stars."
73,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8309136-scott-bischke,5,"OK, truth is this is just a super inspiring book, perhaps the most inspiring book I have read in years! How many books really impact you for more than a short time? I am on a new diet, running long (for me!) distances again, thinking about shoes and running pace and being vegetarian again and...well you get what I'm saying. All that because of McDougall's beautiful told story of the Tarahumara Indians, Scott Jurcek, and ultra running in general (oh, and also because a tandem read of Jurcek's EAT AND RUN).Kate and I read this book aloud to each other early on during our walk across Oregon on the Pacific Crest Trail. What a treat to look forward each night at camp! And when we came to the end, which I surely won't reveal, Kate was reading and me, listening. She cried as she read, and I as I listened so engaged in the story had we become. Not a reaction most books can evoke. "

79,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1121414-morwenna,3,"This book was recommended to me by a friend as we shared an intense conversation regarding existentialism, music, running, spirituality, and theories of time and convergence on my most recent visit to NYC. Invigorated and intrigued by our conversation and my friend's strong endorsement of this book, I immediately resolved to find it. Now that I owe money to the Toronto library (yes, I do intend to pay my fines....eventually), and given the hassle of going to my ""nearest"" branch, I chose to buy this book. A couple chapters in, however, I was extremely unnerved by the cultural paradigm naturally assumed by the author (which I will explore in the following paragraphs). I returned the book in the first week because of these misgivings. I later determined to read the book in entirety before giving up on it - and I have to admit, I'm glad I did.For those of you unfamiliar with the general theme of this book, it is written by a journalist who went in search of alternatives to healing chronic running injuries; in doing so, the author explores running techniques developed by an indigenous group in Mexico - the Raramuri - who are famed endurance runners who traditionally run with only flimsy sandals tied to their feet, and who are generally unaware of chronic running ailments that afflict runners in the US. This is only more amazing given the terrain where the Raramuri live - a remote, unforgiving rocky land consisting of of sharp canyons and drop-offs. The narrative follows the latest trend in running - ""barefoot"" running, and also explores theories of human evolution which claim that humans did not evolve as walkers (as is commonly understood), but rather as endurance runners. In exploring the athleticism of the Raramuri, he compares them with ultra-marathon gurus in America, and the story culminates in an exciting race between the some of the ultra-marathoning greats from the US against the best the Raramuri have to offer in the Raramuri's native turf.This book is exciting (particularly during the races) and generally entertaining. It actively fights against types of consumerism and mainstream (mis)understandings about ultra-marathoning and running, and offers fascinating scientific evidence to support the theory that humans developed as endurance runners, rather than walkers. I found the sections on barefoot running also very informative and compelling; so compelling in fact, that I have been running with a pair of ""5 fingers"" (a shoe designed to simulate barefoot running) for the past month or so.My misgivings about the book center almost entirely on the author's perspective and dissemination of information regarding indigenous peoples. He consistently refers to the Raramuri (their own name for their people) as the Tarahumara (the name their enemies gave them, and which ""stuck""....much like the Sioux/Lakota names) *despite* his acknowledging this very fact. And perhaps I could let this fact go if this was the end of it, but there is a number of ways in which the author perpetuates offensive misunderstandings in regards to indigenous peoples. What do I mean? Throughout the ""evolution"" section, there is a marked reference to hunter-gatherers, and other indigenous peoples as ""living remnants of our prehistoric past."" In essence, indigenous peoples are not as ""advanced"" as Westerners, and he's unconsciously following the old anthropological understanding of human ""progress"" as a ladder moving upwards in time and development: nomadic people; hunter-gathers; farmers; tribe; all the way ""up"" to industrial nation-state. Do you notice a trend? Yep - in this model (that, only coincidentally WE developed), we Westerners are the top of the evolutionary chain...we are the culmination of human progress. And what about those other social organizations? According to this understanding, they are undeveloped, frozen in time and unchanging; these peoples are considered as a kind of temporal throw-back in progress. This denies them agency, and in many ways, personhood - their choices can never be ""real"" since they are merely only ever following ""traditions"" that our people ""progressed"" away from...Where as our choices are real and continuing to move forward in time/civilization, indigenous peoples can only move closer to our place at the top, or continue to occupy the same or lesser cultural space.Of course, Mr. McDougall does not mean to use ""primitive"" in an insulting way, but he uses the lessons learned from the indigenous cultures to critique modern mainstream North American culture. But in doing so, he commits the other major sin against indigenous peoples: he uses these people as an example of a kind of lost innocence and harmony with both nature and our bodies that we modern folks lost in all that progress. Essentially, this is an extension of the problem outlined in the previous paragraph. In this logic chain, indigenous peoples are still considered less developed, and ""closer"" to nature. Both ends of the spectrum put indigenous peoples in a bad place. As James Wilson gracefully put it: ""[Native Americans:] are exotic relic[s:] of some earlier stage that we have already passed through: either - depending on you point of view - a kind of primitive anarchy that we have overcome (in nature, in ourselves) or an innocent Golden Age that we have forfeited through greed and destructiveness"" (excerpt from the Earth Shall Weep).Allow me to clarify: it is not a matter of ""racism"". Rather, his perspectives are infuriatingly common amongst the general population. So, why is it important to discuss and bring these issues to the open? Indigenous peoples still struggle all over the world - with economic problems, health problems, and a wide assortment of social ills - and yep, that includes Canada and the US. These ideas about indigenous peoples still hurts them, because this kind of thinking is part of the problem. But even if you couldn't give a hoot about indigenous peoples anywhere, these themes of ""progress"" should worry you. One of the best explorations of this theme in mainstream culture is the movie ""Serenity"". In this movie, the characters discover that a group of violent, anarchist cannibals were actually an unfortunate and unintended product of a failed government project to control human behavior. The cover-up is in full-swing, and the main characters are caught in the middle. The epic speech delivered by the captain of this crew, meant to galvanize their support in his fight to uncover this truth, is centered around the idea of progress:""Sure as I know anything, I know this - they will try again. Maybe on another world, maybe on this very ground swept clean. A year from now, ten? They'll swing back to the belief that they can make people... better. And I do not hold to that. So no more runnin'. I aim to misbehave.""""Progress"" can be used as easily against other undesireables as indigenous peoples. It was used by the Soviets, the Fascists, and all sorts of other ugly totalitarian regimes. Mr. McDougall does not intend to invoke these ghosts, and yet, I could not ignore them in my reading of his book.This book is written not simply as an ode to running, but also a call for community-building. Despite my critiques, I agree with Mr. McDougall's notion that our modern world has fragmented communities, and keeps us separated. Running, he suggests, is a powerful tool in building community, trust, and bonds. I agree that this is a distinct possibility. The race he describes at the end of the book is a great example of this dream - but it is only a dream for many of us who cannot afford exotic trips to connect with great athletes in remote global locales. We must set aside our ideals of progress, and pursue the loves in our lives - every day. This means that if we love running, we may need to do so in smoggy, overcrowded cities, through industrial wastelands, after working a 11-hour shift. If I'm reading McDougall correctly, this also means building connections to run not only because of our love of running, but for our other loves, as well - running for charity, volunteering our skills to help out locals kids or other community initiatives, or running with family members for some QT. Love builds love.So, this really does come full circle. My love of music, philosophy, and running urged me to read this book, and now I gotta figure out how to build just a little more love."
80,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61264875-abhinaba,4,"It is funny that sixty mile runs are casual for the Tarahumara (read Tara-oo-mara) tribe. Or is it alarming that we, modern homo-sapiens, who could run longer than almost all other species have lost the innate ability? Is it possible for everyone to run that mileage?These were some questions that Christopher McDougall asked himself when he visited Urique(Northern Mexico), originally to find what do the Tarahumara tribes did right to be free of injury and to meet the legend Caballo. In the first quarter of the book he states how difficult it is to get to the Tarahumara tribe due to Mafias notorious for killing reporters and musicians, treacherous unpaved roads, and the recluse nature of the tribe itself. It is impossible to spot a Tarahumara if they want to be hidden. Hidden they must be, that was taught by generations as they were targeted by the outsiders. The atrocities mentioned are truly heart breaking. Micah True aka Caballo Blanco aka The (white)Horse is the center piece of the book. He has a Raramuri soul. There were stories on the mafia, funny conversations between Caballo and Mama, and anecdotes of Ann the Brija; about the people of the tribe, their sports and celebration and corn beer. This was supplemented with history of many ultra marathon runners. If you read the book you will find that it is not completely factual. There are plays of spirits, believes, and fiction along with it. One has to read it with judgement so as to pick the parts that would assist in their running and lifestyle, while removing the points which are pretence. At present times running is for business, fame, money, health which doesn't compare to what we have lost: running for fun, bonding and celebration. It is primarily because we don't have a need for it. It doesn't sound technical but running is more about heart than about statistics and equipments. On shoes“But once you block a natural movement(using shoes),” Dr. Hartmann said, “you adversely affect the others. Just look at the architecture,” Dr. Hartmann explained. ""Blueprint your feet, and you’ll find a marvel that engineers have been trying to match for centuries. Your foot’s centerpiece is the arch, the greatest weight-bearing design ever created. The beauty of any arch is the way it gets stronger under stress; the harder you push down, the tighter its parts mesh. No stonemason worth his trowel would ever stick a support under an arch; push up from underneath, and you weaken the whole structure. Buttressing the foot’s arch from all sides is a high-tensile web of twenty-six bones, thirty-three joints, twelve rubbery tendons, and eighteen muscles, all stretching and flexing like an earthquake-resistant suspension bridge.""On formBefore the invention of a cushioned shoe, runners through the ages had identical form: Jesse Owens, Roger Bannister, Frank Shorter, and even Emil Zatopek all ran with backs straight, knees bent, feet scratching back under their hipsI bent against the rope, churning my legs as I dragged him forward. He released the rope, and I shot off. “Good,” the man said. “Whenever you run, remember that feeling of straining against the rope. It’ll keep your feet under your body, your hips driving straight ahead, and your heels out of the picture.”We share a lot more traits with runners (horses, dogs) than with walkers (pigs, chimps). Although we share about 95% DNA with chimps, we have quite different mechanics for movement. Nuchal(stabilizes head during high speed movement), Achilles tendon, short toes, hefty gluteus maximus are some of the factors. Some miscellaneous points:1. Along with getting more exercise, says Dr. Weinberg, we need to build our diets around fruit and vegetables instead of red meat and processed carbs.2. Don't run on your heels. Body weight should be on the balls of the foot and toes i.e. the front part. Heels don't come into the picture. They are for walking or standing. 3. Chia drink for vitality. There is a local recipe using Chia seeds, chilled water, lime, sugar and salt to make a refreshing energetic drink. 4. A lengthy case was made about why running with shoes is not only unnatural but harmful for us. The arguments seem valid and Nike is useless.5. Must look into the history the Czech runner Emil Zátopek. 6. Running should be easy, light, smooth and fast (in that order).Personally, I've always treated run/jogging as a single activity to put the body in shape. Multiple benefits from one activity, which happens to take bare minimum time to do. And there are fluctuations in how many times a week I run due to lack of true love for running or serious concern for health. After reading this I have come to know that the joy of running comes while running with others, running with nature. There has to be some element of exhilaration.The author put the ""Acknowledgments"" at the end of the book and it made sense. Reading through it felt meaningful.  Side by side, stride for stride, Caballo and I ran into Urique. "
81,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4020888-maya-sophia,5,"I was hooked from the moment the author details the injury he had sustained whilst running, for which he'd consulted one of the best sports medicine doctors, decided he didn't like the diagnosis and prognosis, and sought two more opinions, both of which told him he was crazy for not listening to the first guy. I felt like we were kindred spirits because I also did not want to accept the prognosis of the knee injury I sustained running four years ago. From there, this book just gets wild and fascinating. He explores the history of a tribe in Mexico called the Tarahumara, who are known for their ability to endurance run. And we're not talking marathons here. We're talking people who regularly run HUNDREDS of miles, usually in what are essentially sandals. From there, he explores the world of ultra marathons and the superathletes that compete in them. These are foot races that last for days and often cover the most grueling terrain. Think Death Valley. Think cliffs. Finally, he looks at the evolutionary purpose of running and there are so many fascets of that which I found utterly fascinating. Running predates tools by more than a million years as a method for catching prey that was necessary to fuel large human brains, and that is reflected in the fossil record. He goes into how that was discovered, the different theories about why it happened, and then compares humans to other walkers and runners in the animal kingdom. Thoughout all of this, he expertly weaves in his own story about becoming a barefoot endurance runner, which takes the reader to a footrace he ran with the Tarahumara. Everything about this book was so interesting and engaging to me. It was well written, genuinely funny, but also very well researched. It struck a great balance between being a memoir while also being scientific and research based.I was surprised by how much I loved this book. I geuinely want to push myself now. I somehow doubt I'll ever be doing ultramarathons, but I've been convinced that endurance running is the innate superpower of humans and it really inspired me to lean into that now that my knee injuries (Yes, plural. I'm so good I can fall once and take out both knees.) have healed."

The author makes the argument that we have forgotten how to run and are actually biologically built for long distance running by using stories of epic races, science, anthropology, and evolution to support his claims. At times the stories seem embellished or facts conveniently missing, but it still makes for an overall compelling read.The reason for 5 stars? This book has made a huge difference in my running. It motivated me to start running regularly again and practice proper form, a huge gap in my knowledge despite running cross-country/track and being trained by experienced coaches. I'll have to consult additional sources to verify my form but there were enough descriptions to get started and realize I wasn't running correctly. Like, ""The forward foot moves toward the track in a downward, backward, ‘stroking’ motion (not punching or pounding) and the outer edge of the ball of the foot makes first contact with the track.""Some other parts that stood out to me:-Practice by running across a grass field barefoot-Focus on easy, light, and smooth in that order then fast will come with it.-Your pace is good if you can breath through your nose or hold a conversation.-The natural way to run can be seen by children playing or if a barefoot parent runs out into the street to stop their child.-The introduction of cushioned shoes caused improper form and injury to become more common.-The foot is supposed to pronate.-Top ultra marathoners all adopt the same form"

La Chia Fresca esta listo para beber en solamente diez y cinco minutos!If you're wondering why I thought to try this, it's because a friend lent me a copy of Born to Run, annnnd... now my weight's up 3 pounds. Just like the drink, the book’s an odd mix that’s easily consumed, a sort-of mash-up that meanders back and forth between multiple, vaguely-related stories. McDougall’s opening question, “Why do my feet hurt?” is something of a red herring. The author is really asking throughout about the natural limits of human endurance: what motivates and makes long-distance running possible. He does so by contrasting the personal wisdom of podiatrists with that recently published by anthropologists and biomechanical engineers, superficially considering the history and culture of race training, the invention of the sneaker, and the Tarahumara Indians. McDougall uses the Raramuri, a joy-of-jogging tribe indigenous to the Copper Canyons deep in the Mexican Barrancas, as his book’s backdrop, specifically focusing on a 50-mile race that will pit a handful of self-selecting American ultrarunners against native canyon athletes. Organizing the event is a Nemo-like character known to the locals and the author as Caballo Blanco.The following passage from pp. 157-8 neatly encapsulates the entire book:""Stop!""Caballo was talking to all of us, not just Ted. He brought us to an abrupt halt in the middle of a wobbly footbridge over a sewage ditch. ""I need you all to swear a blood oath,"" he said. ""So put up your right hands and repeat after me.""...We shrugged, dropped our packs, and lifted our hands.""If I get hurt, lost, or die,"" Caballo began.""If I get hurt, lost, or die,"" we chanted.""It's my own damn fault.""""It's my own damn fault!""""Uh... amen.""""AMEN!""McDougall works his subject matter inside-out, wandering over and around the drug-running dangers of the high Sierras initially in search of the reclusive Tarahumara, then Caballo, then back in the states to various doctors and trainers in an effort to get his own aching arches into running shape in anticipation of the big cross-cultural, cobbled-together Mexican trail ramble. He takes time out around the middle of the book to recap the 1994 Leadville 100, a century high up in the Rocky Mountains in which select Raramuri participated before getting to the most interesting section (for me), a mini-story about how a few anthropologists working on the margins of their science unraveled an evolutionary mystery: Homo Erectus’ transition into Homo Sapiens by way of sweat, aerobic capacity, and an ability to sustain a smooth 10 kph pace for up to 3 days. (In short, try grabbing some friends and some rocks and going off to annoy your local deer population the next time you’re feeling a bit paleo.)According to the author’s research, the anatomical trick to all this is to let your feet feel the road. Wearing cushiony sneaks and orthotics only lulls us into awkward strides that weaken our muscles and batter our knees, hips, and lower back. Allowing yourself to run forever free as a goofy-toed child builds those same muscles, encourages maintenance of the body’s natural center-of-gravity, and saves overall wear-and-tear. So long as you can avoid dehydration and twisted ankles, you’ll eventually come to outrun a horse (eventually), feel light and energetic, and love your fellow human. Just stop stepping out with your heel, which is, in any case, useless for sprinting and running uphill.So is he right? Hard to say. McDougall presents a cherry-picked and anecdotal case, engaging, but iffy (his barefoot apostle ends the book with trail-weary feet). Meanwhile, McDougall hardly practices what he preaches, undertaking a training regimen to change physical habits that is a lot like his races… he’s miserably slow and requires lots of professional supervision, but he gets there.The author closes out with a fun recap of the informal Mexican race, from the gathering of American participants on the outskirts of El Paso (along with brief flashback biographies of each), through the pre-event festivities, and ultimately through to the anticlimax: Caballo’s post-run origin story confession. The whole is related with sincere compassion and respect, although I personally would have preferred the author’s mystery man remain a cipher as receiving a belated backstory contributed no further insight to the book’s theme or tale.McDougall credits iskiate as a Tarahumara miracle drink that revives and revitalizes the weary. Having now enjoyed it myself, I can’t speak to that aspect per se, but then, I didn’t exactly hit the road to test it properly. It’s certainly exotic, but I note that when push came to shove, even the local racers appeared to stick with water.I suppose this review is a bit lackluster. Part of my problem here is that thanks to the invention of the bicycle, I don’t sufficiently care about whether or not people evolved to jog. Running in rubber slippers is one way to get around. But who needs the hassle? My feelings on the book can probably best be summed up by a recent XKCD comic:UPDATE:Before you drink the barefoot-running Kool Aid, here are two recently published studies on the effects of abrupt transition to a Vibram Five Fingers style of shoe. Runner's World appears to be hedging its bets, but ultimately concludes that, at worst, a prolonged transition period with intervening steps is advisable.Personally, I see no reason to change my model of buying whatever feels comfortable in the store in a low price range... but then, I'm a commuter cyclist, not a distance runner."
84,0307266303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7494007-aaron,5,"Christopher McDougall makes a convincing case that running is an innate, core part of the human experience and he tells one long story with a bunch of different story zigzags. The idea that running will give us injuries is true, but only because we run incorrectly. Running barefoot or with simply shoes is the way to go. When we wear Nikes, we weaken our feet.It's like lifting weights with only circuit machines. Sure, you're getting a good workout on a specific muscle, but all the other muscles that go into the movement are withering away. You need to do the free weights. This book is a fun read. "
