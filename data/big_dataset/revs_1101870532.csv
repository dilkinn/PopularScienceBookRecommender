Could you imagine hearing through your tongue or seeing with your ears? This sentence wasn't a hypothesis or theory, it was fact being already performed on real humans. Now could you imagine capturing the map of your brain, transferring it to other body or even a computer. Namely, do you think your conscious mind could ever exist on a computer? Well it's true in theory and is being already worked on. How about expanding our sensory inputs? Being able to constantly feeling the data related to stock market? This is a near-fact too.And since consciousness is the product of collaboration of billions of parts of our brain and body in the right way and direction, do you think the earth or universe could have a consciousness of it's own? The science community is working on bringing the dead back to life. Seriously..."

But if you are looking for a well written & accessible introduction into 'the workings of the brain', this is definitely a great book to start with."
2,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma,4,"Writing a popular science book (I won't use the abhorrent term ""pop science"") is a dicey affair. If it becomes too scientific, it is not likely to be popular; but if it dumbs the science down too much, it tends not to be taken seriously by discerning readers. So the writer of such a tome has a tough time, striking exactly the right note - that is why very few people succeed in this field. David Eagleman is one such, and this book is gem.Having read Sum: Forty Tales from the Afterlives by the author (a quirky look at possible after-death scenarios - nothing to do with science!), I knew Eagleman was a gifted writer. It seems that he is a neuroscientist as well. And when two such talents combine in one person, a book like this is what we get.The Brain: The Story of You is a book about the brain, and the entity that lives inside it: you. It is a tale of both the hardware and the software of the brain, and about the danger of considering it in those terms alone. It talks about the machine, and speculates on when the ghost enters it. And all this is done in the spirit of scientific enquiry, with plenty of real-life examples.So strap in for a whistle-stop tour into the inner cosmos. In the infinitely dense tangle of billions of brain cells and their trillions of connections, I hope you’ll be able to squint and make out something that you might not have expected to see in there. You.***The book is divided into six chapters.1. Who Am I? - The ultimate philosophical question; one which had great men from both the Orient and the Occident running around in circles. The author approaches this from a scientific point of view. The human brain is largely undeveloped at birth; until the early twenties, it still absorbing information and moulding itself. This ""lack of finish"" gives the human brain the astonishing adaptability and flexibility it has - and this is what makes it different from the animals, whose brains are more or less ""hardwired"".Now coming to the ghost in the machine - what is the self? Is it only the electrical impulses generated in the hardware of the brain? But even the brain is not unchanging:Within about seven years every atom in your body will be replaced by other atoms. Physically, you are constantly a new you. Fortunately, there may be one constant that links all these different versions of your self together: memory.So are we the sum total of our memories? But memory gets constantly faded, renewed, replaced and even falsified; so does that mean our self-awareness is also ""false""?Well, to a certain extent, yes - because we are all works in progress. Here, I found the author's views on self-awareness remarkably similar to the Buddhist concept of the anatman, a similarity I noticed in Susan Blackmore's Consciousness: A Very Short Introduction, too. What is important is that there is no common denominator for the brain.Each of us is on our own trajectory – steered by our genes and our experiences – and as a result every brain has a different internal life. Brains are as unique as snowflakes.2. What is Reality? - Once we have decided that the self is transitory, the next big question is the nature of reality; what lies out there. Because there is no way we can see this objectively. Reality to us is what we experience; and with our snowflake-unique brain, each experience is bound to be different.No one is having an experience of the objective reality that really exists; each creature perceives only what it has evolved to perceive.(Right. We Indians knew that all along, no? What we call maya.)Our brain does a great job of filtering, editing and adapting the sensory input we obtain, so that we get a picture of reality that is censored, based on what we need to know for survival and what the brain already knows.So what is reality? It’s like a television show that only you can see, and you can’t turn it off. The good news is that it happens to be broadcasting the most interesting show you could ask for: edited, personalized, and presented just for you.3. Who's in Control? - Well, most of the time the conscious brain isn't. Most of the time, we are on autopilot: allowing the conscious part of the brain free to take the really big decisions. Just think about the things you do automatically without thinking about them at all - like taking a bath in the morning or driving to work. The complex levels of sensory and motor co-ordination required for these tasks are handled at underneath the hood (so to speak).I think of consciousness as the CEO of a large sprawling corporation, with many thousands of subdivisions and departments all collaborating and interacting and competing in different ways. Small companies don’t need a CEO – but when an organization reaches sufficient size and complexity, it needs a CEO to stay above the daily details and to craft the long-view of the company.(The author leaves the troublesome question of free will unresolved - apparently the jury is still out on that one.)4. How Do I Decide? - Well, apparently not based on sound logical reasoning, as the rationalists would like to think (we will leave that to the Vulcans!). Our brain is always in conflict with itself, playing off the rewards of one decision against the other: also immediate gratification against future benefit. In this case also, the brain is also on a continuous learning curve, rewiring itself not to repeat bad decisions. And the emotional content of the decision is as important as the rational one.When making life-and-death decisions, unchecked reason can be dangerous; our emotions are a powerful and often insightful constituency, and we’d be remiss to exclude them from the parliamentary voting. The world would not be better if we all behaved like robots.One exciting possibility Eagleman brings up in this chapter is the reformation of wrongdoers through rewiring of the brain (and no, it's not like A Clockwork Orange!)Equipped with an understanding of how human brains actually make decisions, we can develop new approaches beyond punishment. As we come to better appreciate the operations inside our brains, we can better align our behavior with our best intentions... Although societies possess deeply ingrained impulses for punishment, a different kind of criminal justice system – one with a closer relationship to the neuroscience of decisions – can be imagined. Such a legal system wouldn’t let anyone off the hook, but it would be more concerned with how to deal with law breakers with an eye toward their future rather than writing them off because of their past.5. Do I Need You? - From a neurological viewpoint, definitely! No man is an island. Eagleman shows us, through various examples, how naturally empathetic we are: it's not all evolutionary competition. Disorders like autism which prevent such natural bonding create severely limited individuals.To empathize with another person is to literally feel their pain. You run a compelling simulation of what it would be like if you were in that situation. Our capacity for this is why stories – like movies and novels – are so absorbing and so pervasive across human culture. Whether it’s about total strangers or made-up characters, you experience their agony and their ecstasy. You fluidly become them, live their lives, and stand in their vantage points. When you see another person suffer, you can try to tell yourself that it’s their issue, not yours – but neurons deep in your brain can’t tell the difference.Actually, grouping together is advantageous from the evolutionary point of view. But the flip side is that the ""ingroups"" creates ""outgroups"" out of necessity (a fact that Desmond Morris has also touched upon, in The Human Zoo: A Zoologist's Study of the Urban Animal) and this is the beginning of conflict. And outgroups can be objectified and dehumanised through propaganda - in the worst case, leading to genocide.Genocide is only possible when dehumanization happens on a massive scale, and the perfect tool for this job is propaganda: it keys right into the neural networks that understand other people, and dials down the degree to which we empathize with them.In the current world, we sadly have enough examples of this. Eagleman gives us a fascinating example of a school experiment, and indicates how education can teach children about the dangers of dehumanisation.Education plays a key role in preventing genocide. Only by understanding the neural drive to form ingroups and outgroups – and the standard tricks by which propaganda plugs into this drive – can we hope to interrupt the paths of dehumanization that end in mass atrocity.For, we need to remember:You might assume that you end at the border of your skin, but there’s a sense in which there’s no way to mark the end of you and the beginning of all those around you. Your neurons and those of everyone on the planet interplay in a giant, shifting super-organism. What we demarcate as you is simply a network in a larger network.Yes indeed. Personally, I found this chapter to be the most exciting.6. Who Will We Be? - Now it's time for speculation - plug and play devices into the brain to take care of handicaps; sensory augmentation; keeping the brain in suspended animation; uploading one's consciousness into a computer; artificial intelligence... science fiction? Maybe. Like space travel was science fiction once upon a time. Research is ongoing in all these areas, with exciting possibilities opening up every day.***One thing in conclusion - my review contains only the bare bones of the book. I have left out the various real-world examples Eagleman uses to bolster his arguments, for fear of bloating it up. These examples are actually the most endearing part of the book.Read it! It's terrific."
3,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1902630-jokoloyo,4,"This is a great introductory read with simple explanations for general readers. But for further readings, we could check the notes section. Highly recommended for introduction purpose, make it 5 star for this purpose.This book made me want to read other books related to brain or neuro science."
4,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216284-mark,3,"I didn't learn a single new thing about the brain in this book -- but that's not a criticism.It simply means I've been reading a lot of brain books in recent years (and writing articles about the research), so I was eager to see how one of my favorite neuroscientists, David Eagleman, did on this companion book to his PBS series.He did quite well, thank you. He covered gracefully and without numbing detail the waterfront of much recent research -- how the brain consists of competing networks, how scientists still aren't sure where our sense of consciousness comes from, how much of our mental activity goes on in the background, how our free will may be activated before we're consciously aware of it, and many other topics. The only chapter I had any qualms about was the final one, which speculated on whether there would come a day when we either could be cryonically preserved and brought back to life, or whether our brain's software could be uploaded to a device, allowing us to live on in another form. This area is so highly speculative that there is almost no research that sheds light on it, but I can understand how the producers of the program thought this would be a good hook for people who wonder about the Singularity.At any rate, if you know anyone who doesn't have much familiarity with the latest neuroscience, I can't think of a much better intro than this one."
5,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,5,"This is an excellent book of interest to everyone who has a brain.Pop science in perfection - making science accessible for everyone in an engaging way, without requiring background knowledge. David Eagleman is a world wide renowned neuroscientist and he did a great job with finding the right words for a world audience. Who are we, what do we experience as real, how do we make decisions and why does or brain need social contacts? Those are key questions I think everyone should think and learn about which is why I would recommend this very well written and entertaining book to everyone."
6,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5712507-brian,1,"As a preface I have a PhD in cognitive neuroscience and study how the brain works as my job. Seeing positive reviews I thought this would be an interest book to read. After starting this book the first thing I have to say is, ""wow."" Not as in ""wow that booked blew me away"" but more ""wow, I guess once you have media connections you can publish any piece of trash."" I understand the need to write a book for a lay audience, I really do. The unfortunate part is that much of what Eagleman presents in the book is just simply wrong and not supported by any real science. Early in the ""book"" he talks about how memories are stored as function connections between neurons. He alludes that the reason our memories are not entirely accurate is that the neurons have a limited number of connections and have to be adaptable. This is pure speculative fiction. Sure, this could be the truth, but there is no actual research that says this. It is unknown how memories are stored in the brain or why they are so labile. To present this interpretation as a FACT is not responsible. In another section he is going over how the brain creates sensation. He goes on a near ramble that borders on saying that reality doesn't exist, it is just a construct of our brain. He states that in the ""real"" world, sound doesn't exist, taste doesn't exist, etc. Well fine, yes all of these are labels of how we experience the world. However light photos still exist, chemical odors, exist, sound waves compress air molecules. We aren't living in the freaking Matrix where reality is an illusion. I couldn't take it. I stopped reading the book and took it back to the library. I would have society a better service if I had burnt the book instead and paid a fine. I understand that this is a companion to the TV series. I would just appreciate if the book (and the TV show, I haven't seen it) actually gets the science correct. The brain and consciousness are amazing. There are plenty of topics and insights that are quite interesting without sensationalism and speculative fiction. "
7,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela,3,"Eagleman is quite an entertaining and passionate educator/writer/neuroscientist. His book The Brain: The Story of You is a fun and informative cursory exploration into the 'science' of who we are as intelligent, social, complex, and conscientious beings - well, most of anyway. I guess you could say, in a cheeky pun sort of way, it's a user-friendly synopsis of our synapses.  ""Although the neuroscience is new, the institution has a long history. The ancient Greeks suggested that we should think of our lives like chariots. We are Charioteers trying to hold two horses. The white horse of reason and the black horse of passion. Each horse pulls off-center in opposite directions. Your job is to keep control of both horses, navigating down the middle of the road."" My favorite topics, those I found most fascinating, and relevant, dealt with the processing of information in relation to reality, social dependency, child development, and aging. And too, I appreciated his inclusion of noteworthy experiments (past and present) relating to all things brain-spectacular. However, in order to keep it relatively simple, Eagleman merely skims the surface without going into any debatable depth.  ""With seven billion brains wandering the planet (and trillions of animal brains) there's no single version of reality. Each brain carries its own truth."" Unfortunately though, it's quite evident based on what IS and IS NOT addressed/discussed/explored within the text, that Eagleman strongly believes in evolution - and ONLY evolution. He completely omits any notions of a 'soul' or a Supreme Being - let alone, an Almighty God. Which I find so very, very sad. THREE *** Enlightening and Entertaining, Discretionary Cautioned *** STARS"

10,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"The Brain: The Story of You by David Eagleman“The Brain"" is an excellent companion piece to the six-part PBS series of the same title. Neuroscientist and best-selling author David Eagleman, educates and fascinates the general public with a wonderful popular-science examination of our brains. This captivating 224-page book includes the following six chapters: 1. Who am I?, 2. What is reality?, 3. Who’s in control?,4. How do I decide?, 5. Do I need you?, and 6. Who will we be?.Positives:1. Popular science at its best. Accessible, enlightening and fun to read.2. The fascinating topic of neuroscience in the masterful hands of David Eagleman.3. Full of colorful illustrations that complement the excellent narrative.4. Eagleman’s writing style is easy on the “brain”. His goal is to educate the general public and he succeeds.5. Full of interesting facts spruced throughout the book. “As many as two million new connections, or synapses, are formed every second in an infant’s brain. By age two, a child has over one hundred trillion synapses, double the number an adult has.”6. A good description of the teen’s brain. “Beyond social awkwardness and emotional hypersensitivity, the teen brain is set up to take risks.”7. Goes over some of the keys components of the brain. “The scientists were particularly interested in a small area of the brain called the hippocampus – vital for memory, and, in particular, spatial memory.”8. Includes interesting stories. The story of Charles Whitman is quite enlightening with major repercussions on a society that values evidence.9. Describes how memories are formed. “Our past is not a faithful record. Instead it’s a reconstruction, and sometimes it can border on mythology. When we review our life memories, we should do so with the awareness that not all the details are accurate.”10. Describes some of the tools of a neuroscientist. “One way to measure that is with electroencephalography (EEG), which captures a summary of billions of neurons firing by picking up weak electrical signals on the outside of the skull.”11. Considers important philosophical questions. Does the idea of an immaterial soul reconcile with neuroscientific evidence? Find out.12. Describes reality. “One way to measure that is with electroencephalography (EEG), which captures a summary of billions of neurons firing by picking up weak electrical signals on the outside of the skull.” “Everything you experience – every sight, sound, smell – rather than being a direct experience, is an electrochemical rendition in a dark theater.” “The slice of reality that we can see is limited by our biology.”13. Describes consciousness. “…the conscious you is only the smallest part of the activity of your brain. Your actions, your beliefs and your biases are all driven by networks in your brain to which you have no conscious access.” “I think of consciousness as the CEO of a large sprawling corporation, with many thousands of subdivisions and departments all collaborating and interacting and competing in different ways.”14. Describes how the brain decides. “It’s easy to think about the brain commanding the body from on high – but in fact the brain is in constant feedback with the body.”15. An interesting look at willpower. “…willpower isn’t something that we just exercise – it’s something we deplete.”16. A look at social neuroscience. “Our social skills are deeply rooted in our neural circuitry – and understanding this circuitry is the basis of a young field of study called social neuroscience.”17. A fascinating look at Syndrome E and its repercussions. “Syndrome E is characterized by a diminished emotional reactivity, which allows repetitive acts of violence.” “Genocide is only possible when dehumanization happens on a massive scale, and the perfect tool for this job is propaganda.”18. A look at the future of neuroscience. “The secret to understanding our success – and our future opportunity – is the brain’s tremendous ability to adjust, known as brain plasticity.”19. Can consciousness be uploaded? Find out.20. A helpful glossary of terms.Negatives:1. As expected, a book this succinct will leave some interesting neuroscientific topics on the table. The topic of free will gets shortchanged.2. A book intended for the general public and a companion piece no less, will lack depth.3. The eBook edition has some glitches, as an example, extra blank pages inserted.4. Endnotes included but no formal bibliography.In summary, this book exemplifies my love for science. Eagleman is a master of his craft and a skilled writer. He covers complex topics on the neuroscience with ease and provides the general public with an appetizer of knowledge. Neuroscience is a fascinating field in it is infancy and Eagleman successfully whets the public’s interest. I highly recommend it!Further recommendations: “Incognito: The Secret Lives of the Brain” by the same author, “How to Create a Mind” and “The Singularity is Near” by Ray Kurzwell, “Who’s in Charge?” by Michael S.

11,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11652288-faye,0,"Took me forever to finish (why???) but was very interesting. Didn't like the part about us potentially becoming machines in the future, with our brains downloaded to a computer... The author got really excited about the possibilities but I just couldn't. Also would have liked more insights into what we understand a lit brain processes instead of future potential with computers, processing power, etc."
12,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49624287-annette-lulchak,2,"The cover of this book is beautiful - and the pages are that thick, heavy sort that just scream quality. Yet what was written on them I found to be a little lacking. Eagleman clearly has a lot of passion for neurobiology and psychology, and references quite a few of his own experiments and what he learned from it. The passages on artificial intelligence were interesting and thought provoking, and the parts on empathy and the need for social interaction were not bad either. It touched quite a surprising amount on philosophy, and not as much on the neurobiology as I was expecting in a book called The Brain.The main feature that kept me from really enjoying this book was the lack of depth. It bounces around from topic to topic using one or two anecdotes of studies done (mostly ones I learned of in my first year psychology classes) to prove his brief point before brushing the surface of the next issue. It felt rushed in that sense and caused me to not really buy in to what he was saying - not that I don't believe him, but I wanted more information to better understand. I wanted to know at least a simplified version of the biology that goes into sensory augmentation, syndrome E, levels of consciousness of coma patients, etc. There were many interesting concepts introduced but the lack of exploration into any of them made me feel shortchanged. It's hard to completely buy into the fact that the world has ""no colour, there's also no sound . . . Reality is also odorless"" outside of our minds because until our mind converts this incoming information (whether it's wavelengths to colour, vibrations to sound, etc) it is just data floating out in a the void of the world. It's a big statement to throw out there and hard to really wrap your head around and agree with without further proof of theory.Statements like that, as well as his definition of consciousness (""When you're awake you have consciousness, and when you're in deep sleep you don't."") are overly simplistic and not the kind of thing I'm looking for in a $40 book. I understand that there is no assumption of pre-existing knowledge, but that doesn't mean that anyone picking up the book is not eager to learn and does not have the capacity to understand a concept of consciousness more difficult than the one provided. Our brains are truly amazing, though. Their ability to transform all of this incoming information, make sense of it, and react to our surroundings so quickly it is not even a conscious thought is astounding. The fact that the brain has no direct link to the outer world and relies heavily on this incoming information, is something that Eagleman does not let us forget, thus reminding us every several pages that all of this is happening ""sealed within the dark, silent chamber of your skull"", "" inside the sealed auditorium of the cranium"", ""is ultimately built in the dark, in a foreign language of electrochemical signals"", etc. Reminding us that it is all of the neurons working in concert that allows these great biological feats to be achieved. This got old pretty quickly and felt like a go-to for wrapping up a concept.Overall, the writing was well done, and maybe I was just looking for something more than this book was offering. I would recommend if you're looking for a headline-type look at the brain without working too much about the details. If you're looking for something thought provoking with evidence backing the theories presented and a response to opposing ideas, then this really isn't quite it. Either way the repetition of certain phrases comes through loud and clear and is for you to decide whether you think that will bother you. "
13,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,2,"If you haven’t read anything else about the human brain and how it works, you’ll probably find this interesting. It covers the usual points: a lot of interesting stuff about the way our brains work and the way they perceive the world. And it’s definitely presented in a readable, easy to understand fashion; I think it’d definitely be suitable for a layperson.For me, however, it got boring pretty fast because I know this stuff. It’s hardly even revision for me – this is stuff I just know. I had the same feeling with one of the author’s previous books, so I’d better keep a mental note and avoid in future!Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."
14,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4,"Definitely, the readers digest version of neuroscience but picks up some of the big findings and mention them. But it doesn't dig deep. This is an intro to the subject and a short book. A good start but one probably will want more after reading this. Not bad for such a short book though."
15,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27156807-keshav-bhatt,4,"This book helped me appreciate the neuroscience behind how much of our mindset, perspective and identity is simply a matter of neural wiring. Who we are is a result of where we have been, and the story we create of ourselves based on our previous experiences. And it is exactly that. A story. Too often we do not see what is really happening, but a projection tainted by old ideas and memories. We see things as we are, not as they actually are. I knew this truth to self evident already but through this book I understood more of the science behind it making this a sobering yet enlightening read. I think it will help to create a more stoic grounded perspective on life - that things are not as bad or good as they seem, things can change and shift, our ideas are skewed and it's really just not that serious after all in the grand scheme of things. Maybe it's all just a projection created based on electrical currents firing around a 3 pound piece of flesh in our skulls! Here are my key insights from the book:* We are born with a blank canvas. We can't walk or fend for ourselves. It takes 2 years before we can articulate ourselves. Conversely, tots of other mammals are born very different and come hardwired with the information they need to hit the ground (literally) running. Dolphins for example, can swim immediately. Zebras can run after 35 mins of birth. At first it seems like they have the advantage. They aren't born helpless. They're born into a pre programmed wiring. But actually this is where our strength lies - they are stuck to these patterns. We are not. These animals are highly adept, but only suited to their specific habitat and environment. If you switched their environments...they'd be stuck. A rhino in the arctic would die. They are unable like human beings, to adapt. Whereas we are born flexible. Not with everything fixed but flexible and open. Meaning we can adapt to any environment. It allows us to be shaped by our experience and environments. Our advantage is we can adapt to the world we are born into.* The way we look back at a memory at different stages of our lives will affect the memory itself.* Who you are varies according to which neurons are firing. Who you are depends on what your neurons are upto. The thread of memory isn't fixed so as our memories change. We change.* Meaning is a reaction of you and unique to your specific reaction. You don't perceive things as they are but as you are. If you did you would be shocked at how colourless, odorless and silent things are in the world around you.* Different brains are unique and thus have varying private experiences. What is reality? Nothing but your own subjective experience.* We learn and develop sight by interacting with the world. If we didn't, as a newborn we wouldn't develop our sight. We need to touch the bars of the cot and play with our feet to get the information of the environment around us in order to develop our sensory data on size, texture, weight etc. Without this interaction, you theoretically would not develop sight. This is a powerful metaphor too - the more we interact and experience the world and verify it with our own senses, the better our sight develops and the more we understand it. * Consciousness kicks in when the unexpected happens. When with most things brain tries to stick to auto pilot. For example as you're driving, having a conversation with your passenger and fiddling with the radio dial. * Decisions can seen spontaneous but actually are the result of an accumulation of things stored in the database of your brain. You are reacting to nothing else but those stored experiences and chunks of data. * Your valuation of how much something is worth changes. E.g going to the park being excited but then you get there and it rains. Your brain constantly reassesses so it can anticipate what comes next. Our brains simulate constantly what the future reward will be. If that changes, our valuation of its worth changes. * The seduction of the now is powerful. We are wired for immediate gratification living in a world that favours delayed gratification. We work towards the shadow of the future. So what can you do? Take inspiration from Ulysses. He knew he would face temptation so tied himself to a pole so he didn't and couldn't do anything. Create ulysses contracts so you have no choice but to make the logical choice. For example, agreeing to pay money if you forfeit on your goals or showing up to meet a friend at the gym. Give yourself no way out and commit fully. * Oxytocin in men in good relationships with their wives increased their perceived attraction of their wives and made them ignore other attractive females even more. * We don't make singular decisions but cumulative ones through a system. We're driven by emotion and logic and our job is to manage the two.* Our neurons require the stimulation of other people to survive. We are deeply social creatures. In this regard our brains aren't individual but influenced and developed by the people around us. * Empathy allows us to get a better predictor of how others are feeling helping us to predict what they may do next. But in many cases, it's a projection from ourselves and how we are feeling. Resulting in us tainting that lens and misreading the situation* We are social creatures and the world around you forms a large part of who you are. Social rejection therefore is painful and literally hurts us, triggering pain receptors in the brain. It's thus important to be part of a connected group and tribe so we feel secure and socially stimulated. But the problem here is it creates an 'in' group and an 'out' group.* Why is it then that if we are social creatures so deeply connected that things like genocide happen? There are a lot of factors but we also need to consider more the role neurology plays in genocide. Being part of the out group short circuits normal functioning of the brain where the syndrome becomes that some are more equal than others. Think of - Tutsi vs hutu. Atheist vs non etc. What happens in the brain is empathy is lowered for the people we consider the 'out' group. For example refugees or the homeless. This basic categorisation and dehumanisation is enough to lower the empathic response and so moral consideration is greatly lowered. E.g they are muslim or refugee so their needs don't need to be considered but those of my children do. Commandent at belson. This makes it easier to disregard and continue on without too much of an effect to our psyche or emotions.In genocide propaganda plays a role in creating neural manipulation. As happened in Sarajevo with the ethnic cleansing.* Looking at the different perspectives of people opens new neural pathways in the brain. In the 1960s, Jane Elliott, a teacher in the US did an experiment to demonstrate this to her class after the assassination of MLK. She gave blue eyed students more power and influence than brown eyed students for a week. Some were allowed to play on the playground equipment and others weren't, one group couldn't talk to the other etc and through this stimulating the deep divides in America at the time. This created the in/out binary and students found this negatively impaired their morality and ethics to those in less power. Their actions began to be far more hostile towards those in the opposing group. Then after a week, she switched the rules completely. The roles were subverted. This taught the students the important lesson that systems of rules can be arbitrary. The truth of the world is not fixed and this helped them see through the smoke and mirrors and form their own opinion.* You falsely assume you end at the border of your skin, but we are not only constantly interacting and developing based on the external stimulus, we are also all connected as a wider network of neurons. Our internal world has evolved through the external, and vice versa* 3 pounds of flesh that are the reason we have evolved to point that we have. Incredible!* Seeing is just light being streamed into the darkness of our skulls, an image formed by our retinas to create a projection of the world "

I wish I could have read this book some years ago when I started reading about the brain, as it would be the best introduction.The narrative, as always, is interesting and warm and listening to this book narrated by Eagleman himself made it a better experience.If you're looking for something new, then this book is not for you. But if you want to refresh your knowledge about the brain, then this is it."

Although I was disappointed that Eagleman did not go further and include much deeper knowledge about his field, everything was quite superficial, it is still amazingly mind-blowing. Neuroscience has always been enthralling to me, and this book was just the subtle push on the door that unraveled a portal of awe in me, I am drastically impressed with our brains.This book is perfect for all kinds of readers, Eagleman did a fantastic job with the writing, the anecdotes, the examples and every component of the book. This did not feel like reading a college textbook, but rather a fun magazine about what sits inside our heads. I enjoyed it and I have learnt a lot. Finally, I see myself coming back to this book even to merely feel the magical spark it made me feel while reading it."

Because of this complexity, the book is very shallow and only briefly touches the different subjects. It raises a lot of questions and perhaps I will read more books related to the magic of our brains, though those books should go deeper into specific areas.A big positive of the book is that its subject matter is very much intertwined with other books, whether it is about habits, artificial intelligence or philosophy."

21,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1074117-abhi,4,"Considering where we are, and what we know so far, it is a safe bet to say that the key to understanding the origins of life and consciousness, and the nature of reality lie in understanding the brain.That is why despite the fact that it doesn’t contain details of the types and roles of neurons and their connections, functional neuronal networks, mapping of consciousness and other abstract concepts such as anxiety or love to specific brain regions, etc., and that it forays quite quickly into the psychological and philosophical implications of the basic ideas laid out in the beginning, I consider this an important book. Because it is important for us to know what the people who understand the brain the most think about these key questions. And Mr. Eagleman certainly seems to be one of them.The book starts as you would expect: the structure and complexity of the brain, and then moving on to, again as you would expect, dealing with how this lump of matter is involved in various functions such as sight or motion, how it gets really good at certain things and remains limited with respect to other things, and how different networks interact in decision-making and impulse behaviours. This part can be summarized as: the brain is too complex for us to really know what happens exactly where, or predict the outcome of an input (the brain has close to a hundred billion neurons, each with ten thousand connections), but we have made progress enough to know a lot more than we did just a few decades ago. Towards the end is the part about the role the brain plays in a vast global network of other brains, connecting the dots to kin- and group-selection, brain plasticity and the possibilities of enhancing and escaping our biological limitations, and eventually of cheating death. And what modern account of the brain is complete without the Matrix question: are we living in a simulation?A couple of things manage to stand out among all that:1. Mr. Eagleman mentions education as the only cure against genocide (and possibly other human atrocities?).2. Consciousness is most likely an emergent property, and there is nothing mystical about it (a view that I've really come to endorse).This is also a fun and educational read. There are some amazing facts (of brain plasticity, for instance, read about Cameron Mott's hemispherectomy), great references to leading research, and you might also occasionally run into some neuroscience terminology.In closing, I remember thinking this: it is tiring to even think about how active the brain is."

Overall, a fascinating read, but many researches listed are in so many books they're not as fascinating any more. Some of the interpretations were too speculative, some weren't entirely interesting. I didn't feel like I needed to rewind the audio when I missed a few sentences because of a distraction. I don't feel like this is something you recommend to anyone you know.But the biggest reason for a mediocre rating for a quite interesting read: it's almost nothing more than a curious story. A few days after a read I already barely remember half of the things I initially found curious and I'm pretty sure I'll forget almost all of them after a month.It was a good way to kill time, but I generally don't like killing it."

Filled with anecdotes that illustrate the points the author was making, I learned so many cool things about the brain as I zipped through this book in three days (that's fast for me). It's told in a breezy, perfect-for-laymen fashion and has only further piqued my interest in this subject. It also poses some ideas that will linger with you.

27,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57948241-ivy,5,"Eagleman succeeds with a great book about the brain and the entity that lives inside it, for everyone who's not too familiar with neuroscience. His well written, basic explanation of how the human brain works is not too scientific and so good to educate the general public. It's full of fascinating thoughts, facts and stories that amazed me, made me think and left me wondering. ""Our thoughts and our dreams, our memories and experiences all arise from this strange neural material.""This really made me think about that Aerosmith song, that says ""How strange it is to be anything at all"". The book begins with the ultimate philosophical question ""Who am I?"" and delivers the scientific answer. And I was instantly amazed. The author points out how we, helpless and dependant at birth evolve, thanks to the the adaptibility and flexibility of our brains. ""We are sculpted by the world we happen to drop into.""""These indelible, microscopic impressions accumulate to make you who you are and to constrain who you can become."" Everyone knows that our family, origin, culture, friends, educatin, work, the books we read, the movies we watch, the conversations we have - basically everything forms us. But it's still something else to read about it in depth and to learn that it also changes the actual shape of our brain and ""the profound importance of the environment around us in shaping who we become. ... who we are depends heavily on where we've been.""What a crazy thought that ""everything you've experienced has altered the physical structure of your brain"". Because experiences are unique, our brain also is. With that knowledge and the example of orphanages you come to realize what a shame it is, that politics don't invest more in the helpess, unfortunate ones. ""Our perception of reality has less to do with what's happening out there and more to do with what's happening inside our brain."" Eagleman explains how memories are formed, why reality, to us, is what we experience, censored by our brain. All with interesting examples. We learn that the ""Knowledge of London"" is one of society's most difficult feats of memory, the differences between our brains and mammals and how a supposedly reasonable young man went on a shooting spree and requested to have his brain checked to see where these irrational thoughts come from. Why it's difficult to put effort into future benefit. How choices work and how some things we can't control, like falling in love. ""Presumably there is a why; you just don't have access to it."" And why we empathize and feel the pain of other. Even with fictinal characters, like when reading, your brain doesn't know the difference. But also why we're more likely to feel with people who are on our team. Understanding that social pain is just like physical pain and the effects of dehumanisation blew my mind. There's examples of war, violence, genocide and propaganda and what it does to people. Education really is key here and this should be taught in every school, everywhere. The explanation of schizophrenia as ""an intrusion of the dream state into the waking state"" and many more examples of dieseases that impact the brain and how people relatably explain how they function, makes us understand what this must be like and to not judge. Lots of his studies are fascinating and sound very science fiction, to imagine, that this is waiting for us is not the most pleasant thought, to be honest. I have highlighted so many quotes and learned so much. It's just so interesting to learn about ""the lives we lead as brain owners"" and Eagleman makes me want to read and know more about the brain and neuroscience. Preferably something similarly readable and easy to understand."
28,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51454575-nick-davies,4,"Clearly a tie-in to a TV series I didn't actually see, this was an interesting whistle-stop tour of various aspects of neuroscience and psychology, packed to bursting points with illustrative examples. The general level at which it was pitched was OK for me - I would've appreciated a little more scientific depth in places, but keeping it relatively approachable for the non-scientist made for a quick and quirky read. Though there were several parts which I'd read about in greater depth before (as is the way with this sort of popular science subject at times - the paradigms are worth mentioning, even if every book on the subject tends to do so) there were a number of sections on experiments and examples that were new and intriguing to me.

It is a short book, so you can breeze through it fairly quickly, but I found that many of the topics and stories were so interesting I wanted more detail than the author provided. The book also briefly explores where continuing research is likely to lead us in the future, which is equally as fascinating and perhaps even a little frightening."

Like the very best non-fiction books, this book successfully combines the scientific research on Brain with live examples while being eminently readable, with humour and the right amount of anticipation. So, although the subject that the book deals with is extremely complex and the terminologies may baffle a layperson, keeping us humble reader in focus Eagleman has compiled a book that manages to avoid a lot of perplexing technicalities. This book helped me understand the flaws in our perception about our own self. Who we are is a result of where we have been and what we have experienced. It is a story that we create for ourselves but even this story can be tainted. Memories are not to be trusted since they change with passage of time and our idea of consciousness is eroded as the cells inside the Brain are replaced. Favourite Quote: “Our past is not a faithful record. Instead it’s a reconstruction, and sometimes it can border on mythology. When we review our life memories, we should do so with the awareness that not all the details are accurate.”"

So when I read David Eaglemans Incognito a little while back, it just didn’t quite meet my expectations. However this book did, for it had everything I love in a neuroscience comms book, plenty of references to current research, new insights and great case studies to back up the point being made.The key take home message was that everything each individual experiences forms who you are. Experiences trigger reactions in your brain and this leaves a lasting mark on your personality, which then shapes your brain’s perception of the world.The chapter on subconscious decision making was fascinating. The reference to evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller’s study is an example of what I enjoyed most about the book. He compared how much money female dancers at strip clubs earned at various stages of their menstrual cycle and discovered that when dancers were ovulating, men gave them twice as many tips than their non-ovulating dancers because subconsciously they picked up on subtle changes in the women’s appearances that were caused by higher estrogen levels. Fascinating huh? There were so many examples in this part of the book to convince that so many of our decisions are irrational or at least motivated by subconscious influences. Whilst I did love this example, it was less of a surprise to me than some of the other case studies for I’ve read of similar studies. This was similar to the example given within the book regarding the case of the man with a brain tumor who turned into a mass murderer, fascinating, but not an entirely new insight. However...The research that I found most interesting, and had not been exposed to before, was in the chapter exploring socialisation. The author explains that learning to be empathetic is all about mirroring someone. When we interact with other people, we reflect their facial expressions to let our brains know what they’re thinking and feeling. Science has therefore found that this is one reason that married couples often end up looking alike at the end of their time together. Because years of mirroring each other’s facial expressions actually shape their appearance, even resulting in similar wrinkle patterns. Wow?!Finally, the points made within the book regarding the potential for media outlets and propaganda to dehumanize people in the eyes of others was both scary and important for us to all understand. In the early 1990s, in Yugoslavia, Serbian media channels started running stories specifically designed to incite hatred of the Muslim population. Rumours began to circulate that Muslims were feeding Serbian children to the lions in zoos, and the community began to regard Muslims as a dehumanized outgroup undeserving of empathy. I’m a big believer that taking the time to understand how our brains work can only work in favor of humanity and this section of the book nailed that for me. So 5 stars. If any of the examples I’ve summarized above sound interesting to you, the book is loaded with them so give it a go. Well done David Eagleman, a fascinating read, and thank you. "
48,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,4,"This is a lightweight account of the brain but extremely interesting all the same. David Eagleman, a neuroscientist who has worked with the BBC to make a series about the brain, is well qualified to write this book and he illustrates some of his points using research from his own laboratory. I found the first half of the book, which focussed on how the brain develops and works, and conscious versus unconscious activity, very thought provoking. On the other hand I was less enamoured with much of the second half which looked at decision making and social interactions, topics I felt were more allied with psychology than brain function (although obviously there is considerable overlap between the two). The final chapter examines the nature of consciousness but didn't cover it in the depth that I would have liked. In particular, Giulio Tononi's theory of consciousness, which is considered by some to be the most promising theory in this area, was tantalisingly touched on but then not pursued. But there is a lot to be discovered in this book. Using smoke and mirrors, our brain creates a vision of the world which bears no resemblance to reality and exists only inside our head. For example, light is just electromagnetic radiation and while it has a frequency it doesn't have intrinsic colour - the colour is generated by the brain based on the frequency of the light. Likewise, air molecules move and vibrate but they make no sound - it is our brain that converts this movement to sound. Flavours and smells are also produced within the brain. All this means, of course, that while two people may both agree that a banana is yellow, we have no way of knowing whether the yellow inside one person's head is the same colour as the yellow conceived by the other. The brain has to play a lot of tricks to provide us with this pretence of reality. One factor is that the brain processes sensory information at different speeds, with sound, for instance, being processed faster than light, requiring that the brain then has to make adjustments so that everything appears synchronised in our vision. In fact, we live slightly in the past because there is always a small time lag between what is happening in the world and what we experience inside our heads. This is particularly noticeable in life-threatening situations, which are occasions when people often later recall that time seemed to slow down. What is happening, according to Eagleman, is that in these situations the amygdala goes into high gear resulting in memories being laid down in far more detail than usual. The brain is unaccustomed to this so when events are replayed an instant later there is more information that usual to be played out, giving the impression of slow motion.This was an enjoyable read and it is truly fascinating that everything we perceive to be the real world around us has been constructed inside our heads by our brains. At the end there is a useful glossary of terms although I would also have welcomed an index."
49,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81350561-k-a-ashcomb,4,"A neuroscientist's guide to your brain, asking questions about who you are, how you work, what is reality, is there a free will or not (automata or in control?), me and others, and so on. All the basics about psychology, neuroscience, and adding into the mix some social psychology. This is a book about fundamentals, and if you are already familiar with them, then you might want to skip this one. However, it is not a bad book, quite the opposite. Well written, engaging, amusing, and thorough and informative. I enjoyed listening to this book, I actually did it in one day. Don't ask why. (My weird brain.)What is best about the book is David Eagleman is honest, he doesn't try to say that all is defined that we know exactly how our brains work. He accepts that there is a lot we don't understand. For example, the question of free will. He never says one or the other, but he says that all of our brains are different. That our genes and environment both play a role in who we become. And I like that. It acknowledges that we are not separate from the environment and random occurrences we come across, but still, there is this genetic makeup that impacts us. Like with me, the fact that I have dyslexia (and it runs in my family.) It affects my reading and writing abilities both in good and bad, but also to the way I view the world. I can let it dominate me and stop it pursuing my dreams and wishes or work with it and around it. Lately, there has been a trend going on that denies we have a saying to the matter of what is going on and how we choose to act. For me, that feels like a pessimistic view of our brains. Their plasticity makes them able to adapt, and they change through our actions. For example, they have shown meditation to alter the brain's construction.But back to the book, Eagleman writes, that part of us runs in automatic pilot. Many of those are learned throughout childhood, like walking and eye-hand coordination. Then they became automatic features until something might alter their course like going blind or the other way around as he gives an example. But then most likely, (he doesn't say definitely,) we have some saying on the bigger decisions we make. And I take that most likely. I have an aversion when people say that they cannot help the way they are and how they react. All I want to ask is, really? It feels like they don't want to try. But again, this all is beside the point. I enjoyed the book, and a lot. Most of it was something I already knew, but going back to basics isn't a bad thing at all.

Whatever we may say is the reason usually has nothing to do with reality. For example, men found pictures of women with dilated eyes to be more attractive. None of those men probably knew that dilated eyes are a biological sign of female sexual arousal. But their brains knew it. We find ourselves attracted to some people over others and cannot tell precisely why. Men gave twice as many tips to lap dancers who were ovulating over those who were menstruating. They were not consciously aware of what was happening. But there are actually slight fertility clues that our brain notices. Essentially, your brain is deciding for you. I mean, of course, the brain in your head, the one on your shoulders. Humans can often put rewards like being valued by our community ahead of biological needs. Other animals do not. Read Montague once said, ""Sharks don't go on hunger strikes."" Odysseus had his men lash him to a mast to avoid what the sirens were going to say tempting him to be destructive. We often make deals with our future self to avoid doing the wrong things in the future. This is called a Ulysses Contract. Men who were given oxytocin found their partners more attractive than other more beautiful women. It increased bonding to their partners. We send drug users to prison in the United States. Not a good idea. It generally worsens addiction. The US has more people in prison for drug-related crimes than the European Union has prisoners. We spend 20 billion dollars on the War on Drugs annually. Drug use has only expanded. Humans need other people. We depend on the social web around us. As Martin Heidegger said that is is difficult to speak of a person ""being"" rather we are ""being in the world."" Who we are depends on the world around us. Facial muscles help us to tell what others are feeling. Many fascinating facts in this book. "
51,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22054877-asmaa-hijazi,5,"Wish I didnt finish reading it!I’ve learned so many things while reading this book. Its very dense in information that I’m very glad to learn and add to my memory.Here are few things that I found very interesting :-The basis of empathy: explaining genocide as neural phenomena: people feel lower empathy for member of outgroup.An experiment has been performed ,where they measured the activity of the middle prefrontal cortex, which is usually active when thinking or interacting with people , not objects. They found that most people when they looked at a homeless man , had no activity of this area ; they saw the homeless man as an object; dehumanized him, in order to not feel bad for not giving him money. This lack of empathy explains dehumanization which is a key component of genocide, that’s very sadly explains many historical events in which human killed each other. -The brain doesn’t care about how it gets the information as long as it gets it. what if we could hear through our tongue! A very interesting examples were mentioned as the “vast” which can replace the cochlea implant , a cheaper solution which doesn’t need a surgery to be performed. -Explaining what being conscious really means, and what happens to the brain while being in coma.And experiment has been performed using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). When the person is awake a complex pattern of neuronal activity spreads out from the focus of the TMS pulse and while the person is sleep only few neuronal activity is seen, same as when the person in come, and so when the person is waking up from the coma, more neuronal activates are seen in more areas of the brain. -What changes when we look at a picture, in which we can see 2 figures after staring at it for a while.In this case, nothing changes on the page, so the only thing that has changed must be the details of the brain activity that produce our conscious experience."
52,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68177901-pritom-mojumder,4,"First of all, I want to say that I saw some people who used to say recklessly ""my world, my rule"" or ""whatever people think about me I'll never change"", those people are dumb. Our brain is relentless shape-shifter and constantly rewriting its own circuitry. We crave for coffee, we fall in love, and we go to war - all those signals come from the brain. All the reality we perceive as real is actually happening in our brains. The Brain is a book about us. Not just you. Because the world is not about you. At the root level, it is about billions of 'you'. I, personally liked the 5th chapter ""DO I NEED YOU?"". In this chapter, he talked about GENOCIDE. He explained that our brains can be manipulated by political agendas to dehumanize other people, which can then lead to the darkest side of human acts. Genocide is only possible when dehumanization happens on a massive scale, and the perfect tool for this job is propaganda: it keys right into the neural networks that understand other people, and dials down the degree to which we empathize with them. He talked about a possible solution too. I don't want to talk about it much here. This is a very light read book. So, check it from there.I'm interested to know about the brain, but I didn't have time to read in detail. I studied some a long time ago in the biology book when I was in Higher Secondary School. But that was very insignificant. I picked up another mammoth size book, which was really a famous book on brain and development psychology. But I was feeling to have some prior knowledge. In that case, David Eagleman has done a wonderful job. He has written this book for laymen. If you are already in that field, you may ignore it. "
53,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5753401-henrique-maia,3,"Here’s another interesting book about a fundamental topic that should interest every person out there. Why? Because we all have brains, and knowing how it works, its potencial, its many quirks and limitations, can prove useful to better understand our own potentials and become more accepting of our many perceived flaws. If you are familiar with the topic, this book problably won’t bring you any new knowledge or radically change the way you view your world or how you understand your own mind. But if you’re looking for a good introductory book on this subject, David Eagleman’s The Brain: The Story of You will certainly surprise you and, in a akward way*, delight you, for it is well written, very engaging, and clear in its many explanations, making a hard subject matter into a very compelling narrative. For all this, and for whatever else it provides, this book, as others by the same author, is definitely worth reading. *Knowing how weird our brains are, how complicated and complex is its functioning, and, consequently, how weird, complicated and complex we are can be baffling at first. But as you move on, the existential angst this might provoke will naturally subside. "

It's a book about HOW it makes you WHO you are. The first few chapters of the book leave you thinking that you learnt a lot from it. It gives you lots of answers. It tells you exactly why you couldn't stand your elders in your early teenage. It tells you how you get your morals, your values, your ways of thinking. It tells you how we perceive reality, that it's just a magic show put up by your brain so that you don't die of boredom. It tells you how you choose between different brands of products.But then in the last chapter, the book leaves a ton of QUESTIONS - questions that modern neuroscience hasn't yet been able to answer - the conundrums of modern neuroscience. What is consciousness? What makes you conscious? Is it just the trillions of connections between your neurons? If so, can your brain be mapped and preserved forever by simulating the way they're connected? Can computers ACTUALLY think? Can they ever learn to understand what all the zeros and ones they're throwing around mean?If you're looking for a way into the vast field of neuroscience, then this popular book might just be what you're looking for. Happy reading!"
55,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2257430-jason-carter,5,"Do we live in the present? Or are our brains really presenting to us the recreation of an immediately experienced past? What is memory? Is it like a video recording that breaks apart over time and our brains try to piece back together? Or is it possible that memories are more complex interactions between stored data, our desires, and our imaginations?Eagleman tackles these questions and many, many more in one of the more fascinating books I've read in recent memory. His chapters include:1 - Who am I?2 - What is Reality?3 - Who's in Control?4 - How do I Decide?5 - Do I Need You?6 - Who will We Be?Each chapter is a page-turner, backed by scientific studies, research, and anecdotal stories. Of particular interest for me--with a father suffering from Alzheimer's--were his observations on this disease including the notion of ""cognitive reserve"" which explains why the physical ravages of the disease on the human brain have much less to do with the effect on cognitive decline than the cognitive reserve the individual has built up through a lifetime of brain exercise.Highly, highly recommended."

That is why I am sceptical of people who claim that they wish to be left alone.Neuroscientists weren’t the first to discover that fixing your gaze on something is no guarantee of seeing it. Magicians figured this out long ago.It is easy to trick us. And the fun part is that the trickster is best at tricking himself.Our past is not a faithful record. Instead it’s a reconstruction, and sometimes it can border on mythology.And memory is the trickiest of all. It is what we use to string together a coherent narrative of what it means to be 'me'. Yet memory is never static and never the same. It is always coloured by our present."
57,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2736147-riju-ganguly,4,"Like the very best non-fiction books, this book succeeds in delivering an executive summary of the stuff that the brain performs for us. The strong points in favour of this book are:- It’s eminently readable, with lucid language showing a hint of humour and the right amount of awe.- The subjects it deal with are apparently common but exceedingly complex, like memory and coordination. Nevertheless, with empathy for humble readers like us, the book manages to avoid most technicalities, speeding us through a lot of aspects concisely.I enjoyed the book. Loved the first part more than the later portions— which resulted in a star getting lost. But otherwise, this is a very-very good book.Recommended."
58,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26030811-ameerah,5,"My latest adventure on memory was reading this book, Eagleman explains a complex world of decision-making that takes place inside our brains, exploring human behaviour from empathy to genocide and neuroscience in a bid to help the reader understanding human nature.Eagleman explains how a deeper understanding can “enhance our wellbeing, boost our cognitive skills and even forge a more just society, and ultimately a better future for everyone.”I’ve read several books on memory over the last few months of lockdown and my belief is now that memory is a social justice issue and the number one thing all teachers should learn (other than mastering behaviour management and their subject knowledge)."
59,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31318644-ankit-kumar,4,"A good quick reading about Importance of our brain and it's processes in shaping the world around us. Ranging from everyday activities, social interactions, future predictions, forming memories, feeling emotions etc. Eagleman has talks about the neural activity in brain behind all these processes in very simple terms. This is a good book for people from different backgrounds to have a look at functions of brain and it's capabilities. As a biology/neuroscience student, I found most of the stuff very basic and just icing of neuroscience field. The book is a redundant version of proper neuroscience academic textbooks."

I feel as though it would be worth reading once a year as it's possible that certain topics will resonate more than others depending on what's happening in your life at the time of reading! The two areas that stood out for me this time related to willpower (emotional suppression depletes the amount of energy your brain has to cope with temptation) and empathy (brains are hardwired to allow you to feel more empathy for people who are similar to you). Watch the documentary than read this book!

I saw the BBC series on it too but as sometimes most readers say that book is better, I would say book is far better as it tantalizes the neurons of your brain to imagine and understand rather than taking readymade inputs of some documentary director. The advantage of the book is always that we understand it with the best of our own imagination rather than trying to understand a tertiary opinion.After this book I have read 4 to 5 more neurology books including 2 academic texts even ;)."

120,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75985470-kate-yates,5,This is an excellent book which accompanies an equally good documentary series broadcast a few years ago. I feel as though it would be worth reading once a year as it's possible that certain topics will resonate more than others depending on what's happening in your life at the time of reading! The two areas that stood out for me this time related to willpower (emotional suppression depletes the amount of energy your brain has to cope with temptation) and empathy (brains are hardwired to allow you to feel more empathy for people who are similar to you). Watch the documentary than read this book!

I saw the BBC series on it too but as sometimes most readers say that book is better, I would say book is far better as it tantalizes the neurons of your brain to imagine and understand rather than taking readymade inputs of some documentary director. The advantage of the book is always that we understand it with the best of our own imagination rather than trying to understand a tertiary opinion.After this book I have read 4 to 5 more neurology books including 2 academic texts even ;)."

164,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71981564-abhiraj-sharma,4,It's a good beginner's level book which tries to give an overview of the mysteries lying underneath the hard skull. It's an easy read and uses pictorial representations to demonstrate some of the ongoing as well as some of the past projects undertaken to unravel the hidden secrets of brain and its functioning. I would recommend this for all brain enthusiasts as well as seekers of knowledge.

179,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29488468-tanmay-sethi,5,Amazing book. Gives in depth insight of what we are and how the brain makes us do what we do. Eagleman has described some of the most complex things in most simplistic manner. 
180,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75985470-kate-yates,5,This is an excellent book which accompanies an equally good documentary series broadcast a few years ago. I feel as though it would be worth reading once a year as it's possible that certain topics will resonate more than others depending on what's happening in your life at the time of reading! The two areas that stood out for me this time related to willpower (emotional suppression depletes the amount of energy your brain has to cope with temptation) and empathy (brains are hardwired to allow you to feel more empathy for people who are similar to you). Watch the documentary than read this book!

I saw the BBC series on it too but as sometimes most readers say that book is better, I would say book is far better as it tantalizes the neurons of your brain to imagine and understand rather than taking readymade inputs of some documentary director. The advantage of the book is always that we understand it with the best of our own imagination rather than trying to understand a tertiary opinion.After this book I have read 4 to 5 more neurology books including 2 academic texts even ;)."

The lessons are broken down into small sub topics, facilitating our understanding of the concepts talked about in it.I have always been fascinated by the human brain and had read a few articles online, and a lot of facts as a kid about it. This book, hence, proved to be immensely helpful and insightful to me.It talked about some of the very important questions of human consciousness, and what makes you you, and the transferability of our consciousness enabling perpertual existence, way beyond what this physical form can endure.

183,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57999148-ganesh-balasubramanian,5,One of the best book I have ever read😎I think he made this book with full of real time researches that he made....and described in a normal human reading terms to understand with basic knowledge..... you can able to understand after you done with this book like how it's complicated to understand the consciousness of the human or any species? And how the human species learned all over their life? ....& how the brain re-circuit them when you learned something ... recommended to read more than once...🤗😍
184,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52491322-chocokraken,4,If you have been browsing around and you are not new to brain topics and the human thinking processes you might find this book a good read to refresh some infos that you might have forgotten and perhaps acquire some new. If you are new to all this you'll definitely enjoy more this book as it is very well written and will introduce you to a whole new world with many examples and details on studies made on the brain. It does not have dead points and everything is treated as simply as possible which I appreciate in essays as they often tend to the boring side. I definitely recommend it.

However, if you are looking for a richer details on the research and analysis, this book does not provide that, although personally I feel it provides just enough.On a more personal note, I found a few facts interesting as well as beneficial in explanation of my meditation experience.

The anecdotes are interesting though, and are a great way to express new concepts. I found Eagleman to be quite repetitive, and thought the book could’ve been better edited. Towards the end of it, the book becomes rather philosophical, which wasn’t what I was looking for.The information was presented in a disjointed, shallow manner - a concept is introduced in an over-simplified way, given a story to keep it interesting, and then moved on from (all in about 2-3 pages a concept).I think if you are completely new to the magical world of the brain, this could be a fun place to start.

240,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75985470-kate-yates,5,This is an excellent book which accompanies an equally good documentary series broadcast a few years ago. I feel as though it would be worth reading once a year as it's possible that certain topics will resonate more than others depending on what's happening in your life at the time of reading! The two areas that stood out for me this time related to willpower (emotional suppression depletes the amount of energy your brain has to cope with temptation) and empathy (brains are hardwired to allow you to feel more empathy for people who are similar to you). Watch the documentary than read this book!

I saw the BBC series on it too but as sometimes most readers say that book is better, I would say book is far better as it tantalizes the neurons of your brain to imagine and understand rather than taking readymade inputs of some documentary director. The advantage of the book is always that we understand it with the best of our own imagination rather than trying to understand a tertiary opinion.After this book I have read 4 to 5 more neurology books including 2 academic texts even ;)."

The lessons are broken down into small sub topics, facilitating our understanding of the concepts talked about in it.I have always been fascinated by the human brain and had read a few articles online, and a lot of facts as a kid about it. This book, hence, proved to be immensely helpful and insightful to me.It talked about some of the very important questions of human consciousness, and what makes you you, and the transferability of our consciousness enabling perpertual existence, way beyond what this physical form can endure.

243,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57999148-ganesh-balasubramanian,5,One of the best book I have ever read😎I think he made this book with full of real time researches that he made....and described in a normal human reading terms to understand with basic knowledge..... you can able to understand after you done with this book like how it's complicated to understand the consciousness of the human or any species? And how the human species learned all over their life? ....& how the brain re-circuit them when you learned something ... recommended to read more than once...🤗😍
244,1101870532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52491322-chocokraken,4,If you have been browsing around and you are not new to brain topics and the human thinking processes you might find this book a good read to refresh some infos that you might have forgotten and perhaps acquire some new. If you are new to all this you'll definitely enjoy more this book as it is very well written and will introduce you to a whole new world with many examples and details on studies made on the brain. It does not have dead points and everything is treated as simply as possible which I appreciate in essays as they often tend to the boring side. I definitely recommend it.

The anecdotes are interesting though, and are a great way to express new concepts. I found Eagleman to be quite repetitive, and thought the book could’ve been better edited. Towards the end of it, the book becomes rather philosophical, which wasn’t what I was looking for.The information was presented in a disjointed, shallow manner - a concept is introduced in an over-simplified way, given a story to keep it interesting, and then moved on from (all in about 2-3 pages a concept).I think if you are completely new to the magical world of the brain, this could be a fun place to start.

Can we restore senses lost to us and untill what state can we improve ourselfs?
