The book was released on 15 September 2011 in the United Kingdom, and on 4 October 2011 in the United States. It is a graphic science book aimed primarily at children and young adults. Dawkins has stated that the book is intended for those aged around 12 years and upwards, and that when trialling the book prior to publishing, younger readers were able to understand its content with additional adult assistance.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز هجدهم ماه فوریه سال 2017 میلادیعنوان: جادوی واقعیت، چطور میدانیم چه چیزی واقعا درست است؟؛ نویسنده: ریچارد داوکینز (داکینز)؛ تصویرگر: دیو مک‌کین؛ ترجمه و تنظیم: مینا خبوشانی، ویراستار: آرش حسینیان؛ ناشر: اینترنتی، 1392؛ فهرست کتاب: یک: واقعیت چیست؟ دو: اولین انسان چه کسی بود؟ سه: تنوع گونه‌ های جانوری به چه دلیل است؟ چهار: چیزها از چه ساخته شده‌ اند؟ پنج: چرا شب و روز، تابستان و زمستان داریم؟ شش: خورشید چیست؟ هفت: رنگین کمان چیست؟ هشت: چیزها چه زمانی و چگونه آغاز شدند؟ نه: آیا ما تنها هستیم؟ ده: زلزله چیست؟ یازده: چرا چیزهای بد اتفاق می‌افتند؟ دوازده: معجزه چیستبرخلاف کتاب ساعت‌ساز نابینا؛ و ژن خودخواه؛ که برای مخاطبان نسبتا سطح بالا نوشته شده، این‌بار قلم «ریچارد داکینز(داوکینز)» دارای زبانی ساده است و گویا، همگان آن را میفهمند. ایشان اینبار تلاش می‌کنند، تا شگفتی‌های علم را توضیح دهند. «ریچارد داوکینز»، مشهورترین زیست‌ شناس تکاملی با همکاری «دیو مک‌کین» هنرمند برجسته ی طراحی، با به‌ کارگیری نوشتار، و تصاویر گرافیکی، یکی از زیباترین و خواناترین کتاب‌های علمی عمومی را گردآوری کرده‌ اند. کتاب «جادوی واقعیت»، پاسخهایی ساده به پرسش‌هایی دشوار است. در این کتاب، «داکینز» کوشش می‌کنند، با ترکیب عقلانیت و شواهد موجود، پاسخی درست به پرسشها ارائه دهند. مسائلی که «داکینز» طرح می‌کنند، هم برای بزرگسالان جالب است و هم مورد علاقه ی نوجوانان است. مثلا در بخش نخستین: انسان چه کسی بود، نویسنده که خود از طرفداران فرگشت است، با بیانی ساده و جذاب نحوه ی فرگشت (تکامل) را شرح می‌دهد. یا مثلا در بخش: خورشید چیست، از داستان اسطوره‌ ها آغاز می‌کنند، و نهایتا به این می‌رسند که خورشید نه یک خدا، که یک ستاره است! نکته کتاب اینجاست، که تنها به علم زیست‌ شناسی (تخصص خود داکینز) و فرگشت محدود نمی‌شود. از فیزیک تا نجوم بحث می‌شوند. به‌ نوعی می‌توان گفت «ریچارد داکینز» سعی دارند در «جادوی واقعیت»، عقاید خرافی را از منطق علمی پاک کنند. ا. شربیانی"
1,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,4,"To be sure, I need to be clear as to WHY I like this book. It's not like any of the science or reasoning in it is new or unusual, or that I haven't heard many similar reasonings here or there all the way from high school physics courses all the way to certain and strange movies I've enjoyed.Why I do love this book is simple: it's clear, concise, and it does a very admirable job of setting up magical thinking in all its flavors against the fundamentals of science.It's a great primer. I think I would have loved reading this when I was 13 or 14. It might have even sparked my interest in science even more than I had been sparked... but that might not be possible. Science Fiction did a perfectly admirable job in that department, with Heinlein and Asimov as my tutors.Even so, apart from the things I've heard about of Dawkins, this is relatively mild in the religion bashing. He uses logic and reasoning, postulating clearly and setting up the universe as it is, not as we wish it would be. He also makes sure that Occam's Razor is quite sharp.I certainly have no complaints about this book, assuming I wanted a basic primer, of course.As for being an adult reading this? It's charming. It's somewhat magical in the sense that I draw a sense of wonder about the universe and our living within it. For that alone I would recommend it as a bit of light reading, assuming you're up to your science snuff. :)"
2,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,5,"A surprising number of scientists feel that Richard Dawkins does the public understanding of science real harm through his belligerent attacks on religion, which turn off a good half of his potential audience, but no one can doubt that he has a talent for getting science, particularly biology, across to a general readership. This is his first attempt at a children's book (or rather a 'family' book as it is aimed at a wider readership) and it has much to praise.The Magic of Reality is a solid feeling hardback, half way between an ordinary non-fiction book and a coffee table book in format. Every page is illustrated by Dave McKean, with a mix of full colour photographs and diagrams, and heavily stylised line drawings - these last were perhaps a little angular and abstract for the younger audience, but overall the illustration is a good balance of supporting the text without overwhelming the page.The approach that Dawkins takes is an excellent one, picking up on ten key questions of science - 'What is reality? Who was the first person? Why are there so many different kinds of animals? What are things made of? Why do we have night and day, winter and summer? What is the sun? What is a rainbow? When and how did everything begin? Are we alone? and What is an Earthquake?' Each of these starts with ancient mythical explanations (where there are any) then goes on to detail the way that science answers the questions, using the starting point of the basic question to explore many different aspects of science that can be sensibly linked to it.All this works superbly well. Although it seems slightly odd that biology comes before the more fundamental physics and cosmology chapters, the absolute gem of the book (as you might expect) is the way that Dawkins handles 'Who was the first person?' His use of a stack of photographs, stretching back into the past, one of each generation, is masterful, inventive and wonderfully eye-opening. I love the way he really pushes the paradox that every creature in every generation is the same species as the previous generation's photograph - yet over the millions of years we can see a progression from fish-like creature to modern human. If ever there was a single bit of writing that could totally wipe out anyone's objections to evolution it's this chapter. I loved it. It will really challenge the readers to think and will open their eyes.However, it's important not to let the brilliance of much of the book hide a couple of significant flaws. In terms of science content, the huge disappointment is that Dawkins doesn't mention much modern physics. Both quantum theory and relativity really don't get any coverage. Particle physics only gets a passing reference with a wimp-out about the author not really understanding quarks. This isn't good enough. Omitting quantum theory and relativity from physics is like missing evolution out of biology - it's that significant an omission.The other problem I have is with the final two chapters. Because there aren't 10 questions, there are 12. The remaining two are 'Why do bad things happen?' and 'What is a miracle.' The first of these isn't too bad as it handles chance, but both are primarily Dawkins returning to his bugbear of attacking religion. I don't think this has a place in a science book, and it certainly shouldn't be given two chapters. I think this will confuse and quite probably bore younger readers, as after all the other wonders, these two chapters are, frankly, lacking in scientific joy. There is also one very dubious part. Dawkins suggests that readers use a method of assessing miracles that boils down to 'How do they stand up to common sense?' The trouble with this approach is much of modern physics doesn't fit with what common sense predicts. For that matter, most probability runs counter to common sense. As Dawkins himself points out, common sense expects that after a row of throwing heads, a coin is more likely to throw tails - but common sense gets it wrong. It seems highly spurious to use common sense as a scientific tool, when you've just shown it fails magnificently.I still think this is a great book, and I suspect many young readers will simply not bother with the last couple of chapters. Covering all of science is tricky, but despite the failings in physics, the rest of the book is good enough to make this, without doubt, one of the best children's science books of 2011.(Review originally posted on www.popularscience.co.uk - reproduced with permission)"
3,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,5,"I am still sizzling with delight over my latest Dawkins' read - having soaked up its information like a hungry sponge. It leaves the reader totally awed and dazzled with the world. I’m humming with it. The birds (plump with protons and neurons, atoms and molecules) are singing louder than ever in the garden, and that amazingly mysterious and wonderful star that we call the sun, (roaring away converting hydrogen to helium), shines even more brilliantly in the blue sky as we make a sedate path round it's circumference, twirling round and round on our axis at a giddy rate of 1000 miles per hour. Thank goodness for the stickiness of gravity, and Mother Earth's determination to keep us clasped to her bosom. Ahhhhh ...this book has made me so happy. At last, a book giving a fantastic overview of science that I can easily understand. I obviously have the science age of a 12 year old (the age group that everyone says the book is geared towards....)Something is wrong in my lauding of this book though. Dawkins wouldn’t like it. The term ""Mother Earth"" smacks of anthropomorphism, and he ain’t having any of it. In fact a good fifth of the book is dedicated to the recounting of various myths from around the world – including what he considers the Christian myth - and at the end of every segment on myths Dawkins goes on to show how science is better. Much much better than myth.In fact I mentioned I was reading this book to a neighbour, and he said “Yeah, Dawkins – that’s the guy who keeps banging on against God.” To have a scientist and communicator of the calibre of Dawkins referred to in those terms is I think terrible, but he has bought it upon himself. He just cannot live and let live. In fact I have changed my mind about what I said in the above paragraph... I have since read the Wikipedia article on Creationism (see the paragraphs headed ""Creationism internationally""). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CreationismGiven the large number of people who support the idea of Creationism - it is very good that Dawkins is arguing against it..... But I still don't like a lot of his other criticisms and quips against religion.

Taken from Richard Dawkins.net. Anyway, to get back to the science. This book is a.m.a.z.i.n.g. I learnt tons, and loved every minute of reading it. The chapters have headings which speak for themselves…and also illustrate well the age group Dawkins is appealing to.*Who was the first person?*Why are there so many different kinds of animals?*What are things made of?*Why do we have night and day, winter and summer?*What is the sun?*What is a rainbow?*When and how did everything begin?*Are we alone?*What is an earthquake?There isn’t one single diagram in the book. He does it all with words - but he is an incredibly brilliant writer, and it is utterly memorable and fascinating. Time and time again he wrote about things that I'd previously only half understood, and made them crystal clear. I feel hugely grateful to him. Highly recommended."
4,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4149976-emily,3,"I'm a big fan of Dawkins ever since reading The Selfish Gene many many years ago. However, I was very disppointed in this book, which is so basic that it shouldn't contain surprises for anyone who graduated from high school. There were no surprises and nothing really new - the most interesting part for me was how each chapter is introduced with an example of a myth that people have made up to explain some natural phenomenon, which the rest of the chapter then explains. I found the majority of it plodding, basic, and disappointing.HOWEVER ... on looking over some of the other reviews on Goodreads, I see several people saying this book is intended for younger readers. There was nothing at all in the book's description on Audible that indicated this. However, if that's the case then it's a good, clear, basic introduction for a kid around 8-12 years old. On that basis I'll give it 3 stars. As an adult book, which was my expectation of it, it was very basic stuff and came across rather condescending quite a lot of the time. Marks against the publisher for not making the intended audience extremely clear in the summary."
5,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1789091-noah,3,"I live in the United States in the 21st century. There is no greater danger to our species and our civilization right now than religious crazies. How can we ask our businesses to change the way they do business so as to prevent climate change if half of the country doesn't believe in scientific evidence? Or worse yet, if they expect a big bearded man to come down and bail us out if things get too bad?What about the people who believe that the world will end, in the next few years, with a war in the Middle East? What if their faith leads them to believe we should go to war to make this come about?Yes, these are scary people and there are a lot of them.I'd like to think that Mr. Dawkins had these people in mind when he wrote this book. It may be too late for the current generation who have turned their minds off and handed over their rational thought in exchange for ""faith."" But perhaps the next generation can be saved in time, and with their help we CAN actually do the work necessary to make the world a better place?From that perspective, this is an important and incredible book. It is a blow struck for logic over foolishness.But all the way through, I did find myself having mixed feelings. I don't think Mr. Dawkins really understands the purpose of the old myths and legends. The distinction between fairy tales and mythology seems to be missing from his understanding. When the old stories about the ""gods"" and nature of reality were written, they were neither meant to be ""just so stories"" nor were all of them intended to take the place of science. While he chooses to use the myths throughout his book to make his own book more entertaining, he clearly looks down on them and shows no consciousness that there is a deeper level of meaning to be found in mythology: the realm of the psychological. I would suggest he sit down and re-read his Joseph Campbell. The mythological creation of the world, the end of the world, the nature of mythological reality was never meant to be science. It was often meant to represent the internal journey of mankind.On page 202 he writes, ""We don't have to invent wildly implausible stories: we have the joy and excitement of real scientific investigation and discovery to keep our imaginations in line. And in the end that is more exciting than fantasy."" Why do we need to keep our imaginations in line? Can't we mature to the point at which we are able to partake in scientific investigation on Mondays and mythological investigation on Wednesdays? Can't we be trusted to learn the difference and keep them apart?Science cannot help us with questions of existence. It will never help us with ""How ought I act?"" or ""What meaning can I find in my life?"" ""What happens after we die?"" ""How can I find happiness?"" But perhaps the ancient knowledge, allied with philosophy, can be of some use with these (more important) problems?There are snide remarks here and there aimed at Astrology, aliens, and such. He may be right about many of them, but the attacks lack any logical depth.Overall, I would certainly recommend this book to any and all children of the right reading level, but I would also want to talk to that child as they were reading it. Maybe take them for a walk in the woods and teach them about talking to the trees. There certainly is more in the world we actually experience than is dreamnt of in Mr. Dawkins' science.Dave McKean, as always, is a master. His artwork is well worth the price of the book all by itself. He gets 16 stars. "
6,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12885473-darian-onaciu,5,"As a wee child - no, I'm not Scottish, I just like how 'wee' sounds - I was introverted and could rarely feel at ease while playing with other children.Unfortunately that was a problem because, being human, I also didn't enjoy being left out of activities. All that changed when I discovered the magic of reading books - no, I didn't turn into a robot from the Dungeon Dimensions.Now, don't get me wrong, I wasn't a hermit and got my periodic dose of socialization - yup, sounds cringeworthy - it's just that I felt more at ease with a book because I could travel to new worlds, identify with heroes and villains, see with my mind's eye fictitious or real wonders - yup, way more entertaining than the games children usually play.While in secondary school I started with reading folk and fairy tales and at some point got to a book whose title would be loosely translated as The Legends of the Olympus.I liked it a lot and started wondering about truth, gods, superpowers and religions - you know, as all children do at some point.So I started asking questions and the more answers I received, being born in a country where more than 80% are orthodox, the more I was convinced that one of the best ways someone could get closer to the Truth and be able to better understand the world around us would be to become a priest.Being a respectable goal to pursue, my mother and grandparents, although none were regular churchgoers, encouraged me to do so. So I picked up a Bible and started reading it, only to discover it was full of metaphors and words that as a child I couldn't understand - so I got bored and put it down, nonetheless retaining my faith in a higher power.Years passed by and after the 8th grade national exam I got in at a very good high-school in my small town, in a class with a STEM specialization focusing on Information Technology and Mathematics.I was the odd duck from the class who excelled at English - foreign language - and Romanian - the national language of the country I was born in. I wrote poems depicting my teenage angst and some short prose - speaking of which, I'm sure I'd get a good laugh if I'd discover my 'writings'.I still liked to read but my reading habits, as far as I can remember, just exited the era of Jules Verne's works and gravitated towards books like Oliver Twist, White Fang, Robinson Crusoe and so on. But my reading habits were about to change due to a totally unexpected factor: my new girlfriend. We were classmates and she was a rare combo: one of the smartest and cutest - the best, if you're perchance reading this review (she liked to argue a lot). She was way better than me in STEM but I had the edge in humanities. She introduced me to J. K. Rowling, Frank Herbert, Carl Sagan and more.I really looked up to her.So when she told me she was an atheist and I told her I was a believer, well, the two hormonal teenage universes clashed and although I can't exactly remember, there is about a 100% chance we had an expletive filled fight about it.But with all our differences we cared about each other and continued being together for a few years.More than her looks and academic smarts I appreciated the books we shared and her astuteness in conversation.We talked about anything and everything debating pros and cons. It didn't matter if the subject was asinine or something crucially important like 'would someone after being subjected to teleportation be the same person or merely a clone of the original?'She pushed me out of my comfort zone, stretched my mind and I loved her for it.But belief was a touchy subject. Although I went to church only at special occasions throughout the year, I considered myself a believer. But I also considered myself a smart person who liked to read and ask questions to better understand the Universe.But what if those questions started to elicit uncomfortable emotions?Which identity would prevail then?Questions like: ""Why is there more than one religion?""""How can you tell that you believe in the right one?""""Wouldn't the time of your existence in history, the place you were born in and/or your parents influence your choice of religion more than your free will?""""If there is a God then why are bad things happening to good people?"" and so on.Had it been out then, this book would have been the perfect gift for me.In fact, if I could travel back in time I'd gift it to my secondary school self - though I'm sure he would only partially understand it - then travel a bit forward and hand it to my high school self.Be a kind person and gift this book to people who are curious and like to ask questions.I had to realize on my own through reading books, having interesting conversations and just plain living, that people are creatures of habit, that we act more on an emotional than logical basis, that there are a throng of cognitive biases which continuously incapacitate our decision making and obstruct our evolution. And make no mistake, changing one's mind is strictly a personal journey. But should we tolerate our faults by recognizing our limitations we can make tremendous progress and see the beauty of the Universe not through n interpretations of unchanging ancient texts but through the lens of the only incrementally self actualizing instrument: science.Jesus, this turned out to be a bit personal."
7,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76465748-hanum-salsabila,4,"4.5 ⭐I already read too much fiction this month, so i would try with some academic book. This book is so good. Dawkins made it quite fun, most parts of this book aren’t boring at all. The way he narrated this book is really humble, he isn’t patronized us the reader, and he admitted that he still didn’t understand some part and somehow made himself equal to the reader (of course he isn’t).However, i found a few other parts of the book is a little bit boring. Like the atom part, the explanation is quite long.I found many interesting information in this book like how to measure time in fossils with radioactive clocks using uranium-238, sun and it’s mythology, and also the question i’ve always wanted to know : who is the first person on earth? And the idea that auto immune disease could be a weapon to fight cancer is really fascinating. This book ends with my favorite chapter about several miracles and the possibility that really happened at that time. Well done, Dawkins. I would totally read all of your books."
8,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74466071-charlie-hasler,5,"I enjoyed this read very much. I have read The God Delusion but that is the only other Dawkins book I have read.I enjoy Dawkins ""right between the eyes"" style of writing. This is a superb read, very interesting and complicated science is broken down so even knuckle draggers like me can understand it."
9,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18959010-nihal-vrana,1,"This was the worst popular science book that I have read. It was lazily-written with no real structure rather than flimsy chapter beginnings with myths. The information in it was extremely random and superficial. I'm sorry to say this but it is nothing more than a rant of a famous person than a popular science book with an aim to inform its audience. I used to enjoy Dawkins' books back in the day; when they were about topics which he has a good grasp of (i.e. evolution). But I really don't like what he has become since then, a figurehead basically who does not refrain from giving his opinion on any topic at all. For example, his ""speculation"" about auto-immune diseases in the book shows that he really did not understand them very well, yet it did not stop him from talking about them. The beauty of science is that it never really needs to defend itself. The proofs it comes up with always speak for themselves. When you understand them thoroughly, you will be convinced anyway. So the science does not need ""Champions"", it convinces by evidence. But somehow over the last 10 years, Mr. Dawkins became a self-proclaimed champion of science which, as a professional researcher, irks me. The language, content and style of this book added to my dislike of him as a popular figure."
10,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1575042-antonia,3,"Great book: clear and accessible (not sure of the best age group, though). Kids are naturally curious and fascinated by how the world works. They're also susceptible to all kinds of nonsense, of course. This much-needed book fill s a gap between simplistic kids' books and adult science books. Also, we need books that help kids understand, not just the facts of the world, but how we know them and, more generally, how do we know whether something's true or not? And I should think this book would be invaluable to parents, a good many of whom could probably not explain natural selection, DNA, plate tectonics, or probability.Where else could one find so much in one book? And the illustrations by Dave McKean are astonishing —though somewhat overwhelming. Sometimes too large and distracting. I don't like the weirdly formatted titles with mixed, funky fonts in different colors and sizes (within the same title, that is). But that's me.I couldn't tell what age group he's addressing. I read somewhere that he's said about age 12 and up. But sometimes he sounds he's talking to six-year-olds. At other times, he uses terms like ""the scientific method."" Huh, what? The tone bugged me all the way through. The best children's books are those that don't talk down, that adults can enjoy just as much as a 12-year-old. I didn't (always) find that to be true of this one. I had some mixed feelings about the content, though — not the scientific content, but the way he makes fun of myths, etc. Okay, they're not literally true, but. . . . There's a difference between fairytales and mythology. As another Goodreads reviewer (Noah) has said: ""When the old stories about the ""gods"" and nature of reality were written, they were neither meant to be ""just so stories"" nor were all of them intended to take the place of science.."" The tone bothered me a bit, too. I didn't care for the authorial intrusion. Noah also quotes Dawkins here: ""We don't have to invent wildly implausible stories: we have the joy and excitement of real scientific investigation and discovery to keep our imaginations in line. And in the end that is more exciting than fantasy."" Noah then asks, ""Why do we need to keep our imaginations in line?"" Good point. ""Science . . . will never help us with ""How ought I act?"" or ""What meaning can I find in my life?"" . . . ""How can I find happiness?"" But perhaps the ancient knowledge, allied with philosophy, can be of some use with these problems. . . . ""I have no sense at all of how kids would respond to this (don't have any). I would love to see this book reviewed by some 12-year-olds.Apparently, there's a very cool iPad version, which I haven't seen. "

Maybe i am to young to understand everything so i think i will try again in a couple of years!"
12,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-again,4,"A good dose of reality for any youngster patient enough to read it. It's written in a style that is meant to help early adolescents make sense of the things they've been taught, and determine which ones are fact-based. It's a nice introduction to critical thinking, with a lot of science, a little history, and a smattering of myth. Be prepared to have your religious teachings challenged. This IS Richard Dawkins, after all."

An excellent gift for all occasions.Negatives: 1. The book is intended for a younger audience and covers briefly a lot of topics. If you are expecting an in-depth analysis. This is not the book for you. 2. No bibliography.In summary, a fabulous book for all to enjoy. I usually limit my purchases to Kindle books because of the convenience but I'm glad I was ""forced"" to buy this book in hardcover binding. It's a beautiful book inside and out. Substance finally matches style and it's a science book for all to enjoy and for years to come. There is a sense of awe, a poetic magic for reality. For all his knowledge, Professor Dawkins is humbled by what little we do know and how much more we need to find out about the world. It's precisely this drive to know more and that hunger for knowledge that I always wanted to convey to my children. Finally, I have a book that expresses my sentiments and I have Richard Dawkins to thank!"

I am glad to have found The Magic of Reality : How We Know What's Really True. Richard Dawkins is a British biologist. The book includes 12 chapters. Topics include evolution, natural selection, biology, cosmology and physics, but mostly importantly, what is scientific reasoning and how to tell reality from myth and imaginations.The message is clear: the reality itself is beautiful; it is wonderful to pursue scientific truth; we do not need supernaturals to make us feel special. I think these messages are important and relevant in an age where anti-science and conspiracy theories taking hold of our political and daily life.Richard Dawkins is an atheist and a vocal critic of organized religions. There are several mentions of bible stories but his tone is very mild in this book."
16,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2892211-jason-mills,4,"Dawkins here seeks to enthuse young minds about science: not only with its discoveries but as an approach to the world that is far more thrilling and fascinating - not to say productive - than the idle stories and easy answers of myth and religion. Indeed, it is inherently an encouragement to learn and to challenge one's intellect, rather than to remain ignorant.Each chapter addresses a question about the world: What are things made of? What is a rainbow? Dawkins commences in each case by recounting myths from around the world. He acknowledges that these stories are enjoyable and interesting, but he does not need to work hard to show their inadequacies as explanations. (Dawkins bundles in the myths of current religions with those of ancient or 'minor' ones, which is perfectly legitimate, if a tad mischievous; but he does not hammer the reader over the head with that angle: the word ""atheist"", for instance, does not appear.)Then follows the scientific view of the phenomenon in question, carefully and clearly articulated. Although generally well pitched for an audience entering their teenage years, his prose is sometimes a little demanding:The Chumash people believed that they were created on their island (it obviously wasn't called Santa Cruz then, because that is a Spanish name) from the seeds of a magic plant by the Earth goddess Hutash, who was married to the Sky Snake (what we know as the Milky Way, which you can see on a really dark night in the country, but not if you live in a town where there is too much light pollution).Somebody should have told him not to squeeze two or three sentences into one! Such lapses are rare, however, and the text is a thoroughly engaging read.Of course, it's only half the story. It scarcely does justice to Dave McKean's contribution here to say that he ""illustrated"" The Magic Of Reality: he has designed the book from cover to cover, winding the text in and out of the art, playing visual games, creating pictures in ethnic styles corresponding to the cultures whose myths are under discussion, and eloquently illustrating the scientific ideas. Admirable as the text is, it would form a far less lively book without this consummate, diverse and colourful graphic enrichment.Putting both together, this is a splendid celebration. It may be an unusually large slab of non-fiction for the average teenager, but those with the appetite for it will be amply rewarded."
17,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11940616-james,5,"I don't think I can put it any better than the quote from Ricky Gervais on the back of this book:""I wanted to write this book, but I wasn't smart enough. Now that I've read it, I am.""This is an excellent book even for those who like me, were generally familiar with most of the concepts tackled within it already. The trick to knowing whether you really understand something or not is whether or not you can explain it to someone else and have them understand it too. Before reading this book I'm not sure I could have done that, but now I'm pretty sure I can.The Magic of Reality is, as Dawkins describes in it's opening pages, an explanation of some of the most genuinely awe-inspiring things that science has discovered about both our world and the universe. From the first chapter on what exactly reality is (not as easy a concept as it appears) to it's final chapter entitled ""What is a miracle?"" (containing some well designed examples that link up neatly with the opening), it guides the reader through several concepts and discoveries including, but not limited to: who the first person was (spoiler: there wasn't one), why we have winter and summer (which was something I thought I knew but was completely wrong about), how the universe began and the misconception of asking why bad things happen.Most chapters open with some charming and interesting myths from various human tribes and civilisations throughout history about the subject that the chapter itself tackles. This is not only to show just what the human brain is capable of inventing (and believing), but to show that no matter what stories we may invent, the truth of what is really happening is far more enticing.Read it."
18,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10901897-alastair,2,"Whilst I would not dare to fault Dawkins' science, to describe his grasp of the role of myth and story in social evolution as 'limited' would, yet again, be generous. Philip Pullman is quoted in the cover: 'The clearest and most beautifully written introduction to science I've ever read.' Perhaps Mr Pullman read a pre-publication edition in which the writing wasn't dominated by a 1950's avuncular style, peppered with complex concepts and language, the understanding of which is assumed. Also to call this an introduction to science is, surely, to have misunderstood its purpose: demytholigisation. A task which I would actually have little problem with, were it not for the patronizingly simplistic approach to the myths themselves. Having said, that, the book is on my shelf (Dave McKean's illustrations, alone, make it worth keeping) and I will use it as a prompt for further thought on narrative approaches to the world - I will just have to fight the temptation to hurl it at the wall every six or so pages. "
19,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1026591-christian-mckay,2,"Hmm . . . Okay, let's get this out of the way first. Dave McKean's art is, as always, on point. It's worth the price of admission. I do find it strange to see a man, who brought so many of Neil Gaiman's fantastical works to life, turn around and help another guy DISPROVE FAIRIES FOR SOME REASON. But he's unbelievably good at lending visuals to big ideas. His illustrations of the myths Dawkins is shitting all over are just as captivating as his illustrations of scientific principles.Dawkins' prose is clear and concise, if a little stuffy. This is a perfectly fine refresher on the basics of the scientific laws that govern our universe. But when it comes to the beliefs of ""primitive"" people, he becomes patronizing, as if he's convinced that if he lived in ancient times, he would have solved the rules of the universe no problem. K, bro. And he sneakily weaves in his moralistic atheism throughout. I don't have a problem with atheism, but eh, it feels misplaced here.Finally, I'm confused as to who this is for. It's written like it's for children, but in a weighty package that feels better suited for adults. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I think I learned something new once every thirty pages or so. You'll know pretty early whether or not this book is for you."
20,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3898791-udit-nair,4,"After a long period of time I picked up Dawkins's work and it was indeed a delightful reading. Though largely the book is catering to younger audiences but still has learning for all ages. He delves into the magic of reality which is indeed the science. Here is an opening to the book:-"" The third meaning of magic is the one I mean in my title: poetic magic. We are moved to tears by a beautiful piece of music and we describe the performance as ‘magical’. We gaze up at the stars on a dark night with no moon and no city lights and, breathless with joy, we say the sight is ‘pure magic’. We might use the same word to describe a gorgeous sunset, or an alpine landscape, or a rainbow against a dark sky. In this sense, ‘magical’ simply means deeply moving, exhilarating: something that gives us goose bumps, something that makes us feel more fully alive. What I hope to show you in this book is that reality – the facts of the real world as understood through the methods of science – is magical in this third sense, the poetic sense, the good to be alive sense."" Throughout the book there is immense amount of discussion on evolution. Evolution through natural selection is indeed one of the greatest ideas propounded and ofcourse established through ample evidences. Also Dawkins takes digs at various myths and religions and this is expected from the author."
21,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27781063-dyary-abubakr,4,"Magic is a slippery word:  Dawkins wrote it is commonly used in three different ways, and the first thing I must do is distinguish between them. I'll call the first one 'supernatural magic', the second one 'stage magic' and the third one (which is my favourite meaning, and the one I intend in my title) 'poetic magic' What I hope to show you in this book is that reality – the facts of the real world as understood through the methods of science – is magical in this third sense, the poetic sense, the good to be alive sense... the kind I call poetic magic: an inspiring beauty which is all the more magical because it is real and because we can understand how it works. This book, which has twelve chapters and each chapter starts with a question, a simple question that one day myths have been created to explain it, a question like "" Why are there so many different kinds of animal? may has many myths trying to explain them, and that's what dawkins shows in every chapter, he shows you the myths that have been created to explain a natural phenomenon, they may be cute, delightful, fun , but not real and that's what dawkins is trying to show, he is trying to show whats really real, by only science , science is the way to find answers to these questions, and when we do, when we finally know the answer the nature you normally see becomes a magic, a magic of reality."
22,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,2,"I didn't like the approach of this book. I liked the God Delusion and I liked some of his other books on evolution especially The Greatest Show on Earth, but this one is kind of a bad combo of the two. He basically pits Religious and Mythical tradition against ""the Magic of Science and the reality of Nature"". Whether he meant to do that or not this is definitely the way it comes across and I think this is a terrible approach. I am a great lover of reading religion and mythical tradition for what it teaches us about people, about history and about civilized thought. I also believe that you don't frankly need to pit anything against nature and science to see the beauty of it. They both have intrinsically fascinating qualities and bring people a lot of joy and happiness in the experience. Whether or not you believe myths/religions as actual truth I think is somewhat irrelevant, they are still valuable to culture, tradition, and interactions with other people, in finding the way that shapes human thought. I just didn't like the way he went about the subject/topic at all in this book. I thought it a bit in poor taste frankly. "
23,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,4,"I enjoy reading and learning about myths. I devour a good ghost story. I actively seek out tales of the supernatural. But I also believe that the greatest magic of all is the magic of reality, and for that reason, I love science.This was a library copy, but after reading, it's one I'll purchase if only so I can have it around for the kids to thumb through. In fact, it is written in such a basic and easily digestible format that I am considering using in my home school curriculum.This beautifully illustrated celebration of science and its role in solving the mysteries of the unknown will likely appeal to readers who appreciate that things don't have to be unexplainable to be magical. It's not so much that there is anything new here for the science reader. It's somewhat basic. But it does succeed at reminding us that not knowing isn't a justification for making things up. Most science lovers already know this, still it was fun(and somewhat poignant) to read the myths people created before we found the answers. It's clear that as far as we come, we've got a long, long way to go."
24,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36755002-kacey-kells,4,"« We should always be open-minded, but the only good reason to believe that something exists is if there is a real evidence that it does ». Richard Dawkins’ aim is to promote rationalism and the scientific method (i.e. proposing a model and then testing it), rejecting myths and the supernatural. Hence, he addresses key issues such as: the evolution of species and natural selection, organic chemistry and Carbon based life, atoms (“what things are made of”), rainbows and the dispersion of light, the nature (and evolution) of stars, planets, galaxies, and the universe…But don’t be afraid to read this book! In spite of the great complexity of these issues, it is EASY to read.Frankly, I read Richard Dawkins’ “Magic of Reality” with pleasure; is it because I’m the daughter of a physicist? I do not know… but I recommend it strongly."
25,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"Another excellent book by Dawkins narrated by him & Lalla Ward, one of my favorite narrating teams. Dawkins covers a lot of basic science with its history. He tells a few of the legends about what various peoples around the globe have thought about natural phenomena & how science has found out what really takes place. It really is magical, in a poetic sense & he shows that very well. The universe is a fascinating place with a lot of questions remaining to be answered.He doesn't beat on religion too much in this book beyond pointing out how its explanations have been superseded by scientific discoveries. If you know someone who isn't well educated in science & wants to know a bit more, this is a great book to give them. That includes kids from about 12 & up. Dawkins is very clear & concise in his explanations. Highly recommended.Table of Contents:1. What is reality? What is magic?2. Who was the first person?3. Why are there so many different kinds of animals?4. What are things made of?5. Why do we have night and day, winter and summer?6. What is the sun?7. What is a rainbow?8. When and how did everything begin?9. Are we alone?10. What is an earthquake?11. Why do bad things happen?12. What is a miracle?"
26,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7006637-santhosh,4,"The book covers a lot of basic science topics in brief, serving as a good, clear, basic introduction to evolution, natural selection, genetics, molecular physics, cosmology, astronomy, plate tectonics and probability. While the stated audience for this book is 12-year olds, I would say it also makes a good read for intelligent adults whose science grounding is poor. The biggest current danger isn't kids not getting some education, but rather growing up into adults who falsely believe in religious dogma and wrongly assign the role of science only to laboratories and inventions - only to scientists. Adults would also do well to brush up their knowledge of the basics of our world and how these basics interact and add-up into the larger picture. To that order, this is an excellent book, one that I can ask anyone to be comfortable with first if they want to make conversation to me at the bar.As to be expected, Dawkins is in his element when speaking about his pet subject: evolutionary biology, where he draws a vivid and clear walk-through on evolution. The pieces on atoms and the forces that govern their world, speculations on extra-terrestrial life, cosmology, plate tectonics, and probability as related to 'life just is' are all excellent at what the essays set out to do: explain what they are. Overall, Dawkins is able to provide a simple and broken-down explanation of each of the topics, covering them from the individual components to the overall picture. I just wish Carl Sagan had been somehow involved in this, as he would have added his badly missed passion and child-like sense of wonder when explaining science - something which would have helped immensely to make this book, otherwise a little dry, more enjoyable.To me, Dawkins came across as fighting demons in his head while writing this book, by directing his answers toward an imagined audience holding on to their unscientific beliefs. The book thus comes across as a little contemptuous and confronting in its tone, which instead of being mildly mocking as intended, comes across as petulant and irksome while reading. For example, I'm sure that Dawkins understands what mythology is and its role in social evolution. To disdainfully table all of mythology as ignorant ramblings meant only to provide explanations of a particular natural phenomena is to underestimate and subvert the intelligence of our ancestors.In summary, an excellent idea behind the book, and in large parts follows through in the delivery as well."
27,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6068530-jim-whitefield,5,"Armed with the foreknowledge that this book is written to appeal to quite young readers as well as other ages, you will not feel Dawkins is as condescending in tone as you might otherwise be drawn to conclude. In my opinion, he does a marvellous job of writing in a fashion that will entertain and retain the interest of youngsters, whilst at the same time enthralling those of us who are of a much older generation. Beautifully illustrated throughout and with numerous wonderful photos as well, the book covers a dozen chapters on the reality of various interesting scientific aspects within which Dawkins also cunningly intertwines myths and legends surrounding them, including quite naturally, many biblical myths and legends which he phrases in ways that make them laughable rather than remotely plausible. Atheism permeates the book in a manner which is very hard to refute. He makes his readers 'think'. He is extremely adept at putting things into (simple) scientific perspective. He includes myths in pretty much every chapter, apart from the one on things so small you can't see them - and as he explains, there are no myths about them because, in terms of the evolution of human knowledge, until relatively recently, no one knew about them, so there are no myths or legends about them... simple when you think! He includes some internet links to YouTube material which are interesting, except unfortunately, the first one comes up with a notice that it is no longer available because of ""multiple third-party notifications of copyright infringement"" which is a shame as I am sure the publishers felt they had covered that. Perhaps it will get sorted out. Overall, whilst I already knew quite a lot of the things he talks about, even so, there was much I learned and I found the whole experience like being a young teenager again, learning from the best books, in the most interesting and informative - not to mention easy to understand - way imaginable. Well done Richard - I hope there will be more of these. Kids deserve such knowledge and perspective while they are as young as possible. This book should form part of the education curriculum worldwide. For me, this is yet another 'must read'. Brilliant."
28,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"I'm not entirely sure why I still read Dawkins' work. I think he's an extremely intelligent person, of course, and I've enjoyed reading books that focus on science by him -- I love The Ancestor's Tale, for example. But I hate the way that he cannot stop poking at religion, and I expected to hate it even more in a book called The Magic of Reality.Actually, he's more respectful than usual. It all seems rather toned down, since it's aimed at a younger audience than his other books (which is somewhat insulting in itself; I read and understood The Ancestor's Tale perfectly at the age of thirteen, and this book is aimed at 'ages twelve and up', I'm told). It can come across as condescending, though I rather appreciated the parts where he admits he doesn't know everything. It is accessible, for people of any age and any level of knowledge about science, covering basic topics like why we have seasons and what earthquakes are. It's quite enjoyable to read even though I don't think I learnt anything new, because it clarified things and connected ideas.He is, of course, scathing about religion and dismissive of any belief in the supernatural, but if you're planning to read Dawkins, you probably know that already."
29,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4796031-armin-books,5,"The Magic of Reality covers the very basics of what we know about evolution, astronomy, geology, physics and science in general. With its lovely illustrations and clear explanations, it's an amazing gift for children.I didn't include adults because I assume they already know these basic facts of science. In reality though, I've encountered people, even some college graduates who don't know these basic stuff. And, frankly, I find it astonishing that many adults either don't know anything about or care about science. I'm not talking about rocket science. I'm talking about the fundamental questions of where we come from, our evolution, the planet we live on, what are stuff made of ... Generally things any conscious being should be interested in. We are incredibly lucky to know much more, and to have some exciting answers to these old questions. In my opinion, it's one of the great privileges we have compared to our early ancestors and indeed the rest of life on this earth that come and go without ever knowing the reason for their existence. Anyway, that's it for my rant. The point is, go get this book for any young person in your life because there's nothing grander than the Magic of Reality! ;)"
30,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,5,"Target audience: The book primarily targets children and young adults, but it is good for adults who know little about biology as well.About the author: According to Wikipedia, Clinton Richard Dawkins is an English evolutionary biologist and author. He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford, and was the University of Oxford's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008. Dawkins is an atheist, and is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design. In his 1986 book The Blind Watchmaker, he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. He is an opponent of creationism being taught in schools. He has been awarded many prestigious academic and writing awards and he makes regular television, radio and Internet appearances, predominantly discussing his books, his atheism, and his ideas and opinions as a public intellectual.Structure of the book: The book has 272 pages and it is divided in 12 chapters, each chapter having a unique title.Overview: Dawkins says that it is unlikely for a supernatural creator of the world to exist. He contends that religious thought is merely a delusion. This is why nearly all of the chapters begin with a brief synopsis of creation myths in an attempt to explain various observed phenomena. He chooses these myths from all over the world, such as Babylonian, Aztec, Judeo-Christian, Ancient Egyptian, Japanese, Maori, Australian Aboriginal, Hellenic, Nordic, Chinese, and includes even modern alien-abduction mythology. But Dawkins not only enumerates myths, he has a special pleasure dismantling them. In fact, the entire book is a battle between myths and science, or fiction and reality.In early childhood every single one of us – including the author as we find out – asked ourselves: How does this work? Why is this thing here and not there? Why do birds have wings and how can they fly? Why the bear has the color it has?When we are young and naive, we give all sort of answers, one more ridiculous than the other. And the answers we give seem very legit. But, as we grow older and acquire more knowledge, the initial answers are no longer suited to explain reality. So, we abandon them and we try to find other answers for explaining what happens around us.The same it is with the difference between myths and science: myths are failed sciences which were useful in the “childhood” of mankind, when people used sticks to hunt for their prey or rocks to make fire. But now humanity is mature and myths and religions no longer have any utility; on the contrary, in most cases it slows down our moral and scientific progress. Indeed, reality has a natural capacity for beauty. It could be argued that reality – due to its complexity – is, in fact, more magical than any other thing possible. But nobody can deny that very minute phenomena were not known to archaic peoples before the creation of optical magnification devices. Moreover, many of them involve a god's symbolic act performed just once. So, any passages believed to be inspired by gods have not mentioned any knowledge as outside human experience. In this regard Dawkins provides the nice example of the story Cinderella. The little children, when this story is read to them, really believe that a pumpkin can turn into a golden carriage. But in the real world the Fairy Godmother is unable to magically make this transformation with his wand. This is because the pumpkins and carriages have an internal organization that is complex and very, very different. A large pumpkin is impossible to turn into a carriage no matter how well you reorganize its structure.In the later chapters Dawkins address topics that range from speciation and evolutionary biology to physical phenomena like atomic theory or plate tectonics. He declines to explain topics he does not understand. I love his honesty. He characterizes his knowledge of quantum mechanics as at best foggy. He does not attempt to appear more knowledgeable than he is in order to protect his ego. The book is also filled with interesting facts and I found it improved my knowledge of evolutionary biology without sounding like a text book. So, overall, as Dawkins says, a good way to tell if you really understand something or not is whether or not you can explain it to someone else and have them also understand it too.Quote: The truth is more magical - in the best and most exciting sense of the word - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.Strong points: Through brilliant examples and light scientific details Dawkins manages to make his points clear and complex topics easy to understand. Moreover, Dawkins's ability to pose the right questions make his writing a pleasure to read. I believe the layman – even an adolescent child – would have no trouble understanding.Weak points: If you are versed in science, this book will be indeed perceived as weak. However, for the laymen, it is a great source of information and entertainment at the same time. I personally enjoyed the book so much don’t remember any negative feelings I had while reading it._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"
31,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070035-kartik-narayanan,4,"In this book, the author, Richard Dawkins, explains various natural phenomena. He starts the book by identifying three different kinds of magic supernatural magic (things that happen in fairy tales, myths, religious texts etc.) stage magic (things that we know are false but are fun to watch - stage magicians for example) poetic magic (the kind of magic we use to describe our feelings about a great movie or watching a sunset or scenery etc.). Dawkins demonstrates that our ancestors used to explain our world using supernatural magic. He then explains it in the form of poetic magic (i.e. ""what is"" as opposed to ""what we think is""). He picks up the most popular myths and explains these with science. We get to see that supernatural magic is the fear of understanding while poetic magic is the joy of understanding. Richard Dawkins is the world's most famous evolutionary biologist. He is also one of the world's foremost atheists. He has authored many great books, including the ""The Selfish Gene"" and ""The God Delusion"". You have to read those books if you have not already. I consider him to be one of the luminaries of this century - on par with Richard Feynman and others - in popularizing science and reason`. A warning - he is an atheist and uses reason & logic to dissect superstitions and beliefs. So if your faith is fickle or offended, do not bother reading his books. But, you will enjoy his books and be a better person if you have an open mind. This book is meant for general consumption.I highly recommend reading this book. Dawkins explains scientific concepts brilliantly. This understanding leads to a greater appreciation of Nature and the Universe. He calls out areas where he is not explain things well (quarks for example). What is reality? What is magic? - explains the nature of reality and the nature of magic Who was the first person? - explores our origins Why are there so many different kinds of animals? - explores evolution What are things made of? - atomic theory Why do we have day and night, summer and winter? - the earth, sun and orbits What is the Sun? - stellar mechanics What is a rainbow? - optics When and how did everything begin? - Big Bang theory Are we alone? - Aliens and the nature of the universe What are earthquakes? - plate tectonics Why do bad things happen? - chaos What is a miracle? - science vs belief"
32,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"Something Dawkins stated in his book The Ancestor’s Tale has never left me: “My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely that they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world.” There is nothing in the holy books to compare with what science has opened up for human understanding of the world around us. I am humbled by my own ignorance of science but my ignorance doesn’t drive me to become anti-science. If your religion forces you to turn your mind away from science then it’s time to find another religion…or just drop your silly beliefs once and for all. I grew up in a Catholic family but I never for a single conscious moment believed in any the teachings held by the faith of my parents. I have never believed in a god, ever.I would like to add “and that has made all the difference” but simply being an atheist doesn’t get you anywhere on its own. For that you need to open up your mind and put your elbows on the table, as we like to say in Spanish about studying. It’s astounding to me that there are many, many people in the world today who don’t know why we have seasons, or that the earth is billions of years old, or that matter is made up of atoms. Instead, they cling to fairy tales written thousands of years ago to explain these phenomena.I have read things written by Muslims who try to show how the Koran explains science and how their prophet was centuries ahead of his time. Nonsense, just like everything in that book. The same is true of the Bible and the Talmud, and all the others. But don’t think of this book as being anti-religion but pro-mankind. And what is wrong with that? I am so tired of Dawkins’ critics labeling him as strident and belligerent towards religious people.If I were the king of the world I would make everyone read this book and then they would have to prove that they read it and understood it. After that, if you want to go on believing in the offal your religion sloshes out then go right ahead. Since I won’t be king any time soon then perhaps we can make this book available to every adolescent so that they can make their own choices because there are only two: myth or science."
33,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6031670-bruce-caithness,3,"The critical underpinning of science is brought to attention in ""The Magic of Reality"" as well as the wonderful list of findings that have been put forward by science. One cannot fault the book for lacking enthusiasm.Joe Barnhart in Karl Popper: Philosopher of Critical Realism made some nice comments that temper Richard Dawkins sometimes overly enthusiastic positivism.Myths graduate to science when they are open to being tested, science rests on a bedrock of mythology.Creationists who insist on classifying their views as ""scientific creationism"" may not know what they are getting into. Do they really want to assert that creationism is falsifiable? Do they want to try to expose its weaknesses and flaws? Do they seek to correct and revise the doctrine? As is well known, creationists take great delight in pointing out that the theory of evolution is, after all, a theory. But this should pose no problem. All scientific theories are theories. Do creationists want to say that creationism is a theory? Do they want to say that the notion of the Bible as inerrant revelation is a theory?If Karl Popper's analysis is correct, then both evolution and creationism are theories. The real question has to do with how well they are articulated, how well they serve to advance further research, and how well they survive rigorous criticism. The overwhelming majority of biologists and anthropologists have found creationism to be a poor rival to evolution in the attempt to expand our knowledge. Contrary to what some creationists claim, scientists tend to favor evolution as an explanatory theory not because of some presupposition that blinds them to the truth but, rather, because it is scientifically more fruitful than creationism and enjoys greater explanatory power."
34,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19638210-dane-cobain,4,"This book is a bit of a weird one because it takes the form of a series of responses to questions, and so every chapter in the book is based upon a question like, “When and how did everything begin?” It’s a pretty simple setup that allows Dawkins to tackle some of the bigger questions that people have, but it does also mean that it feels as though something’s somehow lacking.Don’t get me wrong, the science was solid and Dawkins made his arguments well, and I do feel that I’ve learned a bunch of stuff here. At the same time, it feels a bit like he’s set out to try to explain everything and then settled for just a few frequently asked questions. I’m not sure what he could have done differently though, because if the book was two or three times the length, it would have ended up feeling long and drawn out.Still, it was a pretty good way to keep my brain trained and to learn a few new lessons about science and stuff. This isn’t necessarily the best non-fiction science book on the market, but I polished it off in 24 hours or so and was happy with it, even if it was just okay. After all, I’m slowly working my way through everything that Dawkins has ever written, and this is probably one of the most approachable. All in all, I’m glad I read it and maybe you’ll like it too."

But otherwise good compilation of myths and their contrast with scientific reasons for various questions like origin of universe, man, etc. Scientific temper is necessary and that requires a skeptical mind. Denouncing myths is one thing, not understanding their power is another. Myths have the power to capture the imagination of the child. Not this book.Richard Dawkins has a good intent, bad execution. He needs to learn how to narrate, make science facts wondrous for the imaginative child. And imagination is being able to grasp the vastness of space or antiquity of universe. Imagination is how the primitive Earth might have been, how life might have evolved. None of the magic is exploited in this book.The author instead of exploiting the power of imagination goes on rambling against the fantasies of various mythologies.Where scientists like Einstein, Bohr, Oppenheimer, Arthur Clark, etc. have all drawn inspiration from ancient texts like the Vedas and the Gita, Dawkins dismisses them. He does not seem to understand the symbolism and takes them for the literal words, like a common man."

The only truly original presentation I saw, was the fantastic 3 mile deep family album.Unfortunately, for modern children, I don't think this is a workable delivery mechanism. Of course he tries to make it interesting, and the text format novelties and fantastic illustrations, show great effort. But it can't compete with video, and they're just too many words I think for children to work through. The words and the names are all quite advanced, so it's great education, but I don't know if modern children will ever learn all of these words.I do appreciate how he bundles all references to God in the myth sections."

I liked Hume's neat idea for evaluating the plausibility of a ""stated"" miracle. The writing is lucid and often witty; should be a great read for youngsters even."

The way he unwrapped some myths and miracles with the help of the science is really beautiful.

Reality itself can be only be explained through science, and scientific methods. What cannot be explained, can be explained in time to come! the machinery of (scientific) methods, is only improving to validate the phenomenon that are yet to be explained. Science is collaborative and unending in it's nature. It should be native to every mind, and should be accepted, and valued. Coming to the book now: I love Dawkins, not only he is humble in his untiring efforts to put 'educating the masses and improving scientific literacy' at top of his agenda, but also doesn't disregard the polemicists so immediately without putting forth a reasonable explanation (reasonable to reasonable people i guess), which I think is what makes him a better person also. This book is a comprehensive approach to understand reality through the lens of science juxtaposing ancient and present-day myths about them.Read it please, and read it to your children as well."

50,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32340477-patricia-lee,5,"As a work of non-fiction,The Magic of Reality: How we know what’s really true, by Richard Dawkins and illustrated by Dave McKean, is an app, where “reading relies on touch and manipulation”. (Bouchardon & Heckman, 2012). This text is Dawkin’s first for teenagers, persuading the reader that the reality of science is as ‘magical’ as mythology. The well researched content is clearly presented, however, on occasions, Dawkins resorts to first person thus detracting from the authority of the text as it reveals his bias.The new Australian English curriculum requires students to respond to and compose texts in different media and technologies. Whilst this text has been primarily written for teenagers, each chapter’s introductory segment retelling myths and legends is suitable for primary school students because the text is clear, the language succinct and the enhancement engaging eg the flames surrounding Hades. Science & Technology units, Primary Connections, are based on the 5e learning model allowing for segments of The Magic of Reality to be shared as a background resource to enhance student understanding in the Earth and space sciences strand. The digital affordances of this app allow for its use to explain scientific concepts across all learning styles eg. Chapter 2, blowing the iguanas across the water whilst avoiding the whirlpools; Chapter 3, the use of a slider to demonstrate the size of the stars. Callow (2013, p. 102) discusses the use of visuals in informative texts, supporting meaning.A linear reading experience is allowed when reading The Magic of Reality, as well as reading it as a non-fiction text by dipping into chapters. The digital affordances supplement the text without distraction. They are many and varied, strategically placed within the text primarily to explain scientific concepts, eg video to explain seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres. Many provide feedback, allowing the reader to repeat the activity to improve his/her personal result eg. Chapter 1, evolution through ‘breeding’ frogs to survive the snakes; Chapter 4, states of matter, firing Newton’s cannon to visualize gravity. Dawkins provides suggestions for the reader to further investigate eg an invitation in Chapter 4 to Google “Iron cold iron” by Kipling to add to the explanation of liquids, solids and gases; a reference to Earthsearch to further explain how big is space.The Magic of Reality is intuitive and easy to navigate, the reader is able to swipe down to view chapters and current position, supporting Jabr (2013). The full colour images and audio (read by Dawkins) are high quality when viewed on an iPad3. Will this enhanced eBook have longevity? A question difficult to answer, for at least two reasons. Firstly, science changes, as Dawkins remarks eg in Chapter 10, his references to earthquakes in Haiti and Christchurch, and Japan’s tsunami. Will this app be updated as required? A specific answer to this has not been found, other than updates provided through Apple iTunes. Despite this, The Magic of Reality is highly recommended for not only teenagers but readers interested in science. The app could be described as “Myth Busters meets Science for Dummies”.

52,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47528776-ibnul-shah,5,"This is one of the most amazing books on science I have ever read. Richard Dawkins' explanatory abilities are unquestionable; the way he explains complicated things is absolutely astonishing. This book talks about different topics of science in a very lucid way, and I think if someone wants a basic introduction to science, this book is an excellent option. The author says its intended for children aged 12-13 years- after reading this book, they'll clearly understand how science works and how to think and act like a scientist. The most important chapter in this book, in my opinion, is the second chapter titled 'Who was the first person?' where Dawkins explains evolution with interesting thought experiments and irrefutable logic. All the other chapters are also filled with exciting scientific elucidations of natural phenomenons, followed by the colorful mythical explanation of the same. The last two chapters were less science related, here the writer emphasizes more on making the reader have a scientific outlook on everything. I love how he ends the book: ""The truth is more magical - in the best and the most exciting sense of the world - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.""However, in some chapters, Dawkins' anti-religious sentiment was clearly exposed and I don't know how readers in countries like mine will take it. Moreover, chapters like 'what are things made of' or 'what is the sun' were pretty boring for me. So I guess these chapters would seem a bit uninteresting for an older reader who has basic ideas about science. On the other hand, it is because of these chapters you can call this book an introduction to science. But all in all, this book was a really pleasant read for me, and I'd say it is a must-read for every children as well as grown-ups with curiosity and enthusiasm about science."
53,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/845928-owen,3,"This book is aimed at teens, I guess, but while the science seems to be at the appropriate level, its discursive and rhetorical style are probably going to go over their heads. Dawkins' approach is to present mythical explanations for natural phenomena, followed by our current scientific understanding of what's really going on—the reality which is, in his terms, even more ""magical"" and wonderful than the myth. I'm dismayed that our supposedly advanced civilizations, particularly the US, are still so blindered by religion that such a book seems necessary and appropriate, but even so I think it would be best to put the dismantling of religious stories as secondary to the explanation of scientific realities: any teen who is going to encounter this book with an open mind will already be receptive to Dawkins' ideas, while anyone who actually believes any of the religious or mythic stories is going to be put on the defensive by Dawkins' attack.I guess this is the same problem even non-religious people have with other facets of the ""New Atheism"": it gets in your face as an idea whose truth requires the falsehood of competing explanations—and, however great your disagreement, getting in someone's face like that is just poor manners. The Magic of Reality is only very slightly boorish in that way, but I think it would have been a better and more wonder-full book if it hadn't addressed myths and religions at all, and just presented the ""magic"" of our scientific understanding of the world."
54,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,3,"The audio version of this book is read by Richard Dawkins and some other Lalla Ward. This is mainly relevant because it meant that I got to spend 5 hours listening to British accents. =)The book itself was good. Each chapter poses a question, gives some answers provided by traditional myths, and then talks about the real scientific answer. I'll lay out up front, that yes, Dawkins does use the Bible for some of his examples of myths, but except to the biblical literalists (especially of the Creationist variety), these are the parts of the Bible that are generally taken to have a mythical element.Also, while I'm on the disclaimers, this book focuses on where Dawkins does best -- explaining science in a manner accessible to the lay reader -- but it does veer just a little into rantiness in one of the later chapters.Moving along, the questions and answers presented in this book should be broadly familiar to anyone who had an retained a decent science education, but there was the occasional moment of ""so that's how it works!"" illumination. For me, one such moment was the explanation of why the angle of the earth relative to the sun makes such a difference in perceived temperature [1]. From an educational standpoint, I think that this would be a really great book to get for a high school student or even an advanced middle school student.[1] When the sun hits the earth at a shallower angle, the same amount of solar energy is spread over a wider area, so the energy received per square inch is decreased."

All my basic scientific knowledge, I have to say, was largely from the books of junior and senior school times and am afraid that I only got nebulous impression now.But the book, this book, the magic of reality still shocked me a little bit, not because of its abstruse contents but because of its simplicity. I guess it is a little book aimed at transmitting basic scientific knowledge to teenagers or young people. So it's another book on common sense.It is not as “prodigiously illuminous and beautifully designed” as it should be, but it's an amusing book and Richard indeed imbued the book with his hilarious humor, which really gave me a lot of laughters in reading.He would list a few mythologies or stories that precede his revealing of the true explanations of the question. And if you are discreet a bit more you would invariably find his “sarcastic tone” for people's beliefs and his ardent support for evolution.If you need to get some basic knowledge about how some natural phenomena happened or physics information such as elements or molecules, all such stuff could be found in the book with concise introductions.But if you want to know more about evolution, as a friend recommend to me, it's better to read his other works like ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution"" or ""The self Gene"" or some similar works from other authors .1.03.2016"

His book The Magic of Reality tries to explain in understandable ways some of the really complicated phenomenons of physics and science overall.In the midway of the book, I felt like back in school. Quite many things very familiar, but the way Mr. Dawkins explains those helped to deepen the understanding quite a bit.The book goes through topics all the way from big bang to evolution to quantum mechanics. So it is really comprehensive overview to the universe as we know it. I give the credit to him on explaining things in very understandable ways.Mr Dawkins is a know atheist and science believer. It really shows in the book. He dismisses all religions. He does admit that there are many things science can't explain yet, but he sees it only as a shortage of current science, not as a possibility for higher forces. Atheism actually came disturbingly through from all the writing. That's a shame, in science facts should be facts without personal believes.I have to still recommend to people who want to understand physics and the world better. I felt like getting a fast recap of learning's from physics from many years at school.

This would be a really cool textbook, or style for a textbook.The writing occasionally edges into the dry, but there are enough anecdotes and pretty pictures to make up for the occasional wall of text.My only problem is with his approach towards mythological stories. I like the variety he presented, but I would have liked more historical context behind the stories as well as the recognition that a lot of stories like the ones he shared were ancient people's way of exploring/explaining the world around them, even though they sound silly today. However, he does use the stories as a way of teaching logical, critical thinking, which I liked.Anyway, I wish I had known how cool science was in school. This book helped me clear up a few bits of confusion (mostly about atoms, because I pretty much just suffered through chemistry class blankly) and offers a neat perspective on the world."

I don't really see it as a book for children, I see it as a book for anyone who wants to think about the beauty of science and everything. It's a book that just consolidates what we already know - I didn't really learn anything knew from it, but I didn't expect to; I did find that the book helped me to pin down my thoughts on reality though, which is just what I hoped it would do. Of course, it's aimed at a younger audience, but that didn't lessen my enjoyment of it. I found it to be delightful, and thought-provoking. The illustrations by Dave McKean were super, and really enhanced the text. I will use this book when I want to talk to my children about science - they're a little young to understand these ideas just yet, but I'm looking forward to when they begin to question their realities. And I'm looking forward to showing them some proper evidence about why 'God' cannot exist - some damage has been done by school telling them that they're Christians! I hope I can undo it."

The author, Richard Dawkins has taken a step forward and cleverly illustrated the reason for things such as what is magic and reality ? who we are ? why we have winter and summer ? what is sun ? and many natural prodigies which one would like to explore. Almost every chapter starts with different myths that were registered by our ancestors in this planet however it’s the science and the scientists who applied the it and figured out the several factors that would determine the actual reason for the way our planet and things were formed and developed. The author has intelligently extracted required information from the world of science and clearly related to the things described in the book. I would happily add this book to nominate for book of the year 2016 :)Overall - Magic of Reality : Explore the realities of core things through the outcome of science in our planet and there is something amazing inside to educate ourselves beyond that as well :)"
60,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,5,"Target audience: The book primarily targets children and young adults, but it is good for adults who know little about biology as well.About the author: According to Wikipedia, Clinton Richard Dawkins is an English evolutionary biologist and author. He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford, and was the University of Oxford's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008. Dawkins is an atheist, and is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design. In his 1986 book The Blind Watchmaker, he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. He is an opponent of creationism being taught in schools. He has been awarded many prestigious academic and writing awards and he makes regular television, radio and Internet appearances, predominantly discussing his books, his atheism, and his ideas and opinions as a public intellectual.Structure of the book: The book has 272 pages and it is divided in 12 chapters, each chapter having a unique title.Overview: Dawkins says that it is unlikely for a supernatural creator of the world to exist. He contends that religious thought is merely a delusion. This is why nearly all of the chapters begin with a brief synopsis of creation myths in an attempt to explain various observed phenomena. He chooses these myths from all over the world, such as Babylonian, Aztec, Judeo-Christian, Ancient Egyptian, Japanese, Maori, Australian Aboriginal, Hellenic, Nordic, Chinese, and includes even modern alien-abduction mythology. But Dawkins not only enumerates myths, he has a special pleasure dismantling them. In fact, the entire book is a battle between myths and science, or fiction and reality.In early childhood every single one of us – including the author as we find out – asked ourselves: How does this work? Why is this thing here and not there? Why do birds have wings and how can they fly? Why the bear has the color it has?When we are young and naive, we give all sort of answers, one more ridiculous than the other. And the answers we give seem very legit. But, as we grow older and acquire more knowledge, the initial answers are no longer suited to explain reality. So, we abandon them and we try to find other answers for explaining what happens around us.The same it is with the difference between myths and science: myths are failed sciences which were useful in the “childhood” of mankind, when people used sticks to hunt for their prey or rocks to make fire. But now humanity is mature and myths and religions no longer have any utility; on the contrary, in most cases it slows down our moral and scientific progress. Indeed, reality has a natural capacity for beauty. It could be argued that reality – due to its complexity – is, in fact, more magical than any other thing possible. But nobody can deny that very minute phenomena were not known to archaic peoples before the creation of optical magnification devices. Moreover, many of them involve a god's symbolic act performed just once. So, any passages believed to be inspired by gods have not mentioned any knowledge as outside human experience. In this regard Dawkins provides the nice example of the story Cinderella. The little children, when this story is read to them, really believe that a pumpkin can turn into a golden carriage. But in the real world the Fairy Godmother is unable to magically make this transformation with his wand. This is because the pumpkins and carriages have an internal organization that is complex and very, very different. A large pumpkin is impossible to turn into a carriage no matter how well you reorganize its structure.In the later chapters Dawkins address topics that range from speciation and evolutionary biology to physical phenomena like atomic theory or plate tectonics. He declines to explain topics he does not understand. I love his honesty. He characterizes his knowledge of quantum mechanics as at best foggy. He does not attempt to appear more knowledgeable than he is in order to protect his ego. The book is also filled with interesting facts and I found it improved my knowledge of evolutionary biology without sounding like a text book. So, overall, as Dawkins says, a good way to tell if you really understand something or not is whether or not you can explain it to someone else and have them also understand it too.Quote: The truth is more magical - in the best and most exciting sense of the word - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.Strong points: Through brilliant examples and light scientific details Dawkins manages to make his points clear and complex topics easy to understand. Moreover, Dawkins's ability to pose the right questions make his writing a pleasure to read. I believe the layman – even an adolescent child – would have no trouble understanding.Weak points: If you are versed in science, this book will be indeed perceived as weak. However, for the laymen, it is a great source of information and entertainment at the same time. I personally enjoyed the book so much don’t remember any negative feelings I had while reading it._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"
61,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070035-kartik-narayanan,4,"In this book, the author, Richard Dawkins, explains various natural phenomena. He starts the book by identifying three different kinds of magic supernatural magic (things that happen in fairy tales, myths, religious texts etc.) stage magic (things that we know are false but are fun to watch - stage magicians for example) poetic magic (the kind of magic we use to describe our feelings about a great movie or watching a sunset or scenery etc.). Dawkins demonstrates that our ancestors used to explain our world using supernatural magic. He then explains it in the form of poetic magic (i.e. ""what is"" as opposed to ""what we think is""). He picks up the most popular myths and explains these with science. We get to see that supernatural magic is the fear of understanding while poetic magic is the joy of understanding. Richard Dawkins is the world's most famous evolutionary biologist. He is also one of the world's foremost atheists. He has authored many great books, including the ""The Selfish Gene"" and ""The God Delusion"". You have to read those books if you have not already. I consider him to be one of the luminaries of this century - on par with Richard Feynman and others - in popularizing science and reason`. A warning - he is an atheist and uses reason & logic to dissect superstitions and beliefs. So if your faith is fickle or offended, do not bother reading his books. But, you will enjoy his books and be a better person if you have an open mind. This book is meant for general consumption.I highly recommend reading this book. Dawkins explains scientific concepts brilliantly. This understanding leads to a greater appreciation of Nature and the Universe. He calls out areas where he is not explain things well (quarks for example). What is reality? What is magic? - explains the nature of reality and the nature of magic Who was the first person? - explores our origins Why are there so many different kinds of animals? - explores evolution What are things made of? - atomic theory Why do we have day and night, summer and winter? - the earth, sun and orbits What is the Sun? - stellar mechanics What is a rainbow? - optics When and how did everything begin? - Big Bang theory Are we alone? - Aliens and the nature of the universe What are earthquakes? - plate tectonics Why do bad things happen? - chaos What is a miracle? - science vs belief"
62,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"Something Dawkins stated in his book The Ancestor’s Tale has never left me: “My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely that they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world.” There is nothing in the holy books to compare with what science has opened up for human understanding of the world around us. I am humbled by my own ignorance of science but my ignorance doesn’t drive me to become anti-science. If your religion forces you to turn your mind away from science then it’s time to find another religion…or just drop your silly beliefs once and for all. I grew up in a Catholic family but I never for a single conscious moment believed in any the teachings held by the faith of my parents. I have never believed in a god, ever.I would like to add “and that has made all the difference” but simply being an atheist doesn’t get you anywhere on its own. For that you need to open up your mind and put your elbows on the table, as we like to say in Spanish about studying. It’s astounding to me that there are many, many people in the world today who don’t know why we have seasons, or that the earth is billions of years old, or that matter is made up of atoms. Instead, they cling to fairy tales written thousands of years ago to explain these phenomena.I have read things written by Muslims who try to show how the Koran explains science and how their prophet was centuries ahead of his time. Nonsense, just like everything in that book. The same is true of the Bible and the Talmud, and all the others. But don’t think of this book as being anti-religion but pro-mankind. And what is wrong with that? I am so tired of Dawkins’ critics labeling him as strident and belligerent towards religious people.If I were the king of the world I would make everyone read this book and then they would have to prove that they read it and understood it. After that, if you want to go on believing in the offal your religion sloshes out then go right ahead. Since I won’t be king any time soon then perhaps we can make this book available to every adolescent so that they can make their own choices because there are only two: myth or science."
63,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6031670-bruce-caithness,3,"The critical underpinning of science is brought to attention in ""The Magic of Reality"" as well as the wonderful list of findings that have been put forward by science. One cannot fault the book for lacking enthusiasm.Joe Barnhart in Karl Popper: Philosopher of Critical Realism made some nice comments that temper Richard Dawkins sometimes overly enthusiastic positivism.Myths graduate to science when they are open to being tested, science rests on a bedrock of mythology.Creationists who insist on classifying their views as ""scientific creationism"" may not know what they are getting into. Do they really want to assert that creationism is falsifiable? Do they want to try to expose its weaknesses and flaws? Do they seek to correct and revise the doctrine? As is well known, creationists take great delight in pointing out that the theory of evolution is, after all, a theory. But this should pose no problem. All scientific theories are theories. Do creationists want to say that creationism is a theory? Do they want to say that the notion of the Bible as inerrant revelation is a theory?If Karl Popper's analysis is correct, then both evolution and creationism are theories. The real question has to do with how well they are articulated, how well they serve to advance further research, and how well they survive rigorous criticism. The overwhelming majority of biologists and anthropologists have found creationism to be a poor rival to evolution in the attempt to expand our knowledge. Contrary to what some creationists claim, scientists tend to favor evolution as an explanatory theory not because of some presupposition that blinds them to the truth but, rather, because it is scientifically more fruitful than creationism and enjoys greater explanatory power."
64,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19638210-dane-cobain,4,"This book is a bit of a weird one because it takes the form of a series of responses to questions, and so every chapter in the book is based upon a question like, “When and how did everything begin?” It’s a pretty simple setup that allows Dawkins to tackle some of the bigger questions that people have, but it does also mean that it feels as though something’s somehow lacking.Don’t get me wrong, the science was solid and Dawkins made his arguments well, and I do feel that I’ve learned a bunch of stuff here. At the same time, it feels a bit like he’s set out to try to explain everything and then settled for just a few frequently asked questions. I’m not sure what he could have done differently though, because if the book was two or three times the length, it would have ended up feeling long and drawn out.Still, it was a pretty good way to keep my brain trained and to learn a few new lessons about science and stuff. This isn’t necessarily the best non-fiction science book on the market, but I polished it off in 24 hours or so and was happy with it, even if it was just okay. After all, I’m slowly working my way through everything that Dawkins has ever written, and this is probably one of the most approachable. All in all, I’m glad I read it and maybe you’ll like it too."
65,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3974523-prem-aparanji,2,"Not for young children. Teenagers maybe. But otherwise good compilation of myths and their contrast with scientific reasons for various questions like origin of universe, man, etc. Scientific temper is necessary and that requires a skeptical mind. Denouncing myths is one thing, not understanding their power is another. Myths have the power to capture the imagination of the child. Not this book.Richard Dawkins has a good intent, bad execution. He needs to learn how to narrate, make science facts wondrous for the imaginative child. And imagination is being able to grasp the vastness of space or antiquity of universe. Imagination is how the primitive Earth might have been, how life might have evolved. None of the magic is exploited in this book.The author instead of exploiting the power of imagination goes on rambling against the fantasies of various mythologies.Where scientists like Einstein, Bohr, Oppenheimer, Arthur Clark, etc. have all drawn inspiration from ancient texts like the Vedas and the Gita, Dawkins dismisses them. He does not seem to understand the symbolism and takes them for the literal words, like a common man."

The only truly original presentation I saw, was the fantastic 3 mile deep family album.Unfortunately, for modern children, I don't think this is a workable delivery mechanism. Of course he tries to make it interesting, and the text format novelties and fantastic illustrations, show great effort. But it can't compete with video, and they're just too many words I think for children to work through. The words and the names are all quite advanced, so it's great education, but I don't know if modern children will ever learn all of these words.I do appreciate how he bundles all references to God in the myth sections."

I liked Hume's neat idea for evaluating the plausibility of a ""stated"" miracle. The writing is lucid and often witty; should be a great read for youngsters even."

The way he unwrapped some myths and miracles with the help of the science is really beautiful. For examples, who was the first person in this world, What are things made of, rainbow, sun etc. It is one of the simplest book I have read that deals with physics,cosmology and evolutionary biology. I would give five star to this book."

Reality itself can be only be explained through science, and scientific methods. What cannot be explained, can be explained in time to come! the machinery of (scientific) methods, is only improving to validate the phenomenon that are yet to be explained. Science is collaborative and unending in it's nature. It should be native to every mind, and should be accepted, and valued. Coming to the book now: I love Dawkins, not only he is humble in his untiring efforts to put 'educating the masses and improving scientific literacy' at top of his agenda, but also doesn't disregard the polemicists so immediately without putting forth a reasonable explanation (reasonable to reasonable people i guess), which I think is what makes him a better person also. This book is a comprehensive approach to understand reality through the lens of science juxtaposing ancient and present-day myths about them.Read it please, and read it to your children as well."

80,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32340477-patricia-lee,5,"As a work of non-fiction,The Magic of Reality: How we know what’s really true, by Richard Dawkins and illustrated by Dave McKean, is an app, where “reading relies on touch and manipulation”. (Bouchardon & Heckman, 2012). This text is Dawkin’s first for teenagers, persuading the reader that the reality of science is as ‘magical’ as mythology. The well researched content is clearly presented, however, on occasions, Dawkins resorts to first person thus detracting from the authority of the text as it reveals his bias.The new Australian English curriculum requires students to respond to and compose texts in different media and technologies. Whilst this text has been primarily written for teenagers, each chapter’s introductory segment retelling myths and legends is suitable for primary school students because the text is clear, the language succinct and the enhancement engaging eg the flames surrounding Hades. Science & Technology units, Primary Connections, are based on the 5e learning model allowing for segments of The Magic of Reality to be shared as a background resource to enhance student understanding in the Earth and space sciences strand. The digital affordances of this app allow for its use to explain scientific concepts across all learning styles eg. Chapter 2, blowing the iguanas across the water whilst avoiding the whirlpools; Chapter 3, the use of a slider to demonstrate the size of the stars. Callow (2013, p. 102) discusses the use of visuals in informative texts, supporting meaning.A linear reading experience is allowed when reading The Magic of Reality, as well as reading it as a non-fiction text by dipping into chapters. The digital affordances supplement the text without distraction. They are many and varied, strategically placed within the text primarily to explain scientific concepts, eg video to explain seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres. Many provide feedback, allowing the reader to repeat the activity to improve his/her personal result eg. Chapter 1, evolution through ‘breeding’ frogs to survive the snakes; Chapter 4, states of matter, firing Newton’s cannon to visualize gravity. Dawkins provides suggestions for the reader to further investigate eg an invitation in Chapter 4 to Google “Iron cold iron” by Kipling to add to the explanation of liquids, solids and gases; a reference to Earthsearch to further explain how big is space.The Magic of Reality is intuitive and easy to navigate, the reader is able to swipe down to view chapters and current position, supporting Jabr (2013). The full colour images and audio (read by Dawkins) are high quality when viewed on an iPad3. Will this enhanced eBook have longevity? A question difficult to answer, for at least two reasons. Firstly, science changes, as Dawkins remarks eg in Chapter 10, his references to earthquakes in Haiti and Christchurch, and Japan’s tsunami. Will this app be updated as required? A specific answer to this has not been found, other than updates provided through Apple iTunes. Despite this, The Magic of Reality is highly recommended for not only teenagers but readers interested in science. The app could be described as “Myth Busters meets Science for Dummies”.

82,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47528776-ibnul-shah,5,"This is one of the most amazing books on science I have ever read. Richard Dawkins' explanatory abilities are unquestionable; the way he explains complicated things is absolutely astonishing. This book talks about different topics of science in a very lucid way, and I think if someone wants a basic introduction to science, this book is an excellent option. The author says its intended for children aged 12-13 years- after reading this book, they'll clearly understand how science works and how to think and act like a scientist. The most important chapter in this book, in my opinion, is the second chapter titled 'Who was the first person?' where Dawkins explains evolution with interesting thought experiments and irrefutable logic. All the other chapters are also filled with exciting scientific elucidations of natural phenomenons, followed by the colorful mythical explanation of the same. The last two chapters were less science related, here the writer emphasizes more on making the reader have a scientific outlook on everything. I love how he ends the book: ""The truth is more magical - in the best and the most exciting sense of the world - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.""However, in some chapters, Dawkins' anti-religious sentiment was clearly exposed and I don't know how readers in countries like mine will take it. Moreover, chapters like 'what are things made of' or 'what is the sun' were pretty boring for me. So I guess these chapters would seem a bit uninteresting for an older reader who has basic ideas about science. On the other hand, it is because of these chapters you can call this book an introduction to science. But all in all, this book was a really pleasant read for me, and I'd say it is a must-read for every children as well as grown-ups with curiosity and enthusiasm about science."
83,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/845928-owen,3,"This book is aimed at teens, I guess, but while the science seems to be at the appropriate level, its discursive and rhetorical style are probably going to go over their heads. Dawkins' approach is to present mythical explanations for natural phenomena, followed by our current scientific understanding of what's really going on—the reality which is, in his terms, even more ""magical"" and wonderful than the myth. I'm dismayed that our supposedly advanced civilizations, particularly the US, are still so blindered by religion that such a book seems necessary and appropriate, but even so I think it would be best to put the dismantling of religious stories as secondary to the explanation of scientific realities: any teen who is going to encounter this book with an open mind will already be receptive to Dawkins' ideas, while anyone who actually believes any of the religious or mythic stories is going to be put on the defensive by Dawkins' attack.I guess this is the same problem even non-religious people have with other facets of the ""New Atheism"": it gets in your face as an idea whose truth requires the falsehood of competing explanations—and, however great your disagreement, getting in someone's face like that is just poor manners. The Magic of Reality is only very slightly boorish in that way, but I think it would have been a better and more wonder-full book if it hadn't addressed myths and religions at all, and just presented the ""magic"" of our scientific understanding of the world."
84,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,3,"The audio version of this book is read by Richard Dawkins and some other Lalla Ward. This is mainly relevant because it meant that I got to spend 5 hours listening to British accents. =)The book itself was good. Each chapter poses a question, gives some answers provided by traditional myths, and then talks about the real scientific answer. I'll lay out up front, that yes, Dawkins does use the Bible for some of his examples of myths, but except to the biblical literalists (especially of the Creationist variety), these are the parts of the Bible that are generally taken to have a mythical element.Also, while I'm on the disclaimers, this book focuses on where Dawkins does best -- explaining science in a manner accessible to the lay reader -- but it does veer just a little into rantiness in one of the later chapters.Moving along, the questions and answers presented in this book should be broadly familiar to anyone who had an retained a decent science education, but there was the occasional moment of ""so that's how it works!"" illumination. For me, one such moment was the explanation of why the angle of the earth relative to the sun makes such a difference in perceived temperature [1]. From an educational standpoint, I think that this would be a really great book to get for a high school student or even an advanced middle school student.[1] When the sun hits the earth at a shallower angle, the same amount of solar energy is spread over a wider area, so the energy received per square inch is decreased."

All my basic scientific knowledge, I have to say, was largely from the books of junior and senior school times and am afraid that I only got nebulous impression now.But the book, this book, the magic of reality still shocked me a little bit, not because of its abstruse contents but because of its simplicity. I guess it is a little book aimed at transmitting basic scientific knowledge to teenagers or young people. So it's another book on common sense.It is not as “prodigiously illuminous and beautifully designed” as it should be, but it's an amusing book and Richard indeed imbued the book with his hilarious humor, which really gave me a lot of laughters in reading.He would list a few mythologies or stories that precede his revealing of the true explanations of the question. And if you are discreet a bit more you would invariably find his “sarcastic tone” for people's beliefs and his ardent support for evolution.If you need to get some basic knowledge about how some natural phenomena happened or physics information such as elements or molecules, all such stuff could be found in the book with concise introductions.But if you want to know more about evolution, as a friend recommend to me, it's better to read his other works like ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution"" or ""The self Gene"" or some similar works from other authors .1.03.2016"

His book The Magic of Reality tries to explain in understandable ways some of the really complicated phenomenons of physics and science overall.In the midway of the book, I felt like back in school. Quite many things very familiar, but the way Mr. Dawkins explains those helped to deepen the understanding quite a bit.The book goes through topics all the way from big bang to evolution to quantum mechanics. So it is really comprehensive overview to the universe as we know it. I give the credit to him on explaining things in very understandable ways.Mr Dawkins is a know atheist and science believer. It really shows in the book. He dismisses all religions. He does admit that there are many things science can't explain yet, but he sees it only as a shortage of current science, not as a possibility for higher forces. Atheism actually came disturbingly through from all the writing. That's a shame, in science facts should be facts without personal believes.I have to still recommend to people who want to understand physics and the world better. I felt like getting a fast recap of learning's from physics from many years at school.

This would be a really cool textbook, or style for a textbook.The writing occasionally edges into the dry, but there are enough anecdotes and pretty pictures to make up for the occasional wall of text.My only problem is with his approach towards mythological stories. I like the variety he presented, but I would have liked more historical context behind the stories as well as the recognition that a lot of stories like the ones he shared were ancient people's way of exploring/explaining the world around them, even though they sound silly today. However, he does use the stories as a way of teaching logical, critical thinking, which I liked.Anyway, I wish I had known how cool science was in school. This book helped me clear up a few bits of confusion (mostly about atoms, because I pretty much just suffered through chemistry class blankly) and offers a neat perspective on the world."

I don't really see it as a book for children, I see it as a book for anyone who wants to think about the beauty of science and everything. It's a book that just consolidates what we already know - I didn't really learn anything knew from it, but I didn't expect to; I did find that the book helped me to pin down my thoughts on reality though, which is just what I hoped it would do. Of course, it's aimed at a younger audience, but that didn't lessen my enjoyment of it. I found it to be delightful, and thought-provoking. The illustrations by Dave McKean were super, and really enhanced the text. I will use this book when I want to talk to my children about science - they're a little young to understand these ideas just yet, but I'm looking forward to when they begin to question their realities. And I'm looking forward to showing them some proper evidence about why 'God' cannot exist - some damage has been done by school telling them that they're Christians! I hope I can undo it."

The author, Richard Dawkins has taken a step forward and cleverly illustrated the reason for things such as what is magic and reality ? who we are ? why we have winter and summer ? what is sun ? and many natural prodigies which one would like to explore. Almost every chapter starts with different myths that were registered by our ancestors in this planet however it’s the science and the scientists who applied the it and figured out the several factors that would determine the actual reason for the way our planet and things were formed and developed. The author has intelligently extracted required information from the world of science and clearly related to the things described in the book. I would happily add this book to nominate for book of the year 2016 :)Overall - Magic of Reality : Explore the realities of core things through the outcome of science in our planet and there is something amazing inside to educate ourselves beyond that as well :)"

He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford, and was the University of Oxford's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008. Dawkins is an atheist, and is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design. In his 1986 book The Blind Watchmaker, he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. He is an opponent of creationism being taught in schools. He has been awarded many prestigious academic and writing awards and he makes regular television, radio and Internet appearances, predominantly discussing his books, his atheism, and his ideas and opinions as a public intellectual.Structure of the book: The book has 272 pages and it is divided in 12 chapters, each chapter having a unique title.Overview: Dawkins says that it is unlikely for a supernatural creator of the world to exist. He contends that religious thought is merely a delusion. This is why nearly all of the chapters begin with a brief synopsis of creation myths in an attempt to explain various observed phenomena. He chooses these myths from all over the world, such as Babylonian, Aztec, Judeo-Christian, Ancient Egyptian, Japanese, Maori, Australian Aboriginal, Hellenic, Nordic, Chinese, and includes even modern alien-abduction mythology. But Dawkins not only enumerates myths, he has a special pleasure dismantling them. In fact, the entire book is a battle between myths and science, or fiction and reality.In early childhood every single one of us – including the author as we find out – asked ourselves: How does this work? Why is this thing here and not there? Why do birds have wings and how can they fly? Why the bear has the color it has?When we are young and naive, we give all sort of answers, one more ridiculous than the other. And the answers we give seem very legit. But, as we grow older and acquire more knowledge, the initial answers are no longer suited to explain reality. So, we abandon them and we try to find other answers for explaining what happens around us.The same it is with the difference between myths and science: myths are failed sciences which were useful in the “childhood” of mankind, when people used sticks to hunt for their prey or rocks to make fire. But now humanity is mature and myths and religions no longer have any utility; on the contrary, in most cases it slows down our moral and scientific progress. Indeed, reality has a natural capacity for beauty. It could be argued that reality – due to its complexity – is, in fact, more magical than any other thing possible. But nobody can deny that very minute phenomena were not known to archaic peoples before the creation of optical magnification devices. Moreover, many of them involve a god's symbolic act performed just once. So, any passages believed to be inspired by gods have not mentioned any knowledge as outside human experience. In this regard Dawkins provides the nice example of the story Cinderella. The little children, when this story is read to them, really believe that a pumpkin can turn into a golden carriage. But in the real world the Fairy Godmother is unable to magically make this transformation with his wand. This is because the pumpkins and carriages have an internal organization that is complex and very, very different. A large pumpkin is impossible to turn into a carriage no matter how well you reorganize its structure.In the later chapters Dawkins address topics that range from speciation and evolutionary biology to physical phenomena like atomic theory or plate tectonics. He declines to explain topics he does not understand. I love his honesty. He characterizes his knowledge of quantum mechanics as at best foggy. He does not attempt to appear more knowledgeable than he is in order to protect his ego. The book is also filled with interesting facts and I found it improved my knowledge of evolutionary biology without sounding like a text book. So, overall, as Dawkins says, a good way to tell if you really understand something or not is whether or not you can explain it to someone else and have them also understand it too.Quote: The truth is more magical - in the best and most exciting sense of the word - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.Strong points: Through brilliant examples and light scientific details Dawkins manages to make his points clear and complex topics easy to understand. Moreover, Dawkins's ability to pose the right questions make his writing a pleasure to read. I believe the layman – even an adolescent child – would have no trouble understanding.Weak points: If you are versed in science, this book will be indeed perceived as weak. However, for the laymen, it is a great source of information and entertainment at the same time. I personally enjoyed the book so much don’t remember any negative feelings I had while reading it._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"
91,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070035-kartik-narayanan,4,"In this book, the author, Richard Dawkins, explains various natural phenomena. He starts the book by identifying three different kinds of magic supernatural magic (things that happen in fairy tales, myths, religious texts etc.) stage magic (things that we know are false but are fun to watch - stage magicians for example) poetic magic (the kind of magic we use to describe our feelings about a great movie or watching a sunset or scenery etc.). Dawkins demonstrates that our ancestors used to explain our world using supernatural magic. He then explains it in the form of poetic magic (i.e. ""what is"" as opposed to ""what we think is""). He picks up the most popular myths and explains these with science. We get to see that supernatural magic is the fear of understanding while poetic magic is the joy of understanding. Richard Dawkins is the world's most famous evolutionary biologist. He is also one of the world's foremost atheists. He has authored many great books, including the ""The Selfish Gene"" and ""The God Delusion"". You have to read those books if you have not already. I consider him to be one of the luminaries of this century - on par with Richard Feynman and others - in popularizing science and reason`. A warning - he is an atheist and uses reason & logic to dissect superstitions and beliefs. So if your faith is fickle or offended, do not bother reading his books. But, you will enjoy his books and be a better person if you have an open mind. This book is meant for general consumption.I highly recommend reading this book. Dawkins explains scientific concepts brilliantly. This understanding leads to a greater appreciation of Nature and the Universe. He calls out areas where he is not explain things well (quarks for example). What is reality? What is magic? - explains the nature of reality and the nature of magic Who was the first person? - explores our origins Why are there so many different kinds of animals? - explores evolution What are things made of? - atomic theory Why do we have day and night, summer and winter? - the earth, sun and orbits What is the Sun? - stellar mechanics What is a rainbow? - optics When and how did everything begin? - Big Bang theory Are we alone? - Aliens and the nature of the universe What are earthquakes? - plate tectonics Why do bad things happen? - chaos What is a miracle? - science vs belief"
92,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"Something Dawkins stated in his book The Ancestor’s Tale has never left me: “My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely that they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world.” There is nothing in the holy books to compare with what science has opened up for human understanding of the world around us. I am humbled by my own ignorance of science but my ignorance doesn’t drive me to become anti-science. If your religion forces you to turn your mind away from science then it’s time to find another religion…or just drop your silly beliefs once and for all. I grew up in a Catholic family but I never for a single conscious moment believed in any the teachings held by the faith of my parents. I have never believed in a god, ever.I would like to add “and that has made all the difference” but simply being an atheist doesn’t get you anywhere on its own. For that you need to open up your mind and put your elbows on the table, as we like to say in Spanish about studying. It’s astounding to me that there are many, many people in the world today who don’t know why we have seasons, or that the earth is billions of years old, or that matter is made up of atoms. Instead, they cling to fairy tales written thousands of years ago to explain these phenomena.I have read things written by Muslims who try to show how the Koran explains science and how their prophet was centuries ahead of his time. Nonsense, just like everything in that book. The same is true of the Bible and the Talmud, and all the others. But don’t think of this book as being anti-religion but pro-mankind. And what is wrong with that? I am so tired of Dawkins’ critics labeling him as strident and belligerent towards religious people.If I were the king of the world I would make everyone read this book and then they would have to prove that they read it and understood it. After that, if you want to go on believing in the offal your religion sloshes out then go right ahead. Since I won’t be king any time soon then perhaps we can make this book available to every adolescent so that they can make their own choices because there are only two: myth or science."
93,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6031670-bruce-caithness,3,"The critical underpinning of science is brought to attention in ""The Magic of Reality"" as well as the wonderful list of findings that have been put forward by science. One cannot fault the book for lacking enthusiasm.Joe Barnhart in Karl Popper: Philosopher of Critical Realism made some nice comments that temper Richard Dawkins sometimes overly enthusiastic positivism.Myths graduate to science when they are open to being tested, science rests on a bedrock of mythology.Creationists who insist on classifying their views as ""scientific creationism"" may not know what they are getting into. Do they really want to assert that creationism is falsifiable? Do they want to try to expose its weaknesses and flaws? Do they seek to correct and revise the doctrine? As is well known, creationists take great delight in pointing out that the theory of evolution is, after all, a theory. But this should pose no problem. All scientific theories are theories. Do creationists want to say that creationism is a theory? Do they want to say that the notion of the Bible as inerrant revelation is a theory?If Karl Popper's analysis is correct, then both evolution and creationism are theories. The real question has to do with how well they are articulated, how well they serve to advance further research, and how well they survive rigorous criticism. The overwhelming majority of biologists and anthropologists have found creationism to be a poor rival to evolution in the attempt to expand our knowledge. Contrary to what some creationists claim, scientists tend to favor evolution as an explanatory theory not because of some presupposition that blinds them to the truth but, rather, because it is scientifically more fruitful than creationism and enjoys greater explanatory power."
94,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19638210-dane-cobain,4,"This book is a bit of a weird one because it takes the form of a series of responses to questions, and so every chapter in the book is based upon a question like, “When and how did everything begin?” It’s a pretty simple setup that allows Dawkins to tackle some of the bigger questions that people have, but it does also mean that it feels as though something’s somehow lacking.Don’t get me wrong, the science was solid and Dawkins made his arguments well, and I do feel that I’ve learned a bunch of stuff here. At the same time, it feels a bit like he’s set out to try to explain everything and then settled for just a few frequently asked questions. I’m not sure what he could have done differently though, because if the book was two or three times the length, it would have ended up feeling long and drawn out.Still, it was a pretty good way to keep my brain trained and to learn a few new lessons about science and stuff. This isn’t necessarily the best non-fiction science book on the market, but I polished it off in 24 hours or so and was happy with it, even if it was just okay. After all, I’m slowly working my way through everything that Dawkins has ever written, and this is probably one of the most approachable. All in all, I’m glad I read it and maybe you’ll like it too."
95,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3974523-prem-aparanji,2,"Not for young children. Teenagers maybe. But otherwise good compilation of myths and their contrast with scientific reasons for various questions like origin of universe, man, etc. Scientific temper is necessary and that requires a skeptical mind. Denouncing myths is one thing, not understanding their power is another. Myths have the power to capture the imagination of the child. Not this book.Richard Dawkins has a good intent, bad execution. He needs to learn how to narrate, make science facts wondrous for the imaginative child. And imagination is being able to grasp the vastness of space or antiquity of universe. Imagination is how the primitive Earth might have been, how life might have evolved. None of the magic is exploited in this book.The author instead of exploiting the power of imagination goes on rambling against the fantasies of various mythologies.Where scientists like Einstein, Bohr, Oppenheimer, Arthur Clark, etc. have all drawn inspiration from ancient texts like the Vedas and the Gita, Dawkins dismisses them. He does not seem to understand the symbolism and takes them for the literal words, like a common man."
96,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3363047-karel-baloun,4,"This is a fine capstone book for Richard Dawkins illustrious career; I can't think of how it could be better.He bounces back-and-forth between myth and reality, and leaves us hopeful that tomorrow's reality will look like magic to us.Yet, as a science interested adult, it seemed to me that I knew every fact and every story in the book, perhaps because cosmos told so many, or because it's hard to be original in these foundational science areas with the Internet. The only truly original presentation I saw, was the fantastic 3 mile deep family album.Unfortunately, for modern children, I don't think this is a workable delivery mechanism. Of course he tries to make it interesting, and the text format novelties and fantastic illustrations, show great effort. But it can't compete with video, and they're just too many words I think for children to work through. The words and the names are all quite advanced, so it's great education, but I don't know if modern children will ever learn all of these words.I do appreciate how he bundles all references to God in the myth sections."
97,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14258644-mohammad-tanviruzzaman,4,"Science's explanation can be more beautiful and amazing than any myth, miracle, or magic: Dawkins makes this point by picking up a series of questions (like: what is real? what is a rainbow? why do we have night and day, summer and winter? who is the first person? why are there so many kinds of life-forms? etc.), which haunt many of us time and again, and then he presents what the myths have to offer as the answer to each of those questions and what science has to offer; and through this journey one is introduced to a lot of important stuffs about science and moreover the way scientists go about applying scientific method to come up with answers. I liked Hume's neat idea for evaluating the plausibility of a ""stated"" miracle. The writing is lucid and often witty; should be a great read for youngsters even."
98,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34211369-mukesh-emes,5,"In this book Richard Dawkins did a great job in breaking all the religious belief about the evolution of world. The way he unwrapped some myths and miracles with the help of the science is really beautiful. For examples, who was the first person in this world, What are things made of, rainbow, sun etc. It is one of the simplest book I have read that deals with physics,cosmology and evolutionary biology. I would give five star to this book."

There isn't much here that should be new to the average intellectually curious adult, but I can certainly see myself enjoying this book at age 10 (I'm not entirely sure I was able to read English at that age, but presumably a translation is forthcoming). McKean's illustrations are sometimes weirder than they strictly need to be, maybe."

Reality itself can be only be explained through science, and scientific methods. What cannot be explained, can be explained in time to come! the machinery of (scientific) methods, is only improving to validate the phenomenon that are yet to be explained. Science is collaborative and unending in it's nature. It should be native to every mind, and should be accepted, and valued. Coming to the book now: I love Dawkins, not only he is humble in his untiring efforts to put 'educating the masses and improving scientific literacy' at top of his agenda, but also doesn't disregard the polemicists so immediately without putting forth a reasonable explanation (reasonable to reasonable people i guess), which I think is what makes him a better person also. This book is a comprehensive approach to understand reality through the lens of science juxtaposing ancient and present-day myths about them.Read it please, and read it to your children as well."

In fact, the audience for this book seems to be people with shockingly little education as almost all the information contained in it is stuff a person should learn by the end of high school, stuff like ""what is an earthquake?"", ""what is a rainbow?"", the basics of evolution and gravity and other stuff like that.

(Bouchardon & Heckman, 2012). This text is Dawkin’s first for teenagers, persuading the reader that the reality of science is as ‘magical’ as mythology. The well researched content is clearly presented, however, on occasions, Dawkins resorts to first person thus detracting from the authority of the text as it reveals his bias.The new Australian English curriculum requires students to respond to and compose texts in different media and technologies. Whilst this text has been primarily written for teenagers, each chapter’s introductory segment retelling myths and legends is suitable for primary school students because the text is clear, the language succinct and the enhancement engaging eg the flames surrounding Hades. Science & Technology units, Primary Connections, are based on the 5e learning model allowing for segments of The Magic of Reality to be shared as a background resource to enhance student understanding in the Earth and space sciences strand. The digital affordances of this app allow for its use to explain scientific concepts across all learning styles eg. Chapter 2, blowing the iguanas across the water whilst avoiding the whirlpools; Chapter 3, the use of a slider to demonstrate the size of the stars. Callow (2013, p. 102) discusses the use of visuals in informative texts, supporting meaning.A linear reading experience is allowed when reading The Magic of Reality, as well as reading it as a non-fiction text by dipping into chapters. The digital affordances supplement the text without distraction. They are many and varied, strategically placed within the text primarily to explain scientific concepts, eg video to explain seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres. Many provide feedback, allowing the reader to repeat the activity to improve his/her personal result eg. Chapter 1, evolution through ‘breeding’ frogs to survive the snakes; Chapter 4, states of matter, firing Newton’s cannon to visualize gravity. Dawkins provides suggestions for the reader to further investigate eg an invitation in Chapter 4 to Google “Iron cold iron” by Kipling to add to the explanation of liquids, solids and gases; a reference to Earthsearch to further explain how big is space.The Magic of Reality is intuitive and easy to navigate, the reader is able to swipe down to view chapters and current position, supporting Jabr (2013). The full colour images and audio (read by Dawkins) are high quality when viewed on an iPad3. Will this enhanced eBook have longevity? A question difficult to answer, for at least two reasons. Firstly, science changes, as Dawkins remarks eg in Chapter 10, his references to earthquakes in Haiti and Christchurch, and Japan’s tsunami. Will this app be updated as required? A specific answer to this has not been found, other than updates provided through Apple iTunes. Despite this, The Magic of Reality is highly recommended for not only teenagers but readers interested in science. The app could be described as “Myth Busters meets Science for Dummies”.

112,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47528776-ibnul-shah,5,"This is one of the most amazing books on science I have ever read. Richard Dawkins' explanatory abilities are unquestionable; the way he explains complicated things is absolutely astonishing. This book talks about different topics of science in a very lucid way, and I think if someone wants a basic introduction to science, this book is an excellent option. The author says its intended for children aged 12-13 years- after reading this book, they'll clearly understand how science works and how to think and act like a scientist. The most important chapter in this book, in my opinion, is the second chapter titled 'Who was the first person?' where Dawkins explains evolution with interesting thought experiments and irrefutable logic. All the other chapters are also filled with exciting scientific elucidations of natural phenomenons, followed by the colorful mythical explanation of the same. The last two chapters were less science related, here the writer emphasizes more on making the reader have a scientific outlook on everything. I love how he ends the book: ""The truth is more magical - in the best and the most exciting sense of the world - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.""However, in some chapters, Dawkins' anti-religious sentiment was clearly exposed and I don't know how readers in countries like mine will take it. Moreover, chapters like 'what are things made of' or 'what is the sun' were pretty boring for me. So I guess these chapters would seem a bit uninteresting for an older reader who has basic ideas about science. On the other hand, it is because of these chapters you can call this book an introduction to science. But all in all, this book was a really pleasant read for me, and I'd say it is a must-read for every children as well as grown-ups with curiosity and enthusiasm about science."
113,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/845928-owen,3,"This book is aimed at teens, I guess, but while the science seems to be at the appropriate level, its discursive and rhetorical style are probably going to go over their heads. Dawkins' approach is to present mythical explanations for natural phenomena, followed by our current scientific understanding of what's really going on—the reality which is, in his terms, even more ""magical"" and wonderful than the myth. I'm dismayed that our supposedly advanced civilizations, particularly the US, are still so blindered by religion that such a book seems necessary and appropriate, but even so I think it would be best to put the dismantling of religious stories as secondary to the explanation of scientific realities: any teen who is going to encounter this book with an open mind will already be receptive to Dawkins' ideas, while anyone who actually believes any of the religious or mythic stories is going to be put on the defensive by Dawkins' attack.I guess this is the same problem even non-religious people have with other facets of the ""New Atheism"": it gets in your face as an idea whose truth requires the falsehood of competing explanations—and, however great your disagreement, getting in someone's face like that is just poor manners. The Magic of Reality is only very slightly boorish in that way, but I think it would have been a better and more wonder-full book if it hadn't addressed myths and religions at all, and just presented the ""magic"" of our scientific understanding of the world."
114,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,3,"The audio version of this book is read by Richard Dawkins and some other Lalla Ward. This is mainly relevant because it meant that I got to spend 5 hours listening to British accents. =)The book itself was good. Each chapter poses a question, gives some answers provided by traditional myths, and then talks about the real scientific answer. I'll lay out up front, that yes, Dawkins does use the Bible for some of his examples of myths, but except to the biblical literalists (especially of the Creationist variety), these are the parts of the Bible that are generally taken to have a mythical element.Also, while I'm on the disclaimers, this book focuses on where Dawkins does best -- explaining science in a manner accessible to the lay reader -- but it does veer just a little into rantiness in one of the later chapters.Moving along, the questions and answers presented in this book should be broadly familiar to anyone who had an retained a decent science education, but there was the occasional moment of ""so that's how it works!"" illumination. For me, one such moment was the explanation of why the angle of the earth relative to the sun makes such a difference in perceived temperature [1]. From an educational standpoint, I think that this would be a really great book to get for a high school student or even an advanced middle school student.[1] When the sun hits the earth at a shallower angle, the same amount of solar energy is spread over a wider area, so the energy received per square inch is decreased."

All my basic scientific knowledge, I have to say, was largely from the books of junior and senior school times and am afraid that I only got nebulous impression now.But the book, this book, the magic of reality still shocked me a little bit, not because of its abstruse contents but because of its simplicity. I guess it is a little book aimed at transmitting basic scientific knowledge to teenagers or young people. So it's another book on common sense.It is not as “prodigiously illuminous and beautifully designed” as it should be, but it's an amusing book and Richard indeed imbued the book with his hilarious humor, which really gave me a lot of laughters in reading.He would list a few mythologies or stories that precede his revealing of the true explanations of the question. And if you are discreet a bit more you would invariably find his “sarcastic tone” for people's beliefs and his ardent support for evolution.If you need to get some basic knowledge about how some natural phenomena happened or physics information such as elements or molecules, all such stuff could be found in the book with concise introductions.But if you want to know more about evolution, as a friend recommend to me, it's better to read his other works like ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution"" or ""The self Gene"" or some similar works from other authors .1.03.2016"

His book The Magic of Reality tries to explain in understandable ways some of the really complicated phenomenons of physics and science overall.In the midway of the book, I felt like back in school. Quite many things very familiar, but the way Mr. Dawkins explains those helped to deepen the understanding quite a bit.The book goes through topics all the way from big bang to evolution to quantum mechanics. So it is really comprehensive overview to the universe as we know it. I give the credit to him on explaining things in very understandable ways.Mr Dawkins is a know atheist and science believer. It really shows in the book. He dismisses all religions. He does admit that there are many things science can't explain yet, but he sees it only as a shortage of current science, not as a possibility for higher forces. Atheism actually came disturbingly through from all the writing. That's a shame, in science facts should be facts without personal believes.I have to still recommend to people who want to understand physics and the world better. I felt like getting a fast recap of learning's from physics from many years at school. It's an excellent book, if you can tolerate the pushing of atheism.This review was originally published in my blog - here"
117,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1215485-megan,4,"This is a beautiful book with some really great illustrations, and it does a wonderful job of making science accessible to younger readers (although, not super young - the writing style is a bit challenging at times). This would be a really cool textbook, or style for a textbook.The writing occasionally edges into the dry, but there are enough anecdotes and pretty pictures to make up for the occasional wall of text.My only problem is with his approach towards mythological stories. I like the variety he presented, but I would have liked more historical context behind the stories as well as the recognition that a lot of stories like the ones he shared were ancient people's way of exploring/explaining the world around them, even though they sound silly today. However, he does use the stories as a way of teaching logical, critical thinking, which I liked.Anyway, I wish I had known how cool science was in school. This book helped me clear up a few bits of confusion (mostly about atoms, because I pretty much just suffered through chemistry class blankly) and offers a neat perspective on the world."
118,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5841574-linda-rawlinson,5,"This book is an excellent explanation of science, what it's for, and why it's important. I don't really see it as a book for children, I see it as a book for anyone who wants to think about the beauty of science and everything. It's a book that just consolidates what we already know - I didn't really learn anything knew from it, but I didn't expect to; I did find that the book helped me to pin down my thoughts on reality though, which is just what I hoped it would do. Of course, it's aimed at a younger audience, but that didn't lessen my enjoyment of it. I found it to be delightful, and thought-provoking. The illustrations by Dave McKean were super, and really enhanced the text. I will use this book when I want to talk to my children about science - they're a little young to understand these ideas just yet, but I'm looking forward to when they begin to question their realities. And I'm looking forward to showing them some proper evidence about why 'God' cannot exist - some damage has been done by school telling them that they're Christians! I hope I can undo it."
119,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29394370-srikanth-krishnamurthy,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The author, Richard Dawkins has taken a step forward and cleverly illustrated the reason for things such as what is magic and reality ? who we are ? why we have winter and summer ? what is sun ? and many natural prodigies which one would like to explore. Almost every chapter starts with different myths that were registered by our ancestors in this planet however it’s the science and the scientists who applied the it and figured out the several factors that would determine the actual reason for the way our planet and things were formed and developed. The author has intelligently extracted required information from the world of science and clearly related to the things described in the book. I would happily add this book to nominate for book of the year 2016 :)Overall - Magic of Reality : Explore the realities of core things through the outcome of science in our planet and there is something amazing inside to educate ourselves beyond that as well :)"
120,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,5,"Target audience: The book primarily targets children and young adults, but it is good for adults who know little about biology as well.About the author: According to Wikipedia, Clinton Richard Dawkins is an English evolutionary biologist and author. He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford, and was the University of Oxford's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008. Dawkins is an atheist, and is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design. In his 1986 book The Blind Watchmaker, he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. He is an opponent of creationism being taught in schools. He has been awarded many prestigious academic and writing awards and he makes regular television, radio and Internet appearances, predominantly discussing his books, his atheism, and his ideas and opinions as a public intellectual.Structure of the book: The book has 272 pages and it is divided in 12 chapters, each chapter having a unique title.Overview: Dawkins says that it is unlikely for a supernatural creator of the world to exist. He contends that religious thought is merely a delusion. This is why nearly all of the chapters begin with a brief synopsis of creation myths in an attempt to explain various observed phenomena. He chooses these myths from all over the world, such as Babylonian, Aztec, Judeo-Christian, Ancient Egyptian, Japanese, Maori, Australian Aboriginal, Hellenic, Nordic, Chinese, and includes even modern alien-abduction mythology. But Dawkins not only enumerates myths, he has a special pleasure dismantling them. In fact, the entire book is a battle between myths and science, or fiction and reality.In early childhood every single one of us – including the author as we find out – asked ourselves: How does this work? Why is this thing here and not there? Why do birds have wings and how can they fly? Why the bear has the color it has?When we are young and naive, we give all sort of answers, one more ridiculous than the other. And the answers we give seem very legit. But, as we grow older and acquire more knowledge, the initial answers are no longer suited to explain reality. So, we abandon them and we try to find other answers for explaining what happens around us.The same it is with the difference between myths and science: myths are failed sciences which were useful in the “childhood” of mankind, when people used sticks to hunt for their prey or rocks to make fire. But now humanity is mature and myths and religions no longer have any utility; on the contrary, in most cases it slows down our moral and scientific progress. Indeed, reality has a natural capacity for beauty. It could be argued that reality – due to its complexity – is, in fact, more magical than any other thing possible. But nobody can deny that very minute phenomena were not known to archaic peoples before the creation of optical magnification devices. Moreover, many of them involve a god's symbolic act performed just once. So, any passages believed to be inspired by gods have not mentioned any knowledge as outside human experience. In this regard Dawkins provides the nice example of the story Cinderella. The little children, when this story is read to them, really believe that a pumpkin can turn into a golden carriage. But in the real world the Fairy Godmother is unable to magically make this transformation with his wand. This is because the pumpkins and carriages have an internal organization that is complex and very, very different. A large pumpkin is impossible to turn into a carriage no matter how well you reorganize its structure.In the later chapters Dawkins address topics that range from speciation and evolutionary biology to physical phenomena like atomic theory or plate tectonics. He declines to explain topics he does not understand. I love his honesty. He characterizes his knowledge of quantum mechanics as at best foggy. He does not attempt to appear more knowledgeable than he is in order to protect his ego. The book is also filled with interesting facts and I found it improved my knowledge of evolutionary biology without sounding like a text book. So, overall, as Dawkins says, a good way to tell if you really understand something or not is whether or not you can explain it to someone else and have them also understand it too.Quote: The truth is more magical - in the best and most exciting sense of the word - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.Strong points: Through brilliant examples and light scientific details Dawkins manages to make his points clear and complex topics easy to understand. Moreover, Dawkins's ability to pose the right questions make his writing a pleasure to read. I believe the layman – even an adolescent child – would have no trouble understanding.Weak points: If you are versed in science, this book will be indeed perceived as weak. However, for the laymen, it is a great source of information and entertainment at the same time. I personally enjoyed the book so much don’t remember any negative feelings I had while reading it._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"
121,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070035-kartik-narayanan,4,"In this book, the author, Richard Dawkins, explains various natural phenomena. He starts the book by identifying three different kinds of magic supernatural magic (things that happen in fairy tales, myths, religious texts etc.) stage magic (things that we know are false but are fun to watch - stage magicians for example) poetic magic (the kind of magic we use to describe our feelings about a great movie or watching a sunset or scenery etc.). Dawkins demonstrates that our ancestors used to explain our world using supernatural magic. He then explains it in the form of poetic magic (i.e. ""what is"" as opposed to ""what we think is""). He picks up the most popular myths and explains these with science. We get to see that supernatural magic is the fear of understanding while poetic magic is the joy of understanding. Richard Dawkins is the world's most famous evolutionary biologist. He is also one of the world's foremost atheists. He has authored many great books, including the ""The Selfish Gene"" and ""The God Delusion"". You have to read those books if you have not already. I consider him to be one of the luminaries of this century - on par with Richard Feynman and others - in popularizing science and reason`. A warning - he is an atheist and uses reason & logic to dissect superstitions and beliefs. So if your faith is fickle or offended, do not bother reading his books. But, you will enjoy his books and be a better person if you have an open mind. This book is meant for general consumption.I highly recommend reading this book. Dawkins explains scientific concepts brilliantly. This understanding leads to a greater appreciation of Nature and the Universe. He calls out areas where he is not explain things well (quarks for example). What is reality? What is magic? - explains the nature of reality and the nature of magic Who was the first person? - explores our origins Why are there so many different kinds of animals? - explores evolution What are things made of? - atomic theory Why do we have day and night, summer and winter? - the earth, sun and orbits What is the Sun? - stellar mechanics What is a rainbow? - optics When and how did everything begin? - Big Bang theory Are we alone? - Aliens and the nature of the universe What are earthquakes? - plate tectonics Why do bad things happen? - chaos What is a miracle? - science vs belief"
122,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"Something Dawkins stated in his book The Ancestor’s Tale has never left me: “My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely that they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world.” There is nothing in the holy books to compare with what science has opened up for human understanding of the world around us. I am humbled by my own ignorance of science but my ignorance doesn’t drive me to become anti-science. If your religion forces you to turn your mind away from science then it’s time to find another religion…or just drop your silly beliefs once and for all. I grew up in a Catholic family but I never for a single conscious moment believed in any the teachings held by the faith of my parents. I have never believed in a god, ever.I would like to add “and that has made all the difference” but simply being an atheist doesn’t get you anywhere on its own. For that you need to open up your mind and put your elbows on the table, as we like to say in Spanish about studying. It’s astounding to me that there are many, many people in the world today who don’t know why we have seasons, or that the earth is billions of years old, or that matter is made up of atoms. Instead, they cling to fairy tales written thousands of years ago to explain these phenomena.I have read things written by Muslims who try to show how the Koran explains science and how their prophet was centuries ahead of his time. Nonsense, just like everything in that book. The same is true of the Bible and the Talmud, and all the others. But don’t think of this book as being anti-religion but pro-mankind. And what is wrong with that? I am so tired of Dawkins’ critics labeling him as strident and belligerent towards religious people.If I were the king of the world I would make everyone read this book and then they would have to prove that they read it and understood it. After that, if you want to go on believing in the offal your religion sloshes out then go right ahead. Since I won’t be king any time soon then perhaps we can make this book available to every adolescent so that they can make their own choices because there are only two: myth or science."
123,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6031670-bruce-caithness,3,"The critical underpinning of science is brought to attention in ""The Magic of Reality"" as well as the wonderful list of findings that have been put forward by science. One cannot fault the book for lacking enthusiasm.Joe Barnhart in Karl Popper: Philosopher of Critical Realism made some nice comments that temper Richard Dawkins sometimes overly enthusiastic positivism.Myths graduate to science when they are open to being tested, science rests on a bedrock of mythology.Creationists who insist on classifying their views as ""scientific creationism"" may not know what they are getting into. Do they really want to assert that creationism is falsifiable? Do they want to try to expose its weaknesses and flaws? Do they seek to correct and revise the doctrine? As is well known, creationists take great delight in pointing out that the theory of evolution is, after all, a theory. But this should pose no problem. All scientific theories are theories. Do creationists want to say that creationism is a theory? Do they want to say that the notion of the Bible as inerrant revelation is a theory?If Karl Popper's analysis is correct, then both evolution and creationism are theories. The real question has to do with how well they are articulated, how well they serve to advance further research, and how well they survive rigorous criticism. The overwhelming majority of biologists and anthropologists have found creationism to be a poor rival to evolution in the attempt to expand our knowledge. Contrary to what some creationists claim, scientists tend to favor evolution as an explanatory theory not because of some presupposition that blinds them to the truth but, rather, because it is scientifically more fruitful than creationism and enjoys greater explanatory power."
124,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19638210-dane-cobain,4,"This book is a bit of a weird one because it takes the form of a series of responses to questions, and so every chapter in the book is based upon a question like, “When and how did everything begin?” It’s a pretty simple setup that allows Dawkins to tackle some of the bigger questions that people have, but it does also mean that it feels as though something’s somehow lacking.Don’t get me wrong, the science was solid and Dawkins made his arguments well, and I do feel that I’ve learned a bunch of stuff here. At the same time, it feels a bit like he’s set out to try to explain everything and then settled for just a few frequently asked questions. I’m not sure what he could have done differently though, because if the book was two or three times the length, it would have ended up feeling long and drawn out.Still, it was a pretty good way to keep my brain trained and to learn a few new lessons about science and stuff. This isn’t necessarily the best non-fiction science book on the market, but I polished it off in 24 hours or so and was happy with it, even if it was just okay. After all, I’m slowly working my way through everything that Dawkins has ever written, and this is probably one of the most approachable. All in all, I’m glad I read it and maybe you’ll like it too."
125,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3974523-prem-aparanji,2,"Not for young children. Teenagers maybe. But otherwise good compilation of myths and their contrast with scientific reasons for various questions like origin of universe, man, etc. Scientific temper is necessary and that requires a skeptical mind. Denouncing myths is one thing, not understanding their power is another. Myths have the power to capture the imagination of the child. Not this book.Richard Dawkins has a good intent, bad execution. He needs to learn how to narrate, make science facts wondrous for the imaginative child. And imagination is being able to grasp the vastness of space or antiquity of universe. Imagination is how the primitive Earth might have been, how life might have evolved. None of the magic is exploited in this book.The author instead of exploiting the power of imagination goes on rambling against the fantasies of various mythologies.Where scientists like Einstein, Bohr, Oppenheimer, Arthur Clark, etc. have all drawn inspiration from ancient texts like the Vedas and the Gita, Dawkins dismisses them. He does not seem to understand the symbolism and takes them for the literal words, like a common man."
126,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3363047-karel-baloun,4,"This is a fine capstone book for Richard Dawkins illustrious career; I can't think of how it could be better.He bounces back-and-forth between myth and reality, and leaves us hopeful that tomorrow's reality will look like magic to us.Yet, as a science interested adult, it seemed to me that I knew every fact and every story in the book, perhaps because cosmos told so many, or because it's hard to be original in these foundational science areas with the Internet. The only truly original presentation I saw, was the fantastic 3 mile deep family album.Unfortunately, for modern children, I don't think this is a workable delivery mechanism. Of course he tries to make it interesting, and the text format novelties and fantastic illustrations, show great effort. But it can't compete with video, and they're just too many words I think for children to work through. The words and the names are all quite advanced, so it's great education, but I don't know if modern children will ever learn all of these words.I do appreciate how he bundles all references to God in the myth sections."
127,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14258644-mohammad-tanviruzzaman,4,"Science's explanation can be more beautiful and amazing than any myth, miracle, or magic: Dawkins makes this point by picking up a series of questions (like: what is real? what is a rainbow? why do we have night and day, summer and winter? who is the first person? why are there so many kinds of life-forms? etc.), which haunt many of us time and again, and then he presents what the myths have to offer as the answer to each of those questions and what science has to offer; and through this journey one is introduced to a lot of important stuffs about science and moreover the way scientists go about applying scientific method to come up with answers. I liked Hume's neat idea for evaluating the plausibility of a ""stated"" miracle. The writing is lucid and often witty; should be a great read for youngsters even."
128,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34211369-mukesh-emes,5,"In this book Richard Dawkins did a great job in breaking all the religious belief about the evolution of world. The way he unwrapped some myths and miracles with the help of the science is really beautiful. For examples, who was the first person in this world, What are things made of, rainbow, sun etc. It is one of the simplest book I have read that deals with physics,cosmology and evolutionary biology. I would give five star to this book."

There isn't much here that should be new to the average intellectually curious adult, but I can certainly see myself enjoying this book at age 10 (I'm not entirely sure I was able to read English at that age, but presumably a translation is forthcoming). McKean's illustrations are sometimes weirder than they strictly need to be, maybe."

Reality itself can be only be explained through science, and scientific methods. What cannot be explained, can be explained in time to come! the machinery of (scientific) methods, is only improving to validate the phenomenon that are yet to be explained. Science is collaborative and unending in it's nature. It should be native to every mind, and should be accepted, and valued. Coming to the book now: I love Dawkins, not only he is humble in his untiring efforts to put 'educating the masses and improving scientific literacy' at top of his agenda, but also doesn't disregard the polemicists so immediately without putting forth a reasonable explanation (reasonable to reasonable people i guess), which I think is what makes him a better person also. This book is a comprehensive approach to understand reality through the lens of science juxtaposing ancient and present-day myths about them.Read it please, and read it to your children as well."

In fact, the audience for this book seems to be people with shockingly little education as almost all the information contained in it is stuff a person should learn by the end of high school, stuff like ""what is an earthquake?"", ""what is a rainbow?"", the basics of evolution and gravity and other stuff like that. The fact that this book has to exist at all for adults is quite sad."

(Bouchardon & Heckman, 2012). This text is Dawkin’s first for teenagers, persuading the reader that the reality of science is as ‘magical’ as mythology. The well researched content is clearly presented, however, on occasions, Dawkins resorts to first person thus detracting from the authority of the text as it reveals his bias.The new Australian English curriculum requires students to respond to and compose texts in different media and technologies. Whilst this text has been primarily written for teenagers, each chapter’s introductory segment retelling myths and legends is suitable for primary school students because the text is clear, the language succinct and the enhancement engaging eg the flames surrounding Hades. Science & Technology units, Primary Connections, are based on the 5e learning model allowing for segments of The Magic of Reality to be shared as a background resource to enhance student understanding in the Earth and space sciences strand. The digital affordances of this app allow for its use to explain scientific concepts across all learning styles eg. Chapter 2, blowing the iguanas across the water whilst avoiding the whirlpools; Chapter 3, the use of a slider to demonstrate the size of the stars. Callow (2013, p. 102) discusses the use of visuals in informative texts, supporting meaning.A linear reading experience is allowed when reading The Magic of Reality, as well as reading it as a non-fiction text by dipping into chapters. The digital affordances supplement the text without distraction. They are many and varied, strategically placed within the text primarily to explain scientific concepts, eg video to explain seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres. Many provide feedback, allowing the reader to repeat the activity to improve his/her personal result eg. Chapter 1, evolution through ‘breeding’ frogs to survive the snakes; Chapter 4, states of matter, firing Newton’s cannon to visualize gravity. Dawkins provides suggestions for the reader to further investigate eg an invitation in Chapter 4 to Google “Iron cold iron” by Kipling to add to the explanation of liquids, solids and gases; a reference to Earthsearch to further explain how big is space.The Magic of Reality is intuitive and easy to navigate, the reader is able to swipe down to view chapters and current position, supporting Jabr (2013). The full colour images and audio (read by Dawkins) are high quality when viewed on an iPad3. Will this enhanced eBook have longevity? A question difficult to answer, for at least two reasons. Firstly, science changes, as Dawkins remarks eg in Chapter 10, his references to earthquakes in Haiti and Christchurch, and Japan’s tsunami. Will this app be updated as required? A specific answer to this has not been found, other than updates provided through Apple iTunes. Despite this, The Magic of Reality is highly recommended for not only teenagers but readers interested in science. The app could be described as “Myth Busters meets Science for Dummies”.

142,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47528776-ibnul-shah,5,"This is one of the most amazing books on science I have ever read. Richard Dawkins' explanatory abilities are unquestionable; the way he explains complicated things is absolutely astonishing. This book talks about different topics of science in a very lucid way, and I think if someone wants a basic introduction to science, this book is an excellent option. The author says its intended for children aged 12-13 years- after reading this book, they'll clearly understand how science works and how to think and act like a scientist. The most important chapter in this book, in my opinion, is the second chapter titled 'Who was the first person?' where Dawkins explains evolution with interesting thought experiments and irrefutable logic. All the other chapters are also filled with exciting scientific elucidations of natural phenomenons, followed by the colorful mythical explanation of the same. The last two chapters were less science related, here the writer emphasizes more on making the reader have a scientific outlook on everything. I love how he ends the book: ""The truth is more magical - in the best and the most exciting sense of the world - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.""However, in some chapters, Dawkins' anti-religious sentiment was clearly exposed and I don't know how readers in countries like mine will take it. Moreover, chapters like 'what are things made of' or 'what is the sun' were pretty boring for me. So I guess these chapters would seem a bit uninteresting for an older reader who has basic ideas about science. On the other hand, it is because of these chapters you can call this book an introduction to science. But all in all, this book was a really pleasant read for me, and I'd say it is a must-read for every children as well as grown-ups with curiosity and enthusiasm about science."
143,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/845928-owen,3,"This book is aimed at teens, I guess, but while the science seems to be at the appropriate level, its discursive and rhetorical style are probably going to go over their heads. Dawkins' approach is to present mythical explanations for natural phenomena, followed by our current scientific understanding of what's really going on—the reality which is, in his terms, even more ""magical"" and wonderful than the myth. I'm dismayed that our supposedly advanced civilizations, particularly the US, are still so blindered by religion that such a book seems necessary and appropriate, but even so I think it would be best to put the dismantling of religious stories as secondary to the explanation of scientific realities: any teen who is going to encounter this book with an open mind will already be receptive to Dawkins' ideas, while anyone who actually believes any of the religious or mythic stories is going to be put on the defensive by Dawkins' attack.I guess this is the same problem even non-religious people have with other facets of the ""New Atheism"": it gets in your face as an idea whose truth requires the falsehood of competing explanations—and, however great your disagreement, getting in someone's face like that is just poor manners. The Magic of Reality is only very slightly boorish in that way, but I think it would have been a better and more wonder-full book if it hadn't addressed myths and religions at all, and just presented the ""magic"" of our scientific understanding of the world."
144,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,3,"The audio version of this book is read by Richard Dawkins and some other Lalla Ward. This is mainly relevant because it meant that I got to spend 5 hours listening to British accents. =)The book itself was good. Each chapter poses a question, gives some answers provided by traditional myths, and then talks about the real scientific answer. I'll lay out up front, that yes, Dawkins does use the Bible for some of his examples of myths, but except to the biblical literalists (especially of the Creationist variety), these are the parts of the Bible that are generally taken to have a mythical element.Also, while I'm on the disclaimers, this book focuses on where Dawkins does best -- explaining science in a manner accessible to the lay reader -- but it does veer just a little into rantiness in one of the later chapters.Moving along, the questions and answers presented in this book should be broadly familiar to anyone who had an retained a decent science education, but there was the occasional moment of ""so that's how it works!"" illumination. For me, one such moment was the explanation of why the angle of the earth relative to the sun makes such a difference in perceived temperature [1]. From an educational standpoint, I think that this would be a really great book to get for a high school student or even an advanced middle school student.[1] When the sun hits the earth at a shallower angle, the same amount of solar energy is spread over a wider area, so the energy received per square inch is decreased."

All my basic scientific knowledge, I have to say, was largely from the books of junior and senior school times and am afraid that I only got nebulous impression now.But the book, this book, the magic of reality still shocked me a little bit, not because of its abstruse contents but because of its simplicity. I guess it is a little book aimed at transmitting basic scientific knowledge to teenagers or young people. So it's another book on common sense.It is not as “prodigiously illuminous and beautifully designed” as it should be, but it's an amusing book and Richard indeed imbued the book with his hilarious humor, which really gave me a lot of laughters in reading.He would list a few mythologies or stories that precede his revealing of the true explanations of the question. And if you are discreet a bit more you would invariably find his “sarcastic tone” for people's beliefs and his ardent support for evolution.If you need to get some basic knowledge about how some natural phenomena happened or physics information such as elements or molecules, all such stuff could be found in the book with concise introductions.But if you want to know more about evolution, as a friend recommend to me, it's better to read his other works like ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution"" or ""The self Gene"" or some similar works from other authors .1.03.2016"

His book The Magic of Reality tries to explain in understandable ways some of the really complicated phenomenons of physics and science overall.In the midway of the book, I felt like back in school. Quite many things very familiar, but the way Mr. Dawkins explains those helped to deepen the understanding quite a bit.The book goes through topics all the way from big bang to evolution to quantum mechanics. So it is really comprehensive overview to the universe as we know it. I give the credit to him on explaining things in very understandable ways.Mr Dawkins is a know atheist and science believer. It really shows in the book. He dismisses all religions. He does admit that there are many things science can't explain yet, but he sees it only as a shortage of current science, not as a possibility for higher forces. Atheism actually came disturbingly through from all the writing. That's a shame, in science facts should be facts without personal believes.I have to still recommend to people who want to understand physics and the world better. I felt like getting a fast recap of learning's from physics from many years at school. It's an excellent book, if you can tolerate the pushing of atheism.This review was originally published in my blog - here"

This would be a really cool textbook, or style for a textbook.The writing occasionally edges into the dry, but there are enough anecdotes and pretty pictures to make up for the occasional wall of text.My only problem is with his approach towards mythological stories. I like the variety he presented, but I would have liked more historical context behind the stories as well as the recognition that a lot of stories like the ones he shared were ancient people's way of exploring/explaining the world around them, even though they sound silly today. However, he does use the stories as a way of teaching logical, critical thinking, which I liked.Anyway, I wish I had known how cool science was in school. This book helped me clear up a few bits of confusion (mostly about atoms, because I pretty much just suffered through chemistry class blankly) and offers a neat perspective on the world."

I don't really see it as a book for children, I see it as a book for anyone who wants to think about the beauty of science and everything. It's a book that just consolidates what we already know - I didn't really learn anything knew from it, but I didn't expect to; I did find that the book helped me to pin down my thoughts on reality though, which is just what I hoped it would do. Of course, it's aimed at a younger audience, but that didn't lessen my enjoyment of it. I found it to be delightful, and thought-provoking. The illustrations by Dave McKean were super, and really enhanced the text. I will use this book when I want to talk to my children about science - they're a little young to understand these ideas just yet, but I'm looking forward to when they begin to question their realities. And I'm looking forward to showing them some proper evidence about why 'God' cannot exist - some damage has been done by school telling them that they're Christians! I hope I can undo it."

The author, Richard Dawkins has taken a step forward and cleverly illustrated the reason for things such as what is magic and reality ? who we are ? why we have winter and summer ? what is sun ? and many natural prodigies which one would like to explore. Almost every chapter starts with different myths that were registered by our ancestors in this planet however it’s the science and the scientists who applied the it and figured out the several factors that would determine the actual reason for the way our planet and things were formed and developed. The author has intelligently extracted required information from the world of science and clearly related to the things described in the book. I would happily add this book to nominate for book of the year 2016 :)Overall - Magic of Reality : Explore the realities of core things through the outcome of science in our planet and there is something amazing inside to educate ourselves beyond that as well :)"
150,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,5,"Target audience: The book primarily targets children and young adults, but it is good for adults who know little about biology as well.About the author: According to Wikipedia, Clinton Richard Dawkins is an English evolutionary biologist and author. He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford, and was the University of Oxford's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008. Dawkins is an atheist, and is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design. In his 1986 book The Blind Watchmaker, he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. He is an opponent of creationism being taught in schools. He has been awarded many prestigious academic and writing awards and he makes regular television, radio and Internet appearances, predominantly discussing his books, his atheism, and his ideas and opinions as a public intellectual.Structure of the book: The book has 272 pages and it is divided in 12 chapters, each chapter having a unique title.Overview: Dawkins says that it is unlikely for a supernatural creator of the world to exist. He contends that religious thought is merely a delusion. This is why nearly all of the chapters begin with a brief synopsis of creation myths in an attempt to explain various observed phenomena. He chooses these myths from all over the world, such as Babylonian, Aztec, Judeo-Christian, Ancient Egyptian, Japanese, Maori, Australian Aboriginal, Hellenic, Nordic, Chinese, and includes even modern alien-abduction mythology. But Dawkins not only enumerates myths, he has a special pleasure dismantling them. In fact, the entire book is a battle between myths and science, or fiction and reality.In early childhood every single one of us – including the author as we find out – asked ourselves: How does this work? Why is this thing here and not there? Why do birds have wings and how can they fly? Why the bear has the color it has?When we are young and naive, we give all sort of answers, one more ridiculous than the other. And the answers we give seem very legit. But, as we grow older and acquire more knowledge, the initial answers are no longer suited to explain reality. So, we abandon them and we try to find other answers for explaining what happens around us.The same it is with the difference between myths and science: myths are failed sciences which were useful in the “childhood” of mankind, when people used sticks to hunt for their prey or rocks to make fire. But now humanity is mature and myths and religions no longer have any utility; on the contrary, in most cases it slows down our moral and scientific progress. Indeed, reality has a natural capacity for beauty. It could be argued that reality – due to its complexity – is, in fact, more magical than any other thing possible. But nobody can deny that very minute phenomena were not known to archaic peoples before the creation of optical magnification devices. Moreover, many of them involve a god's symbolic act performed just once. So, any passages believed to be inspired by gods have not mentioned any knowledge as outside human experience. In this regard Dawkins provides the nice example of the story Cinderella. The little children, when this story is read to them, really believe that a pumpkin can turn into a golden carriage. But in the real world the Fairy Godmother is unable to magically make this transformation with his wand. This is because the pumpkins and carriages have an internal organization that is complex and very, very different. A large pumpkin is impossible to turn into a carriage no matter how well you reorganize its structure.In the later chapters Dawkins address topics that range from speciation and evolutionary biology to physical phenomena like atomic theory or plate tectonics. He declines to explain topics he does not understand. I love his honesty. He characterizes his knowledge of quantum mechanics as at best foggy. He does not attempt to appear more knowledgeable than he is in order to protect his ego. The book is also filled with interesting facts and I found it improved my knowledge of evolutionary biology without sounding like a text book. So, overall, as Dawkins says, a good way to tell if you really understand something or not is whether or not you can explain it to someone else and have them also understand it too.Quote: The truth is more magical - in the best and most exciting sense of the word - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.Strong points: Through brilliant examples and light scientific details Dawkins manages to make his points clear and complex topics easy to understand. Moreover, Dawkins's ability to pose the right questions make his writing a pleasure to read. I believe the layman – even an adolescent child – would have no trouble understanding.Weak points: If you are versed in science, this book will be indeed perceived as weak. However, for the laymen, it is a great source of information and entertainment at the same time. I personally enjoyed the book so much don’t remember any negative feelings I had while reading it._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"
151,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070035-kartik-narayanan,4,"In this book, the author, Richard Dawkins, explains various natural phenomena. He starts the book by identifying three different kinds of magic supernatural magic (things that happen in fairy tales, myths, religious texts etc.) stage magic (things that we know are false but are fun to watch - stage magicians for example) poetic magic (the kind of magic we use to describe our feelings about a great movie or watching a sunset or scenery etc.). Dawkins demonstrates that our ancestors used to explain our world using supernatural magic. He then explains it in the form of poetic magic (i.e. ""what is"" as opposed to ""what we think is""). He picks up the most popular myths and explains these with science. We get to see that supernatural magic is the fear of understanding while poetic magic is the joy of understanding. Richard Dawkins is the world's most famous evolutionary biologist. He is also one of the world's foremost atheists. He has authored many great books, including the ""The Selfish Gene"" and ""The God Delusion"". You have to read those books if you have not already. I consider him to be one of the luminaries of this century - on par with Richard Feynman and others - in popularizing science and reason`. A warning - he is an atheist and uses reason & logic to dissect superstitions and beliefs. So if your faith is fickle or offended, do not bother reading his books. But, you will enjoy his books and be a better person if you have an open mind. This book is meant for general consumption.I highly recommend reading this book. Dawkins explains scientific concepts brilliantly. This understanding leads to a greater appreciation of Nature and the Universe. He calls out areas where he is not explain things well (quarks for example). What is reality? What is magic? - explains the nature of reality and the nature of magic Who was the first person? - explores our origins Why are there so many different kinds of animals? - explores evolution What are things made of? - atomic theory Why do we have day and night, summer and winter? - the earth, sun and orbits What is the Sun? - stellar mechanics What is a rainbow? - optics When and how did everything begin? - Big Bang theory Are we alone? - Aliens and the nature of the universe What are earthquakes? - plate tectonics Why do bad things happen? - chaos What is a miracle? - science vs belief"
152,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"Something Dawkins stated in his book The Ancestor’s Tale has never left me: “My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely that they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world.” There is nothing in the holy books to compare with what science has opened up for human understanding of the world around us. I am humbled by my own ignorance of science but my ignorance doesn’t drive me to become anti-science. If your religion forces you to turn your mind away from science then it’s time to find another religion…or just drop your silly beliefs once and for all. I grew up in a Catholic family but I never for a single conscious moment believed in any the teachings held by the faith of my parents. I have never believed in a god, ever.I would like to add “and that has made all the difference” but simply being an atheist doesn’t get you anywhere on its own. For that you need to open up your mind and put your elbows on the table, as we like to say in Spanish about studying. It’s astounding to me that there are many, many people in the world today who don’t know why we have seasons, or that the earth is billions of years old, or that matter is made up of atoms. Instead, they cling to fairy tales written thousands of years ago to explain these phenomena.I have read things written by Muslims who try to show how the Koran explains science and how their prophet was centuries ahead of his time. Nonsense, just like everything in that book. The same is true of the Bible and the Talmud, and all the others. But don’t think of this book as being anti-religion but pro-mankind. And what is wrong with that? I am so tired of Dawkins’ critics labeling him as strident and belligerent towards religious people.If I were the king of the world I would make everyone read this book and then they would have to prove that they read it and understood it. After that, if you want to go on believing in the offal your religion sloshes out then go right ahead. Since I won’t be king any time soon then perhaps we can make this book available to every adolescent so that they can make their own choices because there are only two: myth or science."
153,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6031670-bruce-caithness,3,"The critical underpinning of science is brought to attention in ""The Magic of Reality"" as well as the wonderful list of findings that have been put forward by science. One cannot fault the book for lacking enthusiasm.Joe Barnhart in Karl Popper: Philosopher of Critical Realism made some nice comments that temper Richard Dawkins sometimes overly enthusiastic positivism.Myths graduate to science when they are open to being tested, science rests on a bedrock of mythology.Creationists who insist on classifying their views as ""scientific creationism"" may not know what they are getting into. Do they really want to assert that creationism is falsifiable? Do they want to try to expose its weaknesses and flaws? Do they seek to correct and revise the doctrine? As is well known, creationists take great delight in pointing out that the theory of evolution is, after all, a theory. But this should pose no problem. All scientific theories are theories. Do creationists want to say that creationism is a theory? Do they want to say that the notion of the Bible as inerrant revelation is a theory?If Karl Popper's analysis is correct, then both evolution and creationism are theories. The real question has to do with how well they are articulated, how well they serve to advance further research, and how well they survive rigorous criticism. The overwhelming majority of biologists and anthropologists have found creationism to be a poor rival to evolution in the attempt to expand our knowledge. Contrary to what some creationists claim, scientists tend to favor evolution as an explanatory theory not because of some presupposition that blinds them to the truth but, rather, because it is scientifically more fruitful than creationism and enjoys greater explanatory power."
154,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19638210-dane-cobain,4,"This book is a bit of a weird one because it takes the form of a series of responses to questions, and so every chapter in the book is based upon a question like, “When and how did everything begin?” It’s a pretty simple setup that allows Dawkins to tackle some of the bigger questions that people have, but it does also mean that it feels as though something’s somehow lacking.Don’t get me wrong, the science was solid and Dawkins made his arguments well, and I do feel that I’ve learned a bunch of stuff here. At the same time, it feels a bit like he’s set out to try to explain everything and then settled for just a few frequently asked questions. I’m not sure what he could have done differently though, because if the book was two or three times the length, it would have ended up feeling long and drawn out.Still, it was a pretty good way to keep my brain trained and to learn a few new lessons about science and stuff. This isn’t necessarily the best non-fiction science book on the market, but I polished it off in 24 hours or so and was happy with it, even if it was just okay. After all, I’m slowly working my way through everything that Dawkins has ever written, and this is probably one of the most approachable. All in all, I’m glad I read it and maybe you’ll like it too."

But otherwise good compilation of myths and their contrast with scientific reasons for various questions like origin of universe, man, etc. Scientific temper is necessary and that requires a skeptical mind. Denouncing myths is one thing, not understanding their power is another. Myths have the power to capture the imagination of the child. Not this book.Richard Dawkins has a good intent, bad execution. He needs to learn how to narrate, make science facts wondrous for the imaginative child. And imagination is being able to grasp the vastness of space or antiquity of universe. Imagination is how the primitive Earth might have been, how life might have evolved. None of the magic is exploited in this book.The author instead of exploiting the power of imagination goes on rambling against the fantasies of various mythologies.Where scientists like Einstein, Bohr, Oppenheimer, Arthur Clark, etc. have all drawn inspiration from ancient texts like the Vedas and the Gita, Dawkins dismisses them. He does not seem to understand the symbolism and takes them for the literal words, like a common man."

The only truly original presentation I saw, was the fantastic 3 mile deep family album.Unfortunately, for modern children, I don't think this is a workable delivery mechanism. Of course he tries to make it interesting, and the text format novelties and fantastic illustrations, show great effort. But it can't compete with video, and they're just too many words I think for children to work through. The words and the names are all quite advanced, so it's great education, but I don't know if modern children will ever learn all of these words.I do appreciate how he bundles all references to God in the myth sections."

I liked Hume's neat idea for evaluating the plausibility of a ""stated"" miracle. The writing is lucid and often witty; should be a great read for youngsters even."

The way he unwrapped some myths and miracles with the help of the science is really beautiful.

Reality itself can be only be explained through science, and scientific methods. What cannot be explained, can be explained in time to come! the machinery of (scientific) methods, is only improving to validate the phenomenon that are yet to be explained. Science is collaborative and unending in it's nature. It should be native to every mind, and should be accepted, and valued. Coming to the book now: I love Dawkins, not only he is humble in his untiring efforts to put 'educating the masses and improving scientific literacy' at top of his agenda, but also doesn't disregard the polemicists so immediately without putting forth a reasonable explanation (reasonable to reasonable people i guess), which I think is what makes him a better person also.

(Bouchardon & Heckman, 2012). This text is Dawkin’s first for teenagers, persuading the reader that the reality of science is as ‘magical’ as mythology. The well researched content is clearly presented, however, on occasions, Dawkins resorts to first person thus detracting from the authority of the text as it reveals his bias.The new Australian English curriculum requires students to respond to and compose texts in different media and technologies. Whilst this text has been primarily written for teenagers, each chapter’s introductory segment retelling myths and legends is suitable for primary school students because the text is clear, the language succinct and the enhancement engaging eg the flames surrounding Hades. Science & Technology units, Primary Connections, are based on the 5e learning model allowing for segments of The Magic of Reality to be shared as a background resource to enhance student understanding in the Earth and space sciences strand. The digital affordances of this app allow for its use to explain scientific concepts across all learning styles eg. Chapter 2, blowing the iguanas across the water whilst avoiding the whirlpools; Chapter 3, the use of a slider to demonstrate the size of the stars. Callow (2013, p. 102) discusses the use of visuals in informative texts, supporting meaning.A linear reading experience is allowed when reading The Magic of Reality, as well as reading it as a non-fiction text by dipping into chapters. The digital affordances supplement the text without distraction. They are many and varied, strategically placed within the text primarily to explain scientific concepts, eg video to explain seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres. Many provide feedback, allowing the reader to repeat the activity to improve his/her personal result eg. Chapter 1, evolution through ‘breeding’ frogs to survive the snakes; Chapter 4, states of matter, firing Newton’s cannon to visualize gravity. Dawkins provides suggestions for the reader to further investigate eg an invitation in Chapter 4 to Google “Iron cold iron” by Kipling to add to the explanation of liquids, solids and gases; a reference to Earthsearch to further explain how big is space.The Magic of Reality is intuitive and easy to navigate, the reader is able to swipe down to view chapters and current position, supporting Jabr (2013). The full colour images and audio (read by Dawkins) are high quality when viewed on an iPad3. Will this enhanced eBook have longevity? A question difficult to answer, for at least two reasons. Firstly, science changes, as Dawkins remarks eg in Chapter 10, his references to earthquakes in Haiti and Christchurch, and Japan’s tsunami. Will this app be updated as required? A specific answer to this has not been found, other than updates provided through Apple iTunes.

172,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47528776-ibnul-shah,5,"This is one of the most amazing books on science I have ever read. Richard Dawkins' explanatory abilities are unquestionable; the way he explains complicated things is absolutely astonishing. This book talks about different topics of science in a very lucid way, and I think if someone wants a basic introduction to science, this book is an excellent option. The author says its intended for children aged 12-13 years- after reading this book, they'll clearly understand how science works and how to think and act like a scientist. The most important chapter in this book, in my opinion, is the second chapter titled 'Who was the first person?' where Dawkins explains evolution with interesting thought experiments and irrefutable logic. All the other chapters are also filled with exciting scientific elucidations of natural phenomenons, followed by the colorful mythical explanation of the same. The last two chapters were less science related, here the writer emphasizes more on making the reader have a scientific outlook on everything. I love how he ends the book: ""The truth is more magical - in the best and the most exciting sense of the world - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.""However, in some chapters, Dawkins' anti-religious sentiment was clearly exposed and I don't know how readers in countries like mine will take it. Moreover, chapters like 'what are things made of' or 'what is the sun' were pretty boring for me. So I guess these chapters would seem a bit uninteresting for an older reader who has basic ideas about science. On the other hand, it is because of these chapters you can call this book an introduction to science. But all in all, this book was a really pleasant read for me, and I'd say it is a must-read for every children as well as grown-ups with curiosity and enthusiasm about science."
173,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/845928-owen,3,"This book is aimed at teens, I guess, but while the science seems to be at the appropriate level, its discursive and rhetorical style are probably going to go over their heads. Dawkins' approach is to present mythical explanations for natural phenomena, followed by our current scientific understanding of what's really going on—the reality which is, in his terms, even more ""magical"" and wonderful than the myth. I'm dismayed that our supposedly advanced civilizations, particularly the US, are still so blindered by religion that such a book seems necessary and appropriate, but even so I think it would be best to put the dismantling of religious stories as secondary to the explanation of scientific realities: any teen who is going to encounter this book with an open mind will already be receptive to Dawkins' ideas, while anyone who actually believes any of the religious or mythic stories is going to be put on the defensive by Dawkins' attack.I guess this is the same problem even non-religious people have with other facets of the ""New Atheism"": it gets in your face as an idea whose truth requires the falsehood of competing explanations—and, however great your disagreement, getting in someone's face like that is just poor manners. The Magic of Reality is only very slightly boorish in that way, but I think it would have been a better and more wonder-full book if it hadn't addressed myths and religions at all, and just presented the ""magic"" of our scientific understanding of the world."
174,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,3,"The audio version of this book is read by Richard Dawkins and some other Lalla Ward. This is mainly relevant because it meant that I got to spend 5 hours listening to British accents. =)The book itself was good. Each chapter poses a question, gives some answers provided by traditional myths, and then talks about the real scientific answer. I'll lay out up front, that yes, Dawkins does use the Bible for some of his examples of myths, but except to the biblical literalists (especially of the Creationist variety), these are the parts of the Bible that are generally taken to have a mythical element.Also, while I'm on the disclaimers, this book focuses on where Dawkins does best -- explaining science in a manner accessible to the lay reader -- but it does veer just a little into rantiness in one of the later chapters.Moving along, the questions and answers presented in this book should be broadly familiar to anyone who had an retained a decent science education, but there was the occasional moment of ""so that's how it works!"" illumination. For me, one such moment was the explanation of why the angle of the earth relative to the sun makes such a difference in perceived temperature [1]. From an educational standpoint, I think that this would be a really great book to get for a high school student or even an advanced middle school student.[1] When the sun hits the earth at a shallower angle, the same amount of solar energy is spread over a wider area, so the energy received per square inch is decreased."

All my basic scientific knowledge, I have to say, was largely from the books of junior and senior school times and am afraid that I only got nebulous impression now.But the book, this book, the magic of reality still shocked me a little bit, not because of its abstruse contents but because of its simplicity. I guess it is a little book aimed at transmitting basic scientific knowledge to teenagers or young people. So it's another book on common sense.It is not as “prodigiously illuminous and beautifully designed” as it should be, but it's an amusing book and Richard indeed imbued the book with his hilarious humor, which really gave me a lot of laughters in reading.He would list a few mythologies or stories that precede his revealing of the true explanations of the question. And if you are discreet a bit more you would invariably find his “sarcastic tone” for people's beliefs and his ardent support for evolution.If you need to get some basic knowledge about how some natural phenomena happened or physics information such as elements or molecules, all such stuff could be found in the book with concise introductions.But if you want to know more about evolution, as a friend recommend to me, it's better to read his other works like ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution"" or ""The self Gene"" or some similar works from other authors .1.03.2016"
176,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6404815-henri-h-m-l-inen,4,"Richard Dawkins is world famous evolutionary biologist and author. His book The Magic of Reality tries to explain in understandable ways some of the really complicated phenomenons of physics and science overall.In the midway of the book, I felt like back in school. Quite many things very familiar, but the way Mr. Dawkins explains those helped to deepen the understanding quite a bit.The book goes through topics all the way from big bang to evolution to quantum mechanics. So it is really comprehensive overview to the universe as we know it. I give the credit to him on explaining things in very understandable ways.Mr Dawkins is a know atheist and science believer. It really shows in the book. He dismisses all religions. He does admit that there are many things science can't explain yet, but he sees it only as a shortage of current science, not as a possibility for higher forces. Atheism actually came disturbingly through from all the writing. That's a shame, in science facts should be facts without personal believes.I have to still recommend to people who want to understand physics and the world better. I felt like getting a fast recap of learning's from physics from many years at school. It's an excellent book, if you can tolerate the pushing of atheism.This review was originally published in my blog - here"
177,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1215485-megan,4,"This is a beautiful book with some really great illustrations, and it does a wonderful job of making science accessible to younger readers (although, not super young - the writing style is a bit challenging at times). This would be a really cool textbook, or style for a textbook.The writing occasionally edges into the dry, but there are enough anecdotes and pretty pictures to make up for the occasional wall of text.My only problem is with his approach towards mythological stories. I like the variety he presented, but I would have liked more historical context behind the stories as well as the recognition that a lot of stories like the ones he shared were ancient people's way of exploring/explaining the world around them, even though they sound silly today. However, he does use the stories as a way of teaching logical, critical thinking, which I liked.Anyway, I wish I had known how cool science was in school. This book helped me clear up a few bits of confusion (mostly about atoms, because I pretty much just suffered through chemistry class blankly) and offers a neat perspective on the world."
178,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5841574-linda-rawlinson,5,"This book is an excellent explanation of science, what it's for, and why it's important. I don't really see it as a book for children, I see it as a book for anyone who wants to think about the beauty of science and everything. It's a book that just consolidates what we already know - I didn't really learn anything knew from it, but I didn't expect to; I did find that the book helped me to pin down my thoughts on reality though, which is just what I hoped it would do. Of course, it's aimed at a younger audience, but that didn't lessen my enjoyment of it. I found it to be delightful, and thought-provoking. The illustrations by Dave McKean were super, and really enhanced the text. I will use this book when I want to talk to my children about science - they're a little young to understand these ideas just yet, but I'm looking forward to when they begin to question their realities. And I'm looking forward to showing them some proper evidence about why 'God' cannot exist - some damage has been done by school telling them that they're Christians! I hope I can undo it."
179,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29394370-srikanth-krishnamurthy,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The author, Richard Dawkins has taken a step forward and cleverly illustrated the reason for things such as what is magic and reality ? who we are ? why we have winter and summer ? what is sun ? and many natural prodigies which one would like to explore. Almost every chapter starts with different myths that were registered by our ancestors in this planet however it’s the science and the scientists who applied the it and figured out the several factors that would determine the actual reason for the way our planet and things were formed and developed. The author has intelligently extracted required information from the world of science and clearly related to the things described in the book. I would happily add this book to nominate for book of the year 2016 :)Overall - Magic of Reality : Explore the realities of core things through the outcome of science in our planet and there is something amazing inside to educate ourselves beyond that as well :)"
180,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,5,"Target audience: The book primarily targets children and young adults, but it is good for adults who know little about biology as well.About the author: According to Wikipedia, Clinton Richard Dawkins is an English evolutionary biologist and author. He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford, and was the University of Oxford's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008. Dawkins is an atheist, and is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design. In his 1986 book The Blind Watchmaker, he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. He is an opponent of creationism being taught in schools. He has been awarded many prestigious academic and writing awards and he makes regular television, radio and Internet appearances, predominantly discussing his books, his atheism, and his ideas and opinions as a public intellectual.Structure of the book: The book has 272 pages and it is divided in 12 chapters, each chapter having a unique title.Overview: Dawkins says that it is unlikely for a supernatural creator of the world to exist. He contends that religious thought is merely a delusion. This is why nearly all of the chapters begin with a brief synopsis of creation myths in an attempt to explain various observed phenomena. He chooses these myths from all over the world, such as Babylonian, Aztec, Judeo-Christian, Ancient Egyptian, Japanese, Maori, Australian Aboriginal, Hellenic, Nordic, Chinese, and includes even modern alien-abduction mythology. But Dawkins not only enumerates myths, he has a special pleasure dismantling them. In fact, the entire book is a battle between myths and science, or fiction and reality.In early childhood every single one of us – including the author as we find out – asked ourselves: How does this work? Why is this thing here and not there? Why do birds have wings and how can they fly? Why the bear has the color it has?When we are young and naive, we give all sort of answers, one more ridiculous than the other. And the answers we give seem very legit. But, as we grow older and acquire more knowledge, the initial answers are no longer suited to explain reality. So, we abandon them and we try to find other answers for explaining what happens around us.The same it is with the difference between myths and science: myths are failed sciences which were useful in the “childhood” of mankind, when people used sticks to hunt for their prey or rocks to make fire. But now humanity is mature and myths and religions no longer have any utility; on the contrary, in most cases it slows down our moral and scientific progress. Indeed, reality has a natural capacity for beauty. It could be argued that reality – due to its complexity – is, in fact, more magical than any other thing possible. But nobody can deny that very minute phenomena were not known to archaic peoples before the creation of optical magnification devices. Moreover, many of them involve a god's symbolic act performed just once. So, any passages believed to be inspired by gods have not mentioned any knowledge as outside human experience. In this regard Dawkins provides the nice example of the story Cinderella. The little children, when this story is read to them, really believe that a pumpkin can turn into a golden carriage. But in the real world the Fairy Godmother is unable to magically make this transformation with his wand. This is because the pumpkins and carriages have an internal organization that is complex and very, very different. A large pumpkin is impossible to turn into a carriage no matter how well you reorganize its structure.In the later chapters Dawkins address topics that range from speciation and evolutionary biology to physical phenomena like atomic theory or plate tectonics. He declines to explain topics he does not understand. I love his honesty. He characterizes his knowledge of quantum mechanics as at best foggy. He does not attempt to appear more knowledgeable than he is in order to protect his ego. The book is also filled with interesting facts and I found it improved my knowledge of evolutionary biology without sounding like a text book. So, overall, as Dawkins says, a good way to tell if you really understand something or not is whether or not you can explain it to someone else and have them also understand it too.Quote: The truth is more magical - in the best and most exciting sense of the word - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.Strong points: Through brilliant examples and light scientific details Dawkins manages to make his points clear and complex topics easy to understand. Moreover, Dawkins's ability to pose the right questions make his writing a pleasure to read. I believe the layman – even an adolescent child – would have no trouble understanding.Weak points: If you are versed in science, this book will be indeed perceived as weak. However, for the laymen, it is a great source of information and entertainment at the same time. I personally enjoyed the book so much don’t remember any negative feelings I had while reading it._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"
181,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070035-kartik-narayanan,4,"In this book, the author, Richard Dawkins, explains various natural phenomena. He starts the book by identifying three different kinds of magic supernatural magic (things that happen in fairy tales, myths, religious texts etc.) stage magic (things that we know are false but are fun to watch - stage magicians for example) poetic magic (the kind of magic we use to describe our feelings about a great movie or watching a sunset or scenery etc.). Dawkins demonstrates that our ancestors used to explain our world using supernatural magic. He then explains it in the form of poetic magic (i.e. ""what is"" as opposed to ""what we think is""). He picks up the most popular myths and explains these with science. We get to see that supernatural magic is the fear of understanding while poetic magic is the joy of understanding. Richard Dawkins is the world's most famous evolutionary biologist. He is also one of the world's foremost atheists. He has authored many great books, including the ""The Selfish Gene"" and ""The God Delusion"". You have to read those books if you have not already. I consider him to be one of the luminaries of this century - on par with Richard Feynman and others - in popularizing science and reason`. A warning - he is an atheist and uses reason & logic to dissect superstitions and beliefs. So if your faith is fickle or offended, do not bother reading his books. But, you will enjoy his books and be a better person if you have an open mind. This book is meant for general consumption.I highly recommend reading this book. Dawkins explains scientific concepts brilliantly. This understanding leads to a greater appreciation of Nature and the Universe. He calls out areas where he is not explain things well (quarks for example). What is reality? What is magic? - explains the nature of reality and the nature of magic Who was the first person? - explores our origins Why are there so many different kinds of animals? - explores evolution What are things made of? - atomic theory Why do we have day and night, summer and winter? - the earth, sun and orbits What is the Sun? - stellar mechanics What is a rainbow? - optics When and how did everything begin? - Big Bang theory Are we alone? - Aliens and the nature of the universe What are earthquakes? - plate tectonics Why do bad things happen? - chaos What is a miracle? - science vs belief"
182,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"Something Dawkins stated in his book The Ancestor’s Tale has never left me: “My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely that they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world.” There is nothing in the holy books to compare with what science has opened up for human understanding of the world around us. I am humbled by my own ignorance of science but my ignorance doesn’t drive me to become anti-science. If your religion forces you to turn your mind away from science then it’s time to find another religion…or just drop your silly beliefs once and for all. I grew up in a Catholic family but I never for a single conscious moment believed in any the teachings held by the faith of my parents. I have never believed in a god, ever.I would like to add “and that has made all the difference” but simply being an atheist doesn’t get you anywhere on its own. For that you need to open up your mind and put your elbows on the table, as we like to say in Spanish about studying. It’s astounding to me that there are many, many people in the world today who don’t know why we have seasons, or that the earth is billions of years old, or that matter is made up of atoms. Instead, they cling to fairy tales written thousands of years ago to explain these phenomena.I have read things written by Muslims who try to show how the Koran explains science and how their prophet was centuries ahead of his time. Nonsense, just like everything in that book. The same is true of the Bible and the Talmud, and all the others. But don’t think of this book as being anti-religion but pro-mankind. And what is wrong with that? I am so tired of Dawkins’ critics labeling him as strident and belligerent towards religious people.If I were the king of the world I would make everyone read this book and then they would have to prove that they read it and understood it. After that, if you want to go on believing in the offal your religion sloshes out then go right ahead. Since I won’t be king any time soon then perhaps we can make this book available to every adolescent so that they can make their own choices because there are only two: myth or science."
183,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6031670-bruce-caithness,3,"The critical underpinning of science is brought to attention in ""The Magic of Reality"" as well as the wonderful list of findings that have been put forward by science. One cannot fault the book for lacking enthusiasm.Joe Barnhart in Karl Popper: Philosopher of Critical Realism made some nice comments that temper Richard Dawkins sometimes overly enthusiastic positivism.Myths graduate to science when they are open to being tested, science rests on a bedrock of mythology.Creationists who insist on classifying their views as ""scientific creationism"" may not know what they are getting into. Do they really want to assert that creationism is falsifiable? Do they want to try to expose its weaknesses and flaws? Do they seek to correct and revise the doctrine? As is well known, creationists take great delight in pointing out that the theory of evolution is, after all, a theory. But this should pose no problem. All scientific theories are theories. Do creationists want to say that creationism is a theory? Do they want to say that the notion of the Bible as inerrant revelation is a theory?If Karl Popper's analysis is correct, then both evolution and creationism are theories. The real question has to do with how well they are articulated, how well they serve to advance further research, and how well they survive rigorous criticism. The overwhelming majority of biologists and anthropologists have found creationism to be a poor rival to evolution in the attempt to expand our knowledge. Contrary to what some creationists claim, scientists tend to favor evolution as an explanatory theory not because of some presupposition that blinds them to the truth but, rather, because it is scientifically more fruitful than creationism and enjoys greater explanatory power."
184,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19638210-dane-cobain,4,"This book is a bit of a weird one because it takes the form of a series of responses to questions, and so every chapter in the book is based upon a question like, “When and how did everything begin?” It’s a pretty simple setup that allows Dawkins to tackle some of the bigger questions that people have, but it does also mean that it feels as though something’s somehow lacking.Don’t get me wrong, the science was solid and Dawkins made his arguments well, and I do feel that I’ve learned a bunch of stuff here. At the same time, it feels a bit like he’s set out to try to explain everything and then settled for just a few frequently asked questions. I’m not sure what he could have done differently though, because if the book was two or three times the length, it would have ended up feeling long and drawn out.Still, it was a pretty good way to keep my brain trained and to learn a few new lessons about science and stuff. This isn’t necessarily the best non-fiction science book on the market, but I polished it off in 24 hours or so and was happy with it, even if it was just okay. After all, I’m slowly working my way through everything that Dawkins has ever written, and this is probably one of the most approachable. All in all, I’m glad I read it and maybe you’ll like it too."
185,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3974523-prem-aparanji,2,"Not for young children. Teenagers maybe. But otherwise good compilation of myths and their contrast with scientific reasons for various questions like origin of universe, man, etc. Scientific temper is necessary and that requires a skeptical mind. Denouncing myths is one thing, not understanding their power is another. Myths have the power to capture the imagination of the child. Not this book.Richard Dawkins has a good intent, bad execution. He needs to learn how to narrate, make science facts wondrous for the imaginative child. And imagination is being able to grasp the vastness of space or antiquity of universe. Imagination is how the primitive Earth might have been, how life might have evolved. None of the magic is exploited in this book.The author instead of exploiting the power of imagination goes on rambling against the fantasies of various mythologies.Where scientists like Einstein, Bohr, Oppenheimer, Arthur Clark, etc. have all drawn inspiration from ancient texts like the Vedas and the Gita, Dawkins dismisses them. He does not seem to understand the symbolism and takes them for the literal words, like a common man."
186,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3363047-karel-baloun,4,"This is a fine capstone book for Richard Dawkins illustrious career; I can't think of how it could be better.He bounces back-and-forth between myth and reality, and leaves us hopeful that tomorrow's reality will look like magic to us.Yet, as a science interested adult, it seemed to me that I knew every fact and every story in the book, perhaps because cosmos told so many, or because it's hard to be original in these foundational science areas with the Internet. The only truly original presentation I saw, was the fantastic 3 mile deep family album.Unfortunately, for modern children, I don't think this is a workable delivery mechanism. Of course he tries to make it interesting, and the text format novelties and fantastic illustrations, show great effort. But it can't compete with video, and they're just too many words I think for children to work through. The words and the names are all quite advanced, so it's great education, but I don't know if modern children will ever learn all of these words.I do appreciate how he bundles all references to God in the myth sections."
187,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14258644-mohammad-tanviruzzaman,4,"Science's explanation can be more beautiful and amazing than any myth, miracle, or magic: Dawkins makes this point by picking up a series of questions (like: what is real? what is a rainbow? why do we have night and day, summer and winter? who is the first person? why are there so many kinds of life-forms? etc.), which haunt many of us time and again, and then he presents what the myths have to offer as the answer to each of those questions and what science has to offer; and through this journey one is introduced to a lot of important stuffs about science and moreover the way scientists go about applying scientific method to come up with answers. I liked Hume's neat idea for evaluating the plausibility of a ""stated"" miracle. The writing is lucid and often witty; should be a great read for youngsters even."

The way he unwrapped some myths and miracles with the help of the science is really beautiful. For examples, who was the first person in this world, What are things made of, rainbow, sun etc. It is one of the simplest book I have read that deals with physics,cosmology and evolutionary biology. I would give five star to this book."

Reality itself can be only be explained through science, and scientific methods. What cannot be explained, can be explained in time to come! the machinery of (scientific) methods, is only improving to validate the phenomenon that are yet to be explained. Science is collaborative and unending in it's nature. It should be native to every mind, and should be accepted, and valued. Coming to the book now: I love Dawkins, not only he is humble in his untiring efforts to put 'educating the masses and improving scientific literacy' at top of his agenda, but also doesn't disregard the polemicists so immediately without putting forth a reasonable explanation (reasonable to reasonable people i guess), which I think is what makes him a better person also. This book is a comprehensive approach to understand reality through the lens of science juxtaposing ancient and present-day myths about them.Read it please, and read it to your children as well."

In fact, the audience for this book seems to be people with shockingly little education as almost all the information contained in it is stuff a person should learn by the end of high school, stuff like ""what is an earthquake?"", ""what is a rainbow?"", the basics of evolution and gravity and other stuff like that. The fact that this book has to exist at all for adults is quite sad."

200,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32340477-patricia-lee,5,"As a work of non-fiction,The Magic of Reality: How we know what’s really true, by Richard Dawkins and illustrated by Dave McKean, is an app, where “reading relies on touch and manipulation”. (Bouchardon & Heckman, 2012). This text is Dawkin’s first for teenagers, persuading the reader that the reality of science is as ‘magical’ as mythology. The well researched content is clearly presented, however, on occasions, Dawkins resorts to first person thus detracting from the authority of the text as it reveals his bias.The new Australian English curriculum requires students to respond to and compose texts in different media and technologies. Whilst this text has been primarily written for teenagers, each chapter’s introductory segment retelling myths and legends is suitable for primary school students because the text is clear, the language succinct and the enhancement engaging eg the flames surrounding Hades. Science & Technology units, Primary Connections, are based on the 5e learning model allowing for segments of The Magic of Reality to be shared as a background resource to enhance student understanding in the Earth and space sciences strand. The digital affordances of this app allow for its use to explain scientific concepts across all learning styles eg. Chapter 2, blowing the iguanas across the water whilst avoiding the whirlpools; Chapter 3, the use of a slider to demonstrate the size of the stars. Callow (2013, p. 102) discusses the use of visuals in informative texts, supporting meaning.A linear reading experience is allowed when reading The Magic of Reality, as well as reading it as a non-fiction text by dipping into chapters. The digital affordances supplement the text without distraction. They are many and varied, strategically placed within the text primarily to explain scientific concepts, eg video to explain seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres. Many provide feedback, allowing the reader to repeat the activity to improve his/her personal result eg. Chapter 1, evolution through ‘breeding’ frogs to survive the snakes; Chapter 4, states of matter, firing Newton’s cannon to visualize gravity. Dawkins provides suggestions for the reader to further investigate eg an invitation in Chapter 4 to Google “Iron cold iron” by Kipling to add to the explanation of liquids, solids and gases; a reference to Earthsearch to further explain how big is space.The Magic of Reality is intuitive and easy to navigate, the reader is able to swipe down to view chapters and current position, supporting Jabr (2013). The full colour images and audio (read by Dawkins) are high quality when viewed on an iPad3. Will this enhanced eBook have longevity? A question difficult to answer, for at least two reasons. Firstly, science changes, as Dawkins remarks eg in Chapter 10, his references to earthquakes in Haiti and Christchurch, and Japan’s tsunami. Will this app be updated as required? A specific answer to this has not been found, other than updates provided through Apple iTunes. Despite this, The Magic of Reality is highly recommended for not only teenagers but readers interested in science. The app could be described as “Myth Busters meets Science for Dummies”.

202,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47528776-ibnul-shah,5,"This is one of the most amazing books on science I have ever read. Richard Dawkins' explanatory abilities are unquestionable; the way he explains complicated things is absolutely astonishing. This book talks about different topics of science in a very lucid way, and I think if someone wants a basic introduction to science, this book is an excellent option. The author says its intended for children aged 12-13 years- after reading this book, they'll clearly understand how science works and how to think and act like a scientist. The most important chapter in this book, in my opinion, is the second chapter titled 'Who was the first person?' where Dawkins explains evolution with interesting thought experiments and irrefutable logic. All the other chapters are also filled with exciting scientific elucidations of natural phenomenons, followed by the colorful mythical explanation of the same. The last two chapters were less science related, here the writer emphasizes more on making the reader have a scientific outlook on everything. I love how he ends the book: ""The truth is more magical - in the best and the most exciting sense of the world - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.""However, in some chapters, Dawkins' anti-religious sentiment was clearly exposed and I don't know how readers in countries like mine will take it. Moreover, chapters like 'what are things made of' or 'what is the sun' were pretty boring for me. So I guess these chapters would seem a bit uninteresting for an older reader who has basic ideas about science. On the other hand, it is because of these chapters you can call this book an introduction to science. But all in all, this book was a really pleasant read for me, and I'd say it is a must-read for every children as well as grown-ups with curiosity and enthusiasm about science."
203,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/845928-owen,3,"This book is aimed at teens, I guess, but while the science seems to be at the appropriate level, its discursive and rhetorical style are probably going to go over their heads. Dawkins' approach is to present mythical explanations for natural phenomena, followed by our current scientific understanding of what's really going on—the reality which is, in his terms, even more ""magical"" and wonderful than the myth. I'm dismayed that our supposedly advanced civilizations, particularly the US, are still so blindered by religion that such a book seems necessary and appropriate, but even so I think it would be best to put the dismantling of religious stories as secondary to the explanation of scientific realities: any teen who is going to encounter this book with an open mind will already be receptive to Dawkins' ideas, while anyone who actually believes any of the religious or mythic stories is going to be put on the defensive by Dawkins' attack.I guess this is the same problem even non-religious people have with other facets of the ""New Atheism"": it gets in your face as an idea whose truth requires the falsehood of competing explanations—and, however great your disagreement, getting in someone's face like that is just poor manners. The Magic of Reality is only very slightly boorish in that way, but I think it would have been a better and more wonder-full book if it hadn't addressed myths and religions at all, and just presented the ""magic"" of our scientific understanding of the world."
204,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,3,"The audio version of this book is read by Richard Dawkins and some other Lalla Ward. This is mainly relevant because it meant that I got to spend 5 hours listening to British accents. =)The book itself was good. Each chapter poses a question, gives some answers provided by traditional myths, and then talks about the real scientific answer. I'll lay out up front, that yes, Dawkins does use the Bible for some of his examples of myths, but except to the biblical literalists (especially of the Creationist variety), these are the parts of the Bible that are generally taken to have a mythical element.Also, while I'm on the disclaimers, this book focuses on where Dawkins does best -- explaining science in a manner accessible to the lay reader -- but it does veer just a little into rantiness in one of the later chapters.Moving along, the questions and answers presented in this book should be broadly familiar to anyone who had an retained a decent science education, but there was the occasional moment of ""so that's how it works!"" illumination. For me, one such moment was the explanation of why the angle of the earth relative to the sun makes such a difference in perceived temperature [1]. From an educational standpoint, I think that this would be a really great book to get for a high school student or even an advanced middle school student.[1] When the sun hits the earth at a shallower angle, the same amount of solar energy is spread over a wider area, so the energy received per square inch is decreased."
205,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49013470-brit-cheung,3,"I found a few copies of Richard Dawkins recommended by a friend by whom I sensed I need to read some scientific books to complement my poor basic science knowledge. All my basic scientific knowledge, I have to say, was largely from the books of junior and senior school times and am afraid that I only got nebulous impression now.But the book, this book, the magic of reality still shocked me a little bit, not because of its abstruse contents but because of its simplicity. I guess it is a little book aimed at transmitting basic scientific knowledge to teenagers or young people. So it's another book on common sense.It is not as “prodigiously illuminous and beautifully designed” as it should be, but it's an amusing book and Richard indeed imbued the book with his hilarious humor, which really gave me a lot of laughters in reading.He would list a few mythologies or stories that precede his revealing of the true explanations of the question. And if you are discreet a bit more you would invariably find his “sarcastic tone” for people's beliefs and his ardent support for evolution.If you need to get some basic knowledge about how some natural phenomena happened or physics information such as elements or molecules, all such stuff could be found in the book with concise introductions.But if you want to know more about evolution, as a friend recommend to me, it's better to read his other works like ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution"" or ""The self Gene"" or some similar works from other authors .1.03.2016"
206,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6404815-henri-h-m-l-inen,4,"Richard Dawkins is world famous evolutionary biologist and author. His book The Magic of Reality tries to explain in understandable ways some of the really complicated phenomenons of physics and science overall.In the midway of the book, I felt like back in school. Quite many things very familiar, but the way Mr. Dawkins explains those helped to deepen the understanding quite a bit.The book goes through topics all the way from big bang to evolution to quantum mechanics. So it is really comprehensive overview to the universe as we know it. I give the credit to him on explaining things in very understandable ways.Mr Dawkins is a know atheist and science believer. It really shows in the book. He dismisses all religions. He does admit that there are many things science can't explain yet, but he sees it only as a shortage of current science, not as a possibility for higher forces. Atheism actually came disturbingly through from all the writing. That's a shame, in science facts should be facts without personal believes.I have to still recommend to people who want to understand physics and the world better. I felt like getting a fast recap of learning's from physics from many years at school. It's an excellent book, if you can tolerate the pushing of atheism.This review was originally published in my blog - here"
207,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1215485-megan,4,"This is a beautiful book with some really great illustrations, and it does a wonderful job of making science accessible to younger readers (although, not super young - the writing style is a bit challenging at times). This would be a really cool textbook, or style for a textbook.The writing occasionally edges into the dry, but there are enough anecdotes and pretty pictures to make up for the occasional wall of text.My only problem is with his approach towards mythological stories. I like the variety he presented, but I would have liked more historical context behind the stories as well as the recognition that a lot of stories like the ones he shared were ancient people's way of exploring/explaining the world around them, even though they sound silly today. However, he does use the stories as a way of teaching logical, critical thinking, which I liked.Anyway, I wish I had known how cool science was in school. This book helped me clear up a few bits of confusion (mostly about atoms, because I pretty much just suffered through chemistry class blankly) and offers a neat perspective on the world."
208,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5841574-linda-rawlinson,5,"This book is an excellent explanation of science, what it's for, and why it's important. I don't really see it as a book for children, I see it as a book for anyone who wants to think about the beauty of science and everything. It's a book that just consolidates what we already know - I didn't really learn anything knew from it, but I didn't expect to; I did find that the book helped me to pin down my thoughts on reality though, which is just what I hoped it would do. Of course, it's aimed at a younger audience, but that didn't lessen my enjoyment of it. I found it to be delightful, and thought-provoking. The illustrations by Dave McKean were super, and really enhanced the text. I will use this book when I want to talk to my children about science - they're a little young to understand these ideas just yet, but I'm looking forward to when they begin to question their realities. And I'm looking forward to showing them some proper evidence about why 'God' cannot exist - some damage has been done by school telling them that they're Christians! I hope I can undo it."

The author, Richard Dawkins has taken a step forward and cleverly illustrated the reason for things such as what is magic and reality ? who we are ? why we have winter and summer ? what is sun ? and many natural prodigies which one would like to explore. Almost every chapter starts with different myths that were registered by our ancestors in this planet however it’s the science and the scientists who applied the it and figured out the several factors that would determine the actual reason for the way our planet and things were formed and developed. The author has intelligently extracted required information from the world of science and clearly related to the things described in the book. I would happily add this book to nominate for book of the year 2016 :)Overall - Magic of Reality : Explore the realities of core things through the outcome of science in our planet and there is something amazing inside to educate ourselves beyond that as well :)"
210,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,5,"Target audience: The book primarily targets children and young adults, but it is good for adults who know little about biology as well.About the author: According to Wikipedia, Clinton Richard Dawkins is an English evolutionary biologist and author. He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford, and was the University of Oxford's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008. Dawkins is an atheist, and is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design. In his 1986 book The Blind Watchmaker, he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. He is an opponent of creationism being taught in schools. He has been awarded many prestigious academic and writing awards and he makes regular television, radio and Internet appearances, predominantly discussing his books, his atheism, and his ideas and opinions as a public intellectual.Structure of the book: The book has 272 pages and it is divided in 12 chapters, each chapter having a unique title.Overview: Dawkins says that it is unlikely for a supernatural creator of the world to exist. He contends that religious thought is merely a delusion. This is why nearly all of the chapters begin with a brief synopsis of creation myths in an attempt to explain various observed phenomena. He chooses these myths from all over the world, such as Babylonian, Aztec, Judeo-Christian, Ancient Egyptian, Japanese, Maori, Australian Aboriginal, Hellenic, Nordic, Chinese, and includes even modern alien-abduction mythology. But Dawkins not only enumerates myths, he has a special pleasure dismantling them. In fact, the entire book is a battle between myths and science, or fiction and reality.In early childhood every single one of us – including the author as we find out – asked ourselves: How does this work? Why is this thing here and not there? Why do birds have wings and how can they fly? Why the bear has the color it has?When we are young and naive, we give all sort of answers, one more ridiculous than the other. And the answers we give seem very legit. But, as we grow older and acquire more knowledge, the initial answers are no longer suited to explain reality. So, we abandon them and we try to find other answers for explaining what happens around us.The same it is with the difference between myths and science: myths are failed sciences which were useful in the “childhood” of mankind, when people used sticks to hunt for their prey or rocks to make fire. But now humanity is mature and myths and religions no longer have any utility; on the contrary, in most cases it slows down our moral and scientific progress. Indeed, reality has a natural capacity for beauty. It could be argued that reality – due to its complexity – is, in fact, more magical than any other thing possible. But nobody can deny that very minute phenomena were not known to archaic peoples before the creation of optical magnification devices. Moreover, many of them involve a god's symbolic act performed just once. So, any passages believed to be inspired by gods have not mentioned any knowledge as outside human experience. In this regard Dawkins provides the nice example of the story Cinderella. The little children, when this story is read to them, really believe that a pumpkin can turn into a golden carriage. But in the real world the Fairy Godmother is unable to magically make this transformation with his wand. This is because the pumpkins and carriages have an internal organization that is complex and very, very different. A large pumpkin is impossible to turn into a carriage no matter how well you reorganize its structure.In the later chapters Dawkins address topics that range from speciation and evolutionary biology to physical phenomena like atomic theory or plate tectonics. He declines to explain topics he does not understand. I love his honesty. He characterizes his knowledge of quantum mechanics as at best foggy. He does not attempt to appear more knowledgeable than he is in order to protect his ego. The book is also filled with interesting facts and I found it improved my knowledge of evolutionary biology without sounding like a text book. So, overall, as Dawkins says, a good way to tell if you really understand something or not is whether or not you can explain it to someone else and have them also understand it too.Quote: The truth is more magical - in the best and most exciting sense of the word - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.Strong points: Through brilliant examples and light scientific details Dawkins manages to make his points clear and complex topics easy to understand. Moreover, Dawkins's ability to pose the right questions make his writing a pleasure to read. I believe the layman – even an adolescent child – would have no trouble understanding.Weak points: If you are versed in science, this book will be indeed perceived as weak. However, for the laymen, it is a great source of information and entertainment at the same time. I personally enjoyed the book so much don’t remember any negative feelings I had while reading it._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"
211,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070035-kartik-narayanan,4,"In this book, the author, Richard Dawkins, explains various natural phenomena. He starts the book by identifying three different kinds of magic supernatural magic (things that happen in fairy tales, myths, religious texts etc.) stage magic (things that we know are false but are fun to watch - stage magicians for example) poetic magic (the kind of magic we use to describe our feelings about a great movie or watching a sunset or scenery etc.). Dawkins demonstrates that our ancestors used to explain our world using supernatural magic. He then explains it in the form of poetic magic (i.e. ""what is"" as opposed to ""what we think is""). He picks up the most popular myths and explains these with science. We get to see that supernatural magic is the fear of understanding while poetic magic is the joy of understanding. Richard Dawkins is the world's most famous evolutionary biologist. He is also one of the world's foremost atheists. He has authored many great books, including the ""The Selfish Gene"" and ""The God Delusion"". You have to read those books if you have not already. I consider him to be one of the luminaries of this century - on par with Richard Feynman and others - in popularizing science and reason`. A warning - he is an atheist and uses reason & logic to dissect superstitions and beliefs. So if your faith is fickle or offended, do not bother reading his books. But, you will enjoy his books and be a better person if you have an open mind. This book is meant for general consumption.I highly recommend reading this book. Dawkins explains scientific concepts brilliantly. This understanding leads to a greater appreciation of Nature and the Universe. He calls out areas where he is not explain things well (quarks for example). What is reality? What is magic? - explains the nature of reality and the nature of magic Who was the first person? - explores our origins Why are there so many different kinds of animals? - explores evolution What are things made of? - atomic theory Why do we have day and night, summer and winter? - the earth, sun and orbits What is the Sun? - stellar mechanics What is a rainbow? - optics When and how did everything begin? - Big Bang theory Are we alone? - Aliens and the nature of the universe What are earthquakes? - plate tectonics Why do bad things happen? - chaos What is a miracle? - science vs belief"
212,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"Something Dawkins stated in his book The Ancestor’s Tale has never left me: “My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely that they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world.” There is nothing in the holy books to compare with what science has opened up for human understanding of the world around us. I am humbled by my own ignorance of science but my ignorance doesn’t drive me to become anti-science. If your religion forces you to turn your mind away from science then it’s time to find another religion…or just drop your silly beliefs once and for all. I grew up in a Catholic family but I never for a single conscious moment believed in any the teachings held by the faith of my parents. I have never believed in a god, ever.I would like to add “and that has made all the difference” but simply being an atheist doesn’t get you anywhere on its own. For that you need to open up your mind and put your elbows on the table, as we like to say in Spanish about studying. It’s astounding to me that there are many, many people in the world today who don’t know why we have seasons, or that the earth is billions of years old, or that matter is made up of atoms. Instead, they cling to fairy tales written thousands of years ago to explain these phenomena.I have read things written by Muslims who try to show how the Koran explains science and how their prophet was centuries ahead of his time. Nonsense, just like everything in that book. The same is true of the Bible and the Talmud, and all the others. But don’t think of this book as being anti-religion but pro-mankind. And what is wrong with that? I am so tired of Dawkins’ critics labeling him as strident and belligerent towards religious people.If I were the king of the world I would make everyone read this book and then they would have to prove that they read it and understood it. After that, if you want to go on believing in the offal your religion sloshes out then go right ahead. Since I won’t be king any time soon then perhaps we can make this book available to every adolescent so that they can make their own choices because there are only two: myth or science."
213,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6031670-bruce-caithness,3,"The critical underpinning of science is brought to attention in ""The Magic of Reality"" as well as the wonderful list of findings that have been put forward by science. One cannot fault the book for lacking enthusiasm.Joe Barnhart in Karl Popper: Philosopher of Critical Realism made some nice comments that temper Richard Dawkins sometimes overly enthusiastic positivism.Myths graduate to science when they are open to being tested, science rests on a bedrock of mythology.Creationists who insist on classifying their views as ""scientific creationism"" may not know what they are getting into. Do they really want to assert that creationism is falsifiable? Do they want to try to expose its weaknesses and flaws? Do they seek to correct and revise the doctrine? As is well known, creationists take great delight in pointing out that the theory of evolution is, after all, a theory. But this should pose no problem. All scientific theories are theories. Do creationists want to say that creationism is a theory? Do they want to say that the notion of the Bible as inerrant revelation is a theory?If Karl Popper's analysis is correct, then both evolution and creationism are theories. The real question has to do with how well they are articulated, how well they serve to advance further research, and how well they survive rigorous criticism. The overwhelming majority of biologists and anthropologists have found creationism to be a poor rival to evolution in the attempt to expand our knowledge. Contrary to what some creationists claim, scientists tend to favor evolution as an explanatory theory not because of some presupposition that blinds them to the truth but, rather, because it is scientifically more fruitful than creationism and enjoys greater explanatory power."
214,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19638210-dane-cobain,4,"This book is a bit of a weird one because it takes the form of a series of responses to questions, and so every chapter in the book is based upon a question like, “When and how did everything begin?” It’s a pretty simple setup that allows Dawkins to tackle some of the bigger questions that people have, but it does also mean that it feels as though something’s somehow lacking.Don’t get me wrong, the science was solid and Dawkins made his arguments well, and I do feel that I’ve learned a bunch of stuff here. At the same time, it feels a bit like he’s set out to try to explain everything and then settled for just a few frequently asked questions. I’m not sure what he could have done differently though, because if the book was two or three times the length, it would have ended up feeling long and drawn out.Still, it was a pretty good way to keep my brain trained and to learn a few new lessons about science and stuff. This isn’t necessarily the best non-fiction science book on the market, but I polished it off in 24 hours or so and was happy with it, even if it was just okay. After all, I’m slowly working my way through everything that Dawkins has ever written, and this is probably one of the most approachable. All in all, I’m glad I read it and maybe you’ll like it too."
215,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3974523-prem-aparanji,2,"Not for young children. Teenagers maybe. But otherwise good compilation of myths and their contrast with scientific reasons for various questions like origin of universe, man, etc. Scientific temper is necessary and that requires a skeptical mind. Denouncing myths is one thing, not understanding their power is another. Myths have the power to capture the imagination of the child. Not this book.Richard Dawkins has a good intent, bad execution. He needs to learn how to narrate, make science facts wondrous for the imaginative child. And imagination is being able to grasp the vastness of space or antiquity of universe. Imagination is how the primitive Earth might have been, how life might have evolved. None of the magic is exploited in this book.The author instead of exploiting the power of imagination goes on rambling against the fantasies of various mythologies.Where scientists like Einstein, Bohr, Oppenheimer, Arthur Clark, etc. have all drawn inspiration from ancient texts like the Vedas and the Gita, Dawkins dismisses them. He does not seem to understand the symbolism and takes them for the literal words, like a common man."
216,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3363047-karel-baloun,4,"This is a fine capstone book for Richard Dawkins illustrious career; I can't think of how it could be better.He bounces back-and-forth between myth and reality, and leaves us hopeful that tomorrow's reality will look like magic to us.Yet, as a science interested adult, it seemed to me that I knew every fact and every story in the book, perhaps because cosmos told so many, or because it's hard to be original in these foundational science areas with the Internet. The only truly original presentation I saw, was the fantastic 3 mile deep family album.Unfortunately, for modern children, I don't think this is a workable delivery mechanism. Of course he tries to make it interesting, and the text format novelties and fantastic illustrations, show great effort. But it can't compete with video, and they're just too many words I think for children to work through. The words and the names are all quite advanced, so it's great education, but I don't know if modern children will ever learn all of these words.I do appreciate how he bundles all references to God in the myth sections."

I liked Hume's neat idea for evaluating the plausibility of a ""stated"" miracle. The writing is lucid and often witty; should be a great read for youngsters even."
218,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34211369-mukesh-emes,5,"In this book Richard Dawkins did a great job in breaking all the religious belief about the evolution of world. The way he unwrapped some myths and miracles with the help of the science is really beautiful. For examples, who was the first person in this world, What are things made of, rainbow, sun etc. It is one of the simplest book I have read that deals with physics,cosmology and evolutionary biology. I would give five star to this book."

There isn't much here that should be new to the average intellectually curious adult, but I can certainly see myself enjoying this book at age 10 (I'm not entirely sure I was able to read English at that age, but presumably a translation is forthcoming). McKean's illustrations are sometimes weirder than they strictly need to be, maybe."

Reality itself can be only be explained through science, and scientific methods. What cannot be explained, can be explained in time to come! the machinery of (scientific) methods, is only improving to validate the phenomenon that are yet to be explained. Science is collaborative and unending in it's nature. It should be native to every mind, and should be accepted, and valued. Coming to the book now: I love Dawkins, not only he is humble in his untiring efforts to put 'educating the masses and improving scientific literacy' at top of his agenda, but also doesn't disregard the polemicists so immediately without putting forth a reasonable explanation (reasonable to reasonable people i guess), which I think is what makes him a better person also. This book is a comprehensive approach to understand reality through the lens of science juxtaposing ancient and present-day myths about them.Read it please, and read it to your children as well."

In fact, the audience for this book seems to be people with shockingly little education as almost all the information contained in it is stuff a person should learn by the end of high school, stuff like ""what is an earthquake?"", ""what is a rainbow?"", the basics of evolution and gravity and other stuff like that.

230,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32340477-patricia-lee,5,"As a work of non-fiction,The Magic of Reality: How we know what’s really true, by Richard Dawkins and illustrated by Dave McKean, is an app, where “reading relies on touch and manipulation”. (Bouchardon & Heckman, 2012). This text is Dawkin’s first for teenagers, persuading the reader that the reality of science is as ‘magical’ as mythology. The well researched content is clearly presented, however, on occasions, Dawkins resorts to first person thus detracting from the authority of the text as it reveals his bias.The new Australian English curriculum requires students to respond to and compose texts in different media and technologies. Whilst this text has been primarily written for teenagers, each chapter’s introductory segment retelling myths and legends is suitable for primary school students because the text is clear, the language succinct and the enhancement engaging eg the flames surrounding Hades. Science & Technology units, Primary Connections, are based on the 5e learning model allowing for segments of The Magic of Reality to be shared as a background resource to enhance student understanding in the Earth and space sciences strand. The digital affordances of this app allow for its use to explain scientific concepts across all learning styles eg. Chapter 2, blowing the iguanas across the water whilst avoiding the whirlpools; Chapter 3, the use of a slider to demonstrate the size of the stars. Callow (2013, p. 102) discusses the use of visuals in informative texts, supporting meaning.A linear reading experience is allowed when reading The Magic of Reality, as well as reading it as a non-fiction text by dipping into chapters. The digital affordances supplement the text without distraction. They are many and varied, strategically placed within the text primarily to explain scientific concepts, eg video to explain seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres. Many provide feedback, allowing the reader to repeat the activity to improve his/her personal result eg. Chapter 1, evolution through ‘breeding’ frogs to survive the snakes; Chapter 4, states of matter, firing Newton’s cannon to visualize gravity. Dawkins provides suggestions for the reader to further investigate eg an invitation in Chapter 4 to Google “Iron cold iron” by Kipling to add to the explanation of liquids, solids and gases; a reference to Earthsearch to further explain how big is space.The Magic of Reality is intuitive and easy to navigate, the reader is able to swipe down to view chapters and current position, supporting Jabr (2013). The full colour images and audio (read by Dawkins) are high quality when viewed on an iPad3. Will this enhanced eBook have longevity? A question difficult to answer, for at least two reasons. Firstly, science changes, as Dawkins remarks eg in Chapter 10, his references to earthquakes in Haiti and Christchurch, and Japan’s tsunami. Will this app be updated as required? A specific answer to this has not been found, other than updates provided through Apple iTunes. Despite this, The Magic of Reality is highly recommended for not only teenagers but readers interested in science. The app could be described as “Myth Busters meets Science for Dummies”.

232,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47528776-ibnul-shah,5,"This is one of the most amazing books on science I have ever read. Richard Dawkins' explanatory abilities are unquestionable; the way he explains complicated things is absolutely astonishing. This book talks about different topics of science in a very lucid way, and I think if someone wants a basic introduction to science, this book is an excellent option. The author says its intended for children aged 12-13 years- after reading this book, they'll clearly understand how science works and how to think and act like a scientist. The most important chapter in this book, in my opinion, is the second chapter titled 'Who was the first person?' where Dawkins explains evolution with interesting thought experiments and irrefutable logic. All the other chapters are also filled with exciting scientific elucidations of natural phenomenons, followed by the colorful mythical explanation of the same. The last two chapters were less science related, here the writer emphasizes more on making the reader have a scientific outlook on everything. I love how he ends the book: ""The truth is more magical - in the best and the most exciting sense of the world - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.""However, in some chapters, Dawkins' anti-religious sentiment was clearly exposed and I don't know how readers in countries like mine will take it. Moreover, chapters like 'what are things made of' or 'what is the sun' were pretty boring for me. So I guess these chapters would seem a bit uninteresting for an older reader who has basic ideas about science. On the other hand, it is because of these chapters you can call this book an introduction to science. But all in all, this book was a really pleasant read for me, and I'd say it is a must-read for every children as well as grown-ups with curiosity and enthusiasm about science."
233,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/845928-owen,3,"This book is aimed at teens, I guess, but while the science seems to be at the appropriate level, its discursive and rhetorical style are probably going to go over their heads. Dawkins' approach is to present mythical explanations for natural phenomena, followed by our current scientific understanding of what's really going on—the reality which is, in his terms, even more ""magical"" and wonderful than the myth. I'm dismayed that our supposedly advanced civilizations, particularly the US, are still so blindered by religion that such a book seems necessary and appropriate, but even so I think it would be best to put the dismantling of religious stories as secondary to the explanation of scientific realities: any teen who is going to encounter this book with an open mind will already be receptive to Dawkins' ideas, while anyone who actually believes any of the religious or mythic stories is going to be put on the defensive by Dawkins' attack.I guess this is the same problem even non-religious people have with other facets of the ""New Atheism"": it gets in your face as an idea whose truth requires the falsehood of competing explanations—and, however great your disagreement, getting in someone's face like that is just poor manners. The Magic of Reality is only very slightly boorish in that way, but I think it would have been a better and more wonder-full book if it hadn't addressed myths and religions at all, and just presented the ""magic"" of our scientific understanding of the world."
234,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,3,"The audio version of this book is read by Richard Dawkins and some other Lalla Ward. This is mainly relevant because it meant that I got to spend 5 hours listening to British accents. =)The book itself was good. Each chapter poses a question, gives some answers provided by traditional myths, and then talks about the real scientific answer. I'll lay out up front, that yes, Dawkins does use the Bible for some of his examples of myths, but except to the biblical literalists (especially of the Creationist variety), these are the parts of the Bible that are generally taken to have a mythical element.Also, while I'm on the disclaimers, this book focuses on where Dawkins does best -- explaining science in a manner accessible to the lay reader -- but it does veer just a little into rantiness in one of the later chapters.Moving along, the questions and answers presented in this book should be broadly familiar to anyone who had an retained a decent science education, but there was the occasional moment of ""so that's how it works!"" illumination. For me, one such moment was the explanation of why the angle of the earth relative to the sun makes such a difference in perceived temperature [1]. From an educational standpoint, I think that this would be a really great book to get for a high school student or even an advanced middle school student.[1] When the sun hits the earth at a shallower angle, the same amount of solar energy is spread over a wider area, so the energy received per square inch is decreased."

All my basic scientific knowledge, I have to say, was largely from the books of junior and senior school times and am afraid that I only got nebulous impression now.But the book, this book, the magic of reality still shocked me a little bit, not because of its abstruse contents but because of its simplicity. I guess it is a little book aimed at transmitting basic scientific knowledge to teenagers or young people. So it's another book on common sense.It is not as “prodigiously illuminous and beautifully designed” as it should be, but it's an amusing book and Richard indeed imbued the book with his hilarious humor, which really gave me a lot of laughters in reading.He would list a few mythologies or stories that precede his revealing of the true explanations of the question. And if you are discreet a bit more you would invariably find his “sarcastic tone” for people's beliefs and his ardent support for evolution.If you need to get some basic knowledge about how some natural phenomena happened or physics information such as elements or molecules, all such stuff could be found in the book with concise introductions.But if you want to know more about evolution, as a friend recommend to me, it's better to read his other works like ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution"" or ""The self Gene"" or some similar works from other authors .1.03.2016"

His book The Magic of Reality tries to explain in understandable ways some of the really complicated phenomenons of physics and science overall.In the midway of the book, I felt like back in school. Quite many things very familiar, but the way Mr. Dawkins explains those helped to deepen the understanding quite a bit.The book goes through topics all the way from big bang to evolution to quantum mechanics. So it is really comprehensive overview to the universe as we know it. I give the credit to him on explaining things in very understandable ways.Mr Dawkins is a know atheist and science believer. It really shows in the book. He dismisses all religions. He does admit that there are many things science can't explain yet, but he sees it only as a shortage of current science, not as a possibility for higher forces. Atheism actually came disturbingly through from all the writing. That's a shame, in science facts should be facts without personal believes.I have to still recommend to people who want to understand physics and the world better. I felt like getting a fast recap of learning's from physics from many years at school. It's an excellent book, if you can tolerate the pushing of atheism.This review was originally published in my blog - here"

This would be a really cool textbook, or style for a textbook.The writing occasionally edges into the dry, but there are enough anecdotes and pretty pictures to make up for the occasional wall of text.My only problem is with his approach towards mythological stories. I like the variety he presented, but I would have liked more historical context behind the stories as well as the recognition that a lot of stories like the ones he shared were ancient people's way of exploring/explaining the world around them, even though they sound silly today. However, he does use the stories as a way of teaching logical, critical thinking, which I liked.Anyway, I wish I had known how cool science was in school. This book helped me clear up a few bits of confusion (mostly about atoms, because I pretty much just suffered through chemistry class blankly) and offers a neat perspective on the world."

I don't really see it as a book for children, I see it as a book for anyone who wants to think about the beauty of science and everything. It's a book that just consolidates what we already know - I didn't really learn anything knew from it, but I didn't expect to; I did find that the book helped me to pin down my thoughts on reality though, which is just what I hoped it would do. Of course, it's aimed at a younger audience, but that didn't lessen my enjoyment of it. I found it to be delightful, and thought-provoking. The illustrations by Dave McKean were super, and really enhanced the text. I will use this book when I want to talk to my children about science - they're a little young to understand these ideas just yet, but I'm looking forward to when they begin to question their realities. And I'm looking forward to showing them some proper evidence about why 'God' cannot exist - some damage has been done by school telling them that they're Christians! I hope I can undo it."

The author, Richard Dawkins has taken a step forward and cleverly illustrated the reason for things such as what is magic and reality ? who we are ? why we have winter and summer ? what is sun ? and many natural prodigies which one would like to explore. Almost every chapter starts with different myths that were registered by our ancestors in this planet however it’s the science and the scientists who applied the it and figured out the several factors that would determine the actual reason for the way our planet and things were formed and developed. The author has intelligently extracted required information from the world of science and clearly related to the things described in the book. I would happily add this book to nominate for book of the year 2016 :)Overall - Magic of Reality : Explore the realities of core things through the outcome of science in our planet and there is something amazing inside to educate ourselves beyond that as well :)"
240,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,5,"Target audience: The book primarily targets children and young adults, but it is good for adults who know little about biology as well.About the author: According to Wikipedia, Clinton Richard Dawkins is an English evolutionary biologist and author. He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford, and was the University of Oxford's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008. Dawkins is an atheist, and is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design. In his 1986 book The Blind Watchmaker, he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. He is an opponent of creationism being taught in schools. He has been awarded many prestigious academic and writing awards and he makes regular television, radio and Internet appearances, predominantly discussing his books, his atheism, and his ideas and opinions as a public intellectual.Structure of the book: The book has 272 pages and it is divided in 12 chapters, each chapter having a unique title.Overview: Dawkins says that it is unlikely for a supernatural creator of the world to exist. He contends that religious thought is merely a delusion. This is why nearly all of the chapters begin with a brief synopsis of creation myths in an attempt to explain various observed phenomena. He chooses these myths from all over the world, such as Babylonian, Aztec, Judeo-Christian, Ancient Egyptian, Japanese, Maori, Australian Aboriginal, Hellenic, Nordic, Chinese, and includes even modern alien-abduction mythology. But Dawkins not only enumerates myths, he has a special pleasure dismantling them. In fact, the entire book is a battle between myths and science, or fiction and reality.In early childhood every single one of us – including the author as we find out – asked ourselves: How does this work? Why is this thing here and not there? Why do birds have wings and how can they fly? Why the bear has the color it has?When we are young and naive, we give all sort of answers, one more ridiculous than the other. And the answers we give seem very legit. But, as we grow older and acquire more knowledge, the initial answers are no longer suited to explain reality. So, we abandon them and we try to find other answers for explaining what happens around us.The same it is with the difference between myths and science: myths are failed sciences which were useful in the “childhood” of mankind, when people used sticks to hunt for their prey or rocks to make fire. But now humanity is mature and myths and religions no longer have any utility; on the contrary, in most cases it slows down our moral and scientific progress. Indeed, reality has a natural capacity for beauty. It could be argued that reality – due to its complexity – is, in fact, more magical than any other thing possible. But nobody can deny that very minute phenomena were not known to archaic peoples before the creation of optical magnification devices. Moreover, many of them involve a god's symbolic act performed just once. So, any passages believed to be inspired by gods have not mentioned any knowledge as outside human experience. In this regard Dawkins provides the nice example of the story Cinderella. The little children, when this story is read to them, really believe that a pumpkin can turn into a golden carriage. But in the real world the Fairy Godmother is unable to magically make this transformation with his wand. This is because the pumpkins and carriages have an internal organization that is complex and very, very different. A large pumpkin is impossible to turn into a carriage no matter how well you reorganize its structure.In the later chapters Dawkins address topics that range from speciation and evolutionary biology to physical phenomena like atomic theory or plate tectonics. He declines to explain topics he does not understand. I love his honesty. He characterizes his knowledge of quantum mechanics as at best foggy. He does not attempt to appear more knowledgeable than he is in order to protect his ego. The book is also filled with interesting facts and I found it improved my knowledge of evolutionary biology without sounding like a text book. So, overall, as Dawkins says, a good way to tell if you really understand something or not is whether or not you can explain it to someone else and have them also understand it too.Quote: The truth is more magical - in the best and most exciting sense of the word - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.Strong points: Through brilliant examples and light scientific details Dawkins manages to make his points clear and complex topics easy to understand. Moreover, Dawkins's ability to pose the right questions make his writing a pleasure to read. I believe the layman – even an adolescent child – would have no trouble understanding.Weak points: If you are versed in science, this book will be indeed perceived as weak. However, for the laymen, it is a great source of information and entertainment at the same time. I personally enjoyed the book so much don’t remember any negative feelings I had while reading it._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"
241,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070035-kartik-narayanan,4,"In this book, the author, Richard Dawkins, explains various natural phenomena. He starts the book by identifying three different kinds of magic supernatural magic (things that happen in fairy tales, myths, religious texts etc.) stage magic (things that we know are false but are fun to watch - stage magicians for example) poetic magic (the kind of magic we use to describe our feelings about a great movie or watching a sunset or scenery etc.). Dawkins demonstrates that our ancestors used to explain our world using supernatural magic. He then explains it in the form of poetic magic (i.e. ""what is"" as opposed to ""what we think is""). He picks up the most popular myths and explains these with science. We get to see that supernatural magic is the fear of understanding while poetic magic is the joy of understanding. Richard Dawkins is the world's most famous evolutionary biologist. He is also one of the world's foremost atheists. He has authored many great books, including the ""The Selfish Gene"" and ""The God Delusion"". You have to read those books if you have not already. I consider him to be one of the luminaries of this century - on par with Richard Feynman and others - in popularizing science and reason`. A warning - he is an atheist and uses reason & logic to dissect superstitions and beliefs. So if your faith is fickle or offended, do not bother reading his books. But, you will enjoy his books and be a better person if you have an open mind. This book is meant for general consumption.I highly recommend reading this book. Dawkins explains scientific concepts brilliantly. This understanding leads to a greater appreciation of Nature and the Universe. He calls out areas where he is not explain things well (quarks for example). What is reality? What is magic? - explains the nature of reality and the nature of magic Who was the first person? - explores our origins Why are there so many different kinds of animals? - explores evolution What are things made of? - atomic theory Why do we have day and night, summer and winter? - the earth, sun and orbits What is the Sun? - stellar mechanics What is a rainbow? - optics When and how did everything begin? - Big Bang theory Are we alone? - Aliens and the nature of the universe What are earthquakes? - plate tectonics Why do bad things happen? - chaos What is a miracle? - science vs belief"
242,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"Something Dawkins stated in his book The Ancestor’s Tale has never left me: “My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely that they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world.” There is nothing in the holy books to compare with what science has opened up for human understanding of the world around us. I am humbled by my own ignorance of science but my ignorance doesn’t drive me to become anti-science. If your religion forces you to turn your mind away from science then it’s time to find another religion…or just drop your silly beliefs once and for all. I grew up in a Catholic family but I never for a single conscious moment believed in any the teachings held by the faith of my parents. I have never believed in a god, ever.I would like to add “and that has made all the difference” but simply being an atheist doesn’t get you anywhere on its own. For that you need to open up your mind and put your elbows on the table, as we like to say in Spanish about studying. It’s astounding to me that there are many, many people in the world today who don’t know why we have seasons, or that the earth is billions of years old, or that matter is made up of atoms. Instead, they cling to fairy tales written thousands of years ago to explain these phenomena.I have read things written by Muslims who try to show how the Koran explains science and how their prophet was centuries ahead of his time. Nonsense, just like everything in that book. The same is true of the Bible and the Talmud, and all the others. But don’t think of this book as being anti-religion but pro-mankind. And what is wrong with that? I am so tired of Dawkins’ critics labeling him as strident and belligerent towards religious people.If I were the king of the world I would make everyone read this book and then they would have to prove that they read it and understood it. After that, if you want to go on believing in the offal your religion sloshes out then go right ahead. Since I won’t be king any time soon then perhaps we can make this book available to every adolescent so that they can make their own choices because there are only two: myth or science."
243,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6031670-bruce-caithness,3,"The critical underpinning of science is brought to attention in ""The Magic of Reality"" as well as the wonderful list of findings that have been put forward by science. One cannot fault the book for lacking enthusiasm.Joe Barnhart in Karl Popper: Philosopher of Critical Realism made some nice comments that temper Richard Dawkins sometimes overly enthusiastic positivism.Myths graduate to science when they are open to being tested, science rests on a bedrock of mythology.Creationists who insist on classifying their views as ""scientific creationism"" may not know what they are getting into. Do they really want to assert that creationism is falsifiable? Do they want to try to expose its weaknesses and flaws? Do they seek to correct and revise the doctrine? As is well known, creationists take great delight in pointing out that the theory of evolution is, after all, a theory. But this should pose no problem. All scientific theories are theories. Do creationists want to say that creationism is a theory? Do they want to say that the notion of the Bible as inerrant revelation is a theory?If Karl Popper's analysis is correct, then both evolution and creationism are theories. The real question has to do with how well they are articulated, how well they serve to advance further research, and how well they survive rigorous criticism. The overwhelming majority of biologists and anthropologists have found creationism to be a poor rival to evolution in the attempt to expand our knowledge. Contrary to what some creationists claim, scientists tend to favor evolution as an explanatory theory not because of some presupposition that blinds them to the truth but, rather, because it is scientifically more fruitful than creationism and enjoys greater explanatory power."
244,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19638210-dane-cobain,4,"This book is a bit of a weird one because it takes the form of a series of responses to questions, and so every chapter in the book is based upon a question like, “When and how did everything begin?” It’s a pretty simple setup that allows Dawkins to tackle some of the bigger questions that people have, but it does also mean that it feels as though something’s somehow lacking.Don’t get me wrong, the science was solid and Dawkins made his arguments well, and I do feel that I’ve learned a bunch of stuff here. At the same time, it feels a bit like he’s set out to try to explain everything and then settled for just a few frequently asked questions. I’m not sure what he could have done differently though, because if the book was two or three times the length, it would have ended up feeling long and drawn out.Still, it was a pretty good way to keep my brain trained and to learn a few new lessons about science and stuff. This isn’t necessarily the best non-fiction science book on the market, but I polished it off in 24 hours or so and was happy with it, even if it was just okay. After all, I’m slowly working my way through everything that Dawkins has ever written, and this is probably one of the most approachable. All in all, I’m glad I read it and maybe you’ll like it too."

But otherwise good compilation of myths and their contrast with scientific reasons for various questions like origin of universe, man, etc. Scientific temper is necessary and that requires a skeptical mind. Denouncing myths is one thing, not understanding their power is another. Myths have the power to capture the imagination of the child. Not this book.Richard Dawkins has a good intent, bad execution. He needs to learn how to narrate, make science facts wondrous for the imaginative child. And imagination is being able to grasp the vastness of space or antiquity of universe. Imagination is how the primitive Earth might have been, how life might have evolved. None of the magic is exploited in this book.The author instead of exploiting the power of imagination goes on rambling against the fantasies of various mythologies.Where scientists like Einstein, Bohr, Oppenheimer, Arthur Clark, etc. have all drawn inspiration from ancient texts like the Vedas and the Gita, Dawkins dismisses them. He does not seem to understand the symbolism and takes them for the literal words, like a common man."

The only truly original presentation I saw, was the fantastic 3 mile deep family album.Unfortunately, for modern children, I don't think this is a workable delivery mechanism. Of course he tries to make it interesting, and the text format novelties and fantastic illustrations, show great effort. But it can't compete with video, and they're just too many words I think for children to work through. The words and the names are all quite advanced, so it's great education, but I don't know if modern children will ever learn all of these words.I do appreciate how he bundles all references to God in the myth sections."

I liked Hume's neat idea for evaluating the plausibility of a ""stated"" miracle. The writing is lucid and often witty; should be a great read for youngsters even."

Reality itself can be only be explained through science, and scientific methods. What cannot be explained, can be explained in time to come! the machinery of (scientific) methods, is only improving to validate the phenomenon that are yet to be explained. Science is collaborative and unending in it's nature. It should be native to every mind, and should be accepted, and valued. Coming to the book now: I love Dawkins, not only he is humble in his untiring efforts to put 'educating the masses and improving scientific literacy' at top of his agenda, but also doesn't disregard the polemicists so immediately without putting forth a reasonable explanation (reasonable to reasonable people i guess), which I think is what makes him a better person also. This book is a comprehensive approach to understand reality through the lens of science juxtaposing ancient and present-day myths about them.Read it please, and read it to your children as well."

(Bouchardon & Heckman, 2012). This text is Dawkin’s first for teenagers, persuading the reader that the reality of science is as ‘magical’ as mythology. The well researched content is clearly presented, however, on occasions, Dawkins resorts to first person thus detracting from the authority of the text as it reveals his bias.The new Australian English curriculum requires students to respond to and compose texts in different media and technologies. Whilst this text has been primarily written for teenagers, each chapter’s introductory segment retelling myths and legends is suitable for primary school students because the text is clear, the language succinct and the enhancement engaging eg the flames surrounding Hades. Science & Technology units, Primary Connections, are based on the 5e learning model allowing for segments of The Magic of Reality to be shared as a background resource to enhance student understanding in the Earth and space sciences strand. The digital affordances of this app allow for its use to explain scientific concepts across all learning styles eg. Chapter 2, blowing the iguanas across the water whilst avoiding the whirlpools; Chapter 3, the use of a slider to demonstrate the size of the stars. Callow (2013, p. 102) discusses the use of visuals in informative texts, supporting meaning.A linear reading experience is allowed when reading The Magic of Reality, as well as reading it as a non-fiction text by dipping into chapters. The digital affordances supplement the text without distraction. They are many and varied, strategically placed within the text primarily to explain scientific concepts, eg video to explain seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres. Many provide feedback, allowing the reader to repeat the activity to improve his/her personal result eg. Chapter 1, evolution through ‘breeding’ frogs to survive the snakes; Chapter 4, states of matter, firing Newton’s cannon to visualize gravity. Dawkins provides suggestions for the reader to further investigate eg an invitation in Chapter 4 to Google “Iron cold iron” by Kipling to add to the explanation of liquids, solids and gases; a reference to Earthsearch to further explain how big is space.The Magic of Reality is intuitive and easy to navigate, the reader is able to swipe down to view chapters and current position, supporting Jabr (2013). The full colour images and audio (read by Dawkins) are high quality when viewed on an iPad3. Will this enhanced eBook have longevity? A question difficult to answer, for at least two reasons. Firstly, science changes, as Dawkins remarks eg in Chapter 10, his references to earthquakes in Haiti and Christchurch, and Japan’s tsunami. Will this app be updated as required? A specific answer to this has not been found, other than updates provided through Apple iTunes. Despite this, The Magic of Reality is highly recommended for not only teenagers but readers interested in science. The app could be described as “Myth Busters meets Science for Dummies”.

262,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47528776-ibnul-shah,5,"This is one of the most amazing books on science I have ever read. Richard Dawkins' explanatory abilities are unquestionable; the way he explains complicated things is absolutely astonishing. This book talks about different topics of science in a very lucid way, and I think if someone wants a basic introduction to science, this book is an excellent option. The author says its intended for children aged 12-13 years- after reading this book, they'll clearly understand how science works and how to think and act like a scientist. The most important chapter in this book, in my opinion, is the second chapter titled 'Who was the first person?' where Dawkins explains evolution with interesting thought experiments and irrefutable logic. All the other chapters are also filled with exciting scientific elucidations of natural phenomenons, followed by the colorful mythical explanation of the same. The last two chapters were less science related, here the writer emphasizes more on making the reader have a scientific outlook on everything. I love how he ends the book: ""The truth is more magical - in the best and the most exciting sense of the world - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.""However, in some chapters, Dawkins' anti-religious sentiment was clearly exposed and I don't know how readers in countries like mine will take it. Moreover, chapters like 'what are things made of' or 'what is the sun' were pretty boring for me. So I guess these chapters would seem a bit uninteresting for an older reader who has basic ideas about science. On the other hand, it is because of these chapters you can call this book an introduction to science. But all in all, this book was a really pleasant read for me, and I'd say it is a must-read for every children as well as grown-ups with curiosity and enthusiasm about science."
263,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/845928-owen,3,"This book is aimed at teens, I guess, but while the science seems to be at the appropriate level, its discursive and rhetorical style are probably going to go over their heads. Dawkins' approach is to present mythical explanations for natural phenomena, followed by our current scientific understanding of what's really going on—the reality which is, in his terms, even more ""magical"" and wonderful than the myth. I'm dismayed that our supposedly advanced civilizations, particularly the US, are still so blindered by religion that such a book seems necessary and appropriate, but even so I think it would be best to put the dismantling of religious stories as secondary to the explanation of scientific realities: any teen who is going to encounter this book with an open mind will already be receptive to Dawkins' ideas, while anyone who actually believes any of the religious or mythic stories is going to be put on the defensive by Dawkins' attack.I guess this is the same problem even non-religious people have with other facets of the ""New Atheism"": it gets in your face as an idea whose truth requires the falsehood of competing explanations—and, however great your disagreement, getting in someone's face like that is just poor manners. The Magic of Reality is only very slightly boorish in that way, but I think it would have been a better and more wonder-full book if it hadn't addressed myths and religions at all, and just presented the ""magic"" of our scientific understanding of the world."
264,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,3,"The audio version of this book is read by Richard Dawkins and some other Lalla Ward. This is mainly relevant because it meant that I got to spend 5 hours listening to British accents. =)The book itself was good. Each chapter poses a question, gives some answers provided by traditional myths, and then talks about the real scientific answer. I'll lay out up front, that yes, Dawkins does use the Bible for some of his examples of myths, but except to the biblical literalists (especially of the Creationist variety), these are the parts of the Bible that are generally taken to have a mythical element.Also, while I'm on the disclaimers, this book focuses on where Dawkins does best -- explaining science in a manner accessible to the lay reader -- but it does veer just a little into rantiness in one of the later chapters.Moving along, the questions and answers presented in this book should be broadly familiar to anyone who had an retained a decent science education, but there was the occasional moment of ""so that's how it works!"" illumination. For me, one such moment was the explanation of why the angle of the earth relative to the sun makes such a difference in perceived temperature [1]. From an educational standpoint, I think that this would be a really great book to get for a high school student or even an advanced middle school student.[1] When the sun hits the earth at a shallower angle, the same amount of solar energy is spread over a wider area, so the energy received per square inch is decreased."

All my basic scientific knowledge, I have to say, was largely from the books of junior and senior school times and am afraid that I only got nebulous impression now.But the book, this book, the magic of reality still shocked me a little bit, not because of its abstruse contents but because of its simplicity. I guess it is a little book aimed at transmitting basic scientific knowledge to teenagers or young people. So it's another book on common sense.It is not as “prodigiously illuminous and beautifully designed” as it should be, but it's an amusing book and Richard indeed imbued the book with his hilarious humor, which really gave me a lot of laughters in reading.He would list a few mythologies or stories that precede his revealing of the true explanations of the question. And if you are discreet a bit more you would invariably find his “sarcastic tone” for people's beliefs and his ardent support for evolution.If you need to get some basic knowledge about how some natural phenomena happened or physics information such as elements or molecules, all such stuff could be found in the book with concise introductions.But if you want to know more about evolution, as a friend recommend to me, it's better to read his other works like ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution"" or ""The self Gene"" or some similar works from other authors .1.03.2016"

His book The Magic of Reality tries to explain in understandable ways some of the really complicated phenomenons of physics and science overall.In the midway of the book, I felt like back in school. Quite many things very familiar, but the way Mr. Dawkins explains those helped to deepen the understanding quite a bit.The book goes through topics all the way from big bang to evolution to quantum mechanics. So it is really comprehensive overview to the universe as we know it. I give the credit to him on explaining things in very understandable ways.Mr Dawkins is a know atheist and science believer. It really shows in the book. He dismisses all religions. He does admit that there are many things science can't explain yet, but he sees it only as a shortage of current science, not as a possibility for higher forces. Atheism actually came disturbingly through from all the writing. That's a shame, in science facts should be facts without personal believes.I have to still recommend to people who want to understand physics and the world better. I felt like getting a fast recap of learning's from physics from many years at school.

This would be a really cool textbook, or style for a textbook.The writing occasionally edges into the dry, but there are enough anecdotes and pretty pictures to make up for the occasional wall of text.My only problem is with his approach towards mythological stories. I like the variety he presented, but I would have liked more historical context behind the stories as well as the recognition that a lot of stories like the ones he shared were ancient people's way of exploring/explaining the world around them, even though they sound silly today. However, he does use the stories as a way of teaching logical, critical thinking, which I liked.Anyway, I wish I had known how cool science was in school. This book helped me clear up a few bits of confusion (mostly about atoms, because I pretty much just suffered through chemistry class blankly) and offers a neat perspective on the world."

I don't really see it as a book for children, I see it as a book for anyone who wants to think about the beauty of science and everything. It's a book that just consolidates what we already know - I didn't really learn anything knew from it, but I didn't expect to; I did find that the book helped me to pin down my thoughts on reality though, which is just what I hoped it would do. Of course, it's aimed at a younger audience, but that didn't lessen my enjoyment of it. I found it to be delightful, and thought-provoking. The illustrations by Dave McKean were super, and really enhanced the text. I will use this book when I want to talk to my children about science - they're a little young to understand these ideas just yet, but I'm looking forward to when they begin to question their realities. And I'm looking forward to showing them some proper evidence about why 'God' cannot exist - some damage has been done by school telling them that they're Christians! I hope I can undo it."

The author, Richard Dawkins has taken a step forward and cleverly illustrated the reason for things such as what is magic and reality ? who we are ? why we have winter and summer ? what is sun ? and many natural prodigies which one would like to explore. Almost every chapter starts with different myths that were registered by our ancestors in this planet however it’s the science and the scientists who applied the it and figured out the several factors that would determine the actual reason for the way our planet and things were formed and developed. The author has intelligently extracted required information from the world of science and clearly related to the things described in the book. I would happily add this book to nominate for book of the year 2016 :)Overall - Magic of Reality : Explore the realities of core things through the outcome of science in our planet and there is something amazing inside to educate ourselves beyond that as well :)"
270,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,5,"Target audience: The book primarily targets children and young adults, but it is good for adults who know little about biology as well.About the author: According to Wikipedia, Clinton Richard Dawkins is an English evolutionary biologist and author. He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford, and was the University of Oxford's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008. Dawkins is an atheist, and is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design. In his 1986 book The Blind Watchmaker, he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. He is an opponent of creationism being taught in schools. He has been awarded many prestigious academic and writing awards and he makes regular television, radio and Internet appearances, predominantly discussing his books, his atheism, and his ideas and opinions as a public intellectual.Structure of the book: The book has 272 pages and it is divided in 12 chapters, each chapter having a unique title.Overview: Dawkins says that it is unlikely for a supernatural creator of the world to exist. He contends that religious thought is merely a delusion. This is why nearly all of the chapters begin with a brief synopsis of creation myths in an attempt to explain various observed phenomena. He chooses these myths from all over the world, such as Babylonian, Aztec, Judeo-Christian, Ancient Egyptian, Japanese, Maori, Australian Aboriginal, Hellenic, Nordic, Chinese, and includes even modern alien-abduction mythology. But Dawkins not only enumerates myths, he has a special pleasure dismantling them. In fact, the entire book is a battle between myths and science, or fiction and reality.In early childhood every single one of us – including the author as we find out – asked ourselves: How does this work? Why is this thing here and not there? Why do birds have wings and how can they fly? Why the bear has the color it has?When we are young and naive, we give all sort of answers, one more ridiculous than the other. And the answers we give seem very legit. But, as we grow older and acquire more knowledge, the initial answers are no longer suited to explain reality. So, we abandon them and we try to find other answers for explaining what happens around us.The same it is with the difference between myths and science: myths are failed sciences which were useful in the “childhood” of mankind, when people used sticks to hunt for their prey or rocks to make fire. But now humanity is mature and myths and religions no longer have any utility; on the contrary, in most cases it slows down our moral and scientific progress. Indeed, reality has a natural capacity for beauty. It could be argued that reality – due to its complexity – is, in fact, more magical than any other thing possible. But nobody can deny that very minute phenomena were not known to archaic peoples before the creation of optical magnification devices. Moreover, many of them involve a god's symbolic act performed just once. So, any passages believed to be inspired by gods have not mentioned any knowledge as outside human experience. In this regard Dawkins provides the nice example of the story Cinderella. The little children, when this story is read to them, really believe that a pumpkin can turn into a golden carriage. But in the real world the Fairy Godmother is unable to magically make this transformation with his wand. This is because the pumpkins and carriages have an internal organization that is complex and very, very different. A large pumpkin is impossible to turn into a carriage no matter how well you reorganize its structure.In the later chapters Dawkins address topics that range from speciation and evolutionary biology to physical phenomena like atomic theory or plate tectonics. He declines to explain topics he does not understand. I love his honesty. He characterizes his knowledge of quantum mechanics as at best foggy. He does not attempt to appear more knowledgeable than he is in order to protect his ego. The book is also filled with interesting facts and I found it improved my knowledge of evolutionary biology without sounding like a text book. So, overall, as Dawkins says, a good way to tell if you really understand something or not is whether or not you can explain it to someone else and have them also understand it too.Quote: The truth is more magical - in the best and most exciting sense of the word - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.Strong points: Through brilliant examples and light scientific details Dawkins manages to make his points clear and complex topics easy to understand. Moreover, Dawkins's ability to pose the right questions make his writing a pleasure to read. I believe the layman – even an adolescent child – would have no trouble understanding.Weak points: If you are versed in science, this book will be indeed perceived as weak. However, for the laymen, it is a great source of information and entertainment at the same time. I personally enjoyed the book so much don’t remember any negative feelings I had while reading it._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"

Dawkins demonstrates that our ancestors used to explain our world using supernatural magic. He then explains it in the form of poetic magic (i.e. ""what is"" as opposed to ""what we think is""). He picks up the most popular myths and explains these with science. We get to see that supernatural magic is the fear of understanding while poetic magic is the joy of understanding. Richard Dawkins is the world's most famous evolutionary biologist. He is also one of the world's foremost atheists. He has authored many great books, including the ""The Selfish Gene"" and ""The God Delusion"". You have to read those books if you have not already. I consider him to be one of the luminaries of this century - on par with Richard Feynman and others - in popularizing science and reason`. A warning - he is an atheist and uses reason & logic to dissect superstitions and beliefs. So if your faith is fickle or offended, do not bother reading his books. But, you will enjoy his books and be a better person if you have an open mind. This book is meant for general consumption.I highly recommend reading this book. Dawkins explains scientific concepts brilliantly. This understanding leads to a greater appreciation of Nature and the Universe. He calls out areas where he is not explain things well (quarks for example). What is reality? What is magic? - explains the nature of reality and the nature of magic Who was the first person? - explores our origins Why are there so many different kinds of animals? - explores evolution What are things made of? - atomic theory Why do we have day and night, summer and winter? - the earth, sun and orbits What is the Sun? - stellar mechanics What is a rainbow? - optics When and how did everything begin? - Big Bang theory Are we alone? - Aliens and the nature of the universe What are earthquakes? - plate tectonics Why do bad things happen? - chaos What is a miracle? - science vs belief"
272,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"Something Dawkins stated in his book The Ancestor’s Tale has never left me: “My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely that they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world.” There is nothing in the holy books to compare with what science has opened up for human understanding of the world around us. I am humbled by my own ignorance of science but my ignorance doesn’t drive me to become anti-science. If your religion forces you to turn your mind away from science then it’s time to find another religion…or just drop your silly beliefs once and for all. I grew up in a Catholic family but I never for a single conscious moment believed in any the teachings held by the faith of my parents. I have never believed in a god, ever.I would like to add “and that has made all the difference” but simply being an atheist doesn’t get you anywhere on its own. For that you need to open up your mind and put your elbows on the table, as we like to say in Spanish about studying. It’s astounding to me that there are many, many people in the world today who don’t know why we have seasons, or that the earth is billions of years old, or that matter is made up of atoms. Instead, they cling to fairy tales written thousands of years ago to explain these phenomena.I have read things written by Muslims who try to show how the Koran explains science and how their prophet was centuries ahead of his time. Nonsense, just like everything in that book. The same is true of the Bible and the Talmud, and all the others. But don’t think of this book as being anti-religion but pro-mankind. And what is wrong with that? I am so tired of Dawkins’ critics labeling him as strident and belligerent towards religious people.If I were the king of the world I would make everyone read this book and then they would have to prove that they read it and understood it. After that, if you want to go on believing in the offal your religion sloshes out then go right ahead. Since I won’t be king any time soon then perhaps we can make this book available to every adolescent so that they can make their own choices because there are only two: myth or science."
273,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6031670-bruce-caithness,3,"The critical underpinning of science is brought to attention in ""The Magic of Reality"" as well as the wonderful list of findings that have been put forward by science. One cannot fault the book for lacking enthusiasm.Joe Barnhart in Karl Popper: Philosopher of Critical Realism made some nice comments that temper Richard Dawkins sometimes overly enthusiastic positivism.Myths graduate to science when they are open to being tested, science rests on a bedrock of mythology.Creationists who insist on classifying their views as ""scientific creationism"" may not know what they are getting into. Do they really want to assert that creationism is falsifiable? Do they want to try to expose its weaknesses and flaws? Do they seek to correct and revise the doctrine? As is well known, creationists take great delight in pointing out that the theory of evolution is, after all, a theory. But this should pose no problem. All scientific theories are theories. Do creationists want to say that creationism is a theory? Do they want to say that the notion of the Bible as inerrant revelation is a theory?If Karl Popper's analysis is correct, then both evolution and creationism are theories. The real question has to do with how well they are articulated, how well they serve to advance further research, and how well they survive rigorous criticism. The overwhelming majority of biologists and anthropologists have found creationism to be a poor rival to evolution in the attempt to expand our knowledge. Contrary to what some creationists claim, scientists tend to favor evolution as an explanatory theory not because of some presupposition that blinds them to the truth but, rather, because it is scientifically more fruitful than creationism and enjoys greater explanatory power."
274,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19638210-dane-cobain,4,"This book is a bit of a weird one because it takes the form of a series of responses to questions, and so every chapter in the book is based upon a question like, “When and how did everything begin?” It’s a pretty simple setup that allows Dawkins to tackle some of the bigger questions that people have, but it does also mean that it feels as though something’s somehow lacking.Don’t get me wrong, the science was solid and Dawkins made his arguments well, and I do feel that I’ve learned a bunch of stuff here. At the same time, it feels a bit like he’s set out to try to explain everything and then settled for just a few frequently asked questions. I’m not sure what he could have done differently though, because if the book was two or three times the length, it would have ended up feeling long and drawn out.Still, it was a pretty good way to keep my brain trained and to learn a few new lessons about science and stuff. This isn’t necessarily the best non-fiction science book on the market, but I polished it off in 24 hours or so and was happy with it, even if it was just okay. After all, I’m slowly working my way through everything that Dawkins has ever written, and this is probably one of the most approachable. All in all, I’m glad I read it and maybe you’ll like it too."
275,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3974523-prem-aparanji,2,"Not for young children. Teenagers maybe. But otherwise good compilation of myths and their contrast with scientific reasons for various questions like origin of universe, man, etc. Scientific temper is necessary and that requires a skeptical mind. Denouncing myths is one thing, not understanding their power is another. Myths have the power to capture the imagination of the child. Not this book.Richard Dawkins has a good intent, bad execution. He needs to learn how to narrate, make science facts wondrous for the imaginative child. And imagination is being able to grasp the vastness of space or antiquity of universe. Imagination is how the primitive Earth might have been, how life might have evolved. None of the magic is exploited in this book.The author instead of exploiting the power of imagination goes on rambling against the fantasies of various mythologies.Where scientists like Einstein, Bohr, Oppenheimer, Arthur Clark, etc. have all drawn inspiration from ancient texts like the Vedas and the Gita, Dawkins dismisses them. He does not seem to understand the symbolism and takes them for the literal words, like a common man."
276,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3363047-karel-baloun,4,"This is a fine capstone book for Richard Dawkins illustrious career; I can't think of how it could be better.He bounces back-and-forth between myth and reality, and leaves us hopeful that tomorrow's reality will look like magic to us.Yet, as a science interested adult, it seemed to me that I knew every fact and every story in the book, perhaps because cosmos told so many, or because it's hard to be original in these foundational science areas with the Internet. The only truly original presentation I saw, was the fantastic 3 mile deep family album.Unfortunately, for modern children, I don't think this is a workable delivery mechanism. Of course he tries to make it interesting, and the text format novelties and fantastic illustrations, show great effort. But it can't compete with video, and they're just too many words I think for children to work through. The words and the names are all quite advanced, so it's great education, but I don't know if modern children will ever learn all of these words.I do appreciate how he bundles all references to God in the myth sections."
277,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14258644-mohammad-tanviruzzaman,4,"Science's explanation can be more beautiful and amazing than any myth, miracle, or magic: Dawkins makes this point by picking up a series of questions (like: what is real? what is a rainbow? why do we have night and day, summer and winter? who is the first person? why are there so many kinds of life-forms? etc.), which haunt many of us time and again, and then he presents what the myths have to offer as the answer to each of those questions and what science has to offer; and through this journey one is introduced to a lot of important stuffs about science and moreover the way scientists go about applying scientific method to come up with answers. I liked Hume's neat idea for evaluating the plausibility of a ""stated"" miracle. The writing is lucid and often witty; should be a great read for youngsters even."
278,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34211369-mukesh-emes,5,"In this book Richard Dawkins did a great job in breaking all the religious belief about the evolution of world. The way he unwrapped some myths and miracles with the help of the science is really beautiful. For examples, who was the first person in this world, What are things made of, rainbow, sun etc. It is one of the simplest book I have read that deals with physics,cosmology and evolutionary biology. I would give five star to this book."

Reality itself can be only be explained through science, and scientific methods. What cannot be explained, can be explained in time to come! the machinery of (scientific) methods, is only improving to validate the phenomenon that are yet to be explained. Science is collaborative and unending in it's nature. It should be native to every mind, and should be accepted, and valued. Coming to the book now: I love Dawkins, not only he is humble in his untiring efforts to put 'educating the masses and improving scientific literacy' at top of his agenda, but also doesn't disregard the polemicists so immediately without putting forth a reasonable explanation (reasonable to reasonable people i guess), which I think is what makes him a better person also. This book is a comprehensive approach to understand reality through the lens of science juxtaposing ancient and present-day myths about them.Read it please, and read it to your children as well."

In fact, the audience for this book seems to be people with shockingly little education as almost all the information contained in it is stuff a person should learn by the end of high school, stuff like ""what is an earthquake?"", ""what is a rainbow?"", the basics of evolution and gravity and other stuff like that.

290,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32340477-patricia-lee,5,"As a work of non-fiction,The Magic of Reality: How we know what’s really true, by Richard Dawkins and illustrated by Dave McKean, is an app, where “reading relies on touch and manipulation”. (Bouchardon & Heckman, 2012). This text is Dawkin’s first for teenagers, persuading the reader that the reality of science is as ‘magical’ as mythology. The well researched content is clearly presented, however, on occasions, Dawkins resorts to first person thus detracting from the authority of the text as it reveals his bias.The new Australian English curriculum requires students to respond to and compose texts in different media and technologies. Whilst this text has been primarily written for teenagers, each chapter’s introductory segment retelling myths and legends is suitable for primary school students because the text is clear, the language succinct and the enhancement engaging eg the flames surrounding Hades. Science & Technology units, Primary Connections, are based on the 5e learning model allowing for segments of The Magic of Reality to be shared as a background resource to enhance student understanding in the Earth and space sciences strand. The digital affordances of this app allow for its use to explain scientific concepts across all learning styles eg. Chapter 2, blowing the iguanas across the water whilst avoiding the whirlpools; Chapter 3, the use of a slider to demonstrate the size of the stars. Callow (2013, p. 102) discusses the use of visuals in informative texts, supporting meaning.A linear reading experience is allowed when reading The Magic of Reality, as well as reading it as a non-fiction text by dipping into chapters. The digital affordances supplement the text without distraction. They are many and varied, strategically placed within the text primarily to explain scientific concepts, eg video to explain seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres. Many provide feedback, allowing the reader to repeat the activity to improve his/her personal result eg. Chapter 1, evolution through ‘breeding’ frogs to survive the snakes; Chapter 4, states of matter, firing Newton’s cannon to visualize gravity. Dawkins provides suggestions for the reader to further investigate eg an invitation in Chapter 4 to Google “Iron cold iron” by Kipling to add to the explanation of liquids, solids and gases; a reference to Earthsearch to further explain how big is space.The Magic of Reality is intuitive and easy to navigate, the reader is able to swipe down to view chapters and current position, supporting Jabr (2013). The full colour images and audio (read by Dawkins) are high quality when viewed on an iPad3. Will this enhanced eBook have longevity? A question difficult to answer, for at least two reasons. Firstly, science changes, as Dawkins remarks eg in Chapter 10, his references to earthquakes in Haiti and Christchurch, and Japan’s tsunami. Will this app be updated as required? A specific answer to this has not been found, other than updates provided through Apple iTunes. Despite this, The Magic of Reality is highly recommended for not only teenagers but readers interested in science. The app could be described as “Myth Busters meets Science for Dummies”.

292,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47528776-ibnul-shah,5,"This is one of the most amazing books on science I have ever read. Richard Dawkins' explanatory abilities are unquestionable; the way he explains complicated things is absolutely astonishing. This book talks about different topics of science in a very lucid way, and I think if someone wants a basic introduction to science, this book is an excellent option. The author says its intended for children aged 12-13 years- after reading this book, they'll clearly understand how science works and how to think and act like a scientist. The most important chapter in this book, in my opinion, is the second chapter titled 'Who was the first person?' where Dawkins explains evolution with interesting thought experiments and irrefutable logic. All the other chapters are also filled with exciting scientific elucidations of natural phenomenons, followed by the colorful mythical explanation of the same. The last two chapters were less science related, here the writer emphasizes more on making the reader have a scientific outlook on everything. I love how he ends the book: ""The truth is more magical - in the best and the most exciting sense of the world - than any myth or made-up mystery or miracle. Science has its own magic: the magic of reality.""However, in some chapters, Dawkins' anti-religious sentiment was clearly exposed and I don't know how readers in countries like mine will take it. Moreover, chapters like 'what are things made of' or 'what is the sun' were pretty boring for me. So I guess these chapters would seem a bit uninteresting for an older reader who has basic ideas about science. On the other hand, it is because of these chapters you can call this book an introduction to science. But all in all, this book was a really pleasant read for me, and I'd say it is a must-read for every children as well as grown-ups with curiosity and enthusiasm about science."
293,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/845928-owen,3,"This book is aimed at teens, I guess, but while the science seems to be at the appropriate level, its discursive and rhetorical style are probably going to go over their heads. Dawkins' approach is to present mythical explanations for natural phenomena, followed by our current scientific understanding of what's really going on—the reality which is, in his terms, even more ""magical"" and wonderful than the myth. I'm dismayed that our supposedly advanced civilizations, particularly the US, are still so blindered by religion that such a book seems necessary and appropriate, but even so I think it would be best to put the dismantling of religious stories as secondary to the explanation of scientific realities: any teen who is going to encounter this book with an open mind will already be receptive to Dawkins' ideas, while anyone who actually believes any of the religious or mythic stories is going to be put on the defensive by Dawkins' attack.I guess this is the same problem even non-religious people have with other facets of the ""New Atheism"": it gets in your face as an idea whose truth requires the falsehood of competing explanations—and, however great your disagreement, getting in someone's face like that is just poor manners. The Magic of Reality is only very slightly boorish in that way, but I think it would have been a better and more wonder-full book if it hadn't addressed myths and religions at all, and just presented the ""magic"" of our scientific understanding of the world."
294,1439192812,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,3,"The audio version of this book is read by Richard Dawkins and some other Lalla Ward. This is mainly relevant because it meant that I got to spend 5 hours listening to British accents. =)The book itself was good. Each chapter poses a question, gives some answers provided by traditional myths, and then talks about the real scientific answer. I'll lay out up front, that yes, Dawkins does use the Bible for some of his examples of myths, but except to the biblical literalists (especially of the Creationist variety), these are the parts of the Bible that are generally taken to have a mythical element.Also, while I'm on the disclaimers, this book focuses on where Dawkins does best -- explaining science in a manner accessible to the lay reader -- but it does veer just a little into rantiness in one of the later chapters.Moving along, the questions and answers presented in this book should be broadly familiar to anyone who had an retained a decent science education, but there was the occasional moment of ""so that's how it works!"" illumination. For me, one such moment was the explanation of why the angle of the earth relative to the sun makes such a difference in perceived temperature [1]. From an educational standpoint, I think that this would be a really great book to get for a high school student or even an advanced middle school student.[1] When the sun hits the earth at a shallower angle, the same amount of solar energy is spread over a wider area, so the energy received per square inch is decreased."

All my basic scientific knowledge, I have to say, was largely from the books of junior and senior school times and am afraid that I only got nebulous impression now.But the book, this book, the magic of reality still shocked me a little bit, not because of its abstruse contents but because of its simplicity. I guess it is a little book aimed at transmitting basic scientific knowledge to teenagers or young people. So it's another book on common sense.It is not as “prodigiously illuminous and beautifully designed” as it should be, but it's an amusing book and Richard indeed imbued the book with his hilarious humor, which really gave me a lot of laughters in reading.He would list a few mythologies or stories that precede his revealing of the true explanations of the question. And if you are discreet a bit more you would invariably find his “sarcastic tone” for people's beliefs and his ardent support for evolution.If you need to get some basic knowledge about how some natural phenomena happened or physics information such as elements or molecules, all such stuff could be found in the book with concise introductions.But if you want to know more about evolution, as a friend recommend to me, it's better to read his other works like ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution"" or ""The self Gene"" or some similar works from other authors .1.03.2016"

His book The Magic of Reality tries to explain in understandable ways some of the really complicated phenomenons of physics and science overall.In the midway of the book, I felt like back in school. Quite many things very familiar, but the way Mr. Dawkins explains those helped to deepen the understanding quite a bit.The book goes through topics all the way from big bang to evolution to quantum mechanics. So it is really comprehensive overview to the universe as we know it. I give the credit to him on explaining things in very understandable ways.Mr Dawkins is a know atheist and science believer. It really shows in the book. He dismisses all religions. He does admit that there are many things science can't explain yet, but he sees it only as a shortage of current science, not as a possibility for higher forces. Atheism actually came disturbingly through from all the writing. That's a shame, in science facts should be facts without personal believes.I have to still recommend to people who want to understand physics and the world better. I felt like getting a fast recap of learning's from physics from many years at school. It's an excellent book, if you can tolerate the pushing of atheism.This review was originally published in my blog - here"

This would be a really cool textbook, or style for a textbook.The writing occasionally edges into the dry, but there are enough anecdotes and pretty pictures to make up for the occasional wall of text.My only problem is with his approach towards mythological stories. I like the variety he presented, but I would have liked more historical context behind the stories as well as the recognition that a lot of stories like the ones he shared were ancient people's way of exploring/explaining the world around them, even though they sound silly today. However, he does use the stories as a way of teaching logical, critical thinking, which I liked.Anyway, I wish I had known how cool science was in school. This book helped me clear up a few bits of confusion (mostly about atoms, because I pretty much just suffered through chemistry class blankly) and offers a neat perspective on the world."

I don't really see it as a book for children, I see it as a book for anyone who wants to think about the beauty of science and everything. It's a book that just consolidates what we already know - I didn't really learn anything knew from it, but I didn't expect to; I did find that the book helped me to pin down my thoughts on reality though, which is just what I hoped it would do. Of course, it's aimed at a younger audience, but that didn't lessen my enjoyment of it. I found it to be delightful, and thought-provoking. The illustrations by Dave McKean were super, and really enhanced the text. I will use this book when I want to talk to my children about science - they're a little young to understand these ideas just yet, but I'm looking forward to when they begin to question their realities. And I'm looking forward to showing them some proper evidence about why 'God' cannot exist - some damage has been done by school telling them that they're Christians! I hope I can undo it."

The author, Richard Dawkins has taken a step forward and cleverly illustrated the reason for things such as what is magic and reality ? who we are ? why we have winter and summer ? what is sun ? and many natural prodigies which one would like to explore. Almost every chapter starts with different myths that were registered by our ancestors in this planet however it’s the science and the scientists who applied the it and figured out the several factors that would determine the actual reason for the way our planet and things were formed and developed. The author has intelligently extracted required information from the world of science and clearly related to the things described in the book. I would happily add this book to nominate for book of the year 2016 :)Overall - Magic of Reality : Explore the realities of core things through the outcome of science in our planet and there is something amazing inside to educate ourselves beyond that as well :)"
