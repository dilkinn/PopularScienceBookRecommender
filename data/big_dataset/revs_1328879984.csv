""Everything becomes simpler at infinity.""
I have a habit of seeing a book, realising it's on a subject I don't know much about, and finding myself overcome with a strong desire, a need even, to read the book.  That was the case with Infinite Powers: How Calculus Reveals the Secrets of the Universe.  I knew nothing about Calculus.  The only math I took in school was Algebra and Geometry and though I loved both of them, I can't remember diddly-squat about them. As for Calculus? Never learned it, never knew a thing about it.  Thus, when I saw the cover of this book, I suddenly thought, ""I don't know anything about Calculus.  I HAVE to read this book!""Now, I would be doing a donald and lying out my ass if I said that upon reading this book I understand Calculus and can perform any number of its equations.  Nope.  Not even close.  Unfortunately, my brain couldn't quite make sense of it though I often re-read parts in hopes of ""getting"" it.  However, I did at least learn what calculus is, how it is based on infinity, how it takes complex problems and breaks them down into simpler pieces in order to solve them.  How it is obsessed with simplicity.Steven H. Strogatz is a professor of applied mathematics and it must be such a delight to take one of his classes.  He writes exuberantly about Calculus.  He makes it impossible to NOT see the beauty in it, so poetically he writes, so passionately.  I couldn't wait to pick up this book each time, it was so exciting to read!  Yes, even though I didn't understand it all.  Even though it sometimes made my brain hurt.  That didn't matter, or maybe that added to my enjoyment, the way it made my brain go into overtime trying to make sense of what I was reading.I was surprised to learn how much of modern human life is made possible by Calculus.  Everything from putting rockets into space to storing music on cell phones to treating AIDs patients.  There are a myriad of ways in which Calculus makes our lives simpler.  My microwave oven croaked last night and my partner and I had to rush to the store after 10 in order to buy a new one.  How could we possibly live without it?  Well, it's thanks to Calculus that we have this luxury.  And did you know:  The first microwave ovens stood over 6 feet tall and cost what today would be thousands of dollars?  Our kitchen is small so I'm thankful we could buy a compact microwave costing much less than thousands of dollars!But I digress.....I found it fascinating to learn how GPS would not be able to work without the aid of Calculus.  The author says, ""The whole global positioning system requires nanosecond accuracy to work properly"" and that errors in it ""would accumulate at about ten kilometers each day"".  We wouldn't get anywhere close to where we want to go using GPS if it wasn't for Calculus.The author traces the history of Calculus, discussing in length the contributions of such people as Archimedes, Newton, Leibniz, Bruno, Galileo, and more. He blends equations with examples and with stories of women and men who helped discover these equations and who used them to discover other great things. The book is never dry, and it made it become more alive to have this history incorporated into it.I debated giving this book four stars because I wasn't able to learn how to actually do Calculus, but as that is not the fault of the author and because I nonetheless had such a wonderful reading experience, I feel it deserves a full five stars.  If anyone can make Calculus beautiful and exciting, this author certainly can!  I still might not know how to do Calculus but I can appreciate its beauty and simplicity thanks to what I learned in this book.  As Mr. Strogatz writes, ""It isn’t necessary to learn how to do calculus to appreciate it, just as it isn’t necessary to learn how to prepare fine cuisine to enjoy eating it."" And appreciate it I do!"

For me, the math doesn't get interesting until you get above the Calculus line. Calculus with its dealings with the continuum is the first real taste of the infinite. If you stick around for Calculus I bet you would want more. Strogatz in this book shares some of the excitement we have once the math gets weird. In some places, math can be hallucinogenic.

3,1328879984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24035606-ryan-boissonneault,4,"Calculus is one of those subjects that is so complicated that most people not only don’t understand it, they don’t even know what it is that they don’t understand. But that’s unfortunate, because calculus is one of humanity’s most impressive achievements, an accomplishment that unlocks the secrets of the universe and delivers our most profound and useful technology, from radio and television to GPS navigation and MRI imaging. Calculus is the main protagonist in the story of science, and is a subject every educated person should understand at least conceptually. Fortunately, you don’t have to trudge through a thousand-page textbook to appreciate the story and power of calculus. Steven Strogatz, in his latest book Infinite Powers, has provided a clear, concise, and fascinating tour of the subject. In fact, if you don’t understand what calculus is all about after reading this book, then the prospects are not great that you ever will. There is simply no better, clearer presentation of the ideas available. Strogatz uses metaphors, illustrations, stories, and examples to guide the reader through the most difficult concepts. While this is not an easy read, it is as reader-friendly as possible; remember, you’re tackling the most sophisticated branch of mathematics, the underlying logic of all science, and a subject that the sharpest mathematical minds in history had to grapple with for thousands of years. As Strogatz explains, calculus is difficult because it’s tackling the most difficult problems humans encounter, problems that necessitate complex equations, notation, and mathematical manipulation. But behind this computational complexity lies an obsession with simplicity, with breaking down hard problems into easier parts. The special innovation of calculus, as Strogatz explains, is that problems are broken down into infinitely small and manageable parts and then recombined back into the whole. So what is calculus, exactly? It’s easier to describe calculus by the types of problems it solves than by standard mathematical definitions. When most people hear terms like “infinite series,” “limits,” “derivatives,” and “integrals,” they lose sight of the bigger picture of what calculus is trying to accomplish. One type of problem calculus can solve is the area under a curved surface. Area is typically quite easy to solve for shapes with straight lines. For rectangles, for example, the area is simply length times width. But what about for shapes with curves where the slope is constantly changing? There is no simple formula to calculate the area in this situation.You could approximate the area by overlaying rectangular objects over the curved shape (as shown below), but this would only be an approximation as the rectangles would not fit exactly in the curved shape. However, as you made the rectangles smaller (and increased their number) the fit inside the curved shape would keep improving and the approximation would keep getting more accurate. Since you can always keep dividing a number in half (you can always make a number larger or smaller), you can add an infinite number of smaller rectangles into the curved shape. You can never complete this process (which is why the concept of “completed infinity” is logically incoherent), but you could potentially keep adding rectangles forever, which is logically coherent and shows the difference between “completed infinity” and “potential infinity.” As you increase the number of rectangles, you get closer and closer to the area, which is the limit of the infinite series. The area of the curved shape becomes the sum of the infinite series of rectangles. Calculus is the set of equations and procedures to carry out this calculation precisely.  Calculus can also solve problems of motion. Straight-line motion at constant velocity is easy. If you know the speed of an object, then the distance traveled is simply speed times time. But how can you calculate the trajectory of, say, a planet, that not only continuously changes direction in orbit around the sun but that also speeds up or slows down depending on its distance from the sun? This is not so easy, but is solved in a similar way by breaking down the trajectory into infinitely smaller parts and then summing the series. Calculus provides the procedures and notation to carry this out in the most efficient way. You’ll notice that both examples above solve for problems where some quantity is continuously changing. That means that calculus can solve any problem that involves a quantity that is continuously changing, like the spread of a virus, population growth, or continuously compounding interest in finance. Even without understanding the specific calculations, it’s amazing to contemplate the fact that we can harness the power of infinity to calculate with precision the area under any curved surface, the dynamics of any continuously changing variable, and the trajectory of any object anywhere in the universe!Of course, this brief sketch is only a description of the subject in its simplest terms; there is much more to the subject and the mechanics of the calculations gets incredibly complex. If you’re interested in diving deeper into the subject, with examples and proofs, Strogatz delivers a nice mixture of pure mathematics, practical examples, and a history of the personalities behind the development of calculus. Of particular interest for me was Strogatz’s solution of Zeno’s Achilles and the Tortoise paradox, a solution that finally made sense to me (in brief, the solution is that an infinite amount of steps can be completed in a finite amount of time). The Power of Human CooperationIf you find calculus near impossible to learn, you won’t be happy to know that Isaac Newton invented the subject before he turned 25. But you might find some solace in the fact that Newton did little else; he had few friendships and no romantic relationships, so he had all the time in the world to devote to numbers and experiments. Newton also couldn’t have done it alone. He was exactly right when he said that he was able to see further by “standing on the shoulders of giants.” As Strogatz explained:“But again, he [Newton] couldn’t have done any of this without standing on the shoulders of giants. He unified, synthesized, and generalized ideas from his great predecessors: He inherited the Infinity Principle from Archimedes. He learned his tangent lines from Fermat. His decimals came from India. His variables came from Arabic algebra. His representation of curves as equations in the xy plane came from his reading of Descartes. His freewheeling shenanigans with infinity, his spirit of experimentation, and his openness to guesswork and induction came from Wallis. He mashed all of this together to create something fresh, something we’re still using today to solve calculus problems: the versatile method of power series.”There are at least two lessons here; first, knowledge grows exponentially, not linearly, and there is no limit to what can be discovered. By standing on the shoulders of giants, each generation can build on the developments of the past, as Einstein was able to do by rejecting Newton’s ideas of space and time as absolute. Holding a person, idea, or generation in complete reverence inhibits progress, as when we followed Aristotle for 1,500+ years and maintained the belief that the earth was stationary. The best book I’ve read that elaborates on this point is The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World by the physicist David Deutsch. Second, calculus demonstrates the power of human cooperation. No single mind could have developed calculus from scratch. People of diverse origin and circumstance collaborated to find solutions to common, tangible problems, because they didn’t waste their time thinking about arbitrary human divisions and other products of pure imagination, like religion. Newton borrowed from ancient Greek geometry, French analytic geometry, the Indian decimal system, and Arabic algebra. As a result, he discovered the mathematical logic and underlying laws of nature that applied equally to objects anywhere in the universe, thus uniting the entire cosmos. This universality, as Strogatz recognized, sparked the beginning of the Enlightenment. A final point: in the concluding chapter, Strogatz describes Richard Feynman’s quantum electrodynamics (QED) theory, which, by using calculus, describes the quantum interaction of light and matter. Physicists use the theory to make predictions about the properties of electrons and other particles. As Strogatz said, “by comparing those predictions to extremely precise experimental measurements, they’ve shown that the theory agrees with reality to eight decimal places, better than one part in a hundred million.” This means that QED is the most accurate theory anyone has ever devised about anything. A prediction with an accuracy of 8 decimal places is like, using Strogatz’s example, planning to snap your fingers exactly 3.17 years from now down to the second, without the help of a clock or alarm. As Strogatz further explains:“I think this is worth mentioning because it puts the lie to the line you sometimes hear, that science is like faith and other belief systems, that is has no special claim on truth. Come on. Any theory that agrees to one part in a hundred million is not just a matter of faith or somebody’s opinion. It didn’t have to match to eight decimal places.”You will also often hear that science can’t determine right and wrong actions, which in some sense is correct, but misses the point. The moral element of science does not lie in any particular factual claim; it lies in the orientation to forming beliefs. The scientific mindset is not about clinging on to and forming your identity around a set of unalterable beliefs. The scientific mindset is about curiosity, orientation to discovering truth, intellectual integrity, and revising beliefs in the face of new evidence. It’s also, as I believe calculus shows, about the recognition of the power of human cooperation and the pursuit of knowledge as a collective human endeavor."

How I wish Steven Strogatz had been my calc teacher. There are authors who let you know that they are smart and there are authors who write with a definite intention to make the readers smart. Strogatz falls into the latter category. He will infuse you with such a love for math, no matter what level of math you have reached in your studies. Strogatz main message is that calculus extends far beyond what is labeled as Calc I, II, III, or IV. We call all of the other calculus courses by other names because we don't want to just call them calc 1-32. At its essence, Strogatz wants you to know, that calc is utterly obsessed with simplicity. It uses what Strogatz calls the “infinity principle,“ where problems are broken down into tiny parts, which can become infinite parts, and then are fit back together to generate an answer that is easier than trying to answer the original equation. We humans are only as good as our current scientific tools. Once Issac Newton discovered -- or more accurately, allowed the public a reluctant glimpse into his work on-- calculus, life changed in a revolutionary way. In fact, calculus was so revolutionary, Richard Feynman claimed it is indeed the language God speaks. Using calculus as a tool, we humans were able to model an effective treatment for AIDS that stopped the deadly virus from killing a significant portion of our population. We used calculus to listen to unseen objects called black holes. It was the calculus that allowed us to truly hear and see those invisible objects. Strogatz's introduced his reader to the world of calculus by illustrating some examples that show how math surrounds us humans in nature and is eventually uncovered. For example, music itself is mathematical. Since he chose this subject to draw the reader into the world of maths, it was hard not to fall in love with the book. While I wish he had gone a bit more into the neuroscience of music, math, and the brain, he did a lovely job of helping the reader understand how music can be boiled down to ratios. If you pluck a guitar string at the bottom of the string and then move your hand halfway up the string and pluck again, the new note is exactly half as long as it used to be, a ratio of 1:2,  and sounds precisely one octave higher than the original note . If instead the vibrating string is 2/3 of its original length, the note goes up by fifth.I once had a neuroscience professor, Mike Kaplan, who taught us the neuroscience of music and the brain by delivering the entire lecture by playing a keyboard and singing. It was fucking amazing. I particularly enjoyed the portions of the lecture on how the brain can process and enjoy a little bit of dissonance or can instead be agitated by dissonance. And why? Because the inner ear is basically a calculator and it likes mostly straight math, going up octaves with only a little dissonance. If you use more than a little dissonance, as some artists do, you better do it well or it will be like nails on a chalkboard. The long and short of the neuroscience is getting reward and emotional centers to activate and how it's actually the math sequences that can do that. So, if he updates to a new version of this book someday, I really hope he extends his music and the brain discussion. Strogatz marveled at the scholars who were obsessed with understanding numbers and shapes. He provided a quick tour of how using numbers came about -- mostly to keep track of livestock. Numbers were mere scratches on an animal bone and let the king know how many cows you owed him. Eventually numbers evolved into the concept of a number line, something we think nothing of as elementary school children today, became a concept. He marveled even more at how Archimedes came to understand the seemingly simple shape of the circle. He derived pi and wondered how many tiny shapes could fit inside a circle. From those ancient studies came todays understanding of pixilation and the achievement of making Shrek's round belly out of 1,000s of tiny little polygons. I remember reading Clockwork Universe by Edward Dolnick. It is still one of my favorite books. No one, and I mean no one, does a better job of detailing Kepler's maddening obsession with understanding the shape of planetary motion (what would eventually be Kepler's Law of planetary motion). Infinite Powers was every bit as beautiful as Clockwork Universe and did a better job making the math digestible by providing a sweeping and general understanding and then solidifying that understanding with tons of logical and intuitive concrete and local examples of the various forms of calculus (what other authors would call maths related to calculus).  Strogatz painted vivid portraits of Tyco Brahe, Galileo, Kepler, (not as much about Copernicus) Newton, and Leibniz. But what I am most grateful for is Strogatz very clear invitation to women to join the maths by highlighting some very important women who made significant contributions to math. I was surprised not to see Emmy Noether among his examples (maybe because she is known for abstract algebra). Strogatz brought to life stories that literally made my heart flutter with absolute joy. Strogatz, you are the fucking bomb! As a young girl, Sofya Kovalevskaya -- who eventually became the first woman in the world to obtain a PhD in mathematics in 1874 --had an entire wall of her bedroom wallpapered with the calculus notes from when her father was a student at university. She said when she was about 11, she spent hours just trying to make sense of one line of the equations. She had a predilection for math but it was against the law for her to go to college in Russia. When she entered into an unhappy arranged marriage, the one positive aspect of this union was that it allowed her to travel to Germany where she could finally attend math classes. Germany did not not officially allow her to attend university, but she impressed several professors and was able to unofficially attended classes.Kovalevskaya arranged to privately study with Karl Weierstrass And he awarded her a PhD for her outstanding workIn analysis, dynamics, and partial differential equation. She eventually got a position teaching at the University of Stockholm and taught there for eight years before dying of Influenza at the age of 41.  French mathematician Sophie Germain never earned a degree. It certainly was not because she didn't earn it. Indeed she did. Germain had to pretend to be a man just so she could sneak into math classes. Her work was significantly better than that of the man she replaced. Because of this, she was called into a meeting with Lagrange. When he found out she was a woman, he took her under his wing and championed her. I love the progressive men of the past who tried their best to help women. She also caught the attention of the famous Gauss, who was so impressed with her work, he engaged in a regular correspondence with her, thinking all the while she was a man. He eventually found out she was a woman (an interesting tale told by Strogatz in this book). For her work on number theory, and Fermat's Last Theorem, Gauss recommended Germain to receive an honorary degree. But, it was not enough pull to earn her the well deserved degree. Strogatz's awe infused ending to his beautiful book marveled at how, because of the fact that we had calculus as a tool and because we humans and our detectors were listening at the right time, we heard the sound of two black holes colliding.  He spoke of how it made him feel when he heard the news. I could not help but tear up because I felt the same way. This book is about the best of what humans can achieve when  they uncover the secrets of the world and the universe. I am bursting with love for this book. "

Review
When I tell people that I’m an engineer, my wife likes to follow up that comment with, “He does math all day long.” A common response is, “Oh, you must really like math. I didn’t enjoy it in [insert level of schooling here].” To keep the conversation moving I agree, and while I do like math, I didn’t always. Until I started studying calculus, math bored me. Algebra existed as a set of rules; geometry, though my introduction to proofs, seemed too abstract. But when I first solved a derivative, my indifference turned to frustration and intrigue. My plan to take only enough math to get an engineering degree changed to a serious contemplation of switching career paths to applied mathematics (with an eye towards physics grad degrees). Ultimately, I stuck with the engineering curriculum but ended up studying higher level mathematics, and to this day, I still read about and love math. Part of my studies now involves going back and filling in what I missed during previous years. One of the voices to which I turn is Dr. Steven Strogatz, and his latest book, Infinite Powers, fills in details about calculus that I lacked. His explanations don’t rely on the familiar equations but, instead, root themselves in history, in logic, and in excellent prose. Infinite Powers transforms calculus from equations into meaning.
The Story
In Infinite Powers, Dr. Strogatz starts with Archimedes from ancient Greece and carries on to some of today’s most unique challenges. It is the story of calculus told as a continuum of human learning. Often, the public thinks that scientific breakthroughs happen when lone geniuses discover something new, but in reality discoveries occur when people improve upon the work of others. In Infinite Powers Dr. Strogatz traces the methods Archimedes used to Newton and Leibniz, who are the inventors or discoverers of calculus. Along the way, we learn about contributions from Fermat, Galileo, Descartes, Arabic, and Chinese mathematicians. But we don’t stop at the discovery era. Infinite Powers continues on to Fourier and Sophie Germain. We even get to see how calculus is being used today to treat HIV patients, to create microwaves, and, near to my own heart and pocketbook, help the 787 fly.
The Writing
Math possesses a strong language of its own rooted in symbols and logic. While I view this as a strength, I also know others view the equations, Greek letters, and symbols to be inscrutable. Others have said that math texts tend to be dry reads. For anyone who thinks this, Infinite Powers is the book for you. While equations do exists, they are few. Dr. Strogatz takes the time to explain, in detail, what each of the symbols means. But the majority of the book reads more like a history text than a mathematical treatise. While it doesn’t spoon feed the reader, it doesn’t bog down in jargon. Clarity and simplicity are the descriptors I have already used talking about this book with friends. Dr. Strogatz does an excellent job describing what the math is actually doing. The reader will NOT be able to do any calculus after reading it, but he/she will understand how powerful a tool it is.There are graphs and pictures throughout the book. In my advanced reader’s copy (ARC), the graphs didn’t show up. So, I cannot speak to their quality; however, with my background and the detail of Dr. Strogatz’s descriptions, I could picture what his intent was with the graphs. That should be an indicator of success for the prose of this book.
Ugh, Math, Really? 
Bear with me here as I get on my soapbox for a minute. One of the other responses that I get when I’m introduced as an engineer is, “You must be really good at math.” And compared to most people, yes, I am good at math. But I’m good at math for one reason only, I’ve been practicing it in one form or another for the last 23 years. In the martial arts, there’s a saying that a black belt is simply a white belt who didn’t quit. To me, that’s all that math is. I’m good at math and calculus because I didn’t quit doing math. The general public often thinks that math requires a certain mindset or, even, a certain person. No, it requires practices and tenacity. The reason that I stuck with math is because of teachers in high school that showed the same enthusiasm that Dr. Strogatz shows in this book. Teachers and professors who care that students understand a subject make this world a better place. After reading Infinite Powers, I have no doubt Dr. Strogatz is a teacher than inspires students. I can’t help but wonder what could happen if a book like this gets into the hands of someone who thinks they have to be good at math to understand it.
Math as Art
Though we use math in the sciences, I’ve come to view it more as an art. The mathematician, engineer, chemist, or whoever must know and understand the tools math gives us in order to solve problems, and like a painter picks and chooses the right brush to add to the painting, the problem solver picks and chooses the correct mathematical tool. It’s a creative process that, instead of being hung in a gallery or museum, zips down the road, flows through our veins, or launches a satellite into space. Dr. Strogatz demonstrates the versatility and creativity that we are capable of when using calculus. Whether putting satellites in space or determining how viruses spread, calculus is a tool for delving into nature’s mysteries. Infinite Powers stirred that creative sense, that feeling of awe at being able to see into the universes internal mechanisms. At the same time, it reminded me of the ingenuity of the human animal to seek out and explore the world around us. Dr. Strogatz conveys the beauty that one can find in math, and I felt that thrill of discovery again as I read this book.
Infinity
Originally, I requested this book because I thought it was about infinity. That mathematical concept that looks like an 8 fell asleep, ∞. Instead, it was about calculus; so, I went into the first few chapters with the wrong expectations. Dr. Strogatz discusses infinity but not enough to satisfy me. And throughout the book, he does reference back to the topic of infinity, but it feels more like a forced attempt to tie the later chapters to the theme. I’m still hoping that Dr. Strogatz gives us a book about infinity in the same detail and manner that he gave us a book about calculus.
Conclusion
Dr. Steven Strogatz’s Infinite Powers details the history and development of calculus. Dr. Strogatz’s ability to relate complex mathematical concepts in clear and precise language is at peak form in this book. For anyone curious about calculus, this book provides answers in delightful, easy to understand prose that will awaken your curiousity."
6,1328879984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,3,"I certainly wish I had read this book while in high school or college. We grilled all the basic technical parts of calculus and yet unsure what was the point. Well certainly you don't need to know it if you do not work in science and research. Life can go on just as well. But being able to appreciate the beauty of it is an added bonus. And then who knows, seeing that beauty could change the path you take in life.Strogatz takes the same approach with his earlier pop science book, The Joy of x, i.e. trying his best to explain calculus via intuition, allegories, and graphs. It works up to some extent. Some concepts require a lot more, but as the author tries to avoid discussing the technicals, the discussion becomes a bit shallow. That is still fine, this is not a textbook.What I'm a bit uneasy about is Strogatz's reverence for calculus to the point of being religious. Maybe I have taken it wrong, taken his comparison/allegory too much at face value when he cites Feymann over and over again that it is the language of God. Just as the title says, Strogatz argues that calculus is so special, nature acts according to the rules of calculus, everything can be described using these types of equations. Perhaps I've taken calculus for granted. Of course it is behind everything. Modern science is built upon math and ultimately one of the most powerful tools ever invented. Yes, calculus is a tool, a language. It is a lens of looking at the world and of course whatever picture one sees would be described in that medium. Is it so surprising? Could there be another language that provides a different lens to see the world? I'm an illiterate here, I have no idea. My take is that calculus has been so successful to deal with so many problems of interest, and there are so many things to extend and develop, that one isn't incentivized to go through all the pain to develop another language to compete with it. But I would prefer to think that there are possible options out there, so that calculus is not necessary the one (and only) language of ""God."" Strogatz also emphasizes that calculus is behind everything, behind all sorts of important equations and inventions in human history, driving progress and success. It is true that calculus is used, but I feel that the writing is tilted towards overstressing the importance of calculus and downplaying all other types of ingenious ideas and inventions that work together. Perhaps one needs to exaggerate to attract attention. It is the way of writing not the idea. And of course any language has its limitation. Strogatz gives a lot of praises and does not so much tell readers what are the stuffs that calculus cannot deal with. Sure, towards the end he does say there is a limit to what mathematicians can solve, such as nonlinearity. He hints at the need for another type of method to approach such problems, such as that from Poincare. The discussion is not as comprehensive as I would like. Don't get me wrong, I love calculus. I'm more of an abstract thinker and do not need much to be convinced that calculus a wonderful and elegant tool. Yet I have problems with the writing. I prefer writings with more nuance. I ended up looking forward to the bits talking about mathematicians and their private lives. But Professor Strogatz is not a historian, so I was naturally also not satisfied either."
7,1328879984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7309374-romanas,5,"Time spent in the math world is one of the best ones. I am of a strong opinion that the Universe not only talks in the language of math, the Universe is math. Whether math is the langue of the universe, the universe itself, or just a construct that exist only in a human brain, it's the mysterious thing we've been given helping us to reveal many secrets of the universe and making our lifes improved in so many ways and distinquished on this planet.Steven Strogatz can obviously write a book about math that becomes a page turner, an exelent job when it comes to math related texts. A mathematiacian who can write is worth his weight in gold. I wish I had come across such a book at high school. Several passages were a bit murky, but overall, it was an inpiring read. I've filled some gaps in my math brain and got some new and important insights. Strongly recommend the book to anyone."
8,1328879984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,5,"For an ordinary layperson, this is perhaps the most accessible history of the development of Calculus one could hope for. In easily readable language Strogatz has provided a fascinating narrative covering the ideas behind Calculus, its history from the earliest Greek mathematicians, its “dismissal” from the formal geometric/mathematical canon for some two thousand years, until its resurgence in the 17th-c with the work of Newton and Leibnitz, and on to its amazingly extensive application to just about every sphere of activity in modern civilisation.Some knowledge of basic mathematics is required, but not much more than that: Strogatz is more concerned with explaining what Calculus is all about, and pointing out that certain precise questions about specific physical problems can only be best answered by its application. Calculus is the most accurate mathematical tool ever developed for answering such questions.Some things I particularly liked about this lie in the conceptual (philosophical?) matters that are implied or suggested: the idea, for example, that the modern understanding of the Space-Time continuum is maintained (for me, the “problem” between the continuum idea and the idea of infinitesimals remains, and probably should remain so); and the fact that, no matter how “infinitesimal” the divisions of differential calculus are made, there will always remain “a little bit” extra that is unaccounted for. The latter is difficult enough when dealing with the interrelationship of two “entities” or “bodies”, let alone the far more complicated problem relating to three (or more?) such entities, so it remains a potentially intriguing matter.While the cynics among us might consider this enough to disparage its absolute applicability, Calculus remains our most successful, accurate and practical measurement tool so far. I like the idea that there is still the possibility for new approaches to be made: but that being said, the current “solution” to such errors will still most probably be found through the re-application and refinements of its processes.An ironic example of this relates to Strogatz’s use of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner aeroplane as a proud example of the achievements made under the auspices of this form of mathematics. This may very well be the case, but at the same time, some bad reports coming in 2019 about Boeing’s 737 MAX line of planes suggested that, among other matters, computer design flaws were partly responsible for two of these planes crashing with a total loss of 364 lives: a sober reminder that the more intricate the maths, the more care needs to be taken in its applications and consequences in the physical world.Even so, it is Calculus which is at the heart of most of the technological developments we already enjoy, and it will undoubtedly have much more to contribute, particularly in the areas of medicine, society and politics in the years to come. This book will at least provide a basic understanding of what it is that has become indispensable in our societies, whether we like it or not."

But it also has important applications in advanced physics; relativity and quantum mechanics, cosmology, astronomy, biology, chemistry, medicine, geology, ecology and in everyday life. In this book, the author discusses calculus as catch-as-catch-can story in an historical context without giving some ideas of how calculus helped physics to evolve. This is not a recipe book and at the same time it is not overwhelming. But in the absence of clear mathematical methods or its applications, this is a slapdash story that does not make calculus interesting."

I only endured my class with a boring professor. No joy then, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book. All the applications of calculus through the years were fascinating. Amazing stories about the scientists and mathematicians. Very easy to read and understand. I only needed to back up to reread a few paragraphs. "
11,1328879984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18185192-athan-tolis,5,"I need to psyche myself up to do some math for work. And I have a math sherpa and I arranged to meet him so he can take me through the paper I must tackle. But I’m old and only really remember my high school math well, so there is a genuine task at hand here.So I duck and dive between the paper and my notes from my MSc thesis from at least fifteen years ago and I work out the answer to lesser problems and I write out my questions for my sherpa and I also need to be thinking math the whole time; I need to be in a mood, basically.That’s the task.So I did the sensible thing and went on a bit of a binge and bought a whole bunch of popular math books in one go to read in the tube. “Infinite Powers” I read first, because it looked like it would not challenge me at all and it gets good writeups.It’s bloody awesome! It’s more than an anthology of results and it’s more than a series of mini-portraits of mathematicians, it’s almost got a plot. Surprisingly often, even the obligatory corny applications of the math are (somewhat) related to what the author’s talking about.Huge caveat: I knew both the math and even many of the stories upfront, so perhaps it’s not very well explained. I have no way of knowing. But I bet you it is. Perhaps not well enough that you could hope to learn calculus from here, Jordan Ellenberg’s praise on the back cover notwithstanding. (For that I can refer you to “Quick Calculus” by twin gods Kleppner and Ramsey.) But probably well enough to be a companion to anybody taking calculus for the first time.Steven Strogatz had me from “hello,” of course, because he starts with the Greeks, on whom he lavishes immense praise. He could have left it there and I’d still be basking in the warm glow of my ancestors’ work. Needless to say, it does not stop there, he takes you from them to Fermat and Descartes, before introducing you to Newton and Leibniz, a couple words on Fourier and from him straight to Einstein, taking special care to erase all traces of evil men like the unspeakable inventor of delta-epsilon proofs. You won’t find the C-word here.So there’s a massive hole in the nineteenth century, somewhere, but I’m sure you can buy another book to find out about that. Here you’ll discover a decent definition of e, an intuitive explanation of general relativity, the common cause of death of Leibniz and Newton, a fun game to play with your microwave oven, the first and second derivative of the sine wave, the dimension of the three-body problem, a strong defense of infinitesimals, WHAT’S NOT TO LIKE?Enough from me, I’ll now go buy some extra copies for a few boys and girls I know. If one of them likes it, my job is done.Oh, sorry, one more thing. About the plot: it’s a history of how mathematicians throughout time have sliced hard problems into infinite infinitely-thin slices where the problem has a clear answer and then dealt with infinity to sum up the solutions to the easy problem in order to come up with an answer to the hard problem.Whenever you do that, you’re doing calculus, you’re putting together the answer granule by granule."

Then Newton (1643-1727) and Leibniz (1646-1716) invented a mathematical tool to get closer and closer to the changing system at hand. Steven did a great job explaining how Calculus uses divide-and-conquer to the extreme taming infinity to describe the universe. It changed civilization; this book travels from Archimedes (-212) computing pi to today’s design of airplanes. And Calculus is still evolving like a living organism after an explosion of diversity to explain CHANGE everywhere. For example, Einstein (1879-1955) used Calculus to play with space (say x, y, z) and time, at least four things changing at the same time."

Don't go there."" This sentence gives a good idea of the fun and rigor that Steven Strogatz brings to this book that explains what the big deal is to people who, let's face it, are unlikely to learn calculus. ""The desire to harness infinity and exploit its power is a narrative thread that runs through the whole twenty-five hundred year story of calculus."" By weaving examples of what's so damn useful about calculus with stories of great minds and the problems they overcame personally and mathematically, Strogatz wrote a readable, yes, fun book about math. His is not a big ego, he gives pioneers their due and busts some myths along the way, ""the Pythagorean theorem did not originate with Pythagoras, it was known to the Babylonians for at least a thousand years before him."" We learn about the Chinese genius Liu Hui who improved on Archimedes's method for calculating pi as well as Zu Chongzhi who pushed the study of polygons further than anyone before him. Strogatz has a special affinity for the Sicilian Greek Archimedes. The Hindu contribution is enormous and seems worth an entire book on its own. The Arabic scholar Al-Hasan Ibn al-Haytham gets recognized as one of the many giants upon whose shoulders Newton and Leibniz stood.  We don't stop there but in several great chapters we learn about the absolute latest breakthroughs and applications of calculus, to Quantum Electrodynamics and Chaos theory, medicine and many other non-linear problems. Stretching my inelastic brain to the the snapping point, he discusses Eintstein's partial derivative theories.  ""matter tells space-time how to curve, while curvature tells matter how to move. The dance between them makes the theory nonlinear."" I love that sentence! Strogatz is a true writer, an artist with words who, happily for me, applies that skill to explaining his profession, and love, calculus."

16,1328879984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4651295-jason-furman,5,"A fantastic book about calculus. A blend of the history of the development of calculus, its applications, and intuitive explanations of its power filled with nicely intuitive explanations that will either provide a refresher or a different way of understanding what you have already learned.Steven Strogatz proceeds in (sort of) chronological order, defining calculus not as what you learn in school but any technique that breaks things apart into infinitesimal pieces and puts them back together again in order to solve problems. Rather than describing an immaculate conception of calculus by Leibniz and Newton, Strogatz starts with Archimedes, shows several geometric applications, and even spends a lot of time on Descartes and Fermat before even getting to what we consider calculus today. In all of these he shows how a combination of abstract ideas but also in many cases practical problems led to the development of calculus.The chronological order is interrupted (in a good way) by Strogatz’s many descriptions of the applications of calculus to different practical problems, most of which are in the analytically relevant chapter. These include GPS, AIDS drugs, rocketry, and more. In all of these cases Strogatz shows his pedigree as an applied mathematician, going into significant but highly readable detail about the models and discoveries underlying these areas.Overall, the book is very nicely written and highly recommended."
17,1328879984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61750298-yvo-hunink,4,"If I had only read this book before I got calculus in university. I would have maybe actually understood what I was doing. I advise anyone that is doing, or will do, calculus, to use this book as a great additional reading that will probably save you some hours in the end. I got this lovely book from my dear friend Kristina, thanks!Calculus is just not a set of mathematical tricks we use to calculate stuff. The unfolding of proofs, the building on concepts and the progression of the logics of change. It is the core of our collective understanding, to which we owe much of our well-being. From Archimedes, to Galileo, to Newton and now... to Poincaré.I was positively surprised that towards the end of the book, one of the founding fathers of the non-linear, chaotic and complex realm was mentioned, for his expansion of the pendulum dynamics away from the ordered domain. While I was not looking for anything on complex systems in this book, apparently it is hunting me ;). Very good to hear that Strogatz views this field as an interesting topic for calculus in the 21st century.However, that's also where Strogatz lost the 5 stars. He missed the opportunity to explicitely define fractals as the new geometric shape to be studied and fractal dimensions as the go-to derivatives, so that we can maybe find the mysteries of emergence. The last chapter, for me, could have been expanded into 3 more chapters. Especially more about AI and how we use calculus there."

However, I found this book to not make calculus that much more interesting than I’d thought befure due to how shallowly the author penetrates the subject. Additionally, I found the ending of this book to be a drag due to the author forgoing any mathematical explainations and merely describing complicated processes that calculus was magically the answer to. This effectively sucked any of the intrigue out of these otherwise fascinating situations. Sprinkle in a bunch of half-baked analogies and the end of this book is fairly boring and tedious. "
19,1328879984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,5,"The essence of mathematics lies in its beauty and its intellectual challenge. It is a triumph of the imagination. In high schools and universities, we rarely grasp the core ideas in many branches of Mathematics. I thought I understood Euclidean geometry well in school. Much later, I stumbled upon non-Euclidean geometry for the first time. I learnt that Euclid’s fifth axiom - the axiom of parallels - is not a self-evident truth. It is not empirically verifiable. This makes other geometries possible. I had a similar experience with calculus. I grasped the core ideas behind infinitesimal calculus much after I left school. Often, I get fundamentals clarified later in life by popular science books. This book by Dr. Steven Strogatz showed me what was missing in teaching Maths in high schools. The soul of creative mathematics is intuition and imagination. Intuition comes first. Rigor comes after. The author says we leave this out in teaching Maths. Most of us believe that Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz invented Calculus. In this book, Dr. Strogatz traces the ideas of infinitesimal calculus from the days of Archimedes. We then meet Galileo, Kepler, Descartes and Fermat through to Newton and Leibniz. Along the way, we find the contributions of Arabic and Indian mathematicians. This book explains the beauty of calculus to any interested person, even if one is not well-versed in high-school mathematics. We follow the history of calculus. We find its key ideas with engrossing anecdotes of the scientists and mathematicians who developed the field. What is calculus? Calculus is a branch of Mathematics which solves problems in three steps. It splits a complicated but continuous problem into an infinite number of simpler pieces. Then it solves each of the simple piece separately. Finally it puts them together as the solution. For instance, we can visualize motion at changing speed as composed of infinitely many, infinitesimally brief motions at constant speed. Similarly, one could pretend that curves comprise an infinite number of infinitesimally short straight lines. We call the splitting ‘differentiation’ and the putting together ‘integration’. Together, it becomes the Infinitesimal calculus. The author explains these ideas beautifully with many examples. The first chapters in the book lay the foundation by showing us how ancient Greece approached the computation of Pi. Archimedes calculated the perimeter of a many-sided polygon inscribed in a circle. The polygon approached the circle as the number of sides approached infinity and the length of those sides approached zero. He also used the same approach in representing a smooth segment of a parabola. He did it through a mosaic of an infinite number of triangular shards. From here, we move on to see how this principle plays a big role in our life experience. Modern-day animators at DreamWorks used tens of thousands of polygons in creating Shrek’s round belly and trumpet-like ears. In the film ‘Avatar’, animators used millions of polygons to render each plant in the imaginary world of Pandora. Scientists have used the same principle in doing facial surgery for patients with misaligned jaws and other congenital malformations by creating Virtual surgery simulators. In modern-day CT Scanners, x-rays pass through tissue, bone and organs producing different levels of absorption. To compute the reduction of intensity in this process, the CT software calculates step by infinitesimal step as the x-rays travel through the tissue, and then combines all the results as the integral. Calculus provides the language for describing waves and the tools for analyzing them. The vibration of strings produces music. It led to the discovery of the wave equation. James Clerk Maxwell used it to predict the existence of electromagnetic waves. It is calculus which enabled the invention of vacuum tubes, transistors, computers, radar, microwave ovens, drugs for HIV and the design of Boeing 787 wings.The book contains many philosophical musings of the author which are important to understand the illusions which calculus creates to resolve reality. Calculus models Reality through an infinite number of divisions. If we look at any phenomenon in excruciatingly fine detail in time or space, we will see the breakdown of smoothness on which calculus depends on. The book illustrates this in explaining Usain Bolt’s record-breaking 100-meter dash in the 2009 World Championships in Berlin. Conversely calculus also takes its creative license by treating discrete objects as if they are continuous. The modeling is approximate but useful. For example, the DNA is a discrete collection of atoms and not continuous. Molecular Genetics treats it as a continuous curve, like a perfect elastic band. This enables Genetics to apply two spin offs of calculus - elasticity theory and differential geometry - to calculate how DNA deforms when subjected to the forces from proteins, from the environment and from interactions within itself.The author is at his best in the final two chapters, namely ‘The Future of Calculus and Conclusion’. He begins with a defence of what he believes the essence of calculus is. The 19th century saw infinity, and the infinitesimal expunged from calculus. Scientists clarified what limits, derivatives, integrals and real numbers meant. They believed that they arrested the rampage of infinitesimal calculus. Dr. Strogatz differs. He is firm in his belief that the credo of calculus is the Infinity Principle. It is this principle that allows us to study any pattern, curve, motion, natural process, system or phenomenon that changes smoothly and continuously. He explains the role of calculus in linear, non-linear and chaotic systems using everyday experiences with amazing simplicity. Biology and sociology are nonlinear. When a system is nonlinear, its behavior may be impossible to forecast with formulas, even though that behavior is deterministic. Determinism does not imply predictability. In this chapter, he further discusses Complex systems and higher Dimensions. He says that natural selection has tuned our nervous systems to perceive directions as up, down, front, back, left and right of ordinary space. We cannot visualize the fourth dimension, try as we might. We can only comprehend it through mathematical abstractions. This is a huge hurdle in Complex systems where we meet higher dimensions. Hence, the author says that it will be hard, if not impossible, to make progress on the most difficult problems of our time. They are in the behavior of economies, societies, cells, workings of the immune system, genes, brains and consciousness. Reading this, I felt that the Earth’s climate is a highly complicated, nonlinear system. Hence, humility and caution is necessary in making predictions for a hundred years.Dr. Strogatz concludes the book by contemplating on what he calls the greatest mystery of all. Why is the Universe comprehensible and why is calculus in sync with it? He provides three eerie examples of the effectiveness of calculus. The differential equations and integrals of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is one. They help predict the properties of electrons and other particles to a precision of eight decimal places. Such precision is comparable to planning to snap one’s finger 3.17 years from now and getting it right to the nearest second without a clock or an alarm. The second example takes us back to 1928. Then, Paul Dirac wrote a differential equation for the electron which implied something new, true and beautiful about nature. Its logic and beauty demanded the existence of a new particle, the Positron. In 1932, the experimental physicist, Carl Anderson, found it, albeit unaware of Dirac’s prediction. The last example takes us even further back to 1915, to the differential equations of General Relativity. These equations predicted the expansion of the Universe, existence of black holes, gravitational waves, gravity’s effect on time, how matter curves space-time and how the curvature tells matter to move. It is a celestial dance of calculus and nature, in the author’s words. This marvellous book leaves us in no doubt that Calculus is the language that God speaks. Everyone interested in the beauty of Mathematics, and Nature must read this book. "
20,1328879984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1280889-drtaxsacto,5,"Understanding how things move together and how to evaluate seeming disparate data and events are at the core of many of modern life's problems. Steven Strogatz presents a wonderful history of the methodology of those techniques that are embodied in Calculus in a very readable fashion.He does two things which the non-math person should appreciate. First, he presents a good history of the development of thinking about advanced math. From Xeno's paradox (which stipulates it is impossible to get anywhere if you assume that all movement is conditioned on moving half the distance to the goal incrementally) to Arrow's Law (which tried to argue that conditions for decisions in a social setting are hard to establish) I have always been bothered by these mind games. In part, because, we do figure out how to get from here to there and at the same time to vote, even if the results are not perfect. But Strogatz's history is well done.At the same time he presents some real life examples of the uses of calculus to understand some things that are commonly misunderstood. I'll present only one. He presents data that the length of sunlight in a day is not a linear function (each day the number of minutes of sunlight expands or contracts by a common amount). He shows, using calculus, that the days extend from the Winter Equinox to the Spring in an advancing pattern (each day's sunlight is a bit longer) and then through the Summer Equinox the period of extension of sunlight is shortening) - at the Fall Equinox the pattern begins to slow down again until the cycle repeats.One of the problems of many analytical models we assume to be correct in all sorts of fields is their linearity. A good example was the Club of Rome Report which postulated that in the last couple of decades of the 20th Century life on earth would be severely compromised. But many of the things we deal with require (because in part human activity is multi-faceted) configural logic. I will admit that while I am pretty good at math I never took Calculus. I've always wondered whether it would be worth the effort to teach myself the skills. This book helped me decide that there are two opportunities in Calculus - the first is to understand a set of techniques for understand all sorts of things - from how the aids virus interacts to why we get phantom traffic jams. With lots more work we might even be able to understand things like the complex interactions of climate. The second opportunity is to be thankful for all the people willing to go through the process of learning the functions and to appreciate the power of this tool."
21,1328879984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,3,"Infinite Powers was a great book to introduce a comprehensive, high-level conception of Calculus (differential & integral) to a reader who has perhaps shied away from such a conception due to a fear of its complexity. I can vouch that this book is, nearly, for everyone, and that most people interested in the origin story, inception, development, and impact of such an ubiquitous mathematics would be pleased to read it. As it turns out, the history and inception of Calculus is full of recognizable names, to those of us who have had a canonical western mathematics education at the level of, say, high-school or early university calculus courses. The book begins by introducing the notion of infinity, a tool which most theorems of Calculus harness to varying degree; Without such a picture painted, the average reader would surely be asking questions elegantly answered in this initial survey of the concept of infinity. Strogatz formalizes such an ""Infinity Principle"": Problems are easier to solve if you divide them into an infinite series of small parts, solve the problem for those parts independently, and then compute the solution of the original problem by combining the solutions to the infinite parts.The story continues, introducing Archimedes and his attempts at wrangling the nuances of euclidean geometry, from the discovery of ""pi"" to calculating the area under a parabolic segment using the Infinity Priciple. Next, insight into the the problems and mathematical ideas that begot differential calculus such as Galileo's attempts at conceiving laws of motion, Kepler's attempts at understanding planetary motion, and Fermat and Descartes struggles and successes of analytic geometry (unifying algebra and euclidean geometry on the x-y plane) and using the Infinity Principle to solve optimization problems and find the rates of change for non-linear equations. All along, the Infinity Principle was guiding these great mathematicians even before it was formalized!Progressing onwards (quite quickly, I might add), Issac Newton is introduced along with his success in the ""invention"" of differential and integral calculus. Touching on the contributions of Leibniz as well, Strogatz comprehensively describes the three core problems that Calculus solves:1) Given a curve, find the slope of arbitrary points on the curve (derivatives, rate-of-change)2) Given an equation of slopes, find the original curve from which it was derived (primitive integrals, or, ""anti-derivatives"")3) Given a curve, find the area under the curve over a given interval (integrals, magnitude of change)Leibniz and Newton were attacking these problems at around the same time, and even invented different techniques and notations for solving them without knowledge of each other's attempts and successes at doing so! The author does a wonderful job contextualizing these techniques, introducing the problems and their relationships in a straight forward manner, but ultimately doesn't go to the depth that I would have desired (though I understand the length restrictions of modern pop-sci/math books). I sometimes felt like I couldn't understand a page of the authors explanations simply because he would choose to use analogies in places where I thought the mathematics itself would be clearer.Lastly, Strogatz surveys a myriad of specific ways in which Calculus has progressed in the years since Newton and Leibniz: Introducing partial differential equations, applications of infinite series and how Fourier used infinite series of sine waves to describe heat dissapption, Strogatz ties many conceptual knots with the pleasing unification of said techniques. The last few chapters of the boo conclude with providing intriguing insight into the role that such maths play in our day to day lives. Descriptions of the role of Calculus in the solutions of seminal physics problems such as the non-linear three-body problem, Feynman's work on quantum electrodynamics, Dirac's prediction of anti-matter and the positron, and finally Einsteins theory of relativity-- the curvature of space-time! I struggled between whether to rate this book 3/5 or 4/5 stars for several reasons, the most notable being the idea that I liked it, but it was a little too hand-wavy for my taste. I approached the book hoping to get an insight into the way the maths underneath the veil of Calculus work, and for the most part, I did; However, I also expected to peer a bit deeper into the practical applications of Calculus to solving hard mathematical problems from its inception to modern day. Strogatz does touch on a few of these problems more deeply than others, but I was always left feeling like the interesting bits of the problem and its solution-- the systematic, symbolic, mathematics of both--was swept under the rug for fear of the reader's fright of maths manifest.I would highly recommend this book to those who are interested in understanding Calculus's historical narrative, as well as acquiring a more refined broad and shallow insight into its mathematical foundations, and feel a nagging frustration that they lack a holistic conception of perhaps the most ubiquitous and relevant mathematics of them all."
22,1328879984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44469843-tom-lee,2,"This was a real struggle. My mathematical abilities peaked at the age of 15, after which I abandoned the subject forever, except for the kinds of simple calculations that could be completed by an 8-year-old. Perhaps that's why making my way through this book made me feel like Atreyu's horse in the Swamps of Sadness. Almost from the very start I went nearly mad with trying to understand how infinity could be divisible. I raged about it to everyone around me; they just shrugged their shoulders with the air of people who have more important things to think about. Which, to be fair, they almost certain did, because does your average Joe really need to know about calculus? Absolutely not, though Strogatz's enthusiasm made me desperately want to.It was round about page 130, when I reached the section on logarithms, that I realised I would never be able to understand calculus. But I plodded dutifully on and maybe some of it has stuck - at least the parts describing its history and applications were interesting.Ultimately, I would only recommend this book to people who are already attached to mathematics, because reading this won't endear you further to the subject."

This is a really well written and readable introduction to calculus. I took away that calculus deals in the infinite, and makes complex problems less so by slicing them into infinitely small pieces and solving them and then putting them back together. There were times that I wished he would go into some of the calculus that was behind some of the innovations he discussed, at least in an appendix. So while I learned that calculus is vital for lots of uses, he doesn't always tell us exactly how - of course he did this on purpose because the work is probably mind-numbingly complex - but I still wish he would have shown us at least one rather complex one. Much of the book is going through the history of the development of calculus and the important characters. This is well done and interesting for the most part. Ultimately though, calculus is complex, and while interesting to me, only enough for three stars, though this is just based on my personal experience and lack of enthusiasm for the subject - the book is very well done."

I had first-semester calculus many decades ago, I’ve forgotten it all and this book didn’t bring it back to me either. But it was fun to read. My eyes certainly glazed over for some pages here or there, but the vast majority is very readable even if you had zero math background I think."
27,1328879984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58890815-andrii-zakharov,5,"An absolute joy to read, this book just might make you fall in love with calculus. Yes, Steven Strogatz really is that good."
28,1328879984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16624009-mengsen-zhang,5,"I usually reserve 5-star ratings for books that are, say, ecstatic---this book is not that. But I must appreciate the effort put into writing such a remarkably accessible book to general readers about math. It could easily have been boring or forbidding. Strogatz got it to work.  As someone who uses calculus regularly for work, I'm unlikely to be in the target audience. Most people I know who work in a field professionally find it difficult to pick up a popular science book in a related field. But when it comes to math and physics, I could always use a bit more intuition and science history, which are scarcely supplied in technical textbooks. This book has a delicious supply of such exo-textbook insights related to calculus and math history. To see the person behind the science, or more often, the social network behind the science is often very instructive for a working scientist to preserve inner passion and persevere in the greater scheme of life. It's a reminder that humanity is the iceberg that keeps its tip, however abstract, above the water. The beef between Fermat and Descartes certainly worth the buck. It also helps one revisit the elementary problems and ideas in geometry and dynamics. Those historical mathematical problems/ideas may seem too stale, too ""toy"", and too greek from a modern point of view. But they also contain the generator of insights that their advanced offsprings can hardly grow out of. It is always nice to go back to basics.  And as always, I read Strogatz for writing tips! This helps me overcome my tendency to talk very abstractly in science communication. Thus, in my opinion, this book is really for every type of reader. I highly recommend it! "
29,1328879984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63804580-arno-mosikyan,4,"EXCERPTSThe essence of the answer lies in a quip that the physicist Richard Feynman made to the novelist Herman Wouk when they were discussing the Manhattan Project. Wouk was doing research for a big novel he hoped to write about World War II, and he went to Caltech to interview physicists who had worked on the bomb, one of whom was Feynman. After the interview, as they were parting, Feynman asked Wouk if he knew calculus. No, Wouk admitted, he didn’t. “You had better learn it,” said Feynman. “It’s the language God talks.”In any case, it’s a mysterious and marvelous fact that our universe obeys laws of nature that always turn out to be expressible in the language of calculus as sentences called differential equations. Such equations describe the difference between something right now and the same thing an instant later or between something right here and the same thing infinitesimally close by.But why should the universe respect the workings of any kind of logic, let alone the kind of logic that we puny humans can muster? This is what Einstein marveled at when he wrote, “The eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.”Eugene Wigner meant in his essay “On the Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences” when he wrote, “The miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve.”The truly radical and distinctive move of calculus is that it takes this divide-and-conquer strategy to its utmost extreme—all the way out to infinity."
30,1328879984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901229-gary-moreau,4,"This is not intended to be a textbook on calculus. And, like a lot of calculus itself, it is and it isn’t - quite. It is, however, a book about the history of calculus, which is fascinating, and the degree to which the universe seems to have been coded in a way that calculus seems to have an uncanny ability to explain is, well, somewhat inexplicable.But as the author notes in the beginning, “For reasons nobody understands, the universe is deeply mathematical. Maybe God made it that way. Or maybe it’s the only way a universe with us in it could be, because nonmathematical universes can’t harbor life intelligent enough to ask the question.” How often do you hear a Professor of Applied Mathematics, at an Ivy League school no less, say something even remotely so self-reflective?Steven Strogatz is a great communicator who is both a great mathematician and who, it is easy to tell, gets goose bumps every time he thinks about the wonders of calculus. I am not a professional mathematician but have always found mathematics to be both fascinating and, well, not easy, but very relatable. It’s predictable, and that’s comforting once you can see the pattern.If you don’t feel quite that way you may – spoiler alert – find this book to be a bit more like a textbook than advertised. There are plenty of equations and symbols and the like. That is, after all, the alphabet of calculus. But here’s the thing. Unless you are also a math professor, you can ignore all of that. Just go with the prose. It tells the same story, but in a far more relatable form to the average lover of the written word. Just ignore the symbols. If you do you will miss nothing and you will find the professor’s enthusiasm to be quite contagious. The beauty of the book is that it is written from a perspective of humility. Both in terms of the enormity of calculus (Most people will relate to the subject matter simply as science.), and in terms of how far we have yet to go in terms of truly understanding the universe and the reality that defines it. We’ve only explained the tip of the iceberg.Math is a human convention. It’s not hydrogen or oxygen. It’s not even dark matter, which we “know” makes up most of the universe but which no one has ever isolated, although the Chinese are close. It is very accurate at deciphering reality if getting close to the “real” explanation is close enough. But close is only close. It isn’t reality itself. Reality is, after all, by definition, real.That is, ultimately, the problem with the promise of AI. Because AI is ultimately dependent on calculus and other disciplines of mathematics, it will get very smart, but it will never be human. What it will do, however, if we let it, is dumb down what it means to be smart to a standard perfectly suited to its abilities but ignorant of its shortcomings.That’s why, despite the promises of the silicon gods, we are very unlikely to see fully autonomous vehicles for decades to come. The only way that could happen is if we take all human drivers off the road overnight (The AI isn’t the problem; it’s us. We are unpredictable.), switch every vehicle to an autonomous vehicle all at the same time, and rebuild our infrastructure to accommodate the vulnerabilities of the various disciplines of mathematics on which the technology is based. And that’s obviously not going to happen. Nor do we want it to.Pi, as but one example, despite what you were taught in school, is not a number; it’s a range. It’s a small range, to be sure, but it’s a range nonetheless. In other words, it is precise enough for most things, but it is NOT the fabric of the universe.Science is a methodology for understanding reality; it is not, in the most literal sense, reality itself. Reality is not “waiting” to be discovered. It is. And just as an artist can draw a landscape, science can draw reality. Neither, however, IS reality. The history of calculus is truly fascinating. And that, to me, as a reader, makes it entertaining. Newton and Galileo and all the rest were truly amazing people. It boggles the mind to think of what they concluded when they did. Perhaps the book’s greatest contribution, however, is that it will put Silicon Valley in perspective. You may think your smart phone has changed your life in ways that nothing else possibly could. You’re wrong. I am a great admirer of Steve Jobs but James Clerk Maxwell (a Scot in the 1860s) changed your life in ways that Steve did not come close to.And that is why this book is so timely. Calculus is changing our world, and not entirely in good ways. If ever we needed perspective we need it now. Math is elegant. It was designed that way. (Remember that it is not of the universe, like rain or sunshine.) And it does have an uncanny reliability that helps us to understand the world around us. Take GPS. We all use it. We all rely on it. But did you know that GPS is all about time, not navigation? Those GPS satellites don’t “see” you; they time you. It only works because scientists came to understand the mathematics of what we call time at a very precise level. That’s not reality, of course, because time is a concept (time, even as we understand it, varies with altitude), but it is close enough to give us GPS. And isn’t that an amazing thing.I think so. And that’s why I found this to be such an enjoyable book, beyond the fact that I am simply stimulated by really enthusiastic people and Professor Strogatz is one of the most enthusiastic people I have had the privilege to read in a really long time.If, on the other hand, you prefer a good murder mystery, or something with a little romance, at least, you won’t find it in this book. But that’s just my opinion. A little like pi, if you will. Pretty accurate, but not reality itself.Decide for yourself. You won’t be wasting your time."
31,1328879984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55091211-matt-person,4,"I think this book probably works best as a companion to a first year Calculus student. It's very well written and definitely elucidates some of the trickier concepts present in a first year course such as ""harnessing the power of infinity"" to deduce the area under a curve. If you're kind of getting the math behind Calculus but not really feeling motivated to put the work in, or maybe just getting over the hump of having faith it works, this volume is definitely a really solid reinforcement. I feel like that is the scope of the text and it serves its purpose very well. It's maybe not so interesting for the engineer who has already seen the math applied many times, and I'm sure a bona fide mathematician could skim this, but that's okay. The engineer/mathematician in me has a MILD problem with Strogatz treating speed and velocity as synonyms. I understand the simplicity gained by doing so, and I understand that in the context of pure mathematics this is often done, but the fact that the book also delves heavily into sine waves (circular motion), 3 dimensional motions, and even mentions vector fields leads me to believe that the distinction between vector and scalar quantities needs to at least casually be made."

We’ve seen that happen again and again, but it still seems almost miraculous.”This is my kind of popular science (or in this case, mathematical) writing: full of clear and well-thought-out explanations, written with contagious enthusiasm by someone with an obvious passion for their subject, and structured around a historical narrative including philosophical digressions on the nature of scientific enquiry as well as fascinating biographical details. (As well as wanting to read more about Newton’s life, I came away curious about two pioneering female mathematicians that Strogatz praises highly, Sofia Kovalevskaya and Mary Cartwright.) I had to force myself to concentrate rather than just skimming over the most technical sections, and even when I did, some of my insights were of the understand-it-in-the-moment-and-then-immediately-forget-it variety, but I was still left with a renewed appreciation for the elegance and power of calculus. Also, as other reviewers have pointed out, how can you criticize a book that includes instructions for calculating the speed of light using a microwave and a handful of grated cheese?"

Even for those of us who know Calculus (and even have taught it) it offers a very interesting perspective on the most fundamental and beautiful ideas. Passages about the ideas and work of Archimedes, Galileo, Newton and Liebnitz were specially enjoyable. Most the examples of applications of Calculus are interesting and well chosen.It is really a pity that most mathematics courses often are perceived by students as just a disconnected list of ideas and formulas, I guess it will be far more interesting to read this book like this and understand the fundamental ideas than doing lots of mechanical operations just because they are easier to grade."

Like my GR friend who recommended it, I never took calculus in high school and to say math wasn't my strong suit is putting it mildly. So this book really helped me understand WHAT calculus is and HOW it's used in the real world. It is definitely written for the lay person (people like me) but even so I couldn't finish it before it was due back at the library, where to my surprise there was a healthy wait list. Who da' thunk? My primary reason though for not finishing it was me. Even though it was written in an interesting way with examples even I could follow, it still required concentrated reading. More concentrated reading than I was willing to give it. I probably would have been better off reading an in-depth article by the same author. Still, I recommend it!"

Since my dad was reading it though, I read further, and was rewarded - at least initially.At its best, this book tells some fascinating history surrounding major mathematical figures and their circumstances, which is a joy to read. I particularly enjoyed reading about contemporaries Descartes and Fermat, and their resulting rivalry. More typically, it provides a gentle and approachable introduction by way of analogies to the core concepts of calculus. At its worst, and sadly far too often, it bludgeons the reader with proclamations of calculus as the most important thing simply because it has been used to solve a lot of real world problems (so has writing). Combined with a writing style reminiscent of the first edict provided to a child on essay writing: ""tell them what you're going to tell them, tell them, and finally tell them what you told them,"" this book became mightily cumbersome by the end. Despite some interesting tidbits and stories, it was work to finish, and not a particularly rewarding type either."

For its part, geometry gave algebra meaning. Equations were no longer sterile; they were now embodiments of sinuous geometric forms. A whole new continent of curves and surfaces opened up as soon as equations were viewed geometrically. Lush jungles of geometric flora and fauna waited to be discovered, cataloged, classified, and dissected.
Interleaves some explanations of the mathematical concepts with interesting biographical and historical background, and examples of how those concepts are important to modern technology. Pretty interesting and pretty successful at conveying the beauty and fascination of these concepts."

He gives a very accessible explanation of both Newton’s and Leibniz’s approach to the development of the mathematics now called calculus.For the reader who doesn’t want to follow along with the math, “Infinite Powers” is still a very readable glimpse of the strength and beauty of the mathematical concepts.""Infinite Powers” will be tremendously useful in explaining to the high school students I teach why it is that calculus should make their hearts sing!I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book.

His latest book gives a history of calculus, a subject that turns many off from math. Strogatz does a great job giving a comprehensive history of calculus over time, including how ancient Greeks were tantalizingly close to its ""discovery"". Beyond the math, we learn about personalities - Newton vs Leibniz, Descartes vs Fermat, and other colorful personalities in the history of math and calculus. Strogatz also points out the important role of women mathematicians in the history of calculus - Sophie Germain in particular, but also Virginia Johnson of ""Hidden Figures"" fame, in applied math and calculus. Overall, this is a good book for those interested in the history of math, and also those who want a more accessible introduction to the foundations of calculus."

There is certain magic in calculus, but there is more in how humans have used this tool to uncover the secrets of our universe. But I guess you need to add some drama to sell a book. In any case, it is fascinating to discover the way Archimedes estimated the area of a circle, the three Zenon paradoxes, how to estimate the value of pi, the area of a parable sector, the retrograd movement of Mars, the laws of a pendulum, how longitude is estimated, the three Kepler laws, how Fermat invented the cartesian coordinates (and not Descartes) and the optimization techniques that we use today to compress signals..."

51,1328879984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56104661-mark,4,"Those who might have intended simply reading the introduction of Infinite Powers: How CALCULUS Reveals the Secrets of the Universe in order to decide whether or not to go further will find themselves with no decision to make, for author Steven Strogatz will already have them hooked! After chapter 1, he will be confidently reeling you in for the remainder of a journey through the history of what will turn out to be the mathematical topic of calculus. Strogatz will, however, with his bubbling passion and joy for the subject, easily convince readers that there is a lot more to calculus than just mere math.Readers’ minds, especially those without a natural bent for calculus, will be stretched across concepts such as infinity, infinitesimals, and infinite polygons in the early chapters, to writhing numbers of DNA, chaos, and wave phenomena towards the end of the book. Throughout the narrative, Strogatz does a careful job of hand-holding so that readers don’t suddenly get overwhelmed. His early explanation of differential calculus and integral calculus—the former being the breaking up of problems into an infinite number of pieces and solving the pieces, the latter being the reassembly of the pieces to solve the original problem—will stick indelibly with readers.The bulk of the text covers what Strogatz refers to as the “Three Central Problems of Calculus”: the forward problem (given a curve, find its slope everywhere); the backward problem (given a curve’s slope everywhere, find the curve; and the area problem (given a curve, find the area under it). He addresses these problems through successive chapters in a comprehensive, digestible, and entertaining way. Strogatz also does a good job of showing how some concepts we now take for granted in elementary math were at one time a huge deal. The two-dimensional xy-plane, for example, revolutionized calculus from the moment of its discovery!One important accomplishment of the author is to humanize the many aspects of calculus. Whether it’s describing the harnessing of infinity by Archimedes, or Einstein’s overturning of Newton’s conceptions of space and time, Strogatz pays ample homage to the great mathematicians throughout the ages. As well as the more familiar names of Galileo, Copernicus, Newton, Descartes, and Fermat, there are also Fourier, Kepler, Liebnitz, Bernouilli, and Laplace. The twenty-five-hundred-year breadth of the narrative covers the origins of calculus and brings it right up to modern times. And Strogatz keeps his illustrative examples entertaining with iconic figures such as The Beatles, astronaut John Glenn, and athlete Usain Bolt.The book’s subtitle is no idle boast, for Strogatz does indeed show the revelatory power of calculus from the earliest explorations of geometry in ancient Greece to its predictive capabilities for things unseen, such as gravitational waves. Along the way, we see the contributions of calculus touching most, if not all, academic disciplines—from philosophy, politics, and history, to technology, science, and human biology.In the language of calculus, Infinite Powers: How CALCULUS Reveals the Secrets of the Universe is both linear and nonlinear: linear in that it proceeds with sequential chapters that cover discrete areas of the subject, and nonlinear in that the chapters cooperate and connect with each other to enrich the larger overall story. The primary reason popular science books are popular is because of people like Mr. Strogatz, who are both talented scientists and gifted writers."
52,1328879984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104781119-william-bies,3,"Steven Strogatz is an applied mathematician at Cornell University who has risen to prominence in the past decades as a communicator with the general public, what many would suppose to be a thankless task owing to the poor knowledge of mathematics on the part of the typical person these days, even when educated, and to the inherent difficulty of conveying what mathematicians prize in their work. Strogatz, though, is eager to take on the challenge. His background as a noted researcher on dynamical systems and chaos theory (he has written a leading textbook in the field) outfits him well for the task, as it has acquainted him with a kind of mathematics that may be especially accessible to the layman. His most recent contribution, Infinite Powers, devotes itself to the calculus invented during the seventeenth century, which formed the groundwork of the early modern scientific revolution. Now, Strogatz has the disconcerting habit of using the word in an expansive sense, to mean everything comprised under what one would ordinarily refer to with the general term, analysis, but what’s in a name? Clearly, the calculus properly speaking was the driving force behind the development of modern analysis and mathematical physics.Strogatz does have a knack for putting complicated things into simple terms (perhaps too simple, for this reviewer). The curious reader will enjoy following his account of the history of mathematical ideas as they apply to calculus, embellished with elaborate explanations for the rank beginner. Those who know something about the material can read at another level, quickly but attuned to the author’s apt way of putting familiar, or in some cases, perhaps not-so-familiar things. One can discern the hand of the born teacher. This reviewer was pleased, for instance, by Strogatz’s retelling of what Newton means by fluents and fluxions, his observations on why integral calculus is harder than differential calculus (the former reduces to a global, the latter to a local problem) and his reconstruction of the historical path by which the young Newton solved integration by playing with power series. His summary of Leibniz’s career and comparison with Newton’s is also quite good.This book would be worth reading for a sole point, what Strogatz somewhat infelicitously terms the ‘infinity principle’. The problem-solving power of the calculus flows from its method of analysis and synthesis, so adroitly wielded by Newton; namely, one breaks the problem down into infinitely many small pieces, where it is easiest to analyze, then puts all the pieces back together again to yield the solution. Strogatz does a nice job of illustrating his infinity principle, in terms readily perceptible to the amateur, in the work of Archimedes, among others.Now, to some disappointments: Strogatz is not by any means an intellectual historian and, whereas his skillful presentations of elementary mathematics are polished and presumably helpful to learners, his remarks on general issues in the history of ideas are amateurish and do not go beyond the stereotypical. He has, apparently, read many, if not all, of the primary sources in mathematics and physics, but can scarcely have engaged in serious study of the history of philosophical or religious movements. Hence, one will miss in him the perspective on and incisive observations into the context and motivation of the scientific discoveries, such as one could expect as a matter of course from an eminent scholar such as Ernst Cassirer. Consult Strogatz for strokes of clarity in the exposition of technical matters and anecdotal history, little else, nothing having to do, say, with the genesis of ideas or epistemology or methodology in the philosophy of science. It will be best if Strogatz limit himself to his domain of expertise, in applied mathematics and allied scientific disciplines.This last comment prompts another reflection. The technological and engineering advances characteristic of our day were made possible by the advent of the calculus and Strogatz is in his native element when recounting them. Based on his curriculum vitae, however, as an applied mathematician, Strogatz cannot, in all likelihood, possess very much technical competence in the loftier realms of modern mathematics, such as abstract algebra, algebraic topology and geometry, differential geometry, functional analysis and so forth. These latter subjects constitute the research frontier and underlie the remarkable confluence between higher mathematics and mathematical physics that has emerged, meteorically, over recent decades. From what one can tell, the educated public would be keenly interested in participating as spectators in the developments taking place in fundamental physics, and the attendant controversy over the role of string theory versus loop quantum gravity or noncommutative geometry etc. Now, in this reviewer’s estimation, it is here only that the sheer intelligible beauty of mathematics comes to light and that scope is afforded to the genial imagination and inventiveness of the artist. The moral lesson: Strogatz can get one only so far, but is bound by his commitment to basic material to remain innocent of the most profound and wonderful aspects to be contemplated in the world of higher mathematics. If only some of those at the forefront of the state of the art would apply themselves to communication with the larger public, as Strogatz has faithfully done! Perhaps Edward Frenkel’s award-winning Love and math: The heart of hidden reality answers to what this reviewer is looking and hoping for!"
