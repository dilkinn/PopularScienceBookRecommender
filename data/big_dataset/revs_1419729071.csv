0,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"I really dislike conspiracy theories – in fact, few things make me angrier. The reason is that a conspiracy generally involves people plotting and planning and those people who are assumed to have the power to bring the conspiracy into effect generally have been shown in history to be pretty stupid – in fact, far too stupid to do the conspiracy and keep quiet about it. Conspiracy theories also tend to involve improbable leaps of faith along the way, you know, like the one that the US government was involved in bringing down the Twin Towers at 9/11. These theories become so convoluted and improbable that eventually it would be easier to just blame aliens.But the real reason I hate conspiracy theories is that a conspiracy implies that the bad shit that happens in our world is hidden from us by powerful elites – and the fact is that the really, really bad shit in our world isn’t hidden from us at all. I think conspiracy theories have an appeal to us because they basically pardon us for our inaction. How were we supposed to do something about stuff we didn’t even know was happening? – Damn you, you evil conspirators! But really, whether it be climate change, third world debt, HIV/AIDS, American gun laws, the Iraq war, the slaughter and man-made famine in Yemen, the pollution of our oceans, referring to fossil fuels as ‘freedom fuels’ (no, I didn’t make that one up, even though I wish I had https://www.sbs.com.au/news/us-rebran...) – none of this is hidden from us. None of this needs a conspiracy to explain it. All of the murder, all of the destruction, all of the ‘let’s end all life on the planet for a bit more money’ is done in broad daylight with our noses pushed right up into it. And all of this is a million times more terrifying than the idea that the US government blew up a couple of buildings. Yet we watch our nightly news, yawn, roll over and fall back to sleep.This book is about one of those non-conspiracies we sort of know about but do stuff all to fix. The way we treat women is so breathtakingly appalling it would be nice if there was some sort of conspiracy theory involved here to relieve us of our complicity. This book argues that how women are treated isn’t really due to the evil patriarchy, a bit like the Elders of Zion plotting the overthrow of the Tzar, but that how our society ignores women makes how they are treated inevitable. It says that many of the reasons that women are so badly treated in our society is because most of the people with power, most of the people who get to make the decisions that make a difference in the world, are men – and it isn’t that men consciously go out of their way to make life shit for women (even though you would have to wonder sometimes) but rather, they do this because they are men, and as such they design the world to work for them. And when that world simply doesn’t work for women, these men don’t even notice because they simply don’t inhabit the same world that women inhabit. There is no conspiracy theory required – just neglect, self-interest, and perhaps a little dose of wilful blindness based on those with power focused solely on their own needs.The author blames a lot of the problems here on gaps in the data. There were lots of things I didn’t know. I didn’t know that car crash dummies are mostly ‘male’ – particularly driver dummies – and that they are based on what you could call ‘middle man’, about the average in terms of weight and height and everything else. I didn’t know that many drugs that are often almost exclusively given to women (think antidepressants say) are often almost exclusively trialled on men. I didn’t know that Viagra could potentially help cure PMT, but that the drug companies don’t want to put it through the clinical trials to do this since it is such a profitable drug that if they find out it causes problems in women it might cause problems that would kill the goose that laid the golden egg. There are lots of examples here of instances of things like men getting free condoms and women not having access to sanitary products that just make your blood boil. When it is pointed out it is hard to not come to the conclusion that we men really are arseholes.This book gets depressing very quickly. There is just case after case of things that made me say, ‘Oh, for god’s sake – who makes this shit up?’ Like how women are often excluded from drug trails altogether because they have hormones that change over the month and so that might make testing the drug a bit more difficult. Which is a bit like designing trousers for men assuming they don’t have penises because, well, it just makes it easier. And before you laugh, the author gives at least half a dozen examples where things are poorly designed to fit women because women have the audacity to grow breasts. This is an infuriating book. We are effectively murdering women – in fact, often we are actually murdering women and too often we do this by paying no attention at all to the physiological, social, cultural and power differences that exist between the sexes. There was a bit early on in this book where I got a bit worried. She started to discuss the problems associated with women in academia – what has become my world – and while all of these problems are very, very real, I was worried that this book might end up a kind of ‘glass ceiling’ book. And after reading Feminism for the 99% A Manifesto – I’m going to have to get around to reviewing that eventually – I’m worried about ‘feminist’ books that only notice the issues that impact rich, white women. But this book brought intersectionality into its analysis too – you know, if you are black and female, you might want to travel out of the US to give birth, I’m just saying.This book ought to make you angry. 	Not least because the answer to many of the problems identified would simply involve listening to women. I knew many of the things discussed here. For instance, that many more women than men died in the tsunami in 2004. The reason? Women look after children and old people, women are often in locations where they can’t hear the warnings signals, women are less likely to learn to swim, women are less likely to learn to climb trees, women are constrained by ‘modesty’ in clothes that make escaping rising water almost impossible – and if they do escape they are likely to be raped and possibly bashed by men. If you are not made angry by this book you have no humanity left. But the solution is often also painfully simple. We need to listen to women. We need to place them in positions of power. We need to involve them in decision making processes that impact them. I know, radical ideas, but we might as well start big and work down from there.The instance that will stay with me from this book was about public transport – it had just never occurred to me. Most public transport users are women. Men drive cars, women catch the bus. But public transport systems are designed by men. So, they are designed to radiate out from the centre of cities – much like fingers splayed out from the palm of a hand. Which is great for men going to work and then back home again – but not so great for women who might need to get the kids off to school, check on their aging parents, and then work in three part-time jobs that are close enough to home to collect the kids again from school, all of which might not be in a direct line into the centre of the city. Public transport systems are designed by men to suit the needs of men, but are mostly used by women, and so often don’t meet the needs of the majority of its users. Shit like that has really got to stop.Thanks Avolyn for recommending this to me."

However EVERYONE should read this at some point, it looks at things that I had never even considered, genuinely brilliant.Second Read- so.... my Feminist bookclub have this on the list, so gave it a reread- just as goddamn rage inducing on the second read."
3,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"Simply said, if someone is in power, he tries to make a policy that meets his wishes and reflects the image of the society, company, etc he wants to build. This can be done in a direct, evil way by treating minorities, women, atheists, etc. with repression until imprisonment, torture and death if they misbehave and in these cases, it is an obvious crime. It gets more subtle when bigotry and indoctrination kick in and lead to both politicians and managers that are not all direct, misogynic sexists. That would either fit the requirements their spin doctors taught them for winning the next election nor the code of conduct, corporate responsibility or whatever ethic mumbo jumbo the PR department has in planning. Those white, rich man's minds have been poisoned by influences of faith, elitist thinking and inhumanity and many of them simply had no chance to get out of this vicious cycle, because it makes no difference if it is a cult, an extremist group or a billionaires club, they are all pretty misguided and pitiful. The worst case, both for women and for the possibility to real change, are those who believe that they are doing the right thing and would call themselves emancipated but keep on pushing laws and employment contracts that discriminate against women indirectly and perfidiously. They don´t give any kind of appreciation, allowance or financial help to mothers without whose immense pain and effort each nation would die out because no kids would be born anymore. They don´t give a dollar for all the unpaid work, the caring for toddlers and especially care-dependent elders and without this, the health system would simply collapse. There are medicinal research areas that are taught, shaped and mainly tested on man. It is a simple economic reason why men are preferred in all kinds of long going and very expensive admission procedures for drugs because they don´t get pregnant and have no staggering hormone levels. The result is that many side effects may cause much more harm in women because they haven´t been tested in such large numbers or anyway. The same questions plops up with the harmfulness of, well, anything, like any kind of food additive, environmental toxins and the regulatory limits. Tested and found harmless for men with an official quality seal. Tested with younger and older women with different hormone levels, muscle mass and probably pregnancy? ""Nope, would have been too difficult and expensive, sorry, nobody does that, probably in Amazon wonderland, but not here."" There are no numbers available regarding the side effects of all drugs, environmental destruction and food risks, but let's say that there may be an unknown number of women that would have profited from clean 50 male/ 50 female test series instead of dying. I find it really difficult to decide if the simple, logical, economic greed is more disgusting than the reminiscences and aftermaths of all those very old, sexist writings by weird old men. Those two axes of evil certainly exponentiate each other, learn from each other and produce the right social and consumer products for him who unofficially still deems women inferior. In design, the number of toilets is a prime example of male domination. This is not deadly, in contrast to using crash test dummies that are normed as male or giving free condoms and restricting female contraception, but an instance of simply forgetting that there is another gender out there. Or designing public transport in a way that makes it impossible to do more than just manly things like driving from home to work and back and not caring about things like groceries, kids and stuff. It would also be more expensive to tailor clothes that fit better at hips and breasts, so it simply isn´t done. As much talk as there is about gendering, sexual harassment, eating disorders, etc. so less is heard about those topics in mainstream media. Those would probably bash the religious groups as long as the broadcast corporation doesn´t belong to the Kraken. But they wouldn´t even touch the economic problems with pincers and gloves, cause they all are very dependent on the companies advertising their products. There are no men in general to blame, but a society and upbringing that makes them so blind to the different necessities of half of the population that their work, publications and statistics get highly subconscious biased, onesided, dangerous and often even deadly, as seen in medicine, especially pharmacy, one of the sickest examples of misleading science I have ever seen, especially because it is so obvious and could be easily prevented. ""This is a men biased world"", one could sing and yes, the so-called strong gender built the whole world with a focus on efficiency, profit or prestige and didn´t listen, care or even think of the needs of all their wives, mothers, sisters and daughters. And they inherited this behavior to their sons instead who live in a world of big data with algorithms, AI and immense potential to use all those tools to improve life for all people, but instead, as daddy taught them, they simply ignore, forget or, the easiest way, don´t even evaluate the data about women to jump in their money storage instead and let gold coins softly recoil from their bald head (from daddy too) producing a hollow sound from a skull just filled with .... By empowering women, making a strict law to make half of each government and management leadership ranks half female, make all research transparent with tools like blockchain and dumping direct and indirect sexism in the trash can of history right next to all the other sick ideas out of white men's heads.This is another great book about the topic:https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4...I like to talk about WEIRD and the topic is a prime example of it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychol...A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real-life outside books:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biashttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%2...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancip...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminismhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexismhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violenc...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminiz...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employm...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereot...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intra-h...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unpaid_...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuati...Categorieshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categor...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categor...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categor...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categor...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of..."
4,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11862210-gwen,5,"This is a book about unconscious bias. It's not about men deliberately excluding women when considering things like uniforms, city travel, or treatments for medical conditions ... although it's true that once the bias is pointed out, it's not always top of the list to make safety adjustments. And that's really one of the most important points of the book: it endangers women if you design and build the world without considering women's needs and habits. Women are built in a particular way, and they are socially conditioned in a particular way, and they're treated in a particular way - comparing all this to men's situation is useful only to a certain extent because it is so easy for everyone to slip into the mindset that men are the default human, and women are, as the author notes, ""niche"". We design things for people, but really only think of men and their needs because - and companies and designers are open about this - women are harder, with our non-linear bodies and hormones meaning that more sophisticated (and more expensive) research needs to be done.We also design things for men because men are the designers for the most part. They have no experience being women of course, and don't really look into it because, for the most part, it doesn't occur to them. If you're a woman, just think about all the books you've read through the years about male experience, with a male protagonist, and presented - or even taught - to you as ""human experience"". We do it all the time, and I read books regularly with male protagonists sorting out their stuff (if you follow me here, you'll see plenty of ex-Navy-SEALS running around). But women's experience in novels and poems? That's women's experience only. My point here is that while women are trained to identify with both men and women, and indeed possibly favor the male experience, men aren't trained to look at - or think about - women's experience. Criado Perez has really done her research, but what could have been a very statistic-heavy book is in fact very readable, engaging, and so enlightening. The Introduction should really be published on its own - it's magnificent. This is a book to buy and keep, and get some of those sticky notes because you'll want to mark pages for future reference!"
5,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78771640-rob,3,"I don't know who would possibly want a man's opinion on a book about the problems with male default bias, but... here's my review.This is essentially a collection of statistics which entail how systems made by men and for men are minimizing and marginalizing the other 50% of the population. It does this by breaking the statistics down into chapter-spanning categories and creating a cohesive narrative to explain how all of these events are related and come back to the same basic problem.I would recommend this book to any man who identifies as ""not sexist."" Because this makes it clear that even treatment that men believe is fair, un-sexist, and in the best interest of women, is still entirely subjective to their inherently male worldview. This book really shook up my views on what equal consideration for both men and women should look like. To anyone who thinks, ""Why can't women be more like men,"" or that women should follow the exact same rules and be given the exact same treatment, read this book. You will develop a very thorough understanding of how, both now and historically, one-size-fits-all rules generally conflate what favors society as a whole with what favors the men who write them. Consequently, equal consideration to both men and women often requires unequal treatment, because, surprising as this may be to many men, women don't necessarily have the same needs.I listened to the audiobook, which happens to be narrated by the author. This, I think, was a huge benefit, as the tones and inflections of the author convey the feeling and intended meaning of every word. This does, of course, mean that the author's (understandably) frustrated bias often comes through in the subtext, but I think that's important in order to glean not only the data and statistics, but an actual woman's perspective on them. It doesn't blur the actual data being presented, so I think the book is better for it.My one complaint is that the information in this book was borderline overwhelming. A majority of the content entails half-hour cascades of one statistic after another, and I found that my proverbial eyes would glaze over occasionally and I would have to back up and try again. This is unfortunately inevitable, as there are only so many ways to convey this information to the reader. It also draws to light the sheer volume of the unconscious and invisible discriminations that happen every day, and I commend the author's ability to gather and present them so entirely. Another side effect of the volume of information is that I don't feel particularly empowered to personally incite a change. I often found myself nodding along with most of the book, but I'm left feeling very unclear as to what to do next. I do, however, believe that I am armed with facts that I didn't have before, and I can use this knowledge to call out the injustices that occur within my sphere of influence.As a whole, most of this book felt like a persuasive essay along the lines of, ""You want proof that male privilege exists, that most systems of governance are biased toward men, and that women are literally dying because of it? Well here's your proof.""And the proof is appalling. Point taken."
6,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34428697-joanne-harris,0,"This is a long-delayed, hugely important book, which people of ALL genders should be reading. Sadly, more people seem to be discussing it than have actually read it. It's not just about crash test dummies, or voice recognition software, or airline seats, or toilet queues, or medical research. It's about the systematic way in which data on women has been ignored, neglected and downright erased, whereas data on men is not only abundant, but recognized as the universal norm. The needs of the ""average person"" boil down to the needs of the *average man*, and though not all men *are* average, there's still an enduring attitude that male is a default position and female, an aberration. I found myself recognizing so many situations depicted in this book - things I thought that only I had experienced, but which turn out to be common to pretty much all women, whether they're aware of it or not. Read this, and you'll start noticing inequalities you never even considered before. And you'll notice them everywhere. "
7,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39626084-lior,1,"This is a really good comprehensive investigation of how a failure to account for gender based needs and requirements results in a bias towards cis men.This is exactly why the casual cissexism embedded in it is so unfortunate and harmful.Perez critics the continuous overlooking of women and women's needs, but is herself continuously overlooking trans and nonbinary people. She also keeps switching between sex and gender as interchangeable.The most problematic claim is that a lack of sex-segregated bathrooms in some places increases rape and sexual assault. This is clearly focusing on the wrong aspect of a problem, while creating new problems for people who don't fit the norm. It is extremely disappointing in the context of shedding light on how women are seen as a deviation of the cis male norm, who is seen as default.A critical book published in 2019 which deals with gender cannot ignore trans folks. It is simply not good enough to address cis people exclusively in such a comprehensive book.Hope there will be a better, more inclusive edition soon, as it is highly important this kind of information be accessible for all."
8,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista,5,"Invisible Women is the story of what happens when we forget to account for half of humanity. It is an exposé of how the gender data gap harms women when life proceeds, more or less as normal. In urban planning, politics, the workplace. It is also about what happens to women living in a world built on male data when things go wrong. When they get sick. When they lose their home in a flood. When they have to flee that home because of war.My husband is not a knuckle-dragging caveman, but he is a middle-aged, white, Canadian male, totally oblivious to the privileges afforded to him by our society (admittedly, many of those privileges are granted to me as well). We were in the car, listening to the radio over the summer, and “It's a Man's World” began to play. Dave chuckled and said, “Boy, things have changed, eh?” And I replied: “And boy, have they stayed the same.” And this stunned him. “You can't believe that,” he said. “Here's a story for you then. A young girl at work...” I cut him off. “Young girl? What, is she eight or nine?” And then he was flustered. “You know what I mean. I'm just trying to tell you a nice story.” He paused like he was going to punish me by not telling me the story after all but soon continued: “Rebecca, who is probably twenty-five and on my team, was asked by HR to assemble some slides for a presentation on the industry and she asked me if she could present it to me first. She reads off the first slide, which is about the gender pay gap, and before she went to the next slide she frowned, looked at her notes, and said, 'This is probably American data.' Because she knows that there's no gender pay gap in our office, and if anything, there are more women than men in senior positions, and more women on a management track.” He looked proud of himself – and he should, I know that this non-caveman, the father of my daughters, is not a sexist or a chauvinist – but still I pushed my point: “If this had been a twenty-five year old male in your story, would you have started off with, 'This young boy at work...?' Because that's what hasn't changed, and no matter what you consciously do to promote the careers and the welfare of the women you know, it's the subconscious biases that are harder for us to navigate because you don't even know what you're doing that's holding us back.” Dave, “shocked” to discover I felt this way, wanted more details about these “subconscious biases” of which I accused him. And while women know that the systems are rigged against us, it's hard to be specific – until now. Caroline Criado Perez has assembled a collection of shocking and eye-opening stories in Invisible Women, very clearly making the point that men, for the most part, aren't consciously trying to hold women back; for the most part, men don't think about women, and the fact that our needs might differ from their own, at all. From medicine to safety devices to public transit, everything is designed and tested to suit the typical male's body and needs, with women's very different bodies and needs considered niche or secondary or “the same but smaller”. It is mostly about the gender data gap: the fact that nearly all studies and research, even medical testing, isn't disaggregated by sex, so there is next to no data about how anything in our societies, which tend to be designed by men for men, affects women differently than men. And where this is no data, a thing – in this case, women – is in effect invisible to those who do the planning – in most cases, men. Informative, shocking, and usefully prescriptive, Invisible Women is a must read for men and women everywhere.The specifics are fascinating – dysmenorrhea (extremely painful periods) was found to be completely alleviated without side effects in the early stages of Viagra testing, but its manufacturer stopped that direction of testing when it found the drug's more profitable application; women in police forces and armies around the world are forced to wear male body armour that doesn't account for breasts and hips and therefore leaves them vulnerable to attack and more prone to workplace injury (a female police officer in Spain was disciplined for acquiring her own made-for-women bulletproof vest); NGOs tend to ask the male heads of household what is required in the aftermath of a disaster, which has, more than once, led to the construction of homes without kitchens in them – but it would take a book-length review to list everything fascinating in this book. I'll just add some of Criado Perez's conclusions regarding the invisibility of women in public planning:
When planners fail to account for gender, public spaces become male spaces by default. The reality is that half the global population has a female body. Half the global population has to deal with the sexualised menace that is visited on that body. The entire global population needs the care that, currently, is mainly carried out, unpaid, by women. These are not niche concerns, and if public spaces are truly to be for everyone, we have to start accounting for the lives of the other half of the world. And, as we've seen, this isn't just a matter of justice; it's also a matter of simple economics.
The invisibility of women in the workplace:
Women have always worked. They have worked unpaid, underpaid, underappreciated, and invisibly, but they have always worked. But the modern workplace does not work for women. From its location, to its hours, to its regulatory standards, it has been designed around the lives of men and is no longer fit for purpose. The world of work needs a wholesale redesign – of its regulations, of its equipment, of its culture – and this redesign must be led by data on female bodies and female lives.
And the invisibility of women in the political sphere:
The data we already have makes it abundantly clear that female politicians are not operating on a level playing field. The system is skewed towards electing men, which means that the system is skewed towards perpetuating the gender gap in global leadership, with all the attendant negative repercussions for half the world's population. We have to stop willfully closing our eyes to the positive discrimination that currently works in favour of men. We have to stop acting as if theoretical, legal equality of opportunity is the same as true equality of opportunity. And we have to implement an evidence-based electoral system that is designed to ensure that a diverse group of people is in the room when it comes to deciding on the laws that govern us all.
The first step to true equality of opportunity and outcome would be to close this gender data gap – wherever there is evidence of inequality, decent people do tend to advocate for change – but this will take more women in decision-making roles (it's disheartening to read of the many researchers who can't get grants to study issues that affect only women as they are too “niche”) and that takes time. I remember back in the 80s my mother complaining that the medical world tended to treat women like small men instead of maybe, just maybe, something not the same as men. So, yeah, that was a long time ago and it's still a man's world."

10,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,4,"I decided to read ‘Invisible Women’ after coming across an extract from it in the Guardian and associated discussion on twitter. Both focused on how practically everything is designed for the mythical ‘average man’. I'm very aware of this due to being only 5ft tall. I cannot reach any overhead racks in trains, hanging straps in buses, or top shelves in supermarkets. I’ve given up on backpacks because they’re never comfortable and find smart phones incredibly unwieldy to use, one of many reasons I hate them. The desk and chair I work in are too high for me to sit comfortably, so I have to adjust my posture all the time. Constant minor inconveniences of this kind are something I’ve just learned to live with. Such relatively trivial examples are useful to highlight a much more serious point: the world is still largely designed by and for men. Perez considers the impact of this in a variety of specific areas including politics and healthcare, repeatedly highlighting the lack of data on women’s experiences and need for this to understand and improve them. While I found the book very readable, after a while this started to feel slightly more like a weakness than a virtue. By this I mean that any given section could be lifted out and published as a high quality thinkpiece. Perez cites more supporting evidence than most, however I felt that the book had rather a loose thesis and didn't make very strong suggestions for solutions. Perhaps I am merely quicker to blame capitalism than she is? (I tend to blame capitalism for practically everything - probably because practically everything is capitalism’s fault.) For example, one chapter criticises GDP as an inaccurate measure of economic activity, which it is, then suggests economic growth could be achieved by encouraging more women into paid work through better childcare and tax policy. This felt like a rather simplistic summary of the many flaws in GDP, notably its disregard of environmental costs, and of women in work, as underpaid bullshit jobs aren't necessarily liberating. That said, I share her incredulity that big pharma has no interest in researching period pain and PMS. So many women, including myself, would pay good money on a regular basis for some over-the-counter solution to the nightmare of periods. Nurofen just doesn’t cut it and GPs have little to offer. Come on, markets, supply a good to meet our needs! To put my griping in context: I found the book well-argued and written, however it is definitely a piece of longform journalism rather than a work of feminist economics, politics, or theory. Personally, I would have preferred a bit more depth over breadth. That is just my preference, though, and it would be very unfair to criticise the book for not being something it never claimed to be. The topic is vast and Perez has chosen a good range of examples to illustrate key areas. Thus it’s very depressing to read if you regularly experience what it describes. This hit me particularly hard, as it summarises my first year as a junior lecturer:But their unpaid work inside the workplace doesn’t help either. When students have an emotional problem, it is their female professors, not their male professors, they turn to. Students are also more likely to request extensions, grade boosts, and rule-bending of female academics. In isolation, a request of this kind isn’t likely to take up much time or mental energy - but they add up, and they constitute a cost on female academics’ time that male academics mostly aren’t even aware of, and that universities don’t account for. [...] The inequity of women being loaded with less valued work is compounded by the system for evaluating this work, which is itself systematically biased against women. [...] Less effective male professors routinely receive higher student evaluations than more effective female teachers. Students believe that male professors hand marking back more quickly - even when that is impossible because it’s an online course delivered by a single lecturer, but where half the students are led to believe that the professor is male and half female. Female professors are penalised if they aren’t deemed sufficiently warm and accessible. But if they are warm and accessible they can be penalised for not appearing authoritative or professional. On the other hand, appearing authoritative and knowledgeable as a woman can result in student disapproval, because this violates gendered expectations. Meanwhile men are rewarded if they are accessible at a level that is simply expected in women and therefore only noticed if its absent.You really can’t win in academia. Anecdotally, I’ve observed a pattern of senior male professors taking on postgraduate supervisees, then being so inaccessible that these orphan students turn to more junior female professors for guidance. Rather than tell such students to send their supervisor another email I try to help them, effectively taking on work that’s being shirked by men paid twice as much as me. The book didn’t just cover sexism that I was already aware of on a daily basis. The chapter on international development and disaster response was eye-opening and, inevitably, deeply depressing. Perez recognises the important racial as well as gendered elements there and at other points, which is helpful. I found her introductory definitions of sex and gender rather unsatisfactory, though. They are unnecessarily biologically essentialist, and thus surprisingly old-fashioned in tone. This doesn’t undermine Perez’s arguments as such, but it’s a bit disappointing as with only slight editing they could have been much more inclusive. Regarding exciting new manifestations of sexism, I really liked the discussion of how automation via algorithms amplifies bias in training datasets. It’s interesting to compare Perez’s suggestion of more granular data-gathering and rigorous testing of algorithms with the fundamental critique of Zuboff’s The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power. There’s a lot more to be said about how crude and reductive data mining can be; sexism is by no means the only form of inequality that can be reproduced through automation. By looking for correlations in big data without any interest in causation, analytics will find gendered behaviour patterns without providing any explanation for why they might differ, let alone whether these differences are fair. I’d highly recommend ‘Invisible Women’ to men as a readable evidence base for 21st century gender inequality. I’d recommend it to women with the caveat that it’s a reminder of the many ways that being female sucks (albeit to different degrees depending on ethnicity, wealth, nationality, etc). The Guardian extract is an accurate representation of the book as a whole - it has the readability and passion of high quality journalism, without the systematic insight of more academic work."
11,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43708514-candie,5,"Eye opening!!! So interesting to see how deep inequality really goes systemically. I mean you know it does, but I've never looked at it through the eyes of all of this data before, or lack there of. It discusses a lot of topics that are not generally talked about when people are talking about gender inequality. Areas that you have never even thought about; for example things like snow removal, public transportation, how public bathrooms are designed. Some of the things discussed are life threatening, like the symptoms for a heart attack or the use of crash test dummies, but some are less so. However, when all of this data to all of these situations are added up, it can become very life threatening as it leads to a very large gap between genders. Very interesting. Also, keep in mind that although this book has many stories added in to make it quite readable, it is still a book based around data. I do think it is a very important read though as it discusses data and solutions that otherwise would likely not be discussed as they are so ingrained into our society we usually don't even notice. There is no one person making these rules that we can just blame and fight against; there are so many subconscious biases in all areas of our lives, and this book really points out so many. Definitely recommend as it is a great starting place to identifying the areas that need improvement."

In comes @ccriadoperez excellent book that I recommend everyone to read especially all of you engaged in designing and creating spaces within society to check your understanding of your own bias. We are all biased, but if you start to consider your bias as the truth then that’s an issue.

19,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1170391-sara,4,"ARC received in exchange for an honest review 👱‍♀️Incredibly interesting and insightful, 'Invisible Women' explores the often forgotten yet rife data bias in gender. Throughout culture, male biased opinions and ideas form the basis of societal thought and influence - leading to a disadvantage for women in all aspects of their life. It's a disadvantage you may not even be aware of or tend to brush off as a daily inconvenience. It's the shelves in the supermarket that are too high because they've been designed by a male, around average male heights. It's the long queues at the female toilets because they're the same size as the men's - even though they require less stalls.And its also the hidden, deadlier costs. The higher car deaths for women because of the use of male ergonomically configured cars and crash test dummies. The higher rate of death from heart attacks because women do not show the 'typical' male symptoms and end up being misdiagnosed. The drug trials that exclude women entirely because their hormones make results less reliable, resulting in drugs only being used that have been tested and designed for the male anatomy.This really opened my eyes to the numerous amount of bias that women are besieged by every single day, in every aspect of their lives. Women still aren't prioritised. We're still the 'lesser sex' and unjustly represented as a result. We're erased from history, we're pushed out of politics, and we're literally dying because of our gender. I felt such injustice reading this. I feel in this day and age we can all be quite blasé about women's rights. We think that we're getting a better deal than our predecessors - but this book just proves how little progress we've actually made. We need to be heard. To be listened to. Because we are women. We're complicated and messy and different from men, and we should never have to compromise for our gender.I will say that at times the writing does get a little 'dry' and bogged down in statistics, however the passion in the writing along with the astounding amount of research that has gone into the text is enough for me to highly recommend this to everyone. It will truly open your eyes and make you question all aspects of your life for gender bias. "
20,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38530619-britta-b-hler,5,Everybody should read this.
21,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2431873-emily,4,"This is a wide-ranging and thoroughly enraging study of how the world is explicitly designed around men. I think it's very easy to understand, at a high level, that societies are patriarchal and that sexism exists. It's another thing to look at each of the assumptions that undergird specific examples of men as the default, and to look at the (frankly) terrible outcomes that industries and areas provide for women as a result. Did you know that EU car manufacturers do not have to pass any crash tests with female crash-dummies before their products are put on the market? Coincidentally, women are 17% more likely to die in a car crash. You can decide for yourself if the two are connected.Criado Perez divides the book into three sections or themes: the female body, the unpaid care burden that women provide, and male violence against women. She argues that these three areas are not experienced by men and are thus the most likely to be overlooked or underappreciated. Some examples:- Women are more likely to ""trip-chain,"" or combine many stops into one journey. Much of public transportation is built for point A to point B travel: men go to work and go back. There's an implicit assumption that work and home life are separate. Businesses are in one place, and homes in another. Women have to work around this reality when planning a route - how to get children to daycare, pick up groceries, and so on. The infrastructure is simply not built for this and adds an inordinate amount of time to these trips, if the routes even exist.- 75% of unpaid work is performed by women, who spend between three to six hours per day on activities such as childcare, elder care, and housework, while men average between 30 minutes and 2 hours. This is an astonishing statistic when you recognize that most of those women also work full-time jobs. Criado Perez makes a credible argument for including domestic work in GDP. For instance, we see creation and sales of ready-made meals or laundry services as adding production to the economy, but that productivity hasn't appeared from nowhere - the work is simply being accounted for, as it's no longer on the shoulders of unpaid women.- Maternity leave, everyone's favorite issue to argue about, is also represented. I can't even count the number of men (and women!) in my life who have said that it's unfair for businesses to have to cover for women who go on leave, that it's a simple reality that work must go on. I think this is always a question of the larger society that we want to live in. Maternity leave has a positive impact on women's participation in the paid labor market; if women could engage in the paid labor force at the same rate as men, a 2015 McKinsey study estimates that global GDP would grow by $12 trillion. And when men take paternity leave, women's future earnings increase. - Medical studies are typically performed when women are in the earliest phase of the menstrual cycle, when hormone levels are low and the effects of estrogen and progesterone may be minimized. In other words, good luck getting antihistamines, antipsychotics, or antibiotics to work for you when you're in a different part of the menstrual cycle. Pretty tough, since women ingest 80% of pharmaceuticals in the US. And still, men who report pain are more likely to receive pain medication, while women are more likely to receive sedatives or antidepressants. Because the book is so wide-ranging, it at times reads like a laundry list of statistics and is quite dense. You may have also already read some of the content online - the car test section was excerpted quite widely. But this is still worth reading, and is important as a starting point for any discussion about how to begin to account for the lopsided representation of women. Criado Perez takes the time to note that, in many cases, these assumptions and outcomes are borne out of millenia of treating white men as the standard. They aren't malicious, but they are pernicious. She also mentions that we are beginning to encode these assumptions into the algorithms and programs that increasingly run our lives (Apple's Siri is a woman, and in 2016 Google's speech-recognition software was 70% more likely to recognize male speech). Too often, we think about software development and algorithms as neutral endeavors that produce the ""right"" outcomes - but that can't be true when the algorithms are based on a long-standing set of biases (see Weapons of Math Destruction for more). In essence, we are not only starting from a deficit in terms of equity for women, but we are continuing to entrench existing biases into the products that we are creating right now. And what's the way to begin to correct this? Well, quite simply, you could put women in the discussion. Even if you don't buy every single statistic in this book, it certainly could not do any harm. And it would likely improve the lives of the millions of people who just happen to be women.
But why should we accept that the way men do things, the way men see themselves, is the correct way? Recent research has emerged showing that while women tend to assess their intelligence accurately, men of average intelligence think they are more intelligent than two-thirds of people.

22,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10592271-brokentune,5,"Utterly brilliant.What an infuriating, thought-provoking, well-researched, well-presented investigation into the gender data gap and the problems this causes with respect to women being represented in all parts of life. The breadth and level of detail that the author covers is fantastic. The referencing to research alone makes this book stand out for me as it does back up what often is communicated as anecdotal evidence - i.e. is usually disputable - with something far more concrete. The statistics are staggering and infuriating. Not as maddening, tho, as the apparent apathy towards the gender data gap - i.e. the lack of data based on women.For example, medical research is mostly done using men. The results are then applied to all people as if there were no biological differences in how treatments and medications work, which is mad because there are differences. Criado-Perez covers too many aspects of life to list, but her argument - and it is a strong argument - boils down to this: There is a lack of data that not only includes women (of which there seems to be a severe lack) but there is an equal and related lack of data that actively differentiates results to data collected based on men. And this lack of data and the lack of even acknowledgement that this data is important is one of the main reasons that we still cannot speak of gender equality, even in what people refer to as the developed world.I'm so glad my colleague lent this to me.I have also just ordered my very own copy so I can lend it to other people.Failing to collect data on women and their lives means that we continue to naturalise sex and gender discrimination – while at the same time somehow not seeing any of this discrimination. Or really, we don’t see it because we naturalise it – it is too obvious, too commonplace, too much just the way things are to bother commenting on. It’s the irony of being a woman: at once hyper-visible when it comes to being treated as the subservient sex class, and invisible when it counts – when it comes to being counted.There is one more trend I kept coming across while writing this book: the excuses. Chief amongst these is that women are just too complicated to measure. Everyone was saying this, from transport planners, to medical researchers, to tech developers: they were all knocking their heads up against Freud’s riddle of femininity and coming away baffled and defeated. Female bodies are too unharmonious, too menstrual and too hormonal. Women’s travel patterns are too messy, their work schedules are too aberrant, their voices are too high. Even when, in the early twentieth century, influential Swiss architect Le Corbusier was devising a standard human model for use in architecture, the female body was ‘only belatedly considered and rejected as a source of proportional harmony’, with humanity instead represented by a six-foot man with his arm raised (to reach that top shelf I can never reach).The consensus is clear: women are abnormal, atypical, just plain wrong. Why can’t a woman be more like a man? Well, apologies on behalf of the female sex for being so mysterious, but no, we aren’t and no we can’t. And that is a reality that scientists, politicians and tech bros just need to face up to. Yes, simple is easier. Simple is cheaper. But simple doesn’t reflect reality."

Quite simply, we do not exist.When I was 13 I adored reading Sherlock Holmes stories but I soon worked out that when a man refers to ‘people’ what he actually means is ‘other men’. Every single thing that impacts on the lives of women has actually been designed by men for the benefit of men. From cars to taxes, from medication to disaster relief time and time again women suffer, die and are sidelined because instead of being seen at 50% of the population we are simply seen as non-standard men."
25,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"'Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men"" by Carolyn Criado-Pérez spectacularly describes factually and scientifically every problem all women have in navigating every society in the world using scientific Big Data, and small data. Criado-Pérez goes deep describing the issues of Men thinking about Women and the results of that thinking: from physical safety to using tools/machines/weapons to difficulties in networking to harmful stereotypes to body-shaming. I was reminded of the problems people who are left-handed have in maneuvering in the world - social, religious, physical, legal and other built-in prejudices. Of course, the huge glaring difference between left-handers and women is that statistically women occupy 55% of the world's population and yet whose strengths and contributions STILL are ignored by societies, businesses, spouses and politicians. Statistically, men would rather destroy a society rather than allow women to participate as equals, or allow women to help themselves and solve the problems of women. The way men around the world seem to feel deep down (just saying as a figurative example and not at all as a real thing, of my impression of the Male Gaze upon Women from this book's real Big Data's serious Big Picture scientific analysis) as just my personal derived mental picture/illustration:Men would rather starve to death before asking a woman to tell them how to cook a meal or cook it himself. (I remind you this is just a mental-thought nightmare, gentle reader, to demonstrate the overall Big Picture of how generally Men see their relationship towards Women. I know many men cook.) The idea of a Man cooking for his family every day for all of his life span, three times a day, and to do it without compensation or reward or recognition - this idea of a man cooking food is more than simply an 'unnatural order of things' for Men - it might be a line which can never be crossed for men to be a Man - a line which has to be maintained to the point of death of ALL involved, since Male dictatorship over women must be maintained even if it means the utter and complete destruction of country, tribe, scientific advancement, and economic gain. If this 'fantasy' of how Men might feel they should be towards Women happened to exist - they might rather destroy all Mankind in the world by radiation from a nuclear war than allow a single woman any equality of rights or life freedoms to live as she chooses. Just saying, in extrapolating from actual history.Men have in real life all over the world, in every country, within every religion, in every community (much of what I point out below is my extrapolations from the more rigorously researched and academically accurate book):-have refused women health care because they are women, while providing themselves with easily available health care. Men make sure they can achieve tumescence, and their pride in making male babies is foremost over whatever state women are in medically, psychologically or financially. Men give themselves more and more women for sex, the younger the better, primary as long as she is menstruating - replacing female womb parts as if women were parts in a manufacturing process. Or, the opposite - insurance-paid condoms while refusing women insurance-paid birth control. Btw, Viagra is often an insurance-paid benefit, while menstrual pads, childcare and birth-control pills are not. For real. -Additionally, scientific studies and experiments use male mice, or male monkeys, or male whatever - or male cells in cultures. Male dummies are used in car accidents. There is a ""Universal Man"" definition, used by labs, scientists and governments all over the world, because of it being the ""custom"". What it is is really male-oriented group think. This ""universal man"" standard used as an experimental model all over the world is used despite that women are fundamentally and biologically different on the cellular level from Men. Whenever women have been taken into account, stereotypes rule the hypotheses and the experiments rather than factual observations. Plus: women are 55% of the world population, but there is no ""universal woman"" standard.-Men have refused women any secondary education and above, or ANY education, often by LAW, gentle reader, but more often custom, while giving themselves either free education or low-interest loans, (Men helping Men - relatives, bank/finance and old-boy networking) towards all the educational opportunities they want. -Men give each other jobs and apprenticeships while refusing to hire women because they are women, even if those women are academically brilliant, and mathematically-, computer- or scientifically-savvy, or even if she is a just a serviceable body-in-place. If a woman invented a new economical energy drive for space ships to travel to Mars, it is very probable: a Man will take credit for it or bury it, rather than acknowledge a Woman invented it. If Men must give the Women credit for inventions, discoveries or engineering achievements, they will see to it she gets no money or award from it or any historical notice of it. Especially Men will forbid any statues, or picture representation on money or coins celebrating the achievement as a moment of national pride. Instead, if a male co-worker assisted the Woman inventor or engineer, Men will acclaim him, the assistant, publically in every type of social media and history book, asking him to give speeches or interviews. Men will give the male assistant promotions and wage increases, and better job opportunities. Historically, women are pushed out of whatever organizations she was part of into obscurity and unemployability.-Men engineer tools/machines/work clothes/protective gear to specifically fit men's hands and weight distribution and body sizes, refusing to manufacture tools/machines/work clothes/protective gear to specifically fit women's bodies, i.e., breasts and hips, smaller bones, less muscle mass and more body fat. Remember, women are 55% of the population.-Laws protect Men, but not women. Police enforce laws to protect Men, but not Women. Wink, wink.-Appropriate Wages are for Men; women are to be financially exploited, enslaved, or made to work for free - and this eliminates all measures of women's contribution to national economies and measures of well-being (unpaid childcare, elderly care, housework, secretarial and nursing work, farming labor). Women are not given priority attention as a result by politicians.-Politics is for Men only by customary malecentric groupthink. If women happen to be elected or appointed, don't inform them of meetings. Don't give them positions on committees. Don't permit them to speak, or to be quoted in print, television or social media. If they speak, humiliate them with name-calling (most common Twitter word in addressing women politicians or female national figures - Bitch: as in aggressive Bitch, loud Bitch, unladylike Bitch, shrill Bitch, hysterical Bitch, especially if she acted or sounded just like a Man. Worst epithet of all: ambitious Bitch. See 'Hilary Clinton'). Interrupt her every other word, do not allow her to finish a sentence, but let Men talk without interruption even if you don't like what he is saying. If the woman capitulates under the social peer pressure and begins wearing pink, smiling a lot, and brings cookies, pat her on the head and send her out for coffee, saying, ""she knows her place, fellas!"" and give her a place on the committee for children's health.Figuratively speaking, gentle reader - Death seems more preferable than recognizing women as having equal rights for many men, deep down, or in practice in daily life. Even more important, the physical concerns of women to be comfortable and casual and as carefree in the world (as men can be in their bodies and desires) such as going to the toilet, handling menstruation, caring for children, wearing bras, using breast pumps or breast feeding, public swimming, sports, using public transportation, wearing comfortable men's pants (with enough largepockets) or goth tats, being hairy, having a libido, without the Male Gaze approving or disapproving seems a shocking concept for most men in the real world everywhere. Men, even men who support the equality of women, seem to have to overcome their own nature to allow themselves to see women as people with body aches and pains and emissions, some of which are particular to women's bodies!Stupid. It is cutting one's own throat, sinking one's own boat, in order to feel manly, to refuse any woman any legitimate, real, participation in solving any problem, or of thinking of her primarily as someone who's entire purpose is to please your eye or libido or bodily comforts.The book's chapters:Daily LifeThe WorkplaceDesignGoing to the DoctorPublic LifeWhen it Goes WrongThere are extensive Endnotes and an Index. As you can imagine, gentle reader, Criado-Pérez has gone to the mat on research, facts, figures and on meticulous fact-checking. I am also sure Fox News and right-wing conservatives and the religious-right and misogynists have already prepared Twitter blasts with the words ""fill in the blank Bitch"" about Criado-Pérez, and anyone who loves her book. Like me. I highly recommend buying, loaning and reading this book, gentle reader. Unlike me, she gives just the facts, mostly without bitter and acid commentary.It is hard for almost any woman of a certain age today to not have a heart hardened by bitter remembrances and experiences, reader. At least, #metoo."

28,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19741482-k-h-leigh,5,"Everybody needs to read this book. Everybody. Female, male, nonbinary, everybody.The introduction perfectly articulated and validated many of my own anecdotal observations - the pervasive idea that female is somehow a deviation of human, rather than the base model. The first few chapters, which deal largely with social impacts - community planning, workplace dynamics, etc. - were fascinating, insightful, and compelling.But then as the book progresses, Criado-Perez slowly ups the ante. By the time she begins to dissect the utter disregard for women in medical studies and pharmaceutical trials, I was a white hot ball of righteous fury. And it only gets worse from there.And yet, despite how FUCKING LITERALLY INCREDIBLE it is that women remain unseen, despite comprising half of the population, Criado-Perez's impeccable research and dry wit give the reader something to feel optimistic about. No, it isn't hope. Hope is passive. What Criado-Perez provides is motivation. She cites numerous examples of individuals and organizations who are actively changing things for the better. Simply by writing the book, she joins their ranks. Simply by reading the book, I do, too. By passing it along, recommending it to every damn person on my friend list, I am helping make women visible.We are not niche. We are not aberrations. We are not a specialized subset of the human race. We are not to be ignored."
29,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1362376-avolyn-fisher,5,"The popular feminist phrase, 'the future is female,' may make me cringe, but this book makes it abundantly clear that the past and arguably the present, are still very much male. This book is one of the few books I've come across whose description doesn't even scratch the surface of what's to come. I can't think of a book that I've read that was so well researched and written as this, and I'm someone who loves this type of nonfiction work, and has read every one of Malcolm Gladwell's books, written in a similar investigative style.I think this book goes far beyond what it even needed to cover, I'm impressed that at no point did Criado Perez decide 1/3 or 1/4 of the way, that she had written enough for a book, as many books have been published on far less.Victim mentality has always bothered me, and unfortunately, as this book points out, women are often made to feel like they're playing a victim role by simply observing a bias or injustice towards them. Or we are treated as either too sensitive or imagining our circumstance. I've been fortunate enough to have never faced what so many women on this earth face in simply attempting to escape as refugees, find a safe place to use the restroom, etc. But the pieces about being told to be 'more like a man' despite research showing that the behavioral benefits men enjoy from certain behaviors simply do not transfer when a woman tries them on for size. And times when I've been treated differently than my peers, and expected to do more work for equal recognition and praise, I was told I'm making excuses. And as this book highlights, when did we decide that women had to be more like men? Isn't that telling in itself.Whether you agree that women are treated differently or not, I encourage anyone to read this book as I doubt you'll find something written or produced with the same level of rigor and research. So at the very least, if you read this book and decide to disagree with its findings, or maintain any stance you have against equality and supporting women, you will at least be educated in your opinion."

As a 27-year-old woman living in a society, I like to think that I am more than aware of the current state of institutionalized sexism. But oh was I under informed. This book was eye-opening in the most horrific way. As a feminist, I have worked to understand gender bias in service of living my life on more equal terms with my male peers. I like to think I’m pretty woke. But I had no idea about so many of these gaps in the data when it comes to women. I recognize that I have privilege as a white woman who grew up middle class in a first world country, but even those privileges can do nothing to fight against governments and organizations that refuse to close the gender data gap. The cause of my eventual death may very well have been preventable if the data had only been collected and analyzed. And that makes me real mad. It’s 2020. How are we STILL dealing with this bull crap??My only hope is that the right people will read this book and that it will put the wheels in motion for meaningful change. Because systematically ignoring the needs of 50% of the population must end YESTERDAY. That’s all I can say right now. I’m too angry to form coherent sentences. Read this book if you haven’t already. Whether you are a man, a woman, or a person of another gender, you should be informed about the state of our world.Trigger warning: discussion of sexual assault"
31,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6603759-misericordia-the-serendipity-aegis,5,"Q:Most of recorded human history is one big data gap. Starting with the theory of Man the Hunter, the chroniclers of the past have left little space for women’s role in the evolution of humanity, whether cultural or biological. Instead, the lives of men have been taken to represent those of humans overall. When it comes to the lives of the other half of humanity, there is often nothing but silence.And these silences are everywhere. Our entire culture is riddled with them. Films, news, literature, science, city planning, economics. The stories we tell ourselves about our past, present and future. They are all marked – disfigured – by a female-shaped ‘absent presence’. This is the gender data gap.The gender data gap isn’t just about silence. These silences, these gaps, have consequences. They impact on women’s lives every day. The impact can be relatively minor. Shivering in offices set to a male temperature norm, for example, or struggling to reach a top shelf set at a male height norm. Irritating, certainly. Unjust, undoubtedly.But not life-threatening. Not like crashing in a car whose safety measures don’t account for women’s measurements. Not like having your heart attack go undiagnosed because your symptoms are deemed ‘atypical’. For these women, the consequences of living in a world built around male data can be deadly.One of the most important things to say about the gender data gap is that it is not generally malicious, or even deliberate. Quite the opposite. It is simply the product of a way of thinking that has been around for millennia and is therefore a kind of not thinking. A double not thinking, even: men go without saying, and women don’t get said at all. (c) Oh, wow. This is a quite good power start to this book. And it gets only better as it proceeds! Basically, it's very difficult to make men to see life through a prism of female life. The reverse is a bit easier since women anyway do a lot of historically 'male' tasks these days. So, it's either get everyone to practice extreme empathy or invite mixed companies to do tasks that require mixed perspectives. Now, people still are finding it challenging and it keeps leading to impressive flip-floppy results in a number of spheres.Great in-depth research do on how economics benefits from taking into account the needs of women. Q:… sex is not the reason women are excluded from data. Gender is. (c) Q:Private motivations are, to a certain extent, irrelevant. What matters is the pattern. What matters is whether, given the weight of the data I will present, it is reasonable to conclude that the gender data gap is all just one big coincidence. (c) Q:It is why a 2015 study of multiple language Wikipedias found that articles about women include words like ‘woman’, ‘female’ or ‘lady’, but articles about men don’t contain words like ‘man’, ‘masculine’ or ‘gentleman’ (because the male sex goes without saying). (c) Q:‘You’ve played games as a blue hedgehog. As a cybernetically augmented space marine. As a sodding dragon-tamer. [. . .B]ut the idea that women can be protagonists with an inner life and an active nature is somehow beyond your imaginative capacities?’ …It should be easier to imagine yourself as a woman than as a blue hedgehog. But on the other hand she’s also wrong, because that blue hedgehog has one particularly important similarity with male players, even more so than species alignment, and that is that Sonic the hedgehog is male. We know this because he isn’t pink, he doesn’t have a bow in his hair, and he doesn’t simper. (c) Some stuff is, naturally, idiotic, like it always manages to be in these books:Q:More recently, a 2017 analysis of ten introductory political-science textbooks found that an average of only 10.8% of pages per text referenced women (some texts were as low as 5.3%). The same level of male bias has been found in recent analyses of Armenian, Malawian, Pakistani, Taiwanese, South African and Russian textbooks. (c) Political science? Well, if women have been barred from politics for a larger part of history, what should the authors refer to? While the question at hand is serious, the discussion should not become irrational. We should stick to the facts not demand that women are invented into textbooks.The author lists a bunch of instances when a woman's work was attributed to a man. Which, she argues, made women's breakthroughs so much harder to see and to attribute correctly. Love this part. Q:For most of history, if women were allowed to compose at all, it was for a private audience and domestic setting. Large orchestral works, so crucial for the development of a composer’s reputation, were usually off limits, considered ‘improper’. Music was an ‘ornament’ for women, not a career. (c) Street design and transportation gender planning - now, that's another extremely important consideration! Q:There is a tendency (as ever) to blame the women rather than male-biased design. But male-biased design is in fact exactly what the problem is here. (c) Q:when we don’t collect and, crucially, use sex-disaggregated data in urban design, we find unintended male bias cropping up in the most surprising of places. (c) Q:A 2016 study found that Indian women who use fields to relieve themselves are twice as likely to face non-partner sexual violence as women with a household toilet. (c) "
32,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666003-silvana,5,"Shocking. Terrifying. Exasperating. And to me, life-changing. I know I am in a marginal group (at least in my country's and cultural context), but I did not know that I'm being marginalized in every aspect of my life, from the cellphone I use until the fact that I have been doing many care work without remuneration. This is the story of systematized marginalization of half of the world population just because they have vagina. This book makes me angry. My own city does not care about my mobility as a woman and prefer to separate women from men instead of educating everyone that sexual harassment is against the law. My transport app does not care if their bikes are too high for me to ride on. When I am sick, most drugs I use were made with men as trial subjects. My family forces me to do all the cleaning stuff since they said 'it's a girl's job'. The cars I (could) drive have better protection for men because it's designed for men's body in the driving seat. The voice recognition in my phone was designed for mostly men. The chance of me getting a loan for my hypothetical start-up is minimal because I'm a woman, and so on and so forth.That's just me, but what about millions of women who are not as lucky as I am (who has a decent job and still can go on vacations)? THEY, WE LIVE IN THE WORLD MADE BY MEN AND FOR MEN.According to the data from UN Women https://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do... Women bear disproportionate responsibility for unpaid care and domestic work. Women tend to spend around 2.5 times more time on unpaid care and domestic work than men. Did you know what if you got married/living with a men, then your care and domestic work burden will increase up to 70%? while men, most of the times, have more times to pursue their hobbies. I used to scoff at those young mothers with their babysitters in the malls (one babysitter per child) but now I think they're 1) smart 2) lucky to afford the sitters since they have more time for themselves. So, make sure if you decide to cohabitate, all tasks and chores would be divided equally. The Non Fiction Book Club is  still discussing this book and we have plenty of examples on these unpaid work women do because of misplaced gender role in the household. That list goes on and on. ""There is no such thing as a woman who doesn’t work. There is only a woman who isn’t paid for her work.” I will never look at my married male diver friends the same again. They are able to spend a long dive vacations because their wives are at home taking care of everything. Women always takes the burden and we let ourselves doing that. This book is also infuriating especially since even the developed countries still have a bad record when it comes to recognizing women's needs and voices. If they still got it bad, how about us here in the developing world, where patriarchy is the norm? where even affirmative action remains cosmetic?""The presumption that what is male is universal is a direct consequence of the gender data gap. Whiteness and maleness can only go without saying because most other identities never get said at all. But male universality is also a cause of the gender data gap: because women aren't seen and aren't remembered, because male data makes up the majority of what we know, what is male comes to be seen as universal. It leads to the positioning of women, half the global population, as a minority. With a niche identity and subjective point of view. In such a framing, women are set up to be forgettable. Ignorable. Dispensable - from culture, from history, a from data. And so, women become invisible.”Thank you Caroline Criado-Pérez for writing this important book that everyone should read and for opening my eyes to the stark and grim reality. Now excuse me, I need to call my mom and offer her any vacation she wants because I could never thank her properly for every sacrifices she made for me when she had to cope with her career and making sure the house (and me) was in one piece."
33,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,5,"You'd think that by this point, having read as much on this and similar topics as I have, that I wouldn't be shocked anymore at how little women are considered or valued in society... but apparently not. This book was eye opening and yet, completely unsurprising. This is a book about how the Default Human is man. Throughout history, men have been the form around which everything was based. Men were and are the arbiter of value, and as such, designed society and infrastructure around their own, ignoring the needs of the other half of the population. Men are the default, the standard, the objective normal... and women are the exception, the outlier, the anomaly.The term ""man"", used generally, is supposedly representative of humanity. Humanity, which, you may be aware, has more than one biological sex. And yet only one of those sexes is called ""man"". This isn't a mistake. This is by design. Man is MANkind. Man is huMAN. WoMAN is a ""deformed version of a man"" according to Aristotle, apparently. WoMAN is simply allowed to live in a man's world - an inconvenient other, except when necessary for the continuation and care of mankind. These are bold statements, but it's not like we have to look far for evidence. This book is about the data gap that exists when it comes to women. All too often, studies and plans fail to include women, so women's needs are not taken into account. This ranges from everything from neighborhood planning and infrastructure, to bus lines and schedules, to phone size, to health care (see my review on how women's needs in health care are not being met), to car safety testing, to job opportunity, to retirement planning. Crash test dummies are modeled after men's average height and weight, and for a long time were the only model, and would only be tested in the driver's seat, where the man usually would be. Female representative models have only recently been added, but are usually tested in the passenger seat, meaning that women in the driver's seat are still not taken into account for safety - something seriously lacking when one considers that women, being usually shorter, will have the seat closer to the steering column and more upright, and so will naturally fare differently in an accident. Even seatbelts are designed for men - certainly not anyone with boobs or a potentially large pregnant stomach. I have to use a seatbelt adjuster so that I'm not strangled to death (or beheaded should I get into an accident) by the seatbelt that rides up over my chest because my pesky breasts are in the way of where it wants to naturally lie. Firefighter/police/coast guard/military/et al safety gear is still designed and made for men, despite women having held these positions for decades at least. The ""standard issue"" ""safety"" equipment designed for male bodies does not protect female bodies effectively, and is often more detrimental to women's safety than just not wearing it. And women die because of it. Aside from death, though, lack of correctly fitting equipment prevents female opportunity. This year, (as a reminder, it's 2019), we saw the first all-female spacewalk scrapped in March because there were not enough suits sized for the women available. They later clarified and said ""Oh, well we DO have enough, but they'd require some adjustment, and it's just easier to send a man instead."" (Paraphrasing.) So, of course, there was backlash, and now, 7 months later NASA finally got it right and allowed two women to venture outside of the atmosphere of men for the first time in history. It only took 50 years. Let's not forget all of the hate and abuse and threats and shit aimed at women in... oh, pretty much any industry that's typically been done by men. Doctors, programmers, scientists, gamers, military, any elected official... you name it, and women take shit for daring to do it. And all too often, violence against women is seen as expected, normal, and accepted. What do we expect, stepping out of the kitchen like that? Unless it's stepping INTO a kitchen, which apparently men also dominate in the restaurant industry. How very DARE we. Women's value and worth and competency is all too often conflated with our likability. But it's a lose/lose situation. Because if we are too likable, too pretty, too nice, too polite, we're not seen as capable. If we're not likable or demure or modest enough, if we dare show ambition or come across as too matter-of-fact or stern, then we're a bitch, hysterical, unpredictable, untrustworthy, two-faced, vindictive... etc. Men don't face these hypocrisies. If a man yells and screams or interrupts or bangs his fist on the table, he's ""passionate"". If a woman does it, she's ""emotional"" and ""unhinged"". If a working woman has a family, she's still almost always expected to be the primary caregiver - and is penalized for it as she's seen as ""not committed"" to her career. But a man who has a family is expected to be the primary earner outside the home, and he can be and is expected to be career-driven... since usually he has a wife doing all of the heavy lifting behind the scenes. Women do an extraordinary amount of unpaid work to keep our families and society functional, and at every turn, that work is devalued, undermined, and ignored. We are generally the caregivers, the cookers, the cleaners, the errand runners, the homework helpers, the pet minders. We do gardening and house maintenance and menu planning and then shopping and then loading and unloading and putting away the groceries before we cook it. We are the laundry service, the find-the-item-sitting-in-plain-sight service... on and on and on. And that's just the normal stuff. All unpaid. ""Women's work"".This book covered a HUGE array of areas where women are ignored or invisible to society, and my review can't cover it all or do it proper justice. I highly recommend this book. It was fascinating, and really shows how far we have come, and how far there is still to go to achieve true equality. "
34,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1288593-laura,2,"There is so much relevant, important, fascinating, and deeply troubling information here about the ways in which the world, in big and small ways, is built for white men. BUT. I have to give this book two stars for its appalling erasure of trans and nonbinary people. The words themsleves (transgender, nonbinary, gender non-conforming) do not even appear in this book. Not once. Nor does the word cisgender. In a book about the ways that a lack of data renders women invisible, and the ways that invisibility literally costs women their lives, it is, frankly, inexcusable that Criado-Perez does the exact same thing to trans people. In her world, apparently, trans and nonbinary people do not exist.This does not have to be a book about trans issues. It is not a book about race, and yet, Criado-Perez includes some analysis of race in the various scenarios she examines. It is not a book about class, and yet she also includes analysis of the way class affects the various data biases she examines. There is very little analysis of queer sexualities, AND YET she manages to precede almost all the data she gives about married couples with the word ""heterosexual"", which at least renders queer people visible. But she does not give this same basic consideration to trans and nonbinary people.There's a whole chapter about the accessibility of public restrooms, in which she does not consider the ways that access to restrooms specifically affects trans and nonbinary folks. There's a whole bit about gendered language, and the ways it shapes how he think and act (which was totally relevant and important) that does not even CONSIDER how gendered language might and does affect (and harm) people who fall outside the gender binary. There's a chapter on how public transit and its infrastructure (bus stations, subway stops, etc.) are not designed with women in mind. She goes into the ways in which various infrastructures are unsafe for women, and the ways in which women experience violence in public places. But she does not once mention specific violence toward trans women, or how likely trans women are to be the targets of violence.I'd read a few reviews before I started this, so I was prepared to be upset by it, but I decided to read it anyway because I found the subject matter as a whole so compelling. But Criado-Perez's failure to even mention the existence of trans people, and people outside the gender binary, just made it nearly impossible for me to take anything she said seriously. This happens a lot in nonfiction and I'm always exhausted and angered by it. Sometimes the oversights are small enough that I still feel the book has some merit. But in a book ALL ABOUT GENDER, and specifically the ways in which ignoring gender leads to serious harm--it's just too big an erasure to get past. The irony is heartbreaking.Do better."

36,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5954293-david-dinaburg,3,"Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men overflows with facts and examples of how women are discounted or completely ignored in modern social, academic, and commercial applications. The two or three times I noticed it dip into the speculative feels unwieldy: why include weak studies whose findings are still in dispute when you have so much good data that proves your thesis? Why include, “[M]ale-default thinking may also be behind the finding that research perceived to have been done by men is associated with ‘greater scientific quality’: this could be a product of pure sexism, but it could also be a result of the mode of thinking that sees male as universal and female as niche,” after four or five studies that definitively show harmful consequences of universal-male-default thinking? It’s a weird nitpick but one that I’ve slammed a handful of other books for. There is a major difference here, though; those books solely relied upon anecdote and selective studies to prop up their pet theories. It was all they did. The disputed status of the speculative data is fully cited in the actual text in Invisible Women, not buried in the endnotes, hallelujah hallelujah amen. This type of attention to detail permeates the text; nearly every single citations is settled, provable fact and anything that is up for debate is framed as such. Bene.Invisible Women keeps matching datapoint after datapoint to the worst-case scenarios of a world actively hostile toward women. Incredibly, things are always usually worse for fifty percent of the global population than they seem. It’s unnerving, and it expands over the three-hundred pages. There are so many facts that are really important to recognize, and listing them one after another creates shock value that is memorable enough to enact change. The short-list versions of the book are already available; the content there is amazing, and I really think the article works better than the book. Reading chapter after chapter of the same issues in different disciplines turns into a slog, and you can pick up some specifics without wading into the totality of the work.For example, an unnamed charity “...only talked to male farmers.” Things did not go well from there: Male farmers said that yield was the most important trait, and so that was the crop that the organisation bred. And then it was surprised when households didn’t adopt it...[t]he female farmers in this area didn’t see yields as the most important thing. They cared about other factors like how much land preparation and wedding these crops required, because these are female jobs. And they cared about how long, ultimately, the crops could take to cook (another female job). The new, high-yield varieties increased the time the women had to spend on these other tasks, and so, unsurprisingly, they did not adopt these crops. Invisible Women is great citation material, and a book I am happy to own so I can refer back to it. I just wouldn’t recommend reading it straight through. It seems impossible not to become inured as item after item repeats the same format; women are disenfranchised at nearly every turn, their data isn’t collected or sex-disaggregated, and it is messing up how societies are built. This is non-fiction, and I recognize that pervasive repetition is the point, but it is repetitious nonetheless.The long format creates a lot of ambivalence; the shock eventually dulls, and it muddles strong-headline-making injustice—The Deadly Truth about a World Built for Men, From Stab Vests to Car Crashes—with the fact that it is really a lack of information that is killing women: Women aren’t ignored in favor of the male default for medical research only due to misogyny and historical legacy, but because the information seems clear that hormonal changes throughout their period change the efficacy of drugs, their pain threshold and experience, and stress tolerance. The variability is expensive to control for, so men stay the default.” We couldn’t change the focus of medical trials right now even if we wanted to, because the data isn’t there. Because no one bothers to collect it or sex-disaggregate it. Ditto for: restroom access; bus routes; housing and urban planning; seatbelts; kevlar; military backpacks; airbags. It needs to be said, again, that women’s rights are human rights.So while I grew weary of reading the specifics of yet another way in which women have been screwed over, I don’t know a better way to show, over and over, that women have been ignored in data collection and that our current social fabric is built upon an unspoken male default. Example after example within Invisible Women gets to be a tedious read, but it is the only way to be sure the point is made that the world needs to listen to women."

Much of this book is focused on how there’s a data gap when it comes to women, information isn’t gathered about women’s experiences or they aren’t included in studies. One really frustrating thing about this book is that it has its own data gap when it comes to queer and trans women. I think the book does a good job of including women from different countries, socioeconomic backgrounds, and women of color. But it’s just baffling to me that a book in 2019 about women’s issues in the world is going to not talk about queer women, trans women, women with disabilities, and so on when these populations have specific difficulties that they face. Or at least acknowledge your own gap, like “this book will mainly focus on straight, cis, able-bodied women as that’s what most of the data available covers, which is a problem itself.” So yeah, the information that was included was very illuminating, it’s just annoying that a book pointing out data gaps in the world didn’t mention its own data gaps."

The impacts of this are disturbingly far-reaching and ultimately contribute to the naturalisation of gender bias in all of our lives. This is an engaging, thorough, frustrating, essential read."

That said, worth it.I've always rolled my eyes at the people who say, ""Oh, feminism--we don't need it anymore,"" and/or, ""I'd feel better if we called it humanism."" Cool. What this tells me is that you have enough privilege to ignore and/or opt out of everything that inconveniences you. Poof! And it simply blinks out of existence. Or better yet, you're not entirely sure the problem was ever there. Except no, that's not how the world works. Caroline Criado Perez is on point when she says that we have to stop acting as if theoretical, legal equality of opportunity is the same as true equality of opportunity. It isn't. Feminism is only obsolete if it's not intersectional enough. And yes, we need to close the gender data gap. It's not a magic wand that will solve everything, but it's a step towards a world designed for humans, and by saying that I don't mean just men.
Failing to collect data on women and their lives means that we continue to naturalise sex and gender discrimination – while at the same time somehow not seeing any of this discrimination. Or really, we don’t see it because we naturalise it – it is too obvious, too commonplace, too much just the way things are to bother commenting on. It’s the irony of being a woman: at once hyper-visible when it comes to being treated as the subservient sex class, and invisible when it counts – when it comes to being counted.

""you don’t have to realize you’re being discriminated against to in fact be discriminated against”

Caroline Criado-Perez tackles an immense topic and she succeeds in demonstrating that women have been rendered invisible by virtue of cultural norms that men sometimes have unthinkingly and at other times deliberately have adopted. By excluding women from consideration, not only does all of humanity lose out on potentially transformative insights but women are exposed to greater harm ranging from injury and up to death. If you are female, your first response may be to look at your life and believe “not me!” because you’re surrounded by respectful people of both sexes. If you are male, then I’m going to appeal to your innate sense of fairness and decency to consider reading Invisible Women.Let’s start with the indispensable cell phone. Chances are good that you have a smartphone since you’re on Goodreads / social media. Have you noticed that the design of these phones have increased to the point that you need both hands to phone and to operate the camera feature (which are both features you’d likely require during an emergency) and that the phone is too big for most of your pockets (if you’re even wearing clothing with pockets)? The males would be more likely than females to say “no difference, no big deal.” Or have you noticed that you prefer either compact cars or SUVs which seat you up very high because both provide better sightlines and visibility from the driver’s seat than the large family sedan that your parents probably drove? I know that I do.What both questions have in common is that the smartphone and the car were designed with the primary user assumed to be male, who has larger hands and who is taller on average than females. So even if you said, “yeah, sure,” you likely have shrugged them off as minor inconveniences. But these examples are just the tip of the iceberg. The internet and the technological capabilities of modern life have created many benefits and efficiencies. Companies have had decades to collect user data (location, internet traffic patterns, demographics, etc) and industries have compiled massive corpora (databases of voices, text, and images). We’re now in the age of Big Data, with programmers designing algorithms to sift through the oceans of data. But what if those algorithms are based on corpora predominantly featuring male voices, male images, and adjectives that are culturally favorable to males over females? As programmers are wont to say, “garbage in, garbage out.” This means that whatever bias exists in the corpora will be amplified by the time that algorithm completes its search. This could explain why 30 percent of resumes a company receives are the lucky minority to be seen by human eyes. I sincerely doubt that of the 30 percent of resumes which are seen by humans that they equally represent the two sexes.You may then think that you’re not job-hunting and you’ve got a great professional network anyways. But there’s more. Drugs may not work for you if you’re female. There was a 2004 study by Sherry Marts and Sarah Keitt that demonstrated that differences between the two sexes go down to every tissue and organ system in the human body, as well as in the “prevalence, course, and severity” of the majority of common human diseases. Despite the National Institute of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 making it illegal not to include females in federally-funded clinical trials, a 2015 federal government audit of FDA revealed that 40 percent of documents still did not specify the sex of participants. So maybe that’s why you have to try many drugs and different dosages before finding medical relief. Oh, females also are more likely to die or suffer longer because their medical issues present symptoms differently compared with men. Doctors, for the most part, have not been trained to account for these biological differences. Since 1989, cardiovascular disease is the number one health cause of death for women in the US. Perhaps you’ve heard the advice to take a low-dose of aspirin daily to help lower your chances of getting heart disease? The truth is that advice is effective for men, not for women who may actually be harmed by following that guidance, as the American Heart Association pointed out in 2016.Finally, there is the statistic released by a 2015 McKinsey study: “globally, 75 percent of unpaid work is done by women."" But you already knew that, didn’t you?Getting concerned yet? Find out more, by reading Invisible Women. It is easy to read and there are no tables of statistics or graphs. Much as I would have really liked graphical representation of statistics, the lack of comprehensive and historical data supports her basic premise of the book - women are invisible. I personally also would have wanted more depth than breadth for not all of her points were made equally strong.For those of you who already know this, Invisible Women is still worth reading as Criado-Perez provides some coverage of women in other parts of the world as well as suggestions for how to change this systemic problem. Representation of the world, like the world itself, is the work of men; they describe it from their own point of view, which they confuse with the absolute truth. Simone de Beauvoir"
44,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95843318-kiki,2,"TL;DR: Please be aware that this book is trans-exclusive as hell.Ironically, this book would have needed a sensitivity reading.It is painfully exclusive of trans, intersexual, and nonbinary people, starting by defining gender along XX or XY chromosomes in the foreword and sticking to it throughout the book. When it comes to body functions or characteristics (for example regarding toilet infrastructure or seatbelt design), there is no consideration of trans people. This pattern is so visible throughout the book that it hurts to read such a well-sourced and detailed publication on implicit gender bias throughout our daily life.I would really like to recommend this book, but at this state, I just can't. This was released in 2019 and there is no excuse to eradicate trans, inter, and nonbinary people like this in a contemporary publication on gender topics. I would be fine with a book that focuses on cis women if it's well reasoned, but not with a book that eradicates non-cis people entirely by its underlying definitions of ""gender""."

The author explains that there's very little data out there about women of color, which is part of the problem, but I also would've liked to hear information about the ways the gender data gap also works against queer women, trans women, disabled women, etc. Basically, this book could likely have been three times this size.The most frustrating thing overall is that I suspect it's mostly the choir reading this book: feminists, typically women. MEN, READ THIS BOOK, especially those of you who claim to be feminists (and are most likely to actually internalize the entire premise and act on it)."

In my edition (orange and blue cover), on page 36:""And this useful/not so useful binary falls rather neatly onto the male/female binary.""This book is about an overlooked gender, but it overlooks people who don't fall into the gender binary. This book rails against the ignoring of women, but it ignores transgender and non-binary people.The book is well researched (in specific areas) and the information is so very important, but I don't feel comfortable recommending it because of this slight. Which is upsetting, infuriating even, as I think everyone should know the information contained in this book.ETA: I didn't finish this book. I got the message. I was just so disappointed that the author's argument seemed to rely on all women fitting into a category of the ""average female"". Where the 'average female' is middle aged, married, a mother, caring for an elderly relative, working, physically smaller than a man, and predominantly white. The idea that we are ALL disadvantaged by the current system isn't raised. Children, teenagers and older women are only relevant as burdens on this 'average female'. As discussed above, anyone who falls outside the author's ""straight female binary"" is ignored entirely. Discriminations against poor non-white women are sometimes used as examples, but really only to support the main narrative of the world being designed for men. I didn't see any research specific to non-married females. Most of the research is from the UK and the US. In summary: This book is about women being ignored, harmed, disadvantaged, hurt and killed because the 'average man' is the default. It is painfully well researched to back up this assertion. BUT the author seems to perpetrate the same discrimination by ignoring females who aren't her 'average female'. I'm pretty much her 'average female' but I found the lack of consideration of people who are not like me bitterly disappointing."

To distort a reality you are supposedly trying to measure makes sense only if you don't see women as essential. It doesn't make sense if you're talking about half the human race. And it doesn't make sense if you care about accurate data.And there you have it. For years and years and years, society has ignored the fact that women are physiologically different to men and as a result have completely different needs. And as a result of this, women are being put in danger and mistreated because society treats them as an aberration from the ""norm"". In this, the 21st century, when women's capabilities, endurance and perspective is adding more value than ever, the fact that the design of things all around us is holding us back is ever more stark. I am absolutely furious. Everybody needs to read this book. We are so far from an equal society, and we have no idea just how deep set that divide is."

It will make you mad, make you so irate that you’ll want to throw something at a wall. It’ll make you astonished that fifty percent of the world (FIFTY PERCENT) must go through life in a world that isn’t meant for them. To how cities are designed, and roads/sidewalks are cleared of snow; to the unpaid work that women do to keep society running; to how cars are designed, as seat belts were designed based on men, and since women have breasts, women are thus wearing seat belts “improperly” because of our chest; to the size of smartphones to fit the male hand, not a woman’s, despite women buying more iPhones than men; to voice recognition software being set up for a lower-toned male voice, and an example given of a woman literally being told that a man had to set up her car’s voice system because it won’t recognize a female’s voice; to drug trials not including women, partly because researchers believe that women’s bodies are “too hormonal” and are not adequate for a drug study; to females being told by their doctors that nothing is wrong with them, it’s all in their head, and to suck it up, even when something is seriously wrong and the female knows it; to ignoring women’s needs during post-disaster relief efforts…all of this could be helped IF THE WORLD LISTENED TO AND INCLUDED WOMEN. The male-dominated world is literally killing women. The book will make you want to go out and smash the establishment…and we better. “The solution to the sex and gender gap is clear: we have to close the female representation gap. When women are involved in decision-making, in research, in knowledge production,, women do not get forgotten.” (pg 318)So many reviews here are so well-written, and I don’t think I could formulate such an articulate review. So I pulled some major takeaways I got from the book, as I marked up almost every page, and bulleted them below. (Page numbers are from the hardcover copy.)•	“Representation of the world, like the world itself, is the work of men; they describe it from their own point of view, which they confuse with the absolute truth.” (Intro page)  		-What a way to start off the book.•	The gender data gap is “a kind of not thinking”, a “double not thinking, even: men go without saying, and women don’t get said at all” (pg XII). •	Three main areas the book covered: “the female body, women’s unpaid care burden, and male violence against women.” These things “go ignored, and we proceed as if the male body and its attendant life experiences are gender neutral. This is a form of discrimination against women.” (pg XIII)•	“[t]he gender data gap is both a cause and a consequence of the type of thinking that conceives of humanity as almost exclusively male.”•	In terms of language: “The generic masculine is also used when referring to groups of people: when the gender is unknown, or if it’s a mixed group the generic masculine is used. So a group of one hundred female teachers in Spanish would be referred to as ‘las profesoras’ – but as soon as you add a single male teacher, the group suddenly becomes ‘los profesores’. Such is the power of the default male.” (pg 7)•	About male being universal, and female being “niche”: “It is why the England national football team page on Wikipedia is about the men’s national football team, while the women’s page is called the England women’s national football team, and why in 2013 Wikipedia divided writers into ‘American Novelists’ and ‘American Women Novelists’. It is why a 2015 study of multiple language Wikipedias found that articles about women include words like ‘woman’, ‘female’ or ‘lady’, but articles about men don’t contain words like ‘man’, ‘masculine’ or ‘gentleman’ (because the male sex goes without saying).” (pg 13)•	“We call the eighteenth century ‘the Enlightenment’, even though, while it may have expanded ‘the rights of man’, it ‘narrowed the right of women, who were denied control of their property and earnings and barred from higher education and professional training’. We think of ancient Greece as the cradle of democracy although the female half of the population were explicitly excluded from voting.” (pg 13)•	In 2013, Andy Murrary was praised for ending Britain’s 77-year wait to win Wimbledon, when in fact Virginia Wade had won it in 1977. (pg 13)•	“Zoning laws are based on, and prioritise the needs of, a bread-winning heterosexual married man who goes off to work in the morning, and comes home to the suburbs to relax at night.” (pg 40) -Women are more likely to have to run numerous errands, but cities are planned by men with the male schedule in mind. This makes it even more inconvenient for women when they do the errands. •	About women facing harassment and threats in public: “The invisibility of the threatening behavior women face in public is compounded by the reality that men don’t do this to women who are accompanied by other men…” (pg 55)•	“When planners fail to account for gender, public spaces become male spaces by default. The reality is that half the global population has a female body. Half the global population has to deal on a daily basis with the sexualized menace that is visited on that body.” (pg 66)•	On October 24, 1075, Icelandic women went on strike and did not do any work. “No paid work, but also no cooking, no cleaning, no child care. Let the men of Iceland see how they coped without the invisible work women did every day to keep the country moving.” (pg 69)•	“There is no such thing as a woman who doesn’t work. There is only a woman who isn’t paid for her work. Globally, 75% of unpaid work is done by women, who spend between three and six hours per day on it compared to men’s average of thirty minutes to two hours.” (pg 70)•	Business magazines cite statistics that say that we shouldn’t work more than forty hours a week, or that your job could kill you if you work more than that. But “they aren’t talking to women, because for women there is no ‘if’. Women do work well over this amount. Regularly. And it is killing them.” (pg 73)•	A woman could not count childcare costs as a work expense when she had to spend a night out for a work event. “The implicit bias is clear: expense codes are based on the assumption that the employee has a wife at home taking care of the home and the kids. This work doesn’t need paying for, because it’s women’s work, and women don’t get paid for it.” (pg 90)•	“…meritocracy is an insidious myth. It is a myth that provides cover to institutional white male bias.” (pg 93)•	THIS IS ONE THAT I RANT ABOUT ALMOST EVERY DAY. “Then there’s the standard office temperature. The formula to determine standard office temperature was developed din the 1960s around the metabolic resting rate of the average forty-year-old, 70 kg male…meaning that current offices are on average five degrees too cold for women.” (pg 113)•	“We continue to rely on data from studies done on men as if they apply to women.” (pg 118) •	“…the common solution is to fix the women. This is unsurprising in a world where what is male is seen as universal and what is female is seen as ‘atypical’.” (pg 123)•	The book details attempts to introduce clean cook stoves in Africa, as the traditional stoves give off toxic fumes. However, no one ever talked to the women in the communities about what they wanted a stove to have, and researchers were shocked when the new stoves were barely used. They said that the women needed to be educated, instead of talking to the women and finding out why the new stoves were a problem. “Nevertheless, the main and repeated recommendation of the report was to fix the women, rather than the stoves.” -THIS! You don’t know how many times this, or similar cases, has come up in my policy classes and people don’t understand that talking to women is needed! You can’t just shove a new policy down foreign women’s throats and expect them to be okay with it.•	Cars:Women are “out of position” drivers due to the fact that cars were designed based on the size of a man. (pg 186)Crash test dummies based on men are almost solely used as the driver. If a female model is used, it’s almost exclusively in the passenger seat, leading us to have little to no data on car crashes and females. (ps 186-188)There’s also no seat belt that works for pregnant women. But seat belts in general “aren’t great for non-pregnant women either: apparently, in an effort to accommodate our breasts many of us are wearing seat belts ‘improperly’ which again, increases our risk of injury (another reason we should be designing explicitly female dummies rather than just smaller male dummies).” (pg 188)•	“Designers may believe they are making products for everyone, but in reality they are mainly making them for men.” (pg 191)•	Ironically, I read this during the 2020 coronavirus outbreak. The book even discusses the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak in China, and how pregnant-women’s health outcomes were not systemically tracked, thus leading to the WHO and other organizations having no idea what the outcomes of SARS are during pregnancy. Females were literally ignored here in the collection of data. (pg 201)•	“…females aren’t even included in animal studies on female-prevalent diseases.” (pg 205)“…when it comes to medical issues that mainly or only affect women, you can forget about including women in trials because here the research is almost lacking altogether.” (pg 229)HOW DID ANYONE THINK THIS WAS A GOOD SCIENTIFIC PRACTICE?!•	Researchers who want to research PMS and potential medicines to treat it are having grants be turned down because the people in charge of the grants (ahem, men) say that “PMS does not actually exist” (pg 229). But yet, a range of medication exists to treat erectile dysfunction.•	In the U.S., married couples have a choice to file a joint tax return or file individually. There are incentives to file together; however, this means that “most married women in the US get over-taxed on their income”. “In short, the current US tax system for married couples in effect penalizes women in paid employment” (pg 258-259).•	Post-disaster relief once again often ignores women and tries to focus on rebuilding the economy and saving lives. These are false premises as women (and their data) are ignored in the processes. Forgetting to build kitchens into homes post-disaster? Yep, men did that without including women in the decision making. Not teaching women to swim and let relying on them to swim to safety? Again, ignoring data. (pg 290)•	“The quarrels of popes and kings, with wars and pestilences, in every page; the men so good for nothing and hardly any women at all – it is very tiresome.” ~ Jane Austin (pg 310)"
54,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5601183-kamila-kunda,5,"“Insivisible Women. Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men” by Caroline Criado Perez is the book meant to be read slowly to fully grasp the enormity of the problem described. Extremely well researched (with 70 pages of endnotes!) it is an exposé of systematic exclusion and discrimination of women in such varied areas as healthcare, government, education, urban planning, agriculture, office workplaces, humanitarian disasters, factories and academia. Some of the injustice done to women is well-known (the prevalence of rape and violence against women, the scale of unpaid work done by women, machine equipment designed with men in mind, or pay gap, to name a few), but the author opened my eyes to many other shocking consequences of data bias against women. I don’t remember the last time I read a book which would make me as angry and as insulted as this one. Insulted not by the author but by the facts she exposed and of which I was unaware.Too often male perspective and experience are thought to represent the whole humanity. Criado Perez rightly points out that this perspective is also often reduced to that of a ‘white man’ and excludes women as well as people (men and women alike) of colour. I see that nearly every day at my workplace, in the media and the city I live in, claiming to be all-inclusive but failing to provide free, safe and easily accessible public restrooms for women (to use just one example). As a man you may start to begin to comprehend your own privilege after reading this book. As a woman you may feel crushed by the enormity of the evidence of discrimination against you and the realisation you were only aware of the tip of the iceberg. It starts with language. Our language shapes our worldview and the way we think and speak about phenomena. Every language has its own idiosyncrasies so it’s hard to generalise, but numerous studies show how language excludes women from the discourse (think about the casual ‘guys’ meant to include women but does it really do it? I personally refuse to use this word unless I really mean only men, in other context it insults women by using a default male gender. In Dutch, e.g., and many other languages, when the gender is unknown people would say ‘he’ by default). All too often we fall prey to gender stereotypes when we speak about professions (even in English in which the majority are gender-neutral). Criado Perez provoked me to think about areas of discrimination I haven’t thought about. I realised how vulnerable I am when it comes to my health due to the lack of sex-disaggregated data in clinical trials - in most cases, regardless of the condition, I would not be given adequate medical advice and the medicine prescribed might actually harm me rather than help me (most medicine is tested almost exclusively on men and e.g. medicine to treat high blood pressure lowers the risk of heart attacks in men but increases the risk of the attacks in women). Quite often in research excluding women - and it is openly admitted by research institutions - is defended by researchers claiming that it is too costly and burdensome to test on women as women are ‘too complicated’ and ‘too atypical’. Strange how 50% of the global population is ‘atypical’, isn’t it?As a woman and part of 50% of the population I realise nearly every day how neglected I am in most areas of life and this book revealed examples of sexism and exclusion of my gender many accept as normal. How much women put up with because they don’t know otherwise? Because since the very beginning the reality around us has been male-centred?Treating men as the ‘default human’ in all spheres of life doesn’t only lead to minor irritations or in inconveniences (as having everything set or hung too high for example), but it puts millions of women at unnecessary risk with regards to their health and life doing such simple activities as driving a car or walking the streets. Not always it is the result of bad intentions; often male ignorance and lack of imagination are the reasons for gender data gap.Criado Perez has a very simple solution to the problem: “When women are involved in decision-making, in research, in knowledge production, women do not get forgotten. Female lives and perspectives are brought out of the shadows.” My only criticism regarding this otherwise brilliant book is, as often in the case of authors from English-speaking countries, too much focus on the Western world and devoting less attention to Asia, Africa and especially South America. However, I admit that much of the data bias applies to the whole world. I strongly encourage everyone to read “Invisible Women” and guarantee you that you will see everything from a fresh perspective. "
55,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63612882-crazytourists-books,5,"Reading this book made me sick, made me want to scream and cry. It's one thing to sense what happens, experience yourself some of the situations described and another thing to be able to view the problem in it's whole magnitude with statistical proof. What happens is outrageous. The bias against women, that deprive their safety, well being, voice, health and even life, is not unconscious. It is a choice made by the males of this planet against the other half of the planet's population as Mrs Criado Perez puts it. They just don't give a damn. But we do, and that is why we should all be feminists and raise our kids to be one.The work done on this book is immense. The list of references is huge, there was a lot of research behind it. It is well written and captivating as well. So there, it is everything a book of this genre should be. Read it people and give it to every man in your life to read as well.

60,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"This book definitely deserves to win Book of the Year for science and technology (nonfiction would have been a better fit but whatever). I wish I could give this 6 stars, and I wish every human around the world would read this book and make themselves aware of the inequalities women around the globe face simply because the world at large has been built for men. This is not necessarily out of malice. Active oppression -- refusing females an education, not allowing them to drive, or confining them to their homes -- is not required for the emergence of gender inequality. Well meaning men have gathered information in order to build things like cars, companies, medicines, and more. The problem is that when they collected this data, they used males as the prototype. Much of the time women's needs don't even occur to them. She used the example of Sheryl Sandberg's pregnancy and its effect on google's policies to make this point. I was most surprised by the data on gender travel patterns and even more surprised by the information about how difficult it can be for women in various parts of the world to find a safe place to go to the bathroom. Even though I was not a fan of Hilary Clinton for president, I was floored by the comments in 2016 about her being unqualified or wanting to be elected simply because she was a woman. She was extremely qualified, certainly far more qualified then the reality tv star we have in the role currently. I was happy to listen to this author address some of the absurd ways Clinton was presented to the public in 2016.Most the research was exceptional. Solid facts paired with keen insights worked to really show just how invisible the male standard is. While the title suggests that the book will be about how invisible women are, and they clearly often are, what it really stressed was how truly invisible our male norms are. For example, the focus, in general, on humans -- humans in the workplace, humans who travel, humans who use the bathroom, humans who work, and on and on -- is based on male humans. It's basically a given. Women are then supposed to assume that this applies to them -- sometimes -- too. (She details the many facts that show it really doesn't). But, if you try to focus on women's issues, it is seen as fringe or niche. A+ for driving this point home. Excellent writing and debating skills went into this book and the result is a truly salient argument that gives voice to the concerns women have while trying to exist in their societies, workplaces, and families. Bravo! I had a few concerns about some things that were presented too simplistically. Sometimes if you are too simplistic about a topic, it takes away from the credibility of the overall argument, because it provides people with opportunities to poke holes in different places in the argument, which to some can serve to weaken the argument overall. One example of something portrayed without real world complexity was her argument about Rosalind Franklin. Franklin definitely does not get the recognition she deserves. There is no doubt about that. However, even though she was the one to take Photo 51, she did not realize the significance of the photo and was unable to, by herself, determine the structure of DNA. What is also true is that Watson could never have, by himself, determined the structure either. He stole, literally broke in and stole Photo 51 from Franklin's office. It is this thievery, and only this thievery that allowed him to discover the structure that won him a Nobel. That is what this author's focus should have been. She could have also focused on how Rosalind Franklin died, because of the dangers of her x-ray crystallography work, and Nobels were not granted posthumously.  Watson was still alive, and with his fame and time on this earth, he chose to belittle the very woman from whom he stole his data that secured him a Nobel. To treat a woman in science, a brilliant woman in science, in such a manner is definitely something that could have and should have been discussed in this book. His autobiography was a #metoo nightmare for the memory of Franklin, whom he disparaged so often throughout his book. Instead, the Franklin example in this book was presented in a simple and basically incorrect way to the reader. It would have been worth it to put more time into that argument. Another example of simplicity was the discussion of exposure to BPA. I think an author who wants to build credibility should at least show that s/he is aware of limitations of the BPA studies. A meta analysis conducted by the government called previous findings into question. The levels previously thought to cause harm were much lower than what the meta analysis found. It is still a debate. While basic chemistry tells us that when heat is applied (think microwave), that heat can act as a catalyst to dissociate specific molecules from a plastic. Humans definitely don't seemed designed to add those molecules to their digestive/ metabolic system. So, high exposure to those molecules still seems concerning to me, whether or not we have figured out just how harmful those molecules are long term or not. When reading about BPA in this book, I got no sense that the author knew about the questionable finding she was presenting as fact. You cannot simply say BPA is harmful. You have to show that it methylates or de-methylates genes in humans or that there is a difference in male and female mice when exposed to BPA. I think it is important to at least seem aware of the limitations of these studies. There were only a few issues like the foregoing. Even with these small issues, this book was much needed, brilliantly executed, and long over due! If I were only allowed to use one word to describe the information brought to light, it would be ""jarring"". I will definitely read books by this author in the future. "
61,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6513370-jess,4,Depressing as fuck and that was before the surprise!pandemic stuff near the end. Very useful to know that all the ways in which the world is clearly not for me are not in my head. 
62,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4318508-sahitya,4,"I have been very interested to read this book since the first time I read the author’s article in the Guardian about the kind of gender data gap that exists in our world and how it affects daily life of women. But I kept putting it off because I knew it would only make me mad and sad. But I finally got my copy from the library and it made me feel everything I expected it to. To start off with the kind of book this is, it’s possible a casual reader will find it dry. It’s very scientific and research oriented, chock full of information about studies and loads of statistics that are important to understand the gravity of the issues that the author is trying to discuss. This can also come across as a little repetitive because ultimately, whatever the topic the author is talking about in a chapter, the conclusion is kinda inevitable. But it’s the overall impact of these statistics and how it feels to read it as a woman that’s impactful even though I’m not a very numbers oriented person. From something as small as the average setting of the air conditioning in a workplace to highly dangerous like misdiagnosis of life threatening heart attacks, the idea that everything is designed and researched keeping an average man in mind is appalling but also not surprising. Right from how we grew up referring to our species as “mankind”, a man has always been the default and we the women, the aberration. And with men at the helm of every power structure since centuries, it’s no wonder that the whole world is designed in a way to make them safe and comfortable, and any noise made by women or institutions asking for more gender specific research and policy are dismissed because women, their bodies, their unpaid labor - everything about them is too different, too atypical. And it just boils my blood that the differences of half of the population are considered atypical and too complicated to be factored into making life impacting decisions, as if only one half of the world deserves to be represented. The author covers a wide range of topics like how the massive amount of unpaid labor by women goes unnoticed and isn’t considered when making any policy decisions regarding social service budgets or infrastructure planning that would benefit their myriad tasks; how much of the industrial or agricultural equipment is made in a way that exacerbates the chance of injury and long term issues for women; how most of the drugs and treatments that we use have never even been tested properly to see how differently they would affect a woman or are they even effective on a female body; how every field of employment including tech and academia is structured in a way that benefits men who can work along hours but never takes into account the massive amounts of additional responsibilities women have to fulfill; how cars are never crash tested with female dummies, particularly drivers which leads to a much higher risk of injury and death. And the list just goes on. But what scares me the most is the rise of using big data and algorithms for making any important decisions in the current day and age. And as men are still the ones in power and the majority in development of these projects, and data actually pertaining to women doesn’t exist - any algorithms developed only exacerbate their existing biases and will harm women in even more substantial ways as the usage of technology keeps increasing. It’s hardly surprising that even algorithms and AI seem to associate the terms doctor, genius and scientist with men while women are confined to nurse, nanny and secretary. To conclude, this is a very informative book and I think everyone who is interested to know how our world works and on what basis decisions are made everyday, should give this a try. It’s not a binge reading kinda book, so it maybe easy to handle in smaller doses. And if you are a woman reading it, I promise it’ll make you very very angry and exasperated and maybe even scared. And while the author keeps mentioning that many of the issues discussed can be mitigated by gathering more gender specific data, none of what is actually happening gave me hope that it’s possible in the near future. So many of the problems could really be solved if the decision makers just listen to women, but are they really ready to? "

Did you know that the army has boots for the arctic, the desert, the jungle, etc., but doesn't have boots in women's sizes (narrower and smaller) because, well, why? This book heightened my awareness and my blood pressure over the usually invisible bias in the world around us. We all have complained, but to see in print all the ways that the world has been designed due to data that ignores women is breathtaking. It isn't just inconvenient, it can be deadly. You bet I'm ready to march--on big pharma, NTSB and the crash test dummies, Apple, Stanley tools, women's pants pocket makers, drugs that haven't been tested on women (remember thalidomide anyone?) safer cars for women, phones that I can use one-handed, tools that fit in my hand, and pockets that hold my smart phone. (Yes, I'm bitter that my phone fell out of my pocket into a toilet and was ruined.) Did I leave anybody out? Just this week we bought a new battery operated leaf blower that is impossible for me to get out of the charger because my hand won't fit around it. And Rick had the misfortune to laugh about it.**This is eye opening and important, but a little dry so I found myself scanning through some sections.

It's about data and the lack of it, so it's filled with statistics and pages and pages of examples. This sometimes resulted in lack of fluidity in reading; it seemed bumpy to me. (I know that may not make sense, but it's how it felt.) I wanted to say ""Alright, already, I get it. Now get to the good parts."" But then I would press on and though there were ever more statistics and examples, the importance of this subject kept emerging and my outrage kept building. The author is very biased, with good reason. And she is very passionate. Other than the nonstop stats, it's a pretty easy book to read. Short and direct. The stats may be tedious sometimes, but they're very important. Because the world is biased against women -- in all countries, in all walks of life, in all spheres of influence, in all occupations. And the data, or lack of it, evidences that bias. In addition, the lack of data makes it difficult, if not impossible, to fight the bias. I recommend this to all thinking women, and to men if you can read it with an open mind. "

There is evidence to support a plethora of hidden biases against women ranging from dismissive healthcare treatment to ill fitting unisex uniforms. However the author also heavily relies on the use of statistics to support her positions but I feel some of those statistics are too limited in scope or generalized to make a strong argument for cause and effect. That is just my opinion though and I am not an expert on the subject. Even so, this is definitely a worthwhile book to read and the information presented in a few chapters mirrored some of my personal experiences. 3.5 stars rounded up to four. The author is also the narrator of the audio version and she does an excellent job. "

'Invisible Women' upends the myth of meritocracy by demonstrating clearly and irrefutably that the world, from the standard size of our phones to the medicine, is not so much consciously biased against women but which has been constantly designed for men, which Perez describes as the 'gender data gap'. Its not so much that everybody-from car manufacturers to governments-consciously choose to ignore women, it is more that thinking of the world from the prism of the male perspective is so deeply embedded within our collective psyche that we are unable to consider the world in any other way, in what is the ultimate case of cultural hegemony. Perez explores everything from the lack of data collection of everything from medicine to farm labour which impacts on their ability to not just make a living, but also to live. Not only that, but she argues that the hidden economy of female labour, from caring to cleaning, to housekeeping to motherhood, is constantly undervaluing not just the female contribution to the economy, but actual measurable GDP; unpaid an unappreciated free female labour is the cog upon which the machinery of society revolves. Women not only have to navigate this, but they also have to circumvent everything from cars not being shaped to accommodate their bodies to transport systems not being designed to account for their social duties and lives, with all of this adding up to a world inimical to their interests. Perez argues for the important of representation, of ensuring women are present at everything from clinical trials to decision making boards to politics to ensure their experiences are accounted for, their needs are men and that we begin to live in a world which begins to have a semblance of equality. "

Whiteness and maleness can only go without saying because most other identities never get said at all. But male universality is also a cause of the gender data gap: because women aren’t seen and aren’t remembered, because male data makes up the majority of what we know, what is male comes to be seen as universal. It leads to the positioning of women, half the global population, as a minority. With a niche identity and a subjective point of view. In such a framing, women are set up to be forgettable. Ignorable. Dispensable–from culture, from history, from data. And so, women become invisible.>The book circles around three key themes that reoccur consistently:The female-specific concerns that men fail to factor in cover a wide variety of areas, but as you read you will notice that three themes crop up again and again: the female body, women’s unpaid care burden, and male violence against women. These are issues of such significance that they touch on nearly every part of our lives, affecting our experiences of everything from public transport to politics, via the workplace and the doctor’s surgery. But men forget them, because men do not have female bodies. They, as we will see, do only a fraction of the unpaid work done by women. And while they do have to contend with male violence, it manifests in a different way to the violence faced by women.And unfortunately tech (AI, big data etc) is part of the problem, not the solution, given the representative figure is even more narrowly defined than by gender, the ""white-male-founder-who-dropped-out-of-Harvard-and-wears-hoodies.""A highly important book - recommended."
73,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38699564-nicole-westen,5,"The number of times Mom and I have stood in a bathroom line and one of us would say 'If women designed bathrooms we wouldn't have this problem.' I'm laughing now at how right I was. The first thing I need to say about this is, if your a feminist guy, you need to read this. Hell, if you're a feminist woman you need to read this! I have so much to say about it, and I probably won't remember half of it, but a lot of things suddenly make sense.Perez mentions how girls are generally pushed out of playground spaces by boys. Well, now I understand why me and my female friends in elementary school stopped playing on the jungle gym. We were either on the swings, or the two big slides or sandbox that stood separate from the jungle gym. Until they got rid of those. Then it was just the swings, which led to quite a bit of competition among the girls to get one, since there were only about 18 or so for half the school. I don't remember playing on the jungle gym after first grade, except when I was at the playground after school. In fact, I remember a lot of girls playing on the black top or somewhere else, instead of the jungle gym.The number of things where we don't actually know the effect on women, particularly in medicine, is frightening. What's sad is that we're trying to fix some of it now... but that's been a lot of women hurt by things designed for men. There are a lot of medications out there were the second most common side effect for women is: the medication just doesn't work. There are medications we're finding out that work for women, but not for men. And we knew about them years ago, but we didn't use them as medication because they didn't work in men. What's pathetic is that when women reported problems with the 'female viagra' that was released back in 2015 the drug manufacturer decided to run a trial to figure out what was what. Well... it included 25 participants... 23 were men... 2 were women... for a drug designed and marketed specifically for women. That blatant stupidity is just mind boggling.And the number of times thing are constructed without consulting women, that create problems that are beyond asinine. After the 2004 tsunami in Sri Lanka emergency housing was being built for the displaced peoples. Women weren't consulted. The resulting houses were built without a kitchen. Pardon the language but how the fuck do you build a house and forget a kitchen?!? And a lot of US aid organizations are too much better, they had out unprepared food to refugee women, but forget to provide fuel or even a way to cook the food.In fact, my Mom and I were just having this conversation. I have loved My Little Pony since I was 2. I collected the 'blind bag' ponies because the took up less space. Hasbro recently discontinued the bag ponies in favor of this little egg box thing with a string you pull. Well, you pull the string and out comes about two tablespoons of paper confetti. I looked at my Mom and said 'A man designed this. This is a mess and completely unnecessary."" To which my Mom replied ""Well, a man won't have to clean up the mess afterwards, so they don't care if it's messy or not.""I loved how Perez included statistics on how much better the country's GDP (which is an arbitrary BS number anyway) when women are in the work force, and the best way to boost GDP for the long run is actually to make sure there is sufficiently affordably child care for women, because not only would that create child care jobs, now women can participate in the workforce, which means more taxes collected by the government, more women with money to spend, which creates more job, ect. Speak to men in a language they understand.There were so many parts of this book that were enlightening and saddening at the same time. I had to remind myself that I'm reading this to make myself more aware, at least, of the world I live in. Some of it I already know (like male bias in autism diagnoses, and how women aren't believed at doctor's offices and suffer debilitating, sometimes deadly consequences as a result), but others, like how men get pain killers for pain, women get antidepressants for pain (in a man's world it makes sense because women obviously can't be in that much pain and they're making it up for attention), to how women are much more likely to die in the event of a natural disaster (in the Sri Lanka tsunami a lot of women drowned because women aren't taught to swim, boys are. And that they cyclones that hit majority Muslim countries result in female death tolls because a) women don't know it's happening because there is not way to reach the women in the home and they have to wait for a man to come and tell them a natural disaster is one the way, and b) in those countries often times women aren't allowed out of the house without a male family member escort, so these women wait in their homes instead of evacuating for a male family member to come and take them to safety).TL;DR: Read this book, educate yourself about the problems in either your life, or the lives of any women that you care about. You could make their life easier, or even save their life. My hope is that if enough people are actually aware of these problems, something might finally begin to change."
74,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1224976-julie,5,"Every human being should read this book. Everyone! There are people who, when they see the topic of this book, will immediately go on the defensive and refuse to even consider reading it, arguing that it's ""man bashing"" or ""angry feminist"". It is neither. Perez does not state men are ""out to get"" women or that these issues stem from men hating women and actively trying to dismiss them. In a way, if that were the case, it would be an easier problem. Instead, the issues stem from men not understanding or considering or even realizing that there are problems in the first place. And when the problems are pointed out - the medicine wasn't tested on women, the bullet proof vest doesn't fit our bodies, the bus route doesn't consider how isolated the bus stops are etc - the men in charge usually go on the defensive and say it's not a big deal or that women should just figure out how to cope. Very rarely is it admitted that women were never even considered during the initial design process and that is where the problem stems from. So frustrating!A big excuse for not considering half the population when designing a new piece of technology or developing a new medicine or passing a law is that ""it's too difficult"" to include the needs of women or that ""it's too expensive"" or ""I don't see the point, don't they want/need what I need?"" Perez shows through mounds of data that this approach is penny wise and pound foolish. Perhaps the initial outlay is more expensive or it will take a few more months to complete, but in the long run, including women not only saves money but makes more money for everyone. Not to mention that now 50% of the world gets to enjoy the same benefits the other 50% currently enjoys.One thing I really appreciated about this book is that Perez is not just reciting a litany of complaints. She has a solution to the issue and it is a simple one. Include more women in the process and then the needs of women will not be ignored. This brings up the hot button word ""diversity"" which to some people means giving unqualified people preference over qualified ones. Through studying reams of data (and also using common sense), this is not the case. You get qualified people who are not all the same, with the same experiences and then you end up with more ideas, more options, more solutions. People who actually live whatever is being considered do, in fact, have relevant to make that someone who has never experienced the issue doesn't know. And they don't know they don't know it! This holds true for everything. Having a committee of people who have only lived in urban environments making choices for rural parts of the country, having a committee of people who aren't parents making choices about raising children, having a committee of people who are able bodied designing something for the disabled, having a committee of men design a product for menstruation....yes, you can have good ideas about something you don't personally experience, but why not include in the group people who do have experience? Why is that so threatening? They could have an insight that you don't have because they have intimate knowledge of the problem. It can only lead to more ideas, more possible solutions.I learned so many random factoids while reading this book and enjoyed telling everyone around me all about it, whether they wanted to hear about it or not lol. Some nuggets from the book:One of the most important things to say about the gender data gap is that it is not generally malicious, or even deliberate. Quite the opposite. It is simply the product of a way of thinking that has been around for millennia and is therefore a kind of not thinking. A double not thinking, even: men go without saying, and women don't get said at all. Because when we say human, on the whole, we mean manIt's not always easy to convince someone a need exists, if they don't have that need themselves.the male experience, the male perspective, has come to be seen as universal, while the female experience--that of half the global population, after all--is seen as niche.Women tend to sit further forward than men when driving. This is because we are on average shorter. Our legs need to be closer to reach the pedals, and we need to sit more upright to see clearly over the dashboard. This is not, however, the ‘standard seating position’. Women are ‘out of position’ drivers. And our deviation from the ""norm"" means that we are at greater risk of internal on frontal collisions.There is plenty of data showing that women have, on average, smaller hands than men, and yet we continue to design equipment around the average male hand#popsugar reading challenge 2020 a book that won an award in 2019(The Royal Society Science book award)"

For those who think women make everything into ""sexism,"" this book will show that we're not exaggerating when we say things need to change.

Gender neutral is not gender equal!Also special shout out to that bit about how it's always the wives doing cards for the husband's family members.

76,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16405333-monika,2,"This book's scope is its ultimate downfall. Perez does a great job in conveying the data that shows that women and women's voices are criminally overlooked in a number of areas; everywhere from town planning, to medical research to politics and work. Unfortunately, this means that the analysis of the book is too shallow, in some topics more than others. And sometimes Perez just melts one point about one study about into another issue so consistently throughout each chapter that it results in mental whiplash.Also, piling on all of these different points in different context all to say the world is sexist is so depressing. And yes, I know this isn't suppose to be a cheery topic but the problem is that chapter after chapter you find out how bad it is and it just makes you feel powerless. Do you feel like you have the power to undermine sexism or sexist attitudes after reading this book? Because I definitely don't. More importantly, Perez doesn't answer the how. How do we change this data gap? And obviously considering the scope of the book, she can't. Each individual topic probably needs a specific resolution from a range of different people. For example, women are consistently excluded from medical studies from preliminary research on mice to human trials. What do we have to do to change that? Would a campaign to create a law against it help? Do female scientist need to raise the issue within the system? Or do we just need more female scientist doing research? And that is just one subtopic in one chapter of the book! At one point I felt like each chapter of the book (some more than others) could be separated into several different chapters more extensively. And on a bit of a side note, Perez mentions that women's unpaid housework should be included in the GDP and then stated some facts about how much GDP of a few countries would increase due to it. But I'm really confused about her point here. Isn't GDP based on what the government, business and people spend money on? So why should the GDP include women's unpaid housework if it is unpaid?In the end, if you haven't read that much feminist literature, this book will probably be mind blowing and infuriating. But at the stage I am now I need more because if I have to read another fucking book reiterating the same facts on sexism in the workplace/politics/general life, I'll cry on Mary Wollstonecraft's grave."

Of course, I had to bring it home. As a scientist, I was extremely pleased with all the research that went into Invisible Women. It is immediately clear that this is very well researched and that Caroline Criado Perez's claims on (unwilling) gender bias are well backed up by the facts. Personally, while it was no surprise that people fail to think of possible problems that do not concern them (for example the parking for pregnant women problem, which went unnoticed until one of the female directors herself was pregnant and encountered it for herself), I was mainly shocked that there was so little data that was grouped per gender. I mean, I have never filled in a single questionnaire about anything without them asking for my gender, so I would guess that this data is available and just goes unused. Which is, as Invisible Women shows, clearly a pity..."
78,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95081667-shane-parrish,5,"Perez examines how male bias often unintentionally creeps into the studies, systems, and algorithms used to collect data. She demonstrates how not factoring in women's needs, their different bodies, and social roles leads to not only negative outcomes for women, but negative second-order effects that impact the environment and economic development. In clear examples, Perez argues that it makes no sense to treat men as the universal, when women make up 50% of the population. The book is also a stark reminder of how our algorithms as only as good as the data they have to work with, and that by not pursuing diversity in our data that reflects the actual diversity of humans we ultimately do everyone a disservice."

"" -- Simone de Beauvoir.Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men is a powerful, data-driving analysis of how human society as a whole, is systematically biased against women, and how the assumption of men as the default sex and the gap in sex-aggregated data is harming women in every aspect of their life and in every corner of the world. The book covers a lot of topics, from the historical image of ""men hunter"" to global politics, from the lack of properly designed female test dummies in car safety tests to the ignorance of sex difference in medical research, and from the garbage-in-garbage-out data bias in high-tech industry to consistent blindspot in world humanitarian aids. High-tech and machine learning won't fix the pre-existing bias--on the contrary, they amply it. This is a topic I know very well. A main focus in the book is politics. A 2015 McKinsey study shows globally 75% unpaid work is done by women. The author argues that policy makers often overlook women's needs and disregard their role in unpaid work such as childcare and elder care, therefore make policies that overwhelmingly punish women especially during economical downturn.

81,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4785714-lily,3,"This book was both interesting and anger-inducing in its discussions. As someone who's been thinking about gender a long time, it still baffled me seeing it all written down how much of society is biased towards men and how many things I've just become used to working around as a woman exist because of this bias. It also was able to put into words the idea that gender-neutral is in fact male biased, which i appreciated. However, I did feel towards the end it was getting a bit repetitive and long, which I guess is difficult to avoid with a book of this nature. However, for me, a book that tackles gender and inequality in 2019 should not be as cis-centric as this is. This book almost exclusively concentrates on cis, heterosexual people, and makes no mention of the experiences of trans, non-binary and intersex identities. I understand that including a large discussion may have been difficult due to the lack of data, but I would've liked to have seen an acknowledgement of this throughout the book, rather than these identities just being skipped over altogether. Gender and sex were also sometimes used interchangeably, even though the author clarifies in the introduction that they are not, and sex is treated very much as a binary entity - which, we of course know, it is not.

Sexual violence against women and the devaluing of their unpaid care work are two other major themes. I enjoyed some of the examples, such as 90% of Iceland’s women taking a day off in 1976, with this “Long Friday” leading to definitive, discrimination-ending legislation. However, this is all the kind of information you’d read a long magazine article about, rather than a whole book."

If this doesn't inspire anger and heartbreak at the omission of the female experience from the structure of the modern world, I don't know what will. I only hope that this book doesn't simply preach to the converted. It needs to be read by politicians, medical practitioners, clinical researchers, city/town planners, business leaders, HR directors, and more."

And to those holding off because of the size, it's only 380 pages (the rest is notes and references). And you shouldn't read it because you're a feminist, but because understanding how thoroughly the world and everything in it, down to aid efforts are designed (by and) for men. And it is literally killing women, but if that is not motivation enough for you, it is also holding back humankind from using all resources and potentials."

After reading and reviewing this book, I’ve been informed that the author is a TERF so I don’t recommend it.——— ""Humanity is male and man defines woman not in herself, but as relative to him; she is not regarded as an autonomous being… He is the Subject, he is the Absolute - she is the Other."" - Simone de Beauvoir   Invisible Women  presents comprehensive data gaps and bias that prove women's health and safety are constantly at risk in a world designed by and for men. If you are a woman, a lot of the information and discussion in this book isn't surprising but it will make you angry and, at times, sad.Women are on average smaller in size as compared to men yet most technological advances use average sized men to test for function and comfort. For instance, why are doors so heavy? Why do we use antiquated data based on 70 kg, 40 year old men to regulate standard office temperatures? Why are we obsessed with large smart phone screens that half of the population can't operate with one hand? In every case it's because men center themselves and don't consider half of the globe's population. The bias and evidence presented here doesn't blame women for their smaller bodies. On the contrary, the problem is the social meaning attached to women and the consequences for negligence.As women, we constantly manage inconveniences because the world just doesn't consider us. There are so many trivial examples in this book that highlight the larger issues over and over. In some instances, these inconveniences accumulate, compound, and magnify to threats of death for women around the globe. Perez considers the global effects in many areas including occupational design, urban planning, technological advancements, politics, medicine, and disaster relief.This book reads like a series of few long form journalism think pieces. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but it starts to wear on you because it's facts, on top of facts, on top of facts. It can be sobering to hear how many varied and nuanced ways in which the world doesn't consider you a priority. At other times, it's extremely fascinating. Here are a few examples:On unpaid work: ""Globally, 75% of unpaid work I done by women, who spend between three and six hours per day on it compare to men's average of thirty minutes to two hours. This imbalance starts early(girls as young as five do significantly more household chores than their brothers) and increases as they get older."" On the myth of meritocracy: ""An analysis of 248 performance reviews collected from a variety of US-based tech companies found that women receive negative personality criticism than men simply don't. Women are told to watch their tone, to step back. They are called bossy, abrasive, strident, aggressive, emotional and irrational."" On one-size-fits-men: ""The average smartphone is now 5.5 inches, and while we're admittedly all extremely impressed by the size of our screen, it's a slightly different matter when it comes to fitting into half the population's hands (not to mention minuscule or non-existent pockets). The average man can fairly comfortably use his device one-handed - but the average woman's hand is not much bigger than the handset itself."" On medicine: ""Historically it's been assumed that there wasn't anything fundamentally different between male and female bodies other than size and reproductive function, and so for years medical education has been focused on a male 'norm,' with everything that falls outside that designated 'atypical' or even 'abnormal'."" On disaster relief:  ""The irony of excluding women's voices when it all goes wrong is that it is exactly in these extreme contexts that old prejudices are least justified, because women are already disproportionately affected by conflict, pandemic and natural disaster… And while men and women suffer from the same trauma, forcible displacement, injury and death, women also suffer from female-specific injustices."" The one major critique I have for this book is the missed opportunity to address data gaps regarding nonbinary/ gender nonconforming folks, and trans women. This book doesn't consider gender outside of the binary understanding of men and women. That was a constant thought in the back of my mind and a nod to the lack of data would've been nice. I can understand that this data may not even exist but it felt like a misstep to disregard any mention of this community when they are at even higher health and safety risks at just about every facet of life. I found this book to be very comprehensive and was pleasantly surprised that Perez considers international data, women of color, disable women, and others that could easily be forgotten.The overall message of this book is in order to step towards equality we must close the gender data gap and make lasting changes in policy. We have a long way to go but there's lot of evidence here to spark some interest and I'm glad I read this book."
94,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50893748-alejandra,5,Utterly brilliant and necessary to understand a man’s world. I’m impressed about the data and research behind this text. Five stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 
95,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7364359-sunil,5,"Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men, by Caroline Criado Pérez, is an incredible, essential book that should be read by everyone. That's it, that's my review.Okay, fine, I'll say more, but seriously. I heard about this book via 99% Invisible, where the author spoke about just two examples of the titular data bias—snow-clearing patterns and heart attack symptoms—and I'm very glad I read the whole book because wow, it's full of so many more.Criado Pérez begins her Introduction with ""Seeing men as the human default is fundamental to the structure of human society"" and then proceeds to support her assertion with data. It's something we're surely aware of, but it's sobering (and often surprising) to see just how insidious and pervasive this data bias is. She then presents even more data as she drills down into how women have been systematically (intentionally or not) excluded from various facets of the world from urban planning and the workplace to medicine and disaster relief. I know ""data"" makes it sound like this book is just a series of statistics, but the brilliance of Criado Pérez's writing is how she effortlessly weaves these statistics into an incredibly readable format—along with the occasional humorous authorial insertion—that follows from one point to the next. She makes the connections between cause and effect, bringing in interviews with experts who validate and explain her findings and, more importantly, offer methods of improvement.Which is the best part about this book—far from being simply a pointed observation of how fifty percent of the population are treated like an alien minority (and oh boy, it is that), it continually shines a light on a potential path forward. Honestly, it began to feel like the only way to make things right was to burn it all down and start over, but Criado Pérez frequently shows the very easy ways to close this data gap (""ask women"" is not that hard, guys). Not just hypothetical suggestions either, but evidence of results where these tactics have been employed.In addition, Criado Pérez stresses that the greater inclusion of women benefits everyone, not just women. (Even though for anyone with a conscience, benefiting women should be enough as this data gap is literally killing them.) For instance, capitalism is certainly a reason for many of these issues, but providing child care services and increasing the number of women in the workplace would actually increase the GDP! Everybody wins! In the snow-clearing example I mentioned above, changing the snow-clearing pattern resulted in fewer accidents and thus a decrease in the healthcare burden on the state—let me tell you, this book is also a great argument for universal healthcare as it provides the government a financial incentive for public safety.In her Afterword, Criado Pérez lays out the three major trends she found to be responsible for the data gap. First, the female body is not studied as distinctly different from the male body. (Admittedly, this exposes one of her data biases, as she never addresses trans women in the book.) Second, the threat of male sexual violence against women is not accounted for when men design the world. Third, women's unpaid labor is ignored. This is an extensively researched book, with 70 pages of Endnotes following 320 pages of text. It's hard not to walk away convinced of her findings. It's certainly made me think about the world differently and consider how my own biases could be continuing to contribute to the problem. So I'll just say it again:Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men, by Caroline Criado Pérez, is an incredible, essential book that should be read by everyone."
96,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73340606-forest-handford,1,"While I like what Caroline Criado-Perez said in her 99% Invisible interview, I discovered, as I started to read her book, Invisible Women, she completely omits intersex and non-binary people. I made excuses for her to do this, like they are a small percentage of the population and women are 50%. Then my friend Emily asked me how I was liking the book because her view of the author was that Criado-Perez was ""TERFy"". That stands for trans-exclusionary radical feminist. Well, it turns out the author is a TERF and is also racist. I absolutely cannot support a book about bias by someone who has so much bias. Here is an open letter from The CUSU Women's Campaign asking for the author to not be allowed to speak at the ""Women of the World"" festival: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0jb...Thank you Emily for helping to enlighten me. I was sad at first to discover this. I was turned off from JK Rowling over the summer when I discovered she is a TERF. I was hoping that Emily was operating on out-dated information, but it's clear 5 years ago Caroline was still a TERF, despite acting like a friend to trans folk:https://weekwoman.wordpress.com/2015/...If Caroline were to have apologized since, I could let it go, but she hasn't. Sure, we (trans women) were born in a position of power. I hated it though. I hated seeing other women oppressed. When I went to the Women's March in DC I purposely made myself look as cis male appearing as possible because I wanted to make counter protesters and police think twice about harming the women I was with.I also hated how being assigned male at birth put me into a box. I alone should define me.A book I can firmly recommend is ""Excluded: Making Feminist and Queer Movements More Inclusive"" by Julia Serano. I read this book in Library Camp at Firefly. It talks about how lesbian and dyke communities used to exclude trans women but would include trans men! For example, Mitchfest was a music festival that only allowed ""womyn born womyn."" It makes no sense to include trans men in a women's space and exclude trans women!I equate TERFs to racists among the suffragettes, like Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Some of the suffragists justified their actions by saying it would be too complicated to include black women in the movement. Some were just plain racist and I cannot excuse, and Stanton is one of them. There were some, however, who were not racist and fought for female inclusion.I'm sure there are ways it can be said that I am making a false analogy. Regardless of how much male privilege I may still be profiting from, I certainly have white privilege.When I am mistreated as a woman I'm likely to say something, because I know how I should be treated. If I see other women mistreated, be they my CEO, my daughter, the next president, my female employees, my mother, or even Criado-Perez, I'm likely to say something even if they don't want my help. Despite the awful things Criado-Perez says about trans women, I would stick up for her human rights. Maybe the knowledge and power I have to help women only comes from having lived like a man, but isn't that knowledge and power helpful to us women? I say yes.As for Criado-Perez's book, I was in the sample section. I will read no more of it and I will never pay money for it. I cannot accept a book about bias by a TERF and a racist."

To paraphrase Biggie, I didn't know, but now I know..... or at least have a better understanding of how much I don't know about the reality of life for women living in a world designed around the default male.

Maybe I got a bit tired of the subject or maybe this one does have indeed so many numerical information, it was the least good of the three. It does raise some important good questions, for example, I am a supporter of taking down gender notification on public transportation cards and I get annoyed when shops ask for my gender(and give me 2 options only) when I buy stuff online. But this book raise the concern that we also need segregated data to get the right data and I totally agree with that too. but segregated how? sex or gender? This book is very cis-centrred and there is NOT ONE mention about the existance of transgender women and men and I find it a miss."

I couldn't put it down and not because it was so good (well, the writing and humour was), but the contents were shocking, mind-blowing, infuriating, depressing, and so much more. As a woman, so much in this book resonated with me (unfortunately). It did leave me with a bit of an unsecure and depressing mood, because so much in this world is designed for and researched on the default human: the male. It feels so unjust, lazy, arrogant that for centuries, this has been the way to approach things, but even more so when you think about (and read about) the fact that - despite that we now know that leaving women out of the equation negatively impacts ALL humans, not just women - nothing has really changed. The few initiatives that currently exist the gender data gap are mostly initiated by women and most of these initiatives get then shut down by men. Men need to get off their high horses and realise that 'women's rights are human rights and human rights are women's rights' (Hillary Clinton) and that gender neutrality does not mean gender equality. This is a well-researched book and I like that Perez also included the fact that black, Asian, or disabled women are even more disadvantaged in comparison to white women. Perez's humourful (and at times sarcastic) writing style made the facts bearable to read. I'm hoping especially that more men will pick up this book and other books like it, because we women can't do it all om our own. I'm rating this book with ★★★★★"

If you don’t specifically look for it, unconscious male bias in everything from medical research to safety gear, to availability of toilets seems like a far-fetched concept. But then you start thumbing through hundreds of pages of supporting evidence, it’s hard to remain sceptical. Everything in this book just makes sense. The only criticism I have is how overwhelming the data becomes after a while. Chapter after chapter of thorough statistics and unmistakable frustration tucked in between the lines can be quite an exhausting read. "
110,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4780341-alexandra,5,"This book should be read by anyone making policy, collecting data, or using data, about humans. Politicians, business people, public servants, medical researchers: all of them. This book made me angry. That's important to know. It's also important to know that it was, mostly, good angry: it was appropriate and it makes me want to do something, although I'm not sure what.I came across this book thanks to two Galactic Suburbia listeners, which is hilarious all by itself - that they both thought this book should be brought to our attention, and acted on that. It is, of course, exactly up our alley, and so I bought it. The subtitle to the book is ""Exposing data bias in a world designed for men,"" and together with the title this does tell you exactly what the book is about. It's about showing both how women are invisible - if data is not sex-disaggregated, if only men are tested or questioned or used - and data bias: men are assumed to be representative of humanity, men's opinions are assumed to be representative (because they're not thought of as men's opinions), and so on. The results are devastating. The results in the book itself are devastating, for me - the extent to which women's experiences are ignored, sex differences are ignored where they do actually matter (eg medication - the typical fat/muscle ratio in men and women is different, which means differences in how medications affect them), and so on. The results in real life are also devastating: only using male crash-test dummies in cars means cars aren't safety tested for women, and cars aren't safety designed for women (smaller on average, different bodies, etc); safety vests not fitting over boobs; building relief housing after disasters with no kitchens. So, yes, I got angry. I also got angry when Perez pointed out the areas where the data does exist, but it's been ignored: mandating paid parental leave is good for the economy; how about anatomy diagrams that only show male bodies? And the areas where, because it's a female-only issue (like PMS, or endometriosis) the research just hasn't been done. Perez, I imagine, also got angry when she was doing the exhaustive research needed for this book. There's a lot of data, and a lot of footnotes. She's also making firm, reasonable, and clear demands for change, and pointing out some ways that those changes could happen. Many of the changes will be hard: can you imagine what it would take to mandate political parties having genuine female representation? However, her data on what happens in countries that have increased female political representation is, to my mind, compelling; increased expenditure on education, for instance, and - unsurprisingly - issues that specifically affect women more than men: family planning, for instance, and policies around care. And anyone who thinks that these issues don't need to be political ones, when they affect 50% of the population, needs to have a good hard think about whether they're a misogynist. Perez also suggests some ways in which more, better, and new data can be collected... but it's going to be a long hard slog to make the necessary changes, in the vast areas of data collection that exist now, before those changes are fully realised. This is a brilliant book. "

It had a good structure as these books should and all that stuff.However, some things bothered me and I was considering bumping it down to two stars. For one, you don't need twenty pieces of evidence for every claim you make. Just putting that out there. I really didn't want to dislike this book, but come on. Really? I can't take any more of it.Second: using language as an example of the 'default male'? You're on very thin ice. For background, this chapter was the introduction and explained how in languages such as Spanish, males are dominant. For example, if you have a room full of a thousand female professors, you would say  'las profesoras'  but the moment you add in just one male to the group it becomes  'los profesores'  . I understand that it's not quite fair, but: a) languages were made quite a while ago when the world was very unjust, but unless you're making the point that these problems have existed for quite a while (which was not the case) don't use it.b) what is the alternative? To have females be powerful ones? Then we'd have the same problem. Are you suggesting we change it? Do you know how hard it is to change a language? c) how does that have to do with the rest of the book?Third: some things were so dramatic and drawn out and over-the-top. And books like these, in my opinion, should not have that problem.I do technically identify as a feminist, but I cannot stand when someone is making an argument and brings in vaguely related topics as evidence and gets emotional. No thank you.All in all, it was an interesting book. I just didn't love it for these reasons. What brought it up from two stars to three was that it's a topic that needs more to be known about it."

The synopsis sums it up well. Be warned- reading this book will make you angry and outraged! There’s some really shocking parts to it which I can’t say I enjoyed reading as such, but I did find hugely interesting.Some sections I found less gripping than others, but I absolutely loved the ‘Daily Life’, ‘The Workplace’, ‘Going to the Doctor’ and ‘Design’ sections. It’s packed full of facts and references, and quotes that I had to keep stopping to write down. Here’s just a few of them:Globally 75% of work is done by women. Who spend between 3 and 6 hours per day on it compared to men’s average of 30 mins – 2 hours. The imbalance starts early (girls as young as five some significantly more household chores than their brothers) and increases as they get older.PMS affects 90% of all women but is chronically under-studied: one research round-up found five times as many studies on erectile dysfunction than on PMS.Because of this, it took me way longer to read this book than my usual fiction reads – I wanted to make sure I was really taking in and processing every paragraph.Invisible Women a fascinating read and I really recommend this to anyone (whatever gender) as it really opens your eyes to ways that this world is designed around, and for, men instead of women – despite women making only just under 50% of the world’s population.When you get reaaaally angry at something you’ve just read in this book, take a deeeeep breath and read on… because this is all real life, unfortunately!"

Reading this book is a lot like experiencing these events, but worse...so much worse, and I can think of no response better than anger and frustration. Invisible Women discusses a data gap that is more than concerning, it's frightening. It unveils truths about many of our existing systems that I thought were safe, fair, and uncompromised to now discover that all of it was false. The author also reveals how most information we have regarding everything from the interview process, to manufacturing cars, to illnesses is misleading and quite problematic. After learning about the gender data gap and coming to terms with the unrepresentative and non-disaggregated information we have, one can only respond with anger. Anger because I thought we were better than this. Anger because we should be better than this. Everyone should read this book - go read this book"
116,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5071202-amy-neftzger,5,"This is a thought provoking book that draws attention to how we rely on data that may not be representative of the whole population and that research findings may not be valid for specific segments. In a world that relies heavily on science to guide decisions in fields from healthcare to marketing, this is an enormous problem. There are business implications to ignoring a substantial portion of the population, especially if that market segment makes most of the purchasing decisions with a household. It's time that women are included in research studies along with men in proportions that match the population. Anything less should be considered as substandard scientific methodology if the goal is to generalize to the population.This book was very insightful. I was happy to see it written and that someone was drawing attention to this persistent issue.Note: I was given a free ARC of this title by the publisher in exchange for an honest review."

I often read reviews where people say ""everyone needs to read this book"", but I have never felt the need to say that about any book I have read...Until this one. Criado Perez covers a wide range of situations, and the depth of her research is evident. I was impressed with the organisation of the book, despite the breadth of material covered, which is something often lacking in books as ambitious as this one. Criado Perez is clear and engaging. She strikes the right balance in her use of statistics, and she asks the right questions. I especially loved that she was able to convey her passion for her subject matter without compromising her objectivity.

While the topic is extremely important and the provided examples overwhelming and terrifying, I have issues with this book not being trans-inclusive. In fact, the language used by the author actively erases nonbinary individuals and the bit about gender neutral toilets sounds even a bit TERFy. You can't just write a book about data bias regarding one gender and then completely erase another gender(s).

And the thing is, I already knew some of the stuff that would be in here, particularly about the health data gap because I've seen plenty about that myself just in life. But reading about all the ways in which women are left out sometimes unintentionally, other times because they are too ""complicated"" or ""hormonal"" or are simply not considered the default, is extremely disheartening. We obviously have a long way to go. Women are left out of the equation in everything from how cities are designed to how cell phones are designed.The author does state the obvious solution. Ask more women. Be more intentional about including women. But when she also points out how female politicians face more vitriol, harassment, and violence the more visible they become (so, the more women there are in places like the House of Reps for example, the more of this behavior- often including from their own male colleagues- exists) it makes it easy to feel like just asking and including women won't be enough. Some men really do not want to ask or include women. And can you blame them? They've grown up believing they're the default, especially if they're white, so it's going to take a much larger-scale structural and societal change, in my opinion. I wish that there were more potential answers presented for this besides just asking women.None of the information in this book surprises me, even the new things I learned- and I learned a lot- but maybe that's because I'm a woman. Like I said, it made me insanely mad. Some of the stuff stated in here is so obvious to me, but because there's a gender data gap, men don't realize it, simply because it isn't their lived experience. And when more men are in power these things get overlooked (usually unintentionally) and then women have to deal with the unintended consequences. I did find it to be a bit long, and towards the middle, I was having trouble focusing. It sort of made me feel fatigued or burnt out. There's just so much information in here, and none of it is particularly great. I almost think ignorance is bliss in this case if you're a woman. For example, is it really helpful for me to be thinking about how my car's safety was likely only tested on dummies based on the male body as I'm driving 70mph on the highway? Not really. If anything, I would say this book is more important for men to read than women, and I would recommend it with that caveat.Still, four stars mainly because of the sheer amount of new facts I learned, the vast majority of which have just made me a more aware human being if nothing else. This book really drives home the point that women, despite the way society acts, are half of the human species. Men are not the ""default."""

""One of the most important things to say about the gender data Gap is that it is not generally malicious, or even deliberate. Quite the opposite. It is simply the product of a way of thinking that has been around for millennia and is therefore a kind of not thinking. A double not thinking, even: men go without saying, and women don't get said at all. Because when we say human, on the whole, we mean man"".

Caroline Criado Perez explores and presents how the world has always been shaped by men's perspectives & have produced almost all our systems, even those used and meant for women. Best is that she presents this with the use of data - authentic, reliable, and intersectional. .Think about this: Medicines which are meant to be used only by pregnant women are clinically trailed on men. Because women mensurate and it fluctuates data, and hence more work for men. .Or this: Cars seat belts are always tested and designed to suit men, although increasingly more and more women drive. Why? Because women have boobs and they still don't have an authentic design of a seat belt to help women better.Or this worse case: What are the symptoms that one has a heart attack? You say that you have pain on your left arm. False. That's a symptom only for men. For women, the symptoms are completely different and hence more than 40% of women who has heart attack goes undiagnosed and eventually dies.This book is great because it tells you how the world is designed by men, for men, not because men are wicked/evil, but because men and women have ingrained unconscious bias which constricts them to imagine a system enabling only men. Much of this bias is also propagated by lack of data or data which is not segregated on the basis of gender, thereby keeping women in dark shadows for centuries.This is a book which makes you angry but for all the right reasons. It made me realize all the bias I hold against women, against my own self. This will be a book I will go again and again. Empowering, passionate, and hardcore woman-like. Just badass!"
130,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33398563-emma,4,"This was such an interesting book! I was already a feminist before, but after reading this book I am even more convinced of the cause. That is not to say that I am anti-man and all that, I just want equal opportunities, research, and possibilities for and about women. And as some men may be surprised to hear, even nowadays that is not the case.As the author put it: “women are not small men”. We have a different body composition, biology, body shape and much more. However in research, people most often work with male data, of which the results are then later extrapolated to also apply to females. This is not how research is supposed to work!!!!Although the book was a bit data heavy (duh!) and it felt a bit repetitive to read about statistics over and over again, I would still recommend this book! I think the mis- and underrepresentation of women in statistics is a very important issue that most people don’t think about when they think about feminism. I know I didn’t!"

This book made me angry, it made me upset, and by the end it made me hopeful for a better world. However, I wish the author was more inclusive when she talked about sex and gender. Especially for trans folks and people who identify themselves as queer or non binary. Nevertheless, I think this book should be read by everybody at least once!

My main gripe is with the execution. A lot of chapters just felt like an overwhelming parade of statistics connected loosely by each chapter's topic. Most of the examples presented are really eye-opening and often maddening, but by the middle of each chapter they all sort of start to blur together. Ah yes, the 50th example of how pharmaceutical researchers failed to test their drug on enough women and are now giving women dosages based off of the male physique. Something like that.Maybe the author could have spent more time giving each statistic life, but obviously that would have ended up in a much longer book. At the end of the book, the author does tie everything together very nicely, concluding with three main ways that research and policy often fail to take into account women's bodies and experiences."

For example, sex and gender are used interchangeably almost all the time throughout the book, which just doesn’t sit right with me, especially considering how the data gap is never really addressed in relation to trans or non-binary people. At first I was making apologies by rationalizing the lack of mentions to everything outside of the binary. Not delving into these issues was surely just another consequence of the gender data gap since there is probably not a lot of data to analyse, right? But honestly, that’s a lousy excuse for not even including the rare data that does exist. If you’re going to argue that the data gap is detrimental to people, I think it should be in your interest to not exclude anyone from your own examination of the shortcomings of modern research that are still persisting. Even if there was never any quantitative research done on a subject, I’m almost sure there is at least some qualitative research or writing you can find to at least bring attention to the issue.In retrospect, this exclusionist approach soured my overall experience with the book. Because it does target relevant social topics. It discusses how the failure to include research negatively impacts women’s lives and it dismantles systemic sexism and it sheds light on discrimination that’s often goes unnoticed because it is so mundane. But it is also really, really bad at being inclusive in its dissection of gender discrimination, and in my opinion a book like this simply cannot be."

Fine, Siri and Alexa might understand me better, and my Fitbit might be more accurate, if I was a man. But the section on the lack of data related to the effects of medication, vaccines, and other medical treatments on women was downright terrifying. Listening to the author (writing in 2018) worry about the impacts this will have in “the next pandemic” made me shiver.Minus one star for the portions of the book assuming that “women” are synonymous with “women in heterosexual relationships who have children.” NOT because unpaid caregiving responsibilities aren’t a very very important part of the conversation, which absolutely should be emphasized and studied. These aspects just don’t correlate AS directly to gender as some of the other topics covered, and that should be acknowledged."

142,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1863589-robert-sheard,3,"This is a difficult book to evaluate because, while I completely agree with her overriding premise and multiple conclusions, it reads like you would expect a meta-study to read–as a compendium of statistics, citations, and references. (There are roughly 100 pages of notes.) In other words, it's tedious to read, even though I think it's essential for anyone in policy, product development, research, and government to address these vital issues. I do have two qualms with the book, which led me to rate it slightly lower than I might have otherwise. In a work which has as its central premise that data in our world is based on the erroneous assumption that ""average male"" represents everyone, Criado-Perez makes a slew of sweeping generalizations herself. In addition, she makes some factual analyses that are simply wrong, although they're minor in scope and don't wipe away the value of her overall work. (e.g., her analysis of the US Income Tax ""married filing jointly"" is simply incorrect.)"

That said, it felt like a glaring omission considering this is focused on showing the data gaps between women and men, and because it talks about violence and every day sexism against women, which includes trans women. I know this won't bother some people, but it definitely made me question what data she left out of the book, and took me out of the information multiple times as I wondered if the info provided accounted for different races, classes, sexual orientation, etc. There are lots of places where she does not touch on factors for women that have specific data that could differ from another group of women. For example, there was a study from a few years ago that said bisexual women are more likely to suffer from depression than straight women or lesbians. In a book focused on the gender data gap, I would expect to see information like this too, but this book was definitely lacking in this department. She did talk about African American women dying more from childbirth complications, but it was surprisingly short considering the severity of the topic. In the pros column, I did learn a lot. There were things I knew about, like the info about rape and drug trials, but I was surprised by some parts. The city planning info, the info about voice recognition tech, and the info on motion sickness from vr, the car info, & similar stuff was all really interesting and frustrating.

I know that cars are designed for men much bigger than I. I know that women are raped by men far more than men are raped by women. I know other there is unrealized bias by teachers in favor of boys in school. But I knew little about the huge data bias. Suddenly I understand why the voice control for our cable television fails to recognize my commands. When I used that as one example of what I was learning as I read this book by demonstrating its failure to correctly identify the word I was saying, my husband, one of the most unbiased persons I know, explained that I just wasn't doing it right - I needed to do it like he did. We have a long way to go yet women.The scariest thing I learned in this book concerned the lack of medical data concerning women and how very different from a medical aspect women are from men. OK, I know health insurance companies and employers discriminated -- why are men's Viagra prescriptions covered and women's birth control pills not? -- but I did not appreciate how lacking the data was for women, especially for things that only impact women. I am more than ever convinced now that I will never take a drug to lower blood pressure! Never again will I trust the safety ratings for cars. Who knew that women crash test dummies were never used until 2017 and when they were, the 5 star rating for the passenger door of one model dropped to 2 stars? And now I have a better understanding about why those 3-D glasses at the museum made me nauseous and why it takes me so long to regain my balance after a week on a cruise ship (one reason why I don't cruise!).

Given that the people most likely to change their names are women upon marriage, but the designers of IT systems are predominantly men, it could be the case.While reading about the disadvantages I face in all areas of life because of the gender data gap is infuriating (and downright terrifying when it comes to medical science and knowing I might die because the male default determined the dosage of my medication), knowing is the first step to fixing, so I am glad I read this book."

169,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65647396-michelle,0,"*no rating because i feel like rating this book would be a problematic thing to do*Although I appreciate the insight i gained on the deficits of data collection when it comes to gender, I can’t shake the feeling that this book is somewhat TERF-y in its approach. For example, sex and gender are used interchangeably almost all the time throughout the book, which just doesn’t sit right with me, especially considering how the data gap is never really addressed in relation to trans or non-binary people. At first I was making apologies by rationalizing the lack of mentions to everything outside of the binary. Not delving into these issues was surely just another consequence of the gender data gap since there is probably not a lot of data to analyse, right? But honestly, that’s a lousy excuse for not even including the rare data that does exist. If you’re going to argue that the data gap is detrimental to people, I think it should be in your interest to not exclude anyone from your own examination of the shortcomings of modern research that are still persisting. Even if there was never any quantitative research done on a subject, I’m almost sure there is at least some qualitative research or writing you can find to at least bring attention to the issue.In retrospect, this exclusionist approach soured my overall experience with the book. Because it does target relevant social topics. It discusses how the failure to include research negatively impacts women’s lives and it dismantles systemic sexism and it sheds light on discrimination that’s often goes unnoticed because it is so mundane. But it is also really, really bad at being inclusive in its dissection of gender discrimination, and in my opinion a book like this simply cannot be."
170,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2382980-molly,4,"Everyone should read at least a portion of this book. I’m shocked (I shouldn’t be, but I am) at how much of the world actively ignores - or, at best, doesn’t think about including - data from women. Fine, Siri and Alexa might understand me better, and my Fitbit might be more accurate, if I was a man. But the section on the lack of data related to the effects of medication, vaccines, and other medical treatments on women was downright terrifying. Listening to the author (writing in 2018) worry about the impacts this will have in “the next pandemic” made me shiver.Minus one star for the portions of the book assuming that “women” are synonymous with “women in heterosexual relationships who have children.” NOT because unpaid caregiving responsibilities aren’t a very very important part of the conversation, which absolutely should be emphasized and studied. These aspects just don’t correlate AS directly to gender as some of the other topics covered, and that should be acknowledged."

172,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1863589-robert-sheard,3,"This is a difficult book to evaluate because, while I completely agree with her overriding premise and multiple conclusions, it reads like you would expect a meta-study to read–as a compendium of statistics, citations, and references. (There are roughly 100 pages of notes.) In other words, it's tedious to read, even though I think it's essential for anyone in policy, product development, research, and government to address these vital issues. I do have two qualms with the book, which led me to rate it slightly lower than I might have otherwise. In a work which has as its central premise that data in our world is based on the erroneous assumption that ""average male"" represents everyone, Criado-Perez makes a slew of sweeping generalizations herself. In addition, she makes some factual analyses that are simply wrong, although they're minor in scope and don't wipe away the value of her overall work. (e.g., her analysis of the US Income Tax ""married filing jointly"" is simply incorrect.)"

176,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3127698-meaghan,3,"If this book had said more clearly that it would solely focus on cis women and cis men, and then did mention that statistics are not available for trans or nonbinary people for these topics, or that there was not enough of that data to be used for this book in a way that was credible, this would be a five for me and I would be highly recommending it to my friends. That said, it felt like a glaring omission considering this is focused on showing the data gaps between women and men, and because it talks about violence and every day sexism against women, which includes trans women. I know this won't bother some people, but it definitely made me question what data she left out of the book, and took me out of the information multiple times as I wondered if the info provided accounted for different races, classes, sexual orientation, etc. There are lots of places where she does not touch on factors for women that have specific data that could differ from another group of women. For example, there was a study from a few years ago that said bisexual women are more likely to suffer from depression than straight women or lesbians. In a book focused on the gender data gap, I would expect to see information like this too, but this book was definitely lacking in this department. She did talk about African American women dying more from childbirth complications, but it was surprisingly short considering the severity of the topic. In the pros column, I did learn a lot. There were things I knew about, like the info about rape and drug trials, but I was surprised by some parts. The city planning info, the info about voice recognition tech, and the info on motion sickness from vr, the car info, & similar stuff was all really interesting and frustrating. There wasn't any time I was bored, or where I found it dry. I thought the information was presented in a clear and easy to understand fashion. "
177,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4999879-lindaj,5,"Now this is a book that got my blood roiling. I've experienced minor gender discrimination at work. I know that cars are designed for men much bigger than I. I know that women are raped by men far more than men are raped by women. I know other there is unrealized bias by teachers in favor of boys in school. But I knew little about the huge data bias. Suddenly I understand why the voice control for our cable television fails to recognize my commands. When I used that as one example of what I was learning as I read this book by demonstrating its failure to correctly identify the word I was saying, my husband, one of the most unbiased persons I know, explained that I just wasn't doing it right - I needed to do it like he did. We have a long way to go yet women.The scariest thing I learned in this book concerned the lack of medical data concerning women and how very different from a medical aspect women are from men. OK, I know health insurance companies and employers discriminated -- why are men's Viagra prescriptions covered and women's birth control pills not? -- but I did not appreciate how lacking the data was for women, especially for things that only impact women. I am more than ever convinced now that I will never take a drug to lower blood pressure! Never again will I trust the safety ratings for cars. Who knew that women crash test dummies were never used until 2017 and when they were, the 5 star rating for the passenger door of one model dropped to 2 stars? And now I have a better understanding about why those 3-D glasses at the museum made me nauseous and why it takes me so long to regain my balance after a week on a cruise ship (one reason why I don't cruise!). Read this book and get angry, very angry, and insist that this deplorable situation change."

Given that the people most likely to change their names are women upon marriage, but the designers of IT systems are predominantly men, it could be the case.While reading about the disadvantages I face in all areas of life because of the gender data gap is infuriating (and downright terrifying when it comes to medical science and knowing I might die because the male default determined the dosage of my medication), knowing is the first step to fixing, so I am glad I read this book."

Given that the people most likely to change their names are women upon marriage, but the designers of IT systems are predominantly men, it could be the case.While reading about the disadvantages I face in all areas of life because of the gender data gap is infuriating (and downright terrifying when it comes to medical science and knowing I might die because the male default determined the dosage of my medication), knowing is the first step to fixing, so I am glad I read this book."

And the thing is, I already knew some of the stuff that would be in here, particularly about the health data gap because I've seen plenty about that myself just in life. But reading about all the ways in which women are left out sometimes unintentionally, other times because they are too ""complicated"" or ""hormonal"" or are simply not considered the default, is extremely disheartening. We obviously have a long way to go. Women are left out of the equation in everything from how cities are designed to how cell phones are designed.The author does state the obvious solution. Ask more women. Be more intentional about including women. But when she also points out how female politicians face more vitriol, harassment, and violence the more visible they become (so, the more women there are in places like the House of Reps for example, the more of this behavior- often including from their own male colleagues- exists) it makes it easy to feel like just asking and including women won't be enough. Some men really do not want to ask or include women. And can you blame them? They've grown up believing they're the default, especially if they're white, so it's going to take a much larger-scale structural and societal change, in my opinion. I wish that there were more potential answers presented for this besides just asking women.None of the information in this book surprises me, even the new things I learned- and I learned a lot- but maybe that's because I'm a woman. Like I said, it made me insanely mad. Some of the stuff stated in here is so obvious to me, but because there's a gender data gap, men don't realize it, simply because it isn't their lived experience. And when more men are in power these things get overlooked (usually unintentionally) and then women have to deal with the unintended consequences. I did find it to be a bit long, and towards the middle, I was having trouble focusing. It sort of made me feel fatigued or burnt out. There's just so much information in here, and none of it is particularly great. I almost think ignorance is bliss in this case if you're a woman. For example, is it really helpful for me to be thinking about how my car's safety was likely only tested on dummies based on the male body as I'm driving 70mph on the highway? Not really. If anything, I would say this book is more important for men to read than women, and I would recommend it with that caveat.Still, four stars mainly because of the sheer amount of new facts I learned, the vast majority of which have just made me a more aware human being if nothing else. This book really drives home the point that women, despite the way society acts, are half of the human species. Men are not the ""default."""

""One of the most important things to say about the gender data Gap is that it is not generally malicious, or even deliberate. Quite the opposite. It is simply the product of a way of thinking that has been around for millennia and is therefore a kind of not thinking. A double not thinking, even: men go without saying, and women don't get said at all. Because when we say human, on the whole, we mean man"".

Caroline Criado Perez explores and presents how the world has always been shaped by men's perspectives & have produced almost all our systems, even those used and meant for women. Best is that she presents this with the use of data - authentic, reliable, and intersectional. .Think about this: Medicines which are meant to be used only by pregnant women are clinically trailed on men. Because women mensurate and it fluctuates data, and hence more work for men. .Or this: Cars seat belts are always tested and designed to suit men, although increasingly more and more women drive. Why? Because women have boobs and they still don't have an authentic design of a seat belt to help women better.Or this worse case: What are the symptoms that one has a heart attack? You say that you have pain on your left arm. False. That's a symptom only for men. For women, the symptoms are completely different and hence more than 40% of women who has heart attack goes undiagnosed and eventually dies.This book is great because it tells you how the world is designed by men, for men, not because men are wicked/evil, but because men and women have ingrained unconscious bias which constricts them to imagine a system enabling only men. Much of this bias is also propagated by lack of data or data which is not segregated on the basis of gender, thereby keeping women in dark shadows for centuries.This is a book which makes you angry but for all the right reasons. It made me realize all the bias I hold against women, against my own self. This will be a book I will go again and again. Empowering, passionate, and hardcore woman-like. Just badass!"
220,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33398563-emma,4,"This was such an interesting book! I was already a feminist before, but after reading this book I am even more convinced of the cause. That is not to say that I am anti-man and all that, I just want equal opportunities, research, and possibilities for and about women. And as some men may be surprised to hear, even nowadays that is not the case.As the author put it: “women are not small men”. We have a different body composition, biology, body shape and much more. However in research, people most often work with male data, of which the results are then later extrapolated to also apply to females. This is not how research is supposed to work!!!!Although the book was a bit data heavy (duh!) and it felt a bit repetitive to read about statistics over and over again, I would still recommend this book! I think the mis- and underrepresentation of women in statistics is a very important issue that most people don’t think about when they think about feminism. I know I didn’t!"

Most of the examples presented are really eye-opening and often maddening, but by the middle of each chapter they all sort of start to blur together. Ah yes, the 50th example of how pharmaceutical researchers failed to test their drug on enough women and are now giving women dosages based off of the male physique. Something like that.Maybe the author could have spent more time giving each statistic life, but obviously that would have ended up in a much longer book.

""One of the most important things to say about the gender data Gap is that it is not generally malicious, or even deliberate. Quite the opposite. It is simply the product of a way of thinking that has been around for millennia and is therefore a kind of not thinking. A double not thinking, even: men go without saying, and women don't get said at all. Because when we say human, on the whole, we mean man"".

Caroline Criado Perez explores and presents how the world has always been shaped by men's perspectives & have produced almost all our systems, even those used and meant for women. Best is that she presents this with the use of data - authentic, reliable, and intersectional. .Think about this: Medicines which are meant to be used only by pregnant women are clinically trailed on men. Because women mensurate and it fluctuates data, and hence more work for men. .Or this: Cars seat belts are always tested and designed to suit men, although increasingly more and more women drive. Why? Because women have boobs and they still don't have an authentic design of a seat belt to help women better.Or this worse case: What are the symptoms that one has a heart attack? You say that you have pain on your left arm. False. That's a symptom only for men. For women, the symptoms are completely different and hence more than 40% of women who has heart attack goes undiagnosed and eventually dies.This book is great because it tells you how the world is designed by men, for men, not because men are wicked/evil, but because men and women have ingrained unconscious bias which constricts them to imagine a system enabling only men. Much of this bias is also propagated by lack of data or data which is not segregated on the basis of gender, thereby keeping women in dark shadows for centuries.This is a book which makes you angry but for all the right reasons. It made me realize all the bias I hold against women, against my own self. This will be a book I will go again and again. Empowering, passionate, and hardcore woman-like. Just badass!"
250,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33398563-emma,4,"This was such an interesting book! I was already a feminist before, but after reading this book I am even more convinced of the cause. That is not to say that I am anti-man and all that, I just want equal opportunities, research, and possibilities for and about women. And as some men may be surprised to hear, even nowadays that is not the case.As the author put it: “women are not small men”. We have a different body composition, biology, body shape and much more. However in research, people most often work with male data, of which the results are then later extrapolated to also apply to females. This is not how research is supposed to work!!!!Although the book was a bit data heavy (duh!) and it felt a bit repetitive to read about statistics over and over again, I would still recommend this book! I think the mis- and underrepresentation of women in statistics is a very important issue that most people don’t think about when they think about feminism. I know I didn’t!"

This book made me angry, it made me upset, and by the end it made me hopeful for a better world. However, I wish the author was more inclusive when she talked about sex and gender. Especially for trans folks and people who identify themselves as queer or non binary. Nevertheless, I think this book should be read by everybody at least once! It talks about so many aspects of the gender data that women of all backgrounds face on a day to day basis. "

My main gripe is with the execution. A lot of chapters just felt like an overwhelming parade of statistics connected loosely by each chapter's topic. Most of the examples presented are really eye-opening and often maddening, but by the middle of each chapter they all sort of start to blur together. Ah yes, the 50th example of how pharmaceutical researchers failed to test their drug on enough women and are now giving women dosages based off of the male physique. Something like that.Maybe the author could have spent more time giving each statistic life, but obviously that would have ended up in a much longer book. At the end of the book, the author does tie everything together very nicely, concluding with three main ways that research and policy often fail to take into account women's bodies and experiences."

For example, sex and gender are used interchangeably almost all the time throughout the book, which just doesn’t sit right with me, especially considering how the data gap is never really addressed in relation to trans or non-binary people. At first I was making apologies by rationalizing the lack of mentions to everything outside of the binary. Not delving into these issues was surely just another consequence of the gender data gap since there is probably not a lot of data to analyse, right? But honestly, that’s a lousy excuse for not even including the rare data that does exist. If you’re going to argue that the data gap is detrimental to people, I think it should be in your interest to not exclude anyone from your own examination of the shortcomings of modern research that are still persisting. Even if there was never any quantitative research done on a subject, I’m almost sure there is at least some qualitative research or writing you can find to at least bring attention to the issue.In retrospect, this exclusionist approach soured my overall experience with the book. Because it does target relevant social topics. It discusses how the failure to include research negatively impacts women’s lives and it dismantles systemic sexism and it sheds light on discrimination that’s often goes unnoticed because it is so mundane. But it is also really, really bad at being inclusive in its dissection of gender discrimination, and in my opinion a book like this simply cannot be."
260,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2382980-molly,4,"Everyone should read at least a portion of this book. I’m shocked (I shouldn’t be, but I am) at how much of the world actively ignores - or, at best, doesn’t think about including - data from women. Fine, Siri and Alexa might understand me better, and my Fitbit might be more accurate, if I was a man. But the section on the lack of data related to the effects of medication, vaccines, and other medical treatments on women was downright terrifying. Listening to the author (writing in 2018) worry about the impacts this will have in “the next pandemic” made me shiver.Minus one star for the portions of the book assuming that “women” are synonymous with “women in heterosexual relationships who have children.” NOT because unpaid caregiving responsibilities aren’t a very very important part of the conversation, which absolutely should be emphasized and studied. These aspects just don’t correlate AS directly to gender as some of the other topics covered, and that should be acknowledged."

262,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1863589-robert-sheard,3,"This is a difficult book to evaluate because, while I completely agree with her overriding premise and multiple conclusions, it reads like you would expect a meta-study to read–as a compendium of statistics, citations, and references. (There are roughly 100 pages of notes.) In other words, it's tedious to read, even though I think it's essential for anyone in policy, product development, research, and government to address these vital issues. I do have two qualms with the book, which led me to rate it slightly lower than I might have otherwise. In a work which has as its central premise that data in our world is based on the erroneous assumption that ""average male"" represents everyone, Criado-Perez makes a slew of sweeping generalizations herself. In addition, she makes some factual analyses that are simply wrong, although they're minor in scope and don't wipe away the value of her overall work. (e.g., her analysis of the US Income Tax ""married filing jointly"" is simply incorrect.)"

That said, it felt like a glaring omission considering this is focused on showing the data gaps between women and men, and because it talks about violence and every day sexism against women, which includes trans women. I know this won't bother some people, but it definitely made me question what data she left out of the book, and took me out of the information multiple times as I wondered if the info provided accounted for different races, classes, sexual orientation, etc. There are lots of places where she does not touch on factors for women that have specific data that could differ from another group of women. For example, there was a study from a few years ago that said bisexual women are more likely to suffer from depression than straight women or lesbians. In a book focused on the gender data gap, I would expect to see information like this too, but this book was definitely lacking in this department. She did talk about African American women dying more from childbirth complications, but it was surprisingly short considering the severity of the topic. In the pros column, I did learn a lot. There were things I knew about, like the info about rape and drug trials, but I was surprised by some parts. The city planning info, the info about voice recognition tech, and the info on motion sickness from vr, the car info, & similar stuff was all really interesting and frustrating. There wasn't any time I was bored, or where I found it dry. I thought the information was presented in a clear and easy to understand fashion. "

For example, is it really helpful for me to be thinking about how my car's safety was likely only tested on dummies based on the male body as I'm driving 70mph on the highway? Not really. If anything, I would say this book is more important for men to read than women, and I would recommend it with that caveat.Still, four stars mainly because of the sheer amount of new facts I learned, the vast majority of which have just made me a more aware human being if nothing else. This book really drives home the point that women, despite the way society acts, are half of the human species. Men are not the ""default."""

""One of the most important things to say about the gender data Gap is that it is not generally malicious, or even deliberate. Quite the opposite. It is simply the product of a way of thinking that has been around for millennia and is therefore a kind of not thinking. A double not thinking, even: men go without saying, and women don't get said at all. Because when we say human, on the whole, we mean man"".

Caroline Criado Perez explores and presents how the world has always been shaped by men's perspectives & have produced almost all our systems, even those used and meant for women. Best is that she presents this with the use of data - authentic, reliable, and intersectional. .Think about this: Medicines which are meant to be used only by pregnant women are clinically trailed on men. Because women mensurate and it fluctuates data, and hence more work for men. .Or this: Cars seat belts are always tested and designed to suit men, although increasingly more and more women drive. Why? Because women have boobs and they still don't have an authentic design of a seat belt to help women better.Or this worse case: What are the symptoms that one has a heart attack? You say that you have pain on your left arm. False. That's a symptom only for men. For women, the symptoms are completely different and hence more than 40% of women who has heart attack goes undiagnosed and eventually dies.This book is great because it tells you how the world is designed by men, for men, not because men are wicked/evil, but because men and women have ingrained unconscious bias which constricts them to imagine a system enabling only men. Much of this bias is also propagated by lack of data or data which is not segregated on the basis of gender, thereby keeping women in dark shadows for centuries.This is a book which makes you angry but for all the right reasons. It made me realize all the bias I hold against women, against my own self. This will be a book I will go again and again. Empowering, passionate, and hardcore woman-like. Just badass!"

That is not to say that I am anti-man and all that, I just want equal opportunities, research, and possibilities for and about women. And as some men may be surprised to hear, even nowadays that is not the case.As the author put it: “women are not small men”. We have a different body composition, biology, body shape and much more. However in research, people most often work with male data, of which the results are then later extrapolated to also apply to females. This is not how research is supposed to work!!!!Although the book was a bit data heavy (duh!) and it felt a bit repetitive to read about statistics over and over again, I would still recommend this book! I think the mis- and underrepresentation of women in statistics is a very important issue that most people don’t think about when they think about feminism. I know I didn’t!"
281,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31248527-tanpreet-kaur,4,"This book was so informative, eye opening, and a great read! I learnt so much from reading this. This book made me angry, it made me upset, and by the end it made me hopeful for a better world. However, I wish the author was more inclusive when she talked about sex and gender. Especially for trans folks and people who identify themselves as queer or non binary. Nevertheless, I think this book should be read by everybody at least once! It talks about so many aspects of the gender data that women of all backgrounds face on a day to day basis. "
282,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39109173-karolina-kat,5,"This book deserves 10 out of 5 stars.It may be the most important book of our time, in terms of revealing how systemic is the bias against women, and how HALF of world's population is institutionally and culturally marginalised.An eye-opening must read."

286,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43043004-meena-gupta-iwasaki,4,"Super well researched and persuasive book on how the ""default male"" masquerading as gender neutrality has a disproportionate negative impact on 50% of the world's population. My main gripe is with the execution. A lot of chapters just felt like an overwhelming parade of statistics connected loosely by each chapter's topic. Most of the examples presented are really eye-opening and often maddening, but by the middle of each chapter they all sort of start to blur together. Ah yes, the 50th example of how pharmaceutical researchers failed to test their drug on enough women and are now giving women dosages based off of the male physique. Something like that.Maybe the author could have spent more time giving each statistic life, but obviously that would have ended up in a much longer book. At the end of the book, the author does tie everything together very nicely, concluding with three main ways that research and policy often fail to take into account women's bodies and experiences."
287,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42440079-eleanor-slater,5,Bloody brilliant. Real review to come when I'm less tired and angry... If that ever happens.
288,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113593719-katherine-paulsen,5,"I now can’t shut up about all the ways the world is biased against women (hint: the world is biased against women in literally every way). Every woman should read this, but more importantly, EVERY man should read this."
289,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65647396-michelle,0,"*no rating because i feel like rating this book would be a problematic thing to do*Although I appreciate the insight i gained on the deficits of data collection when it comes to gender, I can’t shake the feeling that this book is somewhat TERF-y in its approach. For example, sex and gender are used interchangeably almost all the time throughout the book, which just doesn’t sit right with me, especially considering how the data gap is never really addressed in relation to trans or non-binary people. At first I was making apologies by rationalizing the lack of mentions to everything outside of the binary. Not delving into these issues was surely just another consequence of the gender data gap since there is probably not a lot of data to analyse, right? But honestly, that’s a lousy excuse for not even including the rare data that does exist. If you’re going to argue that the data gap is detrimental to people, I think it should be in your interest to not exclude anyone from your own examination of the shortcomings of modern research that are still persisting. Even if there was never any quantitative research done on a subject, I’m almost sure there is at least some qualitative research or writing you can find to at least bring attention to the issue.In retrospect, this exclusionist approach soured my overall experience with the book. Because it does target relevant social topics. It discusses how the failure to include research negatively impacts women’s lives and it dismantles systemic sexism and it sheds light on discrimination that’s often goes unnoticed because it is so mundane. But it is also really, really bad at being inclusive in its dissection of gender discrimination, and in my opinion a book like this simply cannot be."
290,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2382980-molly,4,"Everyone should read at least a portion of this book. I’m shocked (I shouldn’t be, but I am) at how much of the world actively ignores - or, at best, doesn’t think about including - data from women. Fine, Siri and Alexa might understand me better, and my Fitbit might be more accurate, if I was a man. But the section on the lack of data related to the effects of medication, vaccines, and other medical treatments on women was downright terrifying. Listening to the author (writing in 2018) worry about the impacts this will have in “the next pandemic” made me shiver.Minus one star for the portions of the book assuming that “women” are synonymous with “women in heterosexual relationships who have children.” NOT because unpaid caregiving responsibilities aren’t a very very important part of the conversation, which absolutely should be emphasized and studied. These aspects just don’t correlate AS directly to gender as some of the other topics covered, and that should be acknowledged."
291,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13168636-bindu-upadhyay,5,"Such a well researched book! I am amazed at the author and her calibre. I hope many more professionals read this book. It can help us identify where we are excluding groups, generally minority groups."
292,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1863589-robert-sheard,3,"This is a difficult book to evaluate because, while I completely agree with her overriding premise and multiple conclusions, it reads like you would expect a meta-study to read–as a compendium of statistics, citations, and references. (There are roughly 100 pages of notes.) In other words, it's tedious to read, even though I think it's essential for anyone in policy, product development, research, and government to address these vital issues. I do have two qualms with the book, which led me to rate it slightly lower than I might have otherwise. In a work which has as its central premise that data in our world is based on the erroneous assumption that ""average male"" represents everyone, Criado-Perez makes a slew of sweeping generalizations herself. In addition, she makes some factual analyses that are simply wrong, although they're minor in scope and don't wipe away the value of her overall work. (e.g., her analysis of the US Income Tax ""married filing jointly"" is simply incorrect.)"
293,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16760078-emily-moon,5,"Just brilliant, such a enlightening and frustrating read"
294,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5106807-carol-tilley,5,I wish every male could be required to read this. I want every woman to read it.
295,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10661992-aoife,5,"While many women are already familiar, on a theoretical and personal level, with the discrimination they are subject to on the basis of gender to see it laid out in such a unrelenting way is nonetheless shocking.This book gives voice to women’s lived experiences of discrimination, elevating them out of the realm of the often dismissed ‘shrill woman’ and demonstrating how such discrimination impacts not only women but society as a whole.Reading in parts like an academic article this book is still delivered in an easily accessible manner and makes for essential, albeit disheartening, reading."
296,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3127698-meaghan,3,"If this book had said more clearly that it would solely focus on cis women and cis men, and then did mention that statistics are not available for trans or nonbinary people for these topics, or that there was not enough of that data to be used for this book in a way that was credible, this would be a five for me and I would be highly recommending it to my friends. That said, it felt like a glaring omission considering this is focused on showing the data gaps between women and men, and because it talks about violence and every day sexism against women, which includes trans women. I know this won't bother some people, but it definitely made me question what data she left out of the book, and took me out of the information multiple times as I wondered if the info provided accounted for different races, classes, sexual orientation, etc. There are lots of places where she does not touch on factors for women that have specific data that could differ from another group of women. For example, there was a study from a few years ago that said bisexual women are more likely to suffer from depression than straight women or lesbians. In a book focused on the gender data gap, I would expect to see information like this too, but this book was definitely lacking in this department. She did talk about African American women dying more from childbirth complications, but it was surprisingly short considering the severity of the topic. In the pros column, I did learn a lot. There were things I knew about, like the info about rape and drug trials, but I was surprised by some parts. The city planning info, the info about voice recognition tech, and the info on motion sickness from vr, the car info, & similar stuff was all really interesting and frustrating. There wasn't any time I was bored, or where I found it dry. I thought the information was presented in a clear and easy to understand fashion. "
297,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4999879-lindaj,5,"Now this is a book that got my blood roiling. I've experienced minor gender discrimination at work. I know that cars are designed for men much bigger than I. I know that women are raped by men far more than men are raped by women. I know other there is unrealized bias by teachers in favor of boys in school. But I knew little about the huge data bias. Suddenly I understand why the voice control for our cable television fails to recognize my commands. When I used that as one example of what I was learning as I read this book by demonstrating its failure to correctly identify the word I was saying, my husband, one of the most unbiased persons I know, explained that I just wasn't doing it right - I needed to do it like he did. We have a long way to go yet women.The scariest thing I learned in this book concerned the lack of medical data concerning women and how very different from a medical aspect women are from men. OK, I know health insurance companies and employers discriminated -- why are men's Viagra prescriptions covered and women's birth control pills not? -- but I did not appreciate how lacking the data was for women, especially for things that only impact women. I am more than ever convinced now that I will never take a drug to lower blood pressure! Never again will I trust the safety ratings for cars. Who knew that women crash test dummies were never used until 2017 and when they were, the 5 star rating for the passenger door of one model dropped to 2 stars? And now I have a better understanding about why those 3-D glasses at the museum made me nauseous and why it takes me so long to regain my balance after a week on a cruise ship (one reason why I don't cruise!). Read this book and get angry, very angry, and insist that this deplorable situation change."
298,1419729071,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4789059-andrea,5,"A must-read for any decision maker (so yeah pretty much everyone, but the more people your decision impacts the more pertinent it is that you understand your bias and how to address it).While reading this book I’ve wondered about the role of data bias in many systems (for example, is this why changing your name or associated email address in any IT system is a mess? Given that the people most likely to change their names are women upon marriage, but the designers of IT systems are predominantly men, it could be the case.While reading about the disadvantages I face in all areas of life because of the gender data gap is infuriating (and downright terrifying when it comes to medical science and knowing I might die because the male default determined the dosage of my medication), knowing is the first step to fixing, so I am glad I read this book."
