First, put the body into a very large instapot (euphemistically called a 'pressurised stainless steel cremation chamber'. cover with water and alkali. Heat to 350°F and raise the pressure. 'Cook' for 4 to 6 hours. Finish by draining off the greenish-brownish liquid of amino acids, peptides, sugars and salts, (don't drink this soup, it's not edible and not because it has too much sugar and salt) what you have left are soft bones ready for hand-crushing.This is a more refined method than one of the traditional ways murderers attempt to cover up their crime - put the body in a barrel with a lot of lye.I'm still going for burial at sea.The book is based on questions guaranteed to have been genuinely put by children. Not little kindergarteners though, more like teenagers who (like us) read books and think up sensible questions. It's very readable, very short, very informative and very enjoyable. Four 'verys', four stars."

Puh, getting philosophical in here, so put out all your thoughts... Come, little kitty cat, tasty eyeballs are served. No matter if it is a dog, cat, weasel, reptile (I am not sure regarding their eating behavior), if time and hunger are combined and carrion acceptable for the animal, well... At least one lives on in his pet, except it gets a food poisoning from rotten flesh which would be an unfunny, black comedy trope, but owner and pet would be at least united in death. Who thinks this is already too heavy probably shouldn´t read this book. I like horror, humor and science and this book has everything in it. The wit often comes just from the constellations of topics, from questions an adult wouldn´t dare to ask. So the philosophy that is still in kids and gets lost more and more with the ages, jumps from each side because the questions may seem trivial, but have hidden depths. And children aren´t as constrained, onesided, indoctrinated and socially normed as adults so that they still have an open and healthy attitude towards the topic. Out of the context of this book, but it would make an interesting question for the author: In space flight, the question of how to deal with the deceased, if there are still any, will be a topic too. All the ingredients might be too precious to waste them and many of the extraction procedures to get as much out of it as possible might not work well without gravity or lesser gravity than on earth, may take to long, be too energy expensive or just not economic. The book is a great example of how the knowledge of an expert can be broken down to interesting, short, funny, intelligent and catchy pieces and how much death can show the living how do be thankful for each day, enjoy each moment, be kind to each other, yada yada yada, boring! Carpe diemality. The endeavor and motivation of the author to talk about death openly is very important because it weakens faith and makes people realize how short and fragile life is and to probably awaken more awareness and mindfulness. As already said, kids are the perfect breeding ground for healthy, normal thinking and talking about death and in this case, the old saying ""Give them to us when they are still young and they belong us forever"" gets a positive connotation. Instead of NIMBY https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY, they ask why not the whole family is buried there. Instead, death has become a taboo, especially in Western society, where it is avoided to speak about it or to change something about how society has been instrumentalized and normed in any way around a topic that anyone should be interested in, because, you know... A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real-life outside books:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeralhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burialhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortuar..."

I said look, it's about my eyeballs.They said - Oh, so you know about the eyeball thing. Who told you?I said It's in this book. Everyone knows now.They said This is gonna be bad for cats.I said Look, I like you, I'm a fair person, I want to make a deal. If I predecease you, you can have the eyeballs, I'll bequeath them. But no eating them off my head. They'll be removed by a proper eye doctor in a dignified manner, okay? Plus - if you predecease me, I get your fur for gloves.They conferred for a while and then we shook on it. I feel a lot better now.*****************This is a question I have never asked myself before. So now I need this book to find out the answer. But wait - I have two cats. If I keel over and expire on the spot one day at home, will they take one eyeball each? Or, as usually happens when I dish up food at the same time, will Hatter scoff his eyeball really quick and then shoulder Miranda out of the way as she is nibbling delicately on her eyeball? And I will not be there to tell him off for his unseemly manners. Well, I will be there, of course, but I won't be functional. Except as lunch. So - when they look at me, as they often do, are they just eyeing up the eyeballs? Is that all I am to them? So many questions."
3,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,4,"Those who have read Caitlin Doughty's previous books know her talent for taking the usually bleak and depressing subject of death and turning it into something entertaining.   A bit on the gross side perhaps, but entertaining nonetheless.  In Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs?, Ms. Doughty answers several questions about death, dying, and dead bodies asked of her by children.  They are things that many of you may have wondered too, at least when you were children and before you learned that death is a taboo subject and also something to be avoided at all costs.  And yet, it cannot be avoided.  At any cost.  Unless you know something every single one of your fellow human beings don't know, you are going to eventually end up ashes or worm food or pumped full of embalming fluid.  You are not going to get to enjoy your precious body for all eternity, it just doesn't work like that.  No matter who you are or how rich you might be, no amount of money will buy you eternal life.  Perhaps at some point in the future scientists will figure out how to upload our memories into machines and thus grant us immortality, but as of now, sorry, no can do.  You're gonna croak.I'm sorry to be the bearer of such bad news, but really, it's always better to face the facts.  So now that you know the truth of your limited existence, you might be wondering what exactly will happen to your body when it's no longer living and breathing and eating and shitting.  Some questions you might have that Ms. Doughty thoughtfully answers are:•Why do we turn colours when we die?•Will my hair and nails keep growing in the coffin?•If I die making a funny face, will it be stuck like that forever?•What will I smell like and how long until I start stinking?•Can I have my body preserved in amber like a prehistoric insect?•What would happen if I swallow a bag of popcorn before I die and am cremated?  And of course, the eponymous question that we're all wondering:•Will my cat indeed eat my eyeballs???  The answer is, he might.  (It's not a spoiler because it's answered in the first chapter.)  In case you're thinking it would then be better to adopt a dog rather than take the chance this adorable kitten might grow up to be an eye-munching connoisseur of human flesh.... better think again because that adorable puppy is gonna do the same if left alone without food for too long.  Sorry folks, but they gotta eat.  If you don't want to become pet food, please arrange to have someone find your body soon after you die -- or always leave out a lifetime supply of food for your furry babies.   However, if you do want to become pet food, well.....  I think it would be kinder to find someone willing to break the law who will dump your body at sea rather than have your beloved pet locked up with your decomposing body and little else.  Please don't do that to Fluffy or Fido.   (Note: For the answers to the rest of the questions and more, you'll need to pick up this fun, funny, and interesting book for yourself. You won't be disappointed!"

This is the cat-human compact. Death doesn’t free you from performing your contractual obligations.” Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? - Big Questions From Tiny Mortals About Death, written by mortician Caitlin Doughty, is the book to answer all those questions about death you've been too embarressed to ask.In a Q & A format, Doughty answers questions about death she's been asked again and again by children, and both the questions and answers are hilarious! I mean, death in general is of course not very funny, but Doughty is witty and uses both humor as well as scientific facts to answer the burning questions we all have, like 'What would happen if you swallowed a bag of popcorn before you died and were cremated?' and 'Can I keep my parents' skulls after they die?'.As a future corpse, this book made me feel just slightly better about my own inevitable end - and even if it doesn't do that for you, I'm sure it will make  your  future corpse laugh out loud."

This was yet another enjoyable go-round with my favorite mortician!Here Doughty dumbs it down a bit with a younger audience in mind, but not so dumb that adults can't get something out of her lessons too. Here are snappy answers to not-so-stupid questions, like Can We Give Grandma a Viking Funeral?, What If They Make a Mistake and Bury Me When I'm Just in a Coma?, and If I Died Making a Stupid Face, Would It Be Stuck Like That Forever?. She also tackles a few questions that I found rather disturbing, like Can I Keep My Parents' Skulls? Really? Other than my kid, what sort of a child thinks about that? Caitlin also lays waste to this internet meme:Now you know - don't try this at home, kids!Aside from the giggles I got from reading this book, there was the fun of seeing the looks on my coworkers' faces when they walked into the breakroom, and saw me reading this while shoving leftover Pad Thai into my mouth."

I was late to the party that is ""Smoke Gets In Your Eyes: And Other Lessons From the Crematory"" and loved it sohttps://www.goodreads.com/review/show...?I pre-ordered this one, but thank goodness I didn't read it right away because when I couldn't concentrate on much at all, Caitlin saved me. I wish I had her as a resource when I was a tiny mortal. I love how she addresses them with her signature straightforward honesty and humor, and never talks down to them. The questions are very good and I don't doubt young minds honed on Harry Potter can handle them and indeed have pondered them.There will be a few spoilers here but fact is the joys of this book are not only in the answers but in her explanations. The woman is a trained, licensed mortician who owns her own mortuary, has a degree in writing, could be a stand-up comedian and has a marvelous vlog which has taught me so much, lately about covid, bodies and burials -- and always revelations, my favorite being the one about Victorian death photos (in which I take an interest). Did I mention she started a worldwide charity, The Order of the Good Death, dedicated to making death and death practices more natural, ripping off the shroud of secrecy many morticians maintain and giving people greater control over their own corpses.So, a taste of a great book about death and in case you're dying to know, cannibalism does come up. These are excerpts from her answers and as with every question in this book, the full answers are pages long and fact-and-fun filled with cool illustrations.CAN WE GIVE GRANDMA A VIKING FUNERAL?""Alas, fake fake fakety fake...Who knows how the rumors got started? The Vikings had elaborate cremations! They had boats! They just didn't have cremation boats!"" CAN I KEEP MY PARENTS' SKULLS AFTER THEY DIE?""Tell you what's not going to work: marching on over to your local funeral home and saying 'Greetings! That's my mom's corpse over there. Could you just pop off her head and deflesh her skull? That would be great. Thanks!'""WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO AN ASTRONAUT BODY IN SPACE?Well, that's complicated and depends on a lot of factors but I love her writing and this footnote, um, slayed me:""In 2005, NASA collaborated with a small Swedish company called Promesa on a design prototype for a system that would process and contain space corpses. The prototype was called the Body Back ('I'm bringing body back, returning corpses but they're not intact').**Kids, this is a Justin Timberlake reference, you're fine not knowing who that is.""CAN EVERYBODY FIT IN A CASKET? WHAT IF THEY'RE REALLY TALL?""Listen, sometimes people just don't fit inside a casket. And funeral directors have to do something about it. It's our job. The family is counting on us. If we are left with no other options, we will have to amputate their legs below the knees to make them fit.""No! What the heck? We don't do that. Why does everyone think that's what funeral homes do to tall people?""There can't be another human on earth who can load a body in The Cremulator with great respect and care, write genuinely informative and laugh-out-loud books about death, and vlog about such delightful (for me anyway) and at times scandalous subjects, all with compassion, humor and charm, and make them seem not at all morbid.Wonderful book! As for your cat, not going to spoil it because I was asked not to. So I'll just say, cat lover that I am, I'd much rather picture my cat dining on my dead ____s than think about what your dog might do to you."

9,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43584061-alet,2,"★★½ /5 This was a little bit too simplistic.A few parts in the book I found really interesting, but in general, it was a little bit too oversimplified. It was written in question-answer format (I listened to an audiobook) so it was really easy to get through it, but the majority of questions were just a little bit too ridiculous, I think she could answer more difficult questions then book would be much more fascinating. I could definitely see that she really knows what she is talking about, so I think it would not be a problem for her to answer harder and more scientific questions.This wasn't a bad book, I do not regret reading it and now kind of want to be a mortician now."

Big Questions from Tiny Mortals About Death is a collection of questions asked by children and their answers from Caitlin Doughty's book tours.Until fairly recently, my wife entertained the possibility of being a funeral director. As a result, we've watched about 80% of Caitlin Doughty's Ask a Mortician videos on Youtube. I bought her all three of Caitlin's books and now I'm reading them as some sort of homework assignment.In this volume, Caitlin addresses such topics as what happens to an astronaut's body in space, port-mortem pooping, do mummies stink, and can you be buried with a beloved pet, among other things. Caitlin addresses the topics with respect but also with her dark sense of humor, making for an entertaining read.Any complaints? Nope. If you've been entertained by Caitlin's Ask a Mortician videos, you know what you're getting. This is class A death knowledge.Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs is a good source of info for kids and necromancers alike. Four out of five caskets."

Or, all the things the adults wanted to know but were too embarrassed to ask. A quick and engrossing read, and thus a good intro to the writer, but for my money her earlier more personal memoir Smoke Gets in Your Eyes: and Other Lessons from the Crematory has the most depth, and is the one of her three titles I'd most recommend. (All are good, if with different focuses.)Reading these has had me thinking about my own late mother's death, and my own eventual one, in a less-fraught way, so, good.Ta, L. "
12,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17420799-olive-fellows-abookolive,4,"Check out my review on booktube: https://youtu.be/ZBDA4V2qIAEAND the below review originally appeared on Open Letters Review.Speaking to children about difficult topics is never easy, but the concerns are often comfortingly stereotypical. Perhaps the kids are old enough to discuss the birds and the bees or they’ve joined a sketchy peer group that demands a stern talk about drug or alcohol abuse. But sitting them down to talk about death? A talk centered on the most uncomfortable reality of all might end up being tougher than anything featured on the Dr. Phil show. That’s because, in the Western world, it may be the one concept that’s far more challenging for the adults in the room to face than it will be for the children. But, as demonstrated in Caitlin Doughty’s new nonfiction book, Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs?: Big Questions from Tiny Mortals About Death, that doesn’t mean that kids don’t have an interest in the topic. In fact, they have more than a few questions about it!Caitlin Doughty, a trained mortician and funeral home director, has brought her death-acceptance message to multiple platforms. On her popular YouTube channel, Ask A Mortician, she takes on topics of historical death practices, funeral home insider secrets, and further mayhem within the macabre. She helps to host a podcast called Death in the Afternoon, on which she discusses similar death-centric topics with her co-hosts, two employees of the Order of the Good Death organization Doughty founded to promote healthy conversations about death. She has also written two previous books: Smoke Gets in Your Eyes, a memoir of the birth of her interest in dark-leaning subjects through her beginning experiences working in the death industry and her most recent, From Here to Eternity, a mixture of travel writing and cultural observation as Doughty ventures internationally to witness and/or participate in various death rituals.In her previous works, Doughty first aimed to help her readership understand her critical view on the Western attitude toward death and went on to show how her ideas are actually regressive rather than progressive. Death used to be much more of a reality in daily life and therefore much easier to discuss and confront. Though advances in healthcare have extended the human lifespan in incredible ways, our new distance from death has turned it into a cultural taboo. This has allowed the death industry to wrangle a firm chokehold on our wallets as our modern cultural instincts instruct us to take as many steps backward from the idea as possible. Though it may be agonizing to accept, death is indeed the final frontier for any human. Doughty thinks the best way to come to terms with this fact is to regularly discuss and seek understanding about death. In this new book, one can feel Doughy laying the groundwork for achieving her goal of a death-accepting Western culture by using the same guiding principle leaned on by marketing teams for every sugary cereal brand out there: start them young!Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? is structured in a question/answer format. The question are pulled from or inspired by real questions Doughty has been asked while on the road, the majority of which have been posed by the titular tiny mortals. In true kid fashion, they range from the silly (what would happen if you swallowed a bag of popcorn before you died and were cremated?), to the bizarre (can I preserve my dead body in amber like a prehistoric insect?), to the entirely reasonable (what would happen if you died on a plane?). Her answers pull from her own personal experience working with corpses, historical events, and myth-busting science facts. And while she sets out to deliver factual responses to these inquiries, it certainly doesn’t stop her from joining in on the fun. Her tone is surprisingly lighthearted and packed with all the dry wit readers have come to expect from Doughty:Back in the Middle Ages, people used to be buried right outside (and even inside) churches - lots and lots of people. The human remains were supposed to have been moved away from one particular thirteenth-century English church back in the 1970s. But it turns out they weren’t all moved. We discovered this because badgers invaded and started digging dens and networks of tunnels down through the ancient bones, sending pelvises and femurs flying to the surface. Someone should stop those badgers! Whoops, they can’t. In England it’s illegal to kill those furry creatures, or even move their dens. Thanks to the Protection of Badgers Act (yes, that’s real!), we’re looking at six months in prison and huge fines even for attempted badger assault. Workers at the church have to pick up the bones, say a prayer, and bury them back in the ground. The lesson here is that even if you make it almost a thousand years in the grave, you never know when you’ll be uprooted by a lawless badger. It’s precisely this willingness to lean into the jovial worldview of a child that makes this book so successful. While some will see her tone as irreverent, perhaps us stuffy adults need to, once again, relish in the ick factor and allow death to become as much as an everyday talking point as it is an everyday occurrence. In this way, children are the ideal ground zero for Doughty to promote her death-positivity agenda. Since the Western cultural thumb hasn’t yet flattened their interest in the topic and rolled it into cold, hard fear, kids are far more likely to ask some of these questions that initially sound kooky, but with further thought, slowly morph into totally rational curiosities. The type of unknowns that will nag at one’s psyche if left unanswered. Do bodies decaying underground affect the taste of the groundwater in the area? Read the question and you’ll be dying to know the answer."
13,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/271569-ashley-holstrom,5,"Caitlin Doughty rules. She takes a scary topic like death and makes it feel normal. Because it is normal. We’re all gonna die, y’all, and there’s nothing we can do about it. While this book is influenced by questions from children, I wouldn’t say it’s a great book for kiddos to read unless they’re mature enough to think about decomposing bodies. But hey, maybe that’s the point. Normalize it! Her answers to these questions (“If I die making a funny face, will it stay like that?” and “can I be buried with my dog?”) are smart and full of science and history. And humor. It’s a delight to read. "
14,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15335689-destiny-howling-libraries,5,"Wow, this was absolutely magnificent. It was my first Caitlin Doughty read, but it certainly won't be my last. First of all, I love Caitlin's sense of humor so much, and it conveys just as well through text as it does in her videos. I know it's a book about death, but I found myself laughing out loud so many times and bugging my spouse endlessly with quotes from this book.That said, it's also incredibly informative! She doesn't pull any punches but isn't overly descriptive, either, so even if you're a bit queasy, I bet anyone could enjoy this. I also think it would be great for readers from elementary school up to any age, as it definitely doesn't read like a kids' book, but is very kid-friendly at the same time. I'd recommend this book to literally anyone and everyone interested in learning more about what happens to our bodies after we die, and I can't wait to pick up another of her books."

I watched her youtube video about this book and I consider it a recommendation because I  never  would have read this book otherwise. I also like to give credit where credit is due. So, thank you, Olive! You can watch her review hereThis book is by a mortician who likes to talk about death. She got lots of interesting questions from kids and decided to tackle them all in this book. Starting with “will my cat eat my eyeballs” and including ones like “can we give grandma a Viking funeral?” and “what would happen if you swallowed a bag of popcorn before you died and were cremated?”.The thing I liked most about this book is that while some of these questions seem plain ridiculous, the author answers them honestly and authentically. The author intersperses her humor in every answer, but the responses are genuine and she relies on science and history to answer the questions and make her point.As many of you know I am a children’s librarian. While reading this, I could actually see one of my kids visiting the library asking me or one of their parents some of these questions, and I am pretty darn glad I know the answers now. I probably will be advocating for this book to go into the parenting collection because I can see it really helping parents answer a lot of these very hard questions.Totally worth reading and I am very glad I left my fiction comfort zone and gave this nonfiction book a whirl.

She's also the author of three books, and now one of my must-read authors. In Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs?, Doughty answers this and many other questions she has been asked, specifically by children. There are 34 questions total, including ""Can I keep my parents' skull after they die?"", ""Can we give grandma a Viking funeral?"" and ""What happens when a cemetery is full of bodies and you can't add any more?""Each answer is equal parts informative, honest, and HILARIOUS. Doughty deftly navigates the tightrope between a healthy, reflective outlook on death and a great sense of humor, regularly grounding the discussion and explaining why certain practices and laws exist around death and human remains. She's open and unsqueamish about the tools of her trade, giving us an inside look at the mortician's daily routine, but also consults with other experts where necessary. She debunks a lot of bad information and unjustified fears surrounding bodies, but also explains where those ideas come from while replacing them with better information. This is the kind of book that makes you want to share tidbits you just learned with anyone standing nearby. It's a highly entertaining, quick read and a needed contribution to our societal conversation about death. The illustrations rock, too."

I never read any of Caitlin Doughty books, but I hear her books are a short fun read. I have to agree this book was a short fun read. I found the information funny and nice to know. I did not find this book boring like I do with some non-fiction books. "
19,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"This is the third book by the millennial mortician, and I’ve taken perverse glee in reading them all. Smoke Gets in Your Eyes explains cremation and combats misconceptions about death; From Here to Eternity surveys death rituals from around the world. This new book seems to be aimed at (morbid) children, but for me it was more like one of those New Scientist books (Why Don’t Penguins’ Feet Freeze?) or Why Do Men Have Nipples?Some of the questions are more serious than others, but with her usual punning wit and pop culture references Doughty gives biologically sound answers to them all. For instance, she explains what might happen to a corpse in space, why the hair and fingernails of a cadaver appear to keep growing, and why the quantity of ashes from a cremation is about the same no matter the dead person’s girth (all the fat burns away; what would make your ashes weigh more is being taller and thus having longer bones). I was most interested in the chapter on why conjoined twins generally die at roughly the same time.Doughty also discusses laws relating to the dead, such as “abuse of corpse” regulations and whether or not deaths at a property have to be reported to potential buyers (it depends on what state or country you live in); and what happens in countries that are literally running out of space for burials. In highly population-dense places like Singapore, but also in countries such as Germany, one is considered to ‘rent’ grave space, which is then recycled after 15 years and the previous set of remains cremated. Or graves might get stacked vertically.This is good fun, and features lots of cartoonishly gruesome black-and-white illustrations by Dianné Ruz. If you’ve got a particularly curious niece or nephew who might appreciate a dark sense of humor, this would make a good Christmas gift for one who is an older child or young teen.Originally published on my blog, Bookish Beck."

One thing to love about her is that she will answer ANY and all questions about death, no matter how weird the question. If you have any doubts, go check out her YouTube channel “Ask a Mortician” or watch any of her live Q&A sessions (also found on YouTube). In this book, Doughty collected a number of questions she’s received from children over the years and answered them in her usual matter of fact yet entertaining way. Questions such as “What would happen to an astronaut body in space?”, “Will I poop when I die?”, “How does a whole adult fit in a tiny box after cremation?”, and, yes, she does answer the question about which beloved pet will turn you into a meal upon your death. If you’re a fan of books by Mary Roach, this is a perfect match so go ahead and have a read. You’ll definitely be the coolest aunt/uncle, mom/dad, grandma/grandpa, friend to be able to whip out a total and confident answer to “Can I preserve my dead body in amber like a prehistoric insect?”.Recommend."
21,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32532051-montzalee-wittmann,5,Hilarious and informative!Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? by Caitlin Doughty is a funny book all about death. It is very informative about a sensitive subject matter but she presents it with humor and in a manner the reader is not likely to forget. The questions are from kids (although I am sure adults have thought of these questions too). I love to watch her on YouTube and didn't realize she was the author until I started reading the book! Great book! Going in favorite folder!
22,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2905339-bark,0,Ahhhh! Would you look at this? WOULD YOU LOOK AT THIS?! I must have it.
23,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52870273-schizanthus-nerd,4," We can’t make death fun, but we can make learning about death fun.  A book written by a funeral director, answering questions asked by kids, about death? This future corpse had to read this book! I now know the answers to over thirty death related questions, some I’ve always been curious about and others I didn’t know that I needed to know until I came across them here.  Can I keep my parents’ skulls after they die?Will I poop when I die?What would happen if you swallowed a bag of popcorn before you died and were cremated?What if they make a mistake and bury me when I’m just in a coma?  

 Caitlin Doughty not only answers the question that’s asked but sometimes also adds an ‘if you were asking because of [insert interesting reason here], allow me to suggest an even cooler idea’ or offers solutions to multiple hypothetical tangents.  What’s left behind in the cremated remains is a thrilling combo of calcium phosphates, carbonates, and minerals and salts.  Bacteria farts, the rainbow of livor mortis and putrefaction, leakage and corpse onesies (unionalls) are all explained. I also learned some fun death question adjacent facts, such as the scientifically determined ideal temperature for popping popcorn - “356 degrees Fahrenheit”, if you’re interested. 

 Written in a conversational way, with some much needed humour given the topic, Caitlin combines her experiences with those of her colleagues and adds some science, cultural differences and some good ol’ myth busting. A couple of times small pieces of information would be repeated in later chapters; they were relevant each time they were mentioned and the repetition was often pointed out in the text. It was more noticeable to me because I inhaled the book.Accompanying the text are some wonderful illustrations by Dianné Ruz. They’re quirky and add to the humour. 

 I enjoyed this read even more than I expected to and only wish I could have passed it along to my Nan, who I’m certain would have appreciated it even more than I did. Well, except for the chapter that debunks Viking funeral myths. See, my Nan was the coolest person I’ve ever met and her dream funeral consisted of being transported via a carriage pulled by a team of Clydesdales in the middle of the main street to the ocean, where she would be sent off Viking funeral style. I approximated the Viking part by buying a wooden boat shaped candle holder, loading it up with some of her ashes, setting it alight and drenching myself trying to get it far enough into the ocean so it wouldn’t surf its ways back in.I’m fairly certain Nan would have also been willing to donate her awesome manicured nails in aid of Ragnarök, should they be required.

Filled with cringe worthy dad jokes and with a lot of content I already knew from reading her other books this was not her greatest work.But its admirable that this author has such a passion for taking about death and making it more accessible to us, the death-phobic public.I hope that everyone that loved this one will give her other books a chance, they have a lot more substance."
25,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2644090-erica,4,"Look. I've already pre-ordered this.

I need it in my life badly.I don't think my local bookstore gets a lot of pre-orders, even though I pre-order several books per year, because the clerk, with whom I've spoken about pre-orders before, kept letting me know that this book won't be out until mid-September. I assured her I was well aware, that's why I am PRE-ordering it.She made note of my knowledge.

So, anyway...Remember when Caitlin requested children?This is the result of that request.And now: The review!I'm a tad bitter that Caitlin is so much younger than I am because I blame her for not being born in time to get this book out when I was a kid. Do you know how much I would have freaking LOVED this? I mean, I liked it quite well as an adult but it was mostly just a fun read. Had I read this between the ages of 9-13, it would have become my holy bible. Everything I learned about death in childhood came from the high mortality rate of animals around me and my family. Also because of bodies found in the woods in areas we'd recently visited, making us look like a serial killer family although we weren't. Because had we been, I wouldn't have needed to know so many things about death. Similarly, had this book been available to me at that time, I wouldn't have needed to know so many things about death.At any rate, Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs offers lighthearted, conversational answers to some very important questions, such as: Can I fill my belly with popcorn kernels right before I die in order to blow up the incinerator when I'm cremated? and Will I poop when I die? Knowing the answers to these questions can help take the alienness out of death, giving our demises back to us. Caitlin writes in her sassy tone that is also compassionate and nonchalant because there are no shocking questions about death for this woman.If you have a child who is freaked out over the thought of death and dying, gift this book to the tyke. Each chapter has lovely illustrations (the cremation illustration is my favorite, though I found most of them quite charming) that make death look like a friend, not a scary enemy."
26,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5358527-susie,4,"This is definitely one of those books that will make me annoy my partner with lots of ""Did you know?""s."
27,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4984609-sandi,4,"4 starsThis book was written with children in mind. It is sectioned by questions on death that have been asked by children. Some are very informational, others are a bit humorous, but Doughty has done her best in both answering the question per se and also giving additional useful information. This book tells a lot about cremation and about death rituals in other countries. It dismisses fears and corrects misconceptions. It tackles everything from ""What would happen if you swallowed a bag of popcorn before you died and were cremated?' to ""What would happen if you died on an airplane? and ""What happens when a cemetery is full of bodies and you can't add any more?"" - which I found very interesting. I believe that this is Caitlin Doughty's third book - all of them being very informative. She brings a lot of humor to her books, enabling her to write on a topic that is very sensitive and often taboo to a lot of people. Being a mortician and owning her own funeral home makes her an expert in her field, has given her innumerable stories to tell, and she tells them very well. "
28,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6915263-nev,4,"Another fun and informative read about death, corpses, and funeral practices. Caitlin Doughty has such a great sense of humor, it really adds some lightness to what is a pretty heavy topic. If you’ve ever wanted to know if corpses can donate blood, what happens if you eat popcorn kernels before being cremated, or what happens when you die on an airplane then definitely check this book out. Also, the artwork in the book by Dianné Ruz is excellent. "
29,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79261084-yara,4,"Just like a bacteria farts, this book was short and sweet. Wait! No, that didn't come out right. ""Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs?"" (YES! They will!) by Caitlin Doughty is a small book about the big topic of death. The book is written conversationally with Doughty answering questions from children about death. Now, the questions might have been asked by children, but the answers are very adult. As Doughty goes through not only the explanation but also historical and current practices regarding deaths, burials, cremations, and other elements of dying, we gain not only an understanding of what happens to our bodies after we die we also feel that the dark curtain surrounding death is lifted a bit. I found the book highly entertaining; Doughty is a very witty writer (and narrator - I listened to the audiobook). Doughty, who is a mortician in Los Angeles, California, has a strong fascination with death, and apparently, she's quite famous though this is the first time I've encountered her. She imparts her knowledge with humor, macking a subject that, for most, is very dark, approachable, and engaging. Even though children asked the questions, I, myself, have had many of these questions. Like for example: do we poop when we die? The answer is, it depends. If you ate right before you died, there's a good chance you'll poop after you die. As I noted above, Doughty narrated the audiobook, and I thought she did an excellent job. She can annunciate and modulate, which is really half the battle when you're narrating. I highly recommend this book; it's instructive, fun, and not too long."
30,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105191338-kat,4,"Before reading this book, I would've never imagined the day where a book about death, bodily fluids, corpses and such would be even be on my radar of anything I would want to know about. I fall cleanly into the 'ignorance is bliss' category on some subjects. So why would I choose to read this book anyway? Well, the technical reason is that it was the non-fiction monthly group read choice for one of my groups. The more accurate reason is that there's a cat on the cover and how could I possibly pass by any book whose title includes the words Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? and not be at least a little curious, especially seeing how my own cat stares at me at times. I need to know if she's just waiting me out while she works on her future meal plan. Caitlin Doughty has written a book that handles a very difficult subject with both fact and humor. The questions posed in the book come from children, and it's their imaginative (and sometimes brutal) curiosity that allows us adults to benefit from the questions we might be too timid to ask. Some might find using a humorous approach to the topic mildly crass or disrespectful, but I appreciated that Doughty broke through the polite barriers in a way that, for me at least, felt safe and enjoyable. She's like the cool science teacher you always wish you'd had. The only downside for me is simply that I started tiring of the subject as I went along. Some questions were more interesting than others, and I found myself only wanting to read the book in small doses at a time. I learned a lot - in some cases much more than I wanted to know - but it's a very well written, engaging and informative book. I don't recommend it for the overly squeamish, but I think most people would enjoy it.★★★ ½ (rounded to 4)"
31,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3670585-erin-cataldi,5,"Seriously SOO GOOD! If you're a fan of Caitlin Doughty's previous book, ""Smoke Get's in Your Eyes"" or Mary Roach's class, ""Stiff,"" then you will absolutely appreciate the smarts and humor that went into making this book. Each chapter centers on a different ""taboo"" question that Caitlin has been asked over her career in the funeral business. From dying in space to cannibalism to viking funerals to corpses pooping. The questions are answered with grace, but also lots of humor and levity. The accompanying illustrations are also creepy and beautiful. This book answers so many questions I didn't even know I had. Truly stellar this book is a must read! "

Caitlin is an amazing person who always makes me laugh and feel grossed out at the same time! Although, the more I read about death and the dying process, the less grossed out I feel, which is a plus (I think). I have read Doughty’s previous novels and especially loved ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"" ever since I read it in full at Barnes and Noble one day, then went back a year later and bought it! Caitlin Doughty has a wonderful way of educating you about all these macabre topics but making it entertaining while ALSO keeping the conversation respectful towards individual beliefs and the dead themselves. And the artwork by Dianné Ruz was absolutely beautiful, matching the book perfectly. I simply devoured this book in a day and I would recommend this to anyone with a morbid interest or even a simple curiosity in what happens when/after we die. Thank you so much to W. W. Norton & Company for the free advanced copy in exchange for an honest review! “Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs?” is published on 9/10/19 and you will NOT want to miss it!"

So of course I had to read this one too. In this the author answers children’s questions about death including the question that is the title. I read most of the book out loud to the First Mate. There were just too many cool facts not to. My two favourite chapters were “What would happen to an astronaut body in space?” and “Can we give Grandma a Viking funeral?” The basic answer to the first question is that sci-fi books tend to get it wrong. And the second question is that the flaming floating boat is a Hollywood trick. The First Mate’s favourite was “Why don’t animals dig up all the graves?” Reasons. I love this book because it be funny, answers concisely and clearly about even the hypotheticals, and really does any excellent job explaining the whys and laws involved. The chapters be short but the book is a blast. Society should be able to discuss death instead of it being taboo. Arrr!Check out me other reviews at https://thecaptainsquartersblog.wordp..."

The art features a girl and a skeleton, minimalist, just a tad creepy, but also adorable. Which is pretty much the same as the text. It's fascinating what questions kids ask, and Doughty is clear and accurate in a casual, slightly snarky tone. The answers are age-appropriate for even quite young children because there's nothing scary: it's all the debunking of scary, really. Really entertaining and clever.

When they start to smell? Etc., as well as related interesting facts. While some stuff I knew from procedurals and mysteries, it is still a nice read with some jokes.The book is chiefly for the US public – they discuss laws regarding desecration of corpses (can I have my mom’s skull if we explicitly allowed it? Short answer is ‘no’), whether real estate agent should tell you about death in property you buy (depends on the state)… several urban legends are debunked (what happens if you eat pop-corn and then cremated?) about which I’ve never heard of.There are also some interesting facts about graves and cemeteries, like multi-story ones in Singapore and Hong Kong or renting grave sites instead of buying them."

The art and ideas are cute, but it's pitched to (I think) a middle-grade audience. Not really my kind of thing. So I'm closing it out as DNF, after reading and skimming half or more -- but you may want to take a look. And read some of the more-enthusiastic reviews! Such as LM Bujold's, https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... A quick and easy read, if it catches your fancy. Weak 3 stars from me."

The humor helps a lot, in a dad-jokey way, because without it this subject could get bleak. Instead, the questions about death are often interesting, and in some cases, wondrous. The author is knowledgeable and scientific in their responses, but also, add a lot of humanity to be served alongside it. So yeah, if books about death interest you and you want the quick/cheeky answer to a lot of morbid questions, then this book is for you."

The answers were filled with factual information and some experiences from the author’s life.

43,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13717595-jake,4,"The history of human knowledge of the body’s structure and mechanism is likely ancient. Through war, times of starvation, and malady and the many horrors that be-struck ancient humans— have knowledge of the inner contents of our shared fleshy casing been gleaned. Now of course for many history books on medicine, the findings prior to Hippocrates -the proclaimed father of medicine - is somewhat neglected , just as it is the case that in the many mythological creation stories, that there lacks a time before the chaos. A time before matter was with form. I have minor squabbles with this historiography starting at Hippocrates as I have suspicion that we underestimate the ancients knowledge and use of empiricism to navigate the world of health, disease and death. This, is a rant for another time. 	In this our rightfully whiggish history of anatomy, this developmental progress in anatomy and physiology came from the use of pretty terrible theories of the bodies workings with ideas of spirits, to humors to where we are now, which we can see as : complex mechanics. We as humans have gone from dabbling in blood lettings to using blood tests. We now search for microscopic balances of the proper proportion particles from types of lipids, proteins, and other things instead of a large scale balance of phlegm, blood, bile and what have you that people like Galen, and Avicenna presumed to explain the body.  So here we are in the modern age. The body is unambiguously a material structure, and its composition: organic likely without souls, or Elan vital.** This is therefore, a modern book. One which represents questions young teenagers have for the author, a mortification eager for responses on gasses, rigor mortis, body twitches, weak bowels and the horrific and undignified behaviors of a corpse. And guess what! This particular mortician is happy to oblige in the creepy world from which she is quite familiar. In fact, she quite seems to enjoy her topic. From cremations, putrefactions, laws on owning dead bodies, or on moving into a place where a body had died, Doughty answers the many queries peculiar and predictable. And in way she does it, it kinda makes the book kinda fun. Despite the inherent grimness of the material, I will admit I chuckled at times from her quirky and at time absurdist meanderings, because she simply is a pretty amusing writer. Well, as amusing as you can get in the context of blood, death, guts and the whole nine yards of disturbing. Her writings, were segmented by questions and answers are almost made to be put down and picked up again for whenever you find yourself with once again interested in the subject. I recommend this book for those interested in morbid scientific curiosities , and for later stage high school, and fear year undergrad students interested in death, health, medicine and science. It is best complimented by the more systematic and arguably more comprehensive Stiff by Mary Roach. ** I am open for discussion if you have a superior hypothesis to my material conception of nature"

In this genius work of comedy, Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? Big Questions from Tiny Mortals About Death, Doughty sets out to answer questions she has received from kids on all matters related to human decomposition. Kids ask the important questions after all, like ”What would happen if you swallowed a bag of popcorn before you died and were cremated?” If this is the type of stuff that keeps you up at night, then I would recommend Doughy’s book. Death definitely becomes her."

Leave it to the inquiring minds of children to come up with such intriguing questions that lead to such an engrossing book. This is my first non-fiction book of the year and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Though it may not be a novel I'll plop on my shelves to revisit down the road I did learn interesting facts about death that I think everyone should learn in their life. Who would've thought our meat sacks would be so interesting postmortem.
46,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/130372-maree,4,"This honest, quirky little book reminded me very much of Mary Roach’s Stiff, written for a YA or advanced middle grade audience. Most kids are intensely curious, especially about taboo topics having to do with our bodies. Caitlin Doughty answers real questions from children about death with her trademark humor and straightforwardness, using them to demystify one of the most intimidating topics for parents and teachers to tackle. She doesn’t rely on euphemisms to discuss some of the squickiest details of our current and historical handling of dead bodies, but she also manages to write with respect for the personhood of a body and for various cultural traditions. As a librarian, I appreciated her thorough bibliography for each chapter. As a parent, I considered the ways we avoid talking about death with our kids, and how honest, factual conversations can make it feel less scary. I think this book fills a knowledge gap that some kids will really appreciate."

Just like in the previous two books by Caitlin Doughty, the writing is hilarious and insightful at the same time, her style is very distinct and I love it. And even though this novel is directed towards a younger audience and obviously answers their questions, it's still a great read for adults as well. Overall, I'd really recommend checking out either this book or Caitlin's previous novels and don't forget about her YouTube channel! She's brilliant at what she does."

She answers questions lightly, with humor but with true (very interesting) scientific facts and she does that as if she's talking with kids or teens who maybe asked that question, but most of the adults probably should read this book too.Mainly because I (for example) didn't know almost any of that stuff and it just really interesting. Viking funeral? Corpse laws? Cannibalism (fyi, it's legal to eat human meat in most of the countries)? Donating blood after death? Aquamation? So many things unknown because for a lot of people death is still some kind of taboo. No one really wants to talk about it and especially not while joking about filling your stomach with unpopped popcorn kernels just before dying and going into crematorium. (spoiler alert: it won't work) Honestly, i would recommend this to everyone who is interested to know more about mortician's job, decomposition and overall about what happens (or could/couldn't happen) after death."

Adults who aren't too squeamish about death and what happens to corpses after the bacteria start doing their work of consuming the person who used to be their host. All kinds of questions by kids are answered, such as ""why is grandma wrapped in plastic under her clothes in the coffin"" and ""what do corpses smell like"" or what process a corpse goes through when it's put in an incinerator and what the dust resulting from the incineration is actually composed of, or describing how cemeteries must contend with restricted space and are building high rises to house the dead around the world. Satisfies the curiosity if you've ever wondered, ""what happens to our bodies after we die?"". Not for the squeamish, but otherwise good fun as Doughty obviously doesn't take herself or her profession as a mortician too seriously. "
53,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42219802-michelle,5,"Another 5 star book from Doughty! I just recently finished “Smoke Gets in your Eyes” and loved that as much if not more than this one. Highly recommend both of these books! I am so sad that I only have one book left to read by her, at least I feel special because it’s an ARC. I think that’s why I’ve been cherishing it to read last! She is one author that I’d really like to meet in person! Come visit the East Coast Caitlin....pretty please!So....for this year’s #spookathon I challenged myself to read something out of my comfort zone ( ahem—-cats eating eyeballs, confronting death head on, middle grade—- definitely NOT my norm but nonetheless here we are.)In “Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs” we find out that the answer is yes, it’s a very real possibility that your pets will eat you if they are hungry enough, as well as many other answers to questions from children, yes children, that I, a 30 year-old adult never knew that I had. This book truly had me wondering the ENTIRE time if these kids were really that much smarter than I am. Caitlin discusses that, “Young people are often more perceptive than the adults. They weren’t shy about guts and gore.” I also realized that Caitlin always states in her books that we-as humans- have a HUGE problem when it comes to discussing death; we avoid it at all costs. “Most people in our culture are death illiterate, which makes them even more afraid.” I concur, the unknown is horrifying. There was a lot of information in this book that I didn’t know, that I now feel that I NEEDED to know ( and also some really bizarre things that I could’ve passed on—but hey out of the mouth of babes, right? ). So I thank you, creepy little children for asking these questions. I consider myself to be fairly knowledgable about the world of death, having lost so many close loved ones and trying to cope with the grief, but here is some new information that I learned and would like to express my thoughts on:(Most of these you will not know what I’m talking about, which is the point in me being brief, you should read the book!)1. As far as the “waiting mortuary”....I’ll let you read about this one yourself. All I have to say is hell- -to -the -no!2. The Viking funeral- Who is this child? I’m concerned for his well-being.3. The popcorn meme- I admit I searched for it, but I couldn’t find it. But, seriously who has time to think about these things? Very troubling!4. Realtors- I definitely thought that they all were legally obligated to tell you about murders. Creepy. Out come those trust issues!5. Plastification- Wait, what???? I wanna see. I’m going to Body Worlds ASAP.6. “How does a whole adult fit in a tiny box after cremation?” I know how the cremation process works, but I must admit to you that this is the most shocking and gut-wrenching moment for myself as well as many others that I know. You can TRY to prepare yourself for this, but carrying your loved one in your hands at about 5-8 lbs is truly a smack in your face. A huge dose of reality, that person is long gone.7. October 2nd aka “Old Mans Day” is now one of my new favorite holidays! I can’t believe that I just missed it!8. Never have I ever, in probably 50 or More flights, have I considered someone dying on a plane ( of natural causes—that is). “...But with 8 million people flying every day, it is almost inevitable that someone will die from heart problems, lung problems, or other ailments related to old age.” Perfect, thank you for that image and also giving me a new fear. That 1 in a million statistic of dying in a plane crash now seems beautiful and quite preferable to me that sitting next to a strangers corpse all buckled in for who knows how long.9. “The idea that a body can be dissolved in water drives some people wild with fear—especially when they find out that the water used in the process, which is not dangerous in any way, is sent into the sewage system.” Wait.....what? Yes I’m freaking out too, it’s a good thing that I drink bottled water. If there’s something wrong with spring water, please don’t tell me. Hah.10. The fact that they charge more for caskets for larger people should be ”sizism.” That should really be a thing. I can’t stand when I get charged $3 more for a larger sized bra at Victoria’s Secret, but do they care? No. I know there is more material and labor involved in both circumstances but unless you somehow purposely made yourself grow a few inches or enhanced your chest, I think that it’s personally not fair.11. Donating blood when you’re dead? Fascinating! Due to my immune system ( or lack thereof) no one would even want my blood when I’m alive!12. The “leasing” system and not having enough room for all of the dead—“Once grandma has had her time to decompose, her bones need to step aside for a whole new generation of rotting corpses.” Stacking people —-Prayer level, heart level, sky level, no thank you! I’ll just be cremated.Last but certainly not least, here are some topics that never crossed my mind. What happens when the ground is too frozen to bury someone? What if you wanted your pet to be buried with you? Did mummys stink? Read to find out!5 stars!"

And Caitlin Doughty loves answering them.Doughty knows a lot about death: she is a mortician, owns a funeral home, and runs a Youtube series called “ask a mortician”. She handles questions about death with a candid (and necessarily, morbid) sense of humor and refreshing naturalness. Because death is natural - and the more we know about it, the less frightening it is. Or at least it seemed to me while reading this slim volume with quirky illustrations that I have borrowed from my daughter’s Christmas stash.This is not my normal fare and would not have occurred to me to read, if my kid had not asked for it for Christmas. Well, it was informative, and I have enjoyed it, well, as much as a book rich in various stages of putrefaction, bodily fluids, corpse leakage, and the possibility of cats/dogs/humans eating dead bodies can be enjoyed. It is not for the faint of heart, but it is written for teens so if they can handle it, so can you. Well, if you are so inclined, anyway.I recommend looking up her Youtube series “Ask a mortician”. She is a character. And has a Morticia Adams hair cut. For real."

It's true that you can never predict what children will say, or in this case, ask; and those bizarre questions have led to a book that it both educational and chortling good. While I am disappointed that a flaming Viking ship is not in my funereal future, I'm somewhat relieved that my Gracie will probably nibble my lips away before going for my eyes. I'm not sure why that makes me feel better, but it does. Caitlin Doughty could go on indefinitely about a host of normally repulsive topics, and I would eat it all up. It should be added that Diane Ruiz's somewhat ghoulish artwork add greatly to the macabre merriment. I offer a challenge: Pick up this book and read a paragraph. I'm betting that you won't put it down until you regretfully run out of pages.Thanks to W. W. Norton & Company and NetGalley for making an advance copy available for an honest review."
56,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64630449-traceyl,5,"This is an excellent book. It takes a scientific and entertaining look at death by answering some of our most common questions about it. Some of my favorite questions asked were about dying in space (what physically happens to our bodies, as well as if/how we should bring them back to Earth), eating uncooked popcorn before dying and being cremated (will our stomachs explode with popcorn?), and gifting a loved one your skull after death (legally very difficult). I previously read the author's other work From Here to Eternity: Traveling the World to Find the Good Death which was pretty good, but I prefer this question and answer format. I hope the author follows up with more of these books."
57,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7897151-amanda,4,"Very similar to Caitlin’s original Ask A Mortician videos on her YouTube channel. Full of facts, fun information and Caitlin’s macabre and punny sense of humor. Not a ton of new information in here for me, a long-time fan, but still an enjoyable read!"
58,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13798293-kristie,5,"I thought this was a really entertaining and interesting read. It's written for a younger audience, but still kept my attention. Caitlin Doughty managed to present the subject matter in a way that was both informative and fun. My only complaint is that the book does end rather abruptly. There is no wrap-up to bring it to a close. She is just answering a question, then it's done. The questions end very suddenly. I would have liked a short conclusion to the book. 4.5 stars "
59,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9395475-hayley,5,Laugh out loud funny. Great book.
60,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105191338-kat,4,"Before reading this book, I would've never imagined the day where a book about death, bodily fluids, corpses and such would be even be on my radar of anything I would want to know about. I fall cleanly into the 'ignorance is bliss' category on some subjects. So why would I choose to read this book anyway? Well, the technical reason is that it was the non-fiction monthly group read choice for one of my groups. The more accurate reason is that there's a cat on the cover and how could I possibly pass by any book whose title includes the words Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? and not be at least a little curious, especially seeing how my own cat stares at me at times. I need to know if she's just waiting me out while she works on her future meal plan. Caitlin Doughty has written a book that handles a very difficult subject with both fact and humor. The questions posed in the book come from children, and it's their imaginative (and sometimes brutal) curiosity that allows us adults to benefit from the questions we might be too timid to ask. Some might find using a humorous approach to the topic mildly crass or disrespectful, but I appreciated that Doughty broke through the polite barriers in a way that, for me at least, felt safe and enjoyable. She's like the cool science teacher you always wish you'd had. The only downside for me is simply that I started tiring of the subject as I went along. Some questions were more interesting than others, and I found myself only wanting to read the book in small doses at a time. I learned a lot - in some cases much more than I wanted to know - but it's a very well written, engaging and informative book. I don't recommend it for the overly squeamish, but I think most people would enjoy it.★★★ ½ (rounded to 4)"
61,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3670585-erin-cataldi,5,"Seriously SOO GOOD! If you're a fan of Caitlin Doughty's previous book, ""Smoke Get's in Your Eyes"" or Mary Roach's class, ""Stiff,"" then you will absolutely appreciate the smarts and humor that went into making this book. Each chapter centers on a different ""taboo"" question that Caitlin has been asked over her career in the funeral business. From dying in space to cannibalism to viking funerals to corpses pooping. The questions are answered with grace, but also lots of humor and levity. The accompanying illustrations are also creepy and beautiful. This book answers so many questions I didn't even know I had. Truly stellar this book is a must read! "
62,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37256804-sydney,5,"Another amazing book by Caitlin Doughty, this time in Q&A format, answering your weirdest questions that we all want to know the answers to! Caitlin is an amazing person who always makes me laugh and feel grossed out at the same time! Although, the more I read about death and the dying process, the less grossed out I feel, which is a plus (I think). I have read Doughty’s previous novels and especially loved ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"" ever since I read it in full at Barnes and Noble one day, then went back a year later and bought it! Caitlin Doughty has a wonderful way of educating you about all these macabre topics but making it entertaining while ALSO keeping the conversation respectful towards individual beliefs and the dead themselves. And the artwork by Dianné Ruz was absolutely beautiful, matching the book perfectly. I simply devoured this book in a day and I would recommend this to anyone with a morbid interest or even a simple curiosity in what happens when/after we die. Thank you so much to W. W. Norton & Company for the free advanced copy in exchange for an honest review! “Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs?” is published on 9/10/19 and you will NOT want to miss it!"

So of course I had to read this one too. In this the author answers children’s questions about death including the question that is the title. I read most of the book out loud to the First Mate. There were just too many cool facts not to. My two favourite chapters were “What would happen to an astronaut body in space?” and “Can we give Grandma a Viking funeral?” The basic answer to the first question is that sci-fi books tend to get it wrong. And the second question is that the flaming floating boat is a Hollywood trick. The First Mate’s favourite was “Why don’t animals dig up all the graves?” Reasons. I love this book because it be funny, answers concisely and clearly about even the hypotheticals, and really does any excellent job explaining the whys and laws involved. The chapters be short but the book is a blast. Society should be able to discuss death instead of it being taboo. Arrr!Check out me other reviews at https://thecaptainsquartersblog.wordp..."

You're having so much fun reading her responses that you don't even realize that you're learning so much. If the fantastic title and cover won't win you over, the writing inside will definitely change your mind. This was interesting, wacky, and eye-opening. Caitlin has never steered us wrong... yet! "

The art features a girl and a skeleton, minimalist, just a tad creepy, but also adorable. Which is pretty much the same as the text. It's fascinating what questions kids ask, and Doughty is clear and accurate in a casual, slightly snarky tone. The answers are age-appropriate for even quite young children because there's nothing scary: it's all the debunking of scary, really. Really entertaining and clever. Now I'm eager to read her other books.Library copy"

When they start to smell? Etc., as well as related interesting facts. While some stuff I knew from procedurals and mysteries, it is still a nice read with some jokes.The book is chiefly for the US public – they discuss laws regarding desecration of corpses (can I have my mom’s skull if we explicitly allowed it? Short answer is ‘no’), whether real estate agent should tell you about death in property you buy (depends on the state)… several urban legends are debunked (what happens if you eat pop-corn and then cremated?) about which I’ve never heard of.There are also some interesting facts about graves and cemeteries, like multi-story ones in Singapore and Hong Kong or renting grave sites instead of buying them."
69,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,3,"Who could resist a book by a fashionista mortician who answers such questions as, “what would happen if you swallowed a bag of popcorn before you died and were cremated?” OK, on hand. The art and ideas are cute, but it's pitched to (I think) a middle-grade audience. Not really my kind of thing. So I'm closing it out as DNF, after reading and skimming half or more -- but you may want to take a look. And read some of the more-enthusiastic reviews! Such as LM Bujold's, https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... A quick and easy read, if it catches your fancy. Weak 3 stars from me."

The humor helps a lot, in a dad-jokey way, because without it this subject could get bleak. Instead, the questions about death are often interesting, and in some cases, wondrous. The author is knowledgeable and scientific in their responses, but also, add a lot of humanity to be served alongside it. So yeah, if books about death interest you and you want the quick/cheeky answer to a lot of morbid questions, then this book is for you."

The answers were filled with factual information and some experiences from the author’s life. It was nice hearing the author’s voice and humor in the book, but she wasn’t the best narrator I’ve listened to. Her voice is low and husky, which can make it difficult to focus on even though she’s relaxing to listen to."

Although a light reading and has some interesting information, I found the tone of the author and the overall content of the book to be too childish (“kid-friendly”) for my taste.

73,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13717595-jake,4,"The history of human knowledge of the body’s structure and mechanism is likely ancient. Through war, times of starvation, and malady and the many horrors that be-struck ancient humans— have knowledge of the inner contents of our shared fleshy casing been gleaned. Now of course for many history books on medicine, the findings prior to Hippocrates -the proclaimed father of medicine - is somewhat neglected , just as it is the case that in the many mythological creation stories, that there lacks a time before the chaos. A time before matter was with form. I have minor squabbles with this historiography starting at Hippocrates as I have suspicion that we underestimate the ancients knowledge and use of empiricism to navigate the world of health, disease and death. This, is a rant for another time. 	In this our rightfully whiggish history of anatomy, this developmental progress in anatomy and physiology came from the use of pretty terrible theories of the bodies workings with ideas of spirits, to humors to where we are now, which we can see as : complex mechanics. We as humans have gone from dabbling in blood lettings to using blood tests. We now search for microscopic balances of the proper proportion particles from types of lipids, proteins, and other things instead of a large scale balance of phlegm, blood, bile and what have you that people like Galen, and Avicenna presumed to explain the body.  So here we are in the modern age. The body is unambiguously a material structure, and its composition: organic likely without souls, or Elan vital.** This is therefore, a modern book. One which represents questions young teenagers have for the author, a mortification eager for responses on gasses, rigor mortis, body twitches, weak bowels and the horrific and undignified behaviors of a corpse. And guess what! This particular mortician is happy to oblige in the creepy world from which she is quite familiar. In fact, she quite seems to enjoy her topic. From cremations, putrefactions, laws on owning dead bodies, or on moving into a place where a body had died, Doughty answers the many queries peculiar and predictable. And in way she does it, it kinda makes the book kinda fun. Despite the inherent grimness of the material, I will admit I chuckled at times from her quirky and at time absurdist meanderings, because she simply is a pretty amusing writer. Well, as amusing as you can get in the context of blood, death, guts and the whole nine yards of disturbing. Her writings, were segmented by questions and answers are almost made to be put down and picked up again for whenever you find yourself with once again interested in the subject. I recommend this book for those interested in morbid scientific curiosities , and for later stage high school, and fear year undergrad students interested in death, health, medicine and science. It is best complimented by the more systematic and arguably more comprehensive Stiff by Mary Roach. ** I am open for discussion if you have a superior hypothesis to my material conception of nature"
74,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63944124-francesca-calarco,4,"I feel like if more textbooks took the approach of mortician and NPR’s death expert Caitlin Doughty, we would have more kids in STEM. In this genius work of comedy, Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? Big Questions from Tiny Mortals About Death, Doughty sets out to answer questions she has received from kids on all matters related to human decomposition. Kids ask the important questions after all, like ”What would happen if you swallowed a bag of popcorn before you died and were cremated?” If this is the type of stuff that keeps you up at night, then I would recommend Doughy’s book. Death definitely becomes her."
75,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18056144-permanently-booked,4,I can honestly say that I've never wondered what happens if someone dies in space or why bugs don't eat our bones. Leave it to the inquiring minds of children to come up with such intriguing questions that lead to such an engrossing book. This is my first non-fiction book of the year and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Though it may not be a novel I'll plop on my shelves to revisit down the road I did learn interesting facts about death that I think everyone should learn in their life. Who would've thought our meat sacks would be so interesting postmortem.
76,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/130372-maree,4,"This honest, quirky little book reminded me very much of Mary Roach’s Stiff, written for a YA or advanced middle grade audience. Most kids are intensely curious, especially about taboo topics having to do with our bodies. Caitlin Doughty answers real questions from children about death with her trademark humor and straightforwardness, using them to demystify one of the most intimidating topics for parents and teachers to tackle. She doesn’t rely on euphemisms to discuss some of the squickiest details of our current and historical handling of dead bodies, but she also manages to write with respect for the personhood of a body and for various cultural traditions. As a librarian, I appreciated her thorough bibliography for each chapter. As a parent, I considered the ways we avoid talking about death with our kids, and how honest, factual conversations can make it feel less scary. I think this book fills a knowledge gap that some kids will really appreciate."
77,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57432835-mila,5,"This was such a fun ride! Just like in the previous two books by Caitlin Doughty, the writing is hilarious and insightful at the same time, her style is very distinct and I love it. And even though this novel is directed towards a younger audience and obviously answers their questions, it's still a great read for adults as well. Overall, I'd really recommend checking out either this book or Caitlin's previous novels and don't forget about her YouTube channel! She's brilliant at what she does."

The subject matter is something that fascinates me, and the author does a good job of keeping her answers thorough but easy to understand. This wasn't perfect, but my minor complaints feel so petty I won't go into detail. On the whole I prefer ""Stiff"" by Mary Roach, just for the level of detail and the variety of scenarios she discusses, but I will absolutely seek out Doughty's other books now."
79,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16910534-amber,4,"I picked this book up because the title made me laugh. I recently adopted two kittens and they would for sure eat my eyeballs. This was a fun, easy read. This book is definitely different from what I normally read"

81,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34044332-virginija-rudyt,5,"It's a book written by mortician and funeral home director Caitlin Doughty and she decided to do that because kids have no filter (compared to adults) and ask very interesting questions about death and corpses. She answers questions lightly, with humor but with true (very interesting) scientific facts and she does that as if she's talking with kids or teens who maybe asked that question, but most of the adults probably should read this book too.Mainly because I (for example) didn't know almost any of that stuff and it just really interesting. Viking funeral? Corpse laws? Cannibalism (fyi, it's legal to eat human meat in most of the countries)? Donating blood after death? Aquamation? So many things unknown because for a lot of people death is still some kind of taboo. No one really wants to talk about it and especially not while joking about filling your stomach with unpopped popcorn kernels just before dying and going into crematorium. (spoiler alert: it won't work) Honestly, i would recommend this to everyone who is interested to know more about mortician's job, decomposition and overall about what happens (or could/couldn't happen) after death."
82,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59371159-ilana,4,"Really enjoyed this book. It's presumably intended for a young audience, but adults will find plenty to enjoy here too. Adults who aren't too squeamish about death and what happens to corpses after the bacteria start doing their work of consuming the person who used to be their host. All kinds of questions by kids are answered, such as ""why is grandma wrapped in plastic under her clothes in the coffin"" and ""what do corpses smell like"" or what process a corpse goes through when it's put in an incinerator and what the dust resulting from the incineration is actually composed of, or describing how cemeteries must contend with restricted space and are building high rises to house the dead around the world. Satisfies the curiosity if you've ever wondered, ""what happens to our bodies after we die?"". Not for the squeamish, but otherwise good fun as Doughty obviously doesn't take herself or her profession as a mortician too seriously. "
83,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42219802-michelle,5,"Another 5 star book from Doughty! I just recently finished “Smoke Gets in your Eyes” and loved that as much if not more than this one. Highly recommend both of these books! I am so sad that I only have one book left to read by her, at least I feel special because it’s an ARC. I think that’s why I’ve been cherishing it to read last! She is one author that I’d really like to meet in person! Come visit the East Coast Caitlin....pretty please!So....for this year’s #spookathon I challenged myself to read something out of my comfort zone ( ahem—-cats eating eyeballs, confronting death head on, middle grade—- definitely NOT my norm but nonetheless here we are.)In “Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs” we find out that the answer is yes, it’s a very real possibility that your pets will eat you if they are hungry enough, as well as many other answers to questions from children, yes children, that I, a 30 year-old adult never knew that I had. This book truly had me wondering the ENTIRE time if these kids were really that much smarter than I am. Caitlin discusses that, “Young people are often more perceptive than the adults. They weren’t shy about guts and gore.” I also realized that Caitlin always states in her books that we-as humans- have a HUGE problem when it comes to discussing death; we avoid it at all costs. “Most people in our culture are death illiterate, which makes them even more afraid.” I concur, the unknown is horrifying. There was a lot of information in this book that I didn’t know, that I now feel that I NEEDED to know ( and also some really bizarre things that I could’ve passed on—but hey out of the mouth of babes, right? ). So I thank you, creepy little children for asking these questions. I consider myself to be fairly knowledgable about the world of death, having lost so many close loved ones and trying to cope with the grief, but here is some new information that I learned and would like to express my thoughts on:(Most of these you will not know what I’m talking about, which is the point in me being brief, you should read the book!)1. As far as the “waiting mortuary”....I’ll let you read about this one yourself. All I have to say is hell- -to -the -no!2. The Viking funeral- Who is this child? I’m concerned for his well-being.3. The popcorn meme- I admit I searched for it, but I couldn’t find it. But, seriously who has time to think about these things? Very troubling!4. Realtors- I definitely thought that they all were legally obligated to tell you about murders. Creepy. Out come those trust issues!5. Plastification- Wait, what???? I wanna see. I’m going to Body Worlds ASAP.6. “How does a whole adult fit in a tiny box after cremation?” I know how the cremation process works, but I must admit to you that this is the most shocking and gut-wrenching moment for myself as well as many others that I know. You can TRY to prepare yourself for this, but carrying your loved one in your hands at about 5-8 lbs is truly a smack in your face. A huge dose of reality, that person is long gone.7. October 2nd aka “Old Mans Day” is now one of my new favorite holidays! I can’t believe that I just missed it!8. Never have I ever, in probably 50 or More flights, have I considered someone dying on a plane ( of natural causes—that is). “...But with 8 million people flying every day, it is almost inevitable that someone will die from heart problems, lung problems, or other ailments related to old age.” Perfect, thank you for that image and also giving me a new fear. That 1 in a million statistic of dying in a plane crash now seems beautiful and quite preferable to me that sitting next to a strangers corpse all buckled in for who knows how long.9. “The idea that a body can be dissolved in water drives some people wild with fear—especially when they find out that the water used in the process, which is not dangerous in any way, is sent into the sewage system.” Wait.....what? Yes I’m freaking out too, it’s a good thing that I drink bottled water. If there’s something wrong with spring water, please don’t tell me. Hah.10. The fact that they charge more for caskets for larger people should be ”sizism.” That should really be a thing. I can’t stand when I get charged $3 more for a larger sized bra at Victoria’s Secret, but do they care? No. I know there is more material and labor involved in both circumstances but unless you somehow purposely made yourself grow a few inches or enhanced your chest, I think that it’s personally not fair.11. Donating blood when you’re dead? Fascinating! Due to my immune system ( or lack thereof) no one would even want my blood when I’m alive!12. The “leasing” system and not having enough room for all of the dead—“Once grandma has had her time to decompose, her bones need to step aside for a whole new generation of rotting corpses.” Stacking people —-Prayer level, heart level, sky level, no thank you! I’ll just be cremated.Last but certainly not least, here are some topics that never crossed my mind. What happens when the ground is too frozen to bury someone? What if you wanted your pet to be buried with you? Did mummys stink? Read to find out!5 stars!"

And Caitlin Doughty loves answering them.Doughty knows a lot about death: she is a mortician, owns a funeral home, and runs a Youtube series called “ask a mortician”. She handles questions about death with a candid (and necessarily, morbid) sense of humor and refreshing naturalness. Because death is natural - and the more we know about it, the less frightening it is. Or at least it seemed to me while reading this slim volume with quirky illustrations that I have borrowed from my daughter’s Christmas stash.This is not my normal fare and would not have occurred to me to read, if my kid had not asked for it for Christmas. Well, it was informative, and I have enjoyed it, well, as much as a book rich in various stages of putrefaction, bodily fluids, corpse leakage, and the possibility of cats/dogs/humans eating dead bodies can be enjoyed. It is not for the faint of heart, but it is written for teens so if they can handle it, so can you. Well, if you are so inclined, anyway.I recommend looking up her Youtube series “Ask a mortician”.

I'm not sure why that makes me feel better, but it does. Caitlin Doughty could go on indefinitely about a host of normally repulsive topics, and I would eat it all up. It should be added that Diane Ruiz's somewhat ghoulish artwork add greatly to the macabre merriment. I offer a challenge: Pick up this book and read a paragraph.

It takes a scientific and entertaining look at death by answering some of our most common questions about it. Some of my favorite questions asked were about dying in space (what physically happens to our bodies, as well as if/how we should bring them back to Earth), eating uncooked popcorn before dying and being cremated (will our stomachs explode with popcorn?), and gifting a loved one your skull after death (legally very difficult). I previously read the author's other work From Here to Eternity: Traveling the World to Find the Good Death which was pretty good, but I prefer this question and answer format. I hope the author follows up with more of these books."

Caitlin Doughty managed to present the subject matter in a way that was both informative and fun. My only complaint is that the book does end rather abruptly. There is no wrap-up to bring it to a close. She is just answering a question, then it's done. The questions end very suddenly. I would have liked a short conclusion to the book. 4.5 stars "

90,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105191338-kat,4,"Before reading this book, I would've never imagined the day where a book about death, bodily fluids, corpses and such would be even be on my radar of anything I would want to know about. I fall cleanly into the 'ignorance is bliss' category on some subjects. So why would I choose to read this book anyway? Well, the technical reason is that it was the non-fiction monthly group read choice for one of my groups. The more accurate reason is that there's a cat on the cover and how could I possibly pass by any book whose title includes the words Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? and not be at least a little curious, especially seeing how my own cat stares at me at times. I need to know if she's just waiting me out while she works on her future meal plan. Caitlin Doughty has written a book that handles a very difficult subject with both fact and humor. The questions posed in the book come from children, and it's their imaginative (and sometimes brutal) curiosity that allows us adults to benefit from the questions we might be too timid to ask. Some might find using a humorous approach to the topic mildly crass or disrespectful, but I appreciated that Doughty broke through the polite barriers in a way that, for me at least, felt safe and enjoyable. She's like the cool science teacher you always wish you'd had. The only downside for me is simply that I started tiring of the subject as I went along. Some questions were more interesting than others, and I found myself only wanting to read the book in small doses at a time. I learned a lot - in some cases much more than I wanted to know - but it's a very well written, engaging and informative book. I don't recommend it for the overly squeamish, but I think most people would enjoy it.★★★ ½ (rounded to 4)"

If you're a fan of Caitlin Doughty's previous book, ""Smoke Get's in Your Eyes"" or Mary Roach's class, ""Stiff,"" then you will absolutely appreciate the smarts and humor that went into making this book. Each chapter centers on a different ""taboo"" question that Caitlin has been asked over her career in the funeral business. From dying in space to cannibalism to viking funerals to corpses pooping. The questions are answered with grace, but also lots of humor and levity. The accompanying illustrations are also creepy and beautiful. This book answers so many questions I didn't even know I had. Truly stellar this book is a must read! "

Caitlin is an amazing person who always makes me laugh and feel grossed out at the same time! Although, the more I read about death and the dying process, the less grossed out I feel, which is a plus (I think). I have read Doughty’s previous novels and especially loved ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"" ever since I read it in full at Barnes and Noble one day, then went back a year later and bought it! Caitlin Doughty has a wonderful way of educating you about all these macabre topics but making it entertaining while ALSO keeping the conversation respectful towards individual beliefs and the dead themselves. And the artwork by Dianné Ruz was absolutely beautiful, matching the book perfectly. I simply devoured this book in a day and I would recommend this to anyone with a morbid interest or even a simple curiosity in what happens when/after we die. Thank you so much to W. W.

So of course I had to read this one too. In this the author answers children’s questions about death including the question that is the title. I read most of the book out loud to the First Mate. There were just too many cool facts not to. My two favourite chapters were “What would happen to an astronaut body in space?” and “Can we give Grandma a Viking funeral?” The basic answer to the first question is that sci-fi books tend to get it wrong. And the second question is that the flaming floating boat is a Hollywood trick. The First Mate’s favourite was “Why don’t animals dig up all the graves?” Reasons. I love this book because it be funny, answers concisely and clearly about even the hypotheticals, and really does any excellent job explaining the whys and laws involved. The chapters be short but the book is a blast. Society should be able to discuss death instead of it being taboo. Arrr!Check out me other reviews at https://thecaptainsquartersblog.wordp..."

The art features a girl and a skeleton, minimalist, just a tad creepy, but also adorable. Which is pretty much the same as the text. It's fascinating what questions kids ask, and Doughty is clear and accurate in a casual, slightly snarky tone. The answers are age-appropriate for even quite young children because there's nothing scary: it's all the debunking of scary, really. Really entertaining and clever.

When they start to smell? Etc., as well as related interesting facts. While some stuff I knew from procedurals and mysteries, it is still a nice read with some jokes.The book is chiefly for the US public – they discuss laws regarding desecration of corpses (can I have my mom’s skull if we explicitly allowed it? Short answer is ‘no’), whether real estate agent should tell you about death in property you buy (depends on the state)… several urban legends are debunked (what happens if you eat pop-corn and then cremated?) about which I’ve never heard of.There are also some interesting facts about graves and cemeteries, like multi-story ones in Singapore and Hong Kong or renting grave sites instead of buying them."

The art and ideas are cute, but it's pitched to (I think) a middle-grade audience. Not really my kind of thing. So I'm closing it out as DNF, after reading and skimming half or more -- but you may want to take a look. And read some of the more-enthusiastic reviews!

The humor helps a lot, in a dad-jokey way, because without it this subject could get bleak. Instead, the questions about death are often interesting, and in some cases, wondrous. The author is knowledgeable and scientific in their responses, but also, add a lot of humanity to be served alongside it.

The answers were filled with factual information and some experiences from the author’s life. It was nice hearing the author’s voice and humor in the book, but she wasn’t the best narrator I’ve listened to. Her voice is low and husky, which can make it difficult to focus on even though she’s relaxing to listen to."

103,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13717595-jake,4,"The history of human knowledge of the body’s structure and mechanism is likely ancient. Through war, times of starvation, and malady and the many horrors that be-struck ancient humans— have knowledge of the inner contents of our shared fleshy casing been gleaned. Now of course for many history books on medicine, the findings prior to Hippocrates -the proclaimed father of medicine - is somewhat neglected , just as it is the case that in the many mythological creation stories, that there lacks a time before the chaos. A time before matter was with form. I have minor squabbles with this historiography starting at Hippocrates as I have suspicion that we underestimate the ancients knowledge and use of empiricism to navigate the world of health, disease and death. This, is a rant for another time. 	In this our rightfully whiggish history of anatomy, this developmental progress in anatomy and physiology came from the use of pretty terrible theories of the bodies workings with ideas of spirits, to humors to where we are now, which we can see as : complex mechanics. We as humans have gone from dabbling in blood lettings to using blood tests. We now search for microscopic balances of the proper proportion particles from types of lipids, proteins, and other things instead of a large scale balance of phlegm, blood, bile and what have you that people like Galen, and Avicenna presumed to explain the body.  So here we are in the modern age. The body is unambiguously a material structure, and its composition: organic likely without souls, or Elan vital.** This is therefore, a modern book. One which represents questions young teenagers have for the author, a mortification eager for responses on gasses, rigor mortis, body twitches, weak bowels and the horrific and undignified behaviors of a corpse. And guess what! This particular mortician is happy to oblige in the creepy world from which she is quite familiar. In fact, she quite seems to enjoy her topic. From cremations, putrefactions, laws on owning dead bodies, or on moving into a place where a body had died, Doughty answers the many queries peculiar and predictable. And in way she does it, it kinda makes the book kinda fun. Despite the inherent grimness of the material, I will admit I chuckled at times from her quirky and at time absurdist meanderings, because she simply is a pretty amusing writer. Well, as amusing as you can get in the context of blood, death, guts and the whole nine yards of disturbing. Her writings, were segmented by questions and answers are almost made to be put down and picked up again for whenever you find yourself with once again interested in the subject. I recommend this book for those interested in morbid scientific curiosities , and for later stage high school, and fear year undergrad students interested in death, health, medicine and science. It is best complimented by the more systematic and arguably more comprehensive Stiff by Mary Roach. ** I am open for discussion if you have a superior hypothesis to my material conception of nature"
104,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63944124-francesca-calarco,4,"I feel like if more textbooks took the approach of mortician and NPR’s death expert Caitlin Doughty, we would have more kids in STEM. In this genius work of comedy, Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? Big Questions from Tiny Mortals About Death, Doughty sets out to answer questions she has received from kids on all matters related to human decomposition. Kids ask the important questions after all, like ”What would happen if you swallowed a bag of popcorn before you died and were cremated?” If this is the type of stuff that keeps you up at night, then I would recommend Doughy’s book. Death definitely becomes her."
105,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18056144-permanently-booked,4,I can honestly say that I've never wondered what happens if someone dies in space or why bugs don't eat our bones. Leave it to the inquiring minds of children to come up with such intriguing questions that lead to such an engrossing book. This is my first non-fiction book of the year and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Though it may not be a novel I'll plop on my shelves to revisit down the road I did learn interesting facts about death that I think everyone should learn in their life. Who would've thought our meat sacks would be so interesting postmortem.
106,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/130372-maree,4,"This honest, quirky little book reminded me very much of Mary Roach’s Stiff, written for a YA or advanced middle grade audience. Most kids are intensely curious, especially about taboo topics having to do with our bodies. Caitlin Doughty answers real questions from children about death with her trademark humor and straightforwardness, using them to demystify one of the most intimidating topics for parents and teachers to tackle. She doesn’t rely on euphemisms to discuss some of the squickiest details of our current and historical handling of dead bodies, but she also manages to write with respect for the personhood of a body and for various cultural traditions. As a librarian, I appreciated her thorough bibliography for each chapter. As a parent, I considered the ways we avoid talking about death with our kids, and how honest, factual conversations can make it feel less scary. I think this book fills a knowledge gap that some kids will really appreciate."

Just like in the previous two books by Caitlin Doughty, the writing is hilarious and insightful at the same time, her style is very distinct and I love it. And even though this novel is directed towards a younger audience and obviously answers their questions, it's still a great read for adults as well. Overall, I'd really recommend checking out either this book or Caitlin's previous novels and don't forget about her YouTube channel! She's brilliant at what she does."

111,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34044332-virginija-rudyt,5,"It's a book written by mortician and funeral home director Caitlin Doughty and she decided to do that because kids have no filter (compared to adults) and ask very interesting questions about death and corpses. She answers questions lightly, with humor but with true (very interesting) scientific facts and she does that as if she's talking with kids or teens who maybe asked that question, but most of the adults probably should read this book too.Mainly because I (for example) didn't know almost any of that stuff and it just really interesting. Viking funeral? Corpse laws? Cannibalism (fyi, it's legal to eat human meat in most of the countries)? Donating blood after death? Aquamation? So many things unknown because for a lot of people death is still some kind of taboo. No one really wants to talk about it and especially not while joking about filling your stomach with unpopped popcorn kernels just before dying and going into crematorium. (spoiler alert: it won't work) Honestly, i would recommend this to everyone who is interested to know more about mortician's job, decomposition and overall about what happens (or could/couldn't happen) after death."
112,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59371159-ilana,4,"Really enjoyed this book. It's presumably intended for a young audience, but adults will find plenty to enjoy here too. Adults who aren't too squeamish about death and what happens to corpses after the bacteria start doing their work of consuming the person who used to be their host. All kinds of questions by kids are answered, such as ""why is grandma wrapped in plastic under her clothes in the coffin"" and ""what do corpses smell like"" or what process a corpse goes through when it's put in an incinerator and what the dust resulting from the incineration is actually composed of, or describing how cemeteries must contend with restricted space and are building high rises to house the dead around the world. Satisfies the curiosity if you've ever wondered, ""what happens to our bodies after we die?"". Not for the squeamish, but otherwise good fun as Doughty obviously doesn't take herself or her profession as a mortician too seriously. "
113,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42219802-michelle,5,"Another 5 star book from Doughty! I just recently finished “Smoke Gets in your Eyes” and loved that as much if not more than this one. Highly recommend both of these books! I am so sad that I only have one book left to read by her, at least I feel special because it’s an ARC. I think that’s why I’ve been cherishing it to read last! She is one author that I’d really like to meet in person! Come visit the East Coast Caitlin....pretty please!So....for this year’s #spookathon I challenged myself to read something out of my comfort zone ( ahem—-cats eating eyeballs, confronting death head on, middle grade—- definitely NOT my norm but nonetheless here we are.)In “Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs” we find out that the answer is yes, it’s a very real possibility that your pets will eat you if they are hungry enough, as well as many other answers to questions from children, yes children, that I, a 30 year-old adult never knew that I had. This book truly had me wondering the ENTIRE time if these kids were really that much smarter than I am. Caitlin discusses that, “Young people are often more perceptive than the adults. They weren’t shy about guts and gore.” I also realized that Caitlin always states in her books that we-as humans- have a HUGE problem when it comes to discussing death; we avoid it at all costs. “Most people in our culture are death illiterate, which makes them even more afraid.” I concur, the unknown is horrifying. There was a lot of information in this book that I didn’t know, that I now feel that I NEEDED to know ( and also some really bizarre things that I could’ve passed on—but hey out of the mouth of babes, right? ). So I thank you, creepy little children for asking these questions. I consider myself to be fairly knowledgable about the world of death, having lost so many close loved ones and trying to cope with the grief, but here is some new information that I learned and would like to express my thoughts on:(Most of these you will not know what I’m talking about, which is the point in me being brief, you should read the book!)1. As far as the “waiting mortuary”....I’ll let you read about this one yourself. All I have to say is hell- -to -the -no!2. The Viking funeral- Who is this child? I’m concerned for his well-being.3. The popcorn meme- I admit I searched for it, but I couldn’t find it. But, seriously who has time to think about these things? Very troubling!4. Realtors- I definitely thought that they all were legally obligated to tell you about murders. Creepy. Out come those trust issues!5. Plastification- Wait, what???? I wanna see. I’m going to Body Worlds ASAP.6. “How does a whole adult fit in a tiny box after cremation?” I know how the cremation process works, but I must admit to you that this is the most shocking and gut-wrenching moment for myself as well as many others that I know. You can TRY to prepare yourself for this, but carrying your loved one in your hands at about 5-8 lbs is truly a smack in your face. A huge dose of reality, that person is long gone.7. October 2nd aka “Old Mans Day” is now one of my new favorite holidays! I can’t believe that I just missed it!8. Never have I ever, in probably 50 or More flights, have I considered someone dying on a plane ( of natural causes—that is). “...But with 8 million people flying every day, it is almost inevitable that someone will die from heart problems, lung problems, or other ailments related to old age.” Perfect, thank you for that image and also giving me a new fear. That 1 in a million statistic of dying in a plane crash now seems beautiful and quite preferable to me that sitting next to a strangers corpse all buckled in for who knows how long.9. “The idea that a body can be dissolved in water drives some people wild with fear—especially when they find out that the water used in the process, which is not dangerous in any way, is sent into the sewage system.” Wait.....what? Yes I’m freaking out too, it’s a good thing that I drink bottled water. If there’s something wrong with spring water, please don’t tell me. Hah.10. The fact that they charge more for caskets for larger people should be ”sizism.” That should really be a thing. I can’t stand when I get charged $3 more for a larger sized bra at Victoria’s Secret, but do they care? No. I know there is more material and labor involved in both circumstances but unless you somehow purposely made yourself grow a few inches or enhanced your chest, I think that it’s personally not fair.11. Donating blood when you’re dead? Fascinating! Due to my immune system ( or lack thereof) no one would even want my blood when I’m alive!12. The “leasing” system and not having enough room for all of the dead—“Once grandma has had her time to decompose, her bones need to step aside for a whole new generation of rotting corpses.” Stacking people —-Prayer level, heart level, sky level, no thank you! I’ll just be cremated.Last but certainly not least, here are some topics that never crossed my mind. What happens when the ground is too frozen to bury someone? What if you wanted your pet to be buried with you? Did mummys stink? Read to find out!5 stars!"

I'm not sure why that makes me feel better, but it does. Caitlin Doughty could go on indefinitely about a host of normally repulsive topics, and I would eat it all up. It should be added that Diane Ruiz's somewhat ghoulish artwork add greatly to the macabre merriment. I offer a challenge: Pick up this book and read a paragraph.

116,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64630449-traceyl,5,"This is an excellent book. It takes a scientific and entertaining look at death by answering some of our most common questions about it. Some of my favorite questions asked were about dying in space (what physically happens to our bodies, as well as if/how we should bring them back to Earth), eating uncooked popcorn before dying and being cremated (will our stomachs explode with popcorn?), and gifting a loved one your skull after death (legally very difficult). I previously read the author's other work From Here to Eternity: Traveling the World to Find the Good Death which was pretty good, but I prefer this question and answer format. I hope the author follows up with more of these books."

120,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105191338-kat,4,"Before reading this book, I would've never imagined the day where a book about death, bodily fluids, corpses and such would be even be on my radar of anything I would want to know about. I fall cleanly into the 'ignorance is bliss' category on some subjects. So why would I choose to read this book anyway? Well, the technical reason is that it was the non-fiction monthly group read choice for one of my groups. The more accurate reason is that there's a cat on the cover and how could I possibly pass by any book whose title includes the words Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? and not be at least a little curious, especially seeing how my own cat stares at me at times. I need to know if she's just waiting me out while she works on her future meal plan. Caitlin Doughty has written a book that handles a very difficult subject with both fact and humor. The questions posed in the book come from children, and it's their imaginative (and sometimes brutal) curiosity that allows us adults to benefit from the questions we might be too timid to ask. Some might find using a humorous approach to the topic mildly crass or disrespectful, but I appreciated that Doughty broke through the polite barriers in a way that, for me at least, felt safe and enjoyable. She's like the cool science teacher you always wish you'd had. The only downside for me is simply that I started tiring of the subject as I went along. Some questions were more interesting than others, and I found myself only wanting to read the book in small doses at a time. I learned a lot - in some cases much more than I wanted to know - but it's a very well written, engaging and informative book. I don't recommend it for the overly squeamish, but I think most people would enjoy it.★★★ ½ (rounded to 4)"

If you're a fan of Caitlin Doughty's previous book, ""Smoke Get's in Your Eyes"" or Mary Roach's class, ""Stiff,"" then you will absolutely appreciate the smarts and humor that went into making this book. Each chapter centers on a different ""taboo"" question that Caitlin has been asked over her career in the funeral business. From dying in space to cannibalism to viking funerals to corpses pooping. The questions are answered with grace, but also lots of humor and levity. The accompanying illustrations are also creepy and beautiful. This book answers so many questions I didn't even know I had. Truly stellar this book is a must read! "

Caitlin is an amazing person who always makes me laugh and feel grossed out at the same time! Although, the more I read about death and the dying process, the less grossed out I feel, which is a plus (I think). I have read Doughty’s previous novels and especially loved ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"" ever since I read it in full at Barnes and Noble one day, then went back a year later and bought it! Caitlin Doughty has a wonderful way of educating you about all these macabre topics but making it entertaining while ALSO keeping the conversation respectful towards individual beliefs and the dead themselves. And the artwork by Dianné Ruz was absolutely beautiful, matching the book perfectly. I simply devoured this book in a day and I would recommend this to anyone with a morbid interest or even a simple curiosity in what happens when/after we die. Thank you so much to W. W. Norton & Company for the free advanced copy in exchange for an honest review! “Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs?” is published on 9/10/19 and you will NOT want to miss it!"

So of course I had to read this one too. In this the author answers children’s questions about death including the question that is the title. I read most of the book out loud to the First Mate. There were just too many cool facts not to. My two favourite chapters were “What would happen to an astronaut body in space?” and “Can we give Grandma a Viking funeral?” The basic answer to the first question is that sci-fi books tend to get it wrong. And the second question is that the flaming floating boat is a Hollywood trick. The First Mate’s favourite was “Why don’t animals dig up all the graves?” Reasons. I love this book because it be funny, answers concisely and clearly about even the hypotheticals, and really does any excellent job explaining the whys and laws involved. The chapters be short but the book is a blast. Society should be able to discuss death instead of it being taboo. Arrr!Check out me other reviews at https://thecaptainsquartersblog.wordp..."

You're having so much fun reading her responses that you don't even realize that you're learning so much.

The art features a girl and a skeleton, minimalist, just a tad creepy, but also adorable. Which is pretty much the same as the text. It's fascinating what questions kids ask, and Doughty is clear and accurate in a casual, slightly snarky tone. The answers are age-appropriate for even quite young children because there's nothing scary: it's all the debunking of scary, really. Really entertaining and clever. Now I'm eager to read her other books.Library copy"

When they start to smell? Etc., as well as related interesting facts. While some stuff I knew from procedurals and mysteries, it is still a nice read with some jokes.The book is chiefly for the US public – they discuss laws regarding desecration of corpses (can I have my mom’s skull if we explicitly allowed it? Short answer is ‘no’), whether real estate agent should tell you about death in property you buy (depends on the state)… several urban legends are debunked (what happens if you eat pop-corn and then cremated?) about which I’ve never heard of.There are also some interesting facts about graves and cemeteries, like multi-story ones in Singapore and Hong Kong or renting grave sites instead of buying them."

The art and ideas are cute, but it's pitched to (I think) a middle-grade audience. Not really my kind of thing. So I'm closing it out as DNF, after reading and skimming half or more -- but you may want to take a look. And read some of the more-enthusiastic reviews!

The humor helps a lot, in a dad-jokey way, because without it this subject could get bleak. Instead, the questions about death are often interesting, and in some cases, wondrous. The author is knowledgeable and scientific in their responses, but also, add a lot of humanity to be served alongside it. So yeah, if books about death interest you and you want the quick/cheeky answer to a lot of morbid questions, then this book is for you."

The answers were filled with factual information and some experiences from the author’s life. It was nice hearing the author’s voice and humor in the book, but she wasn’t the best narrator I’ve listened to. Her voice is low and husky, which can make it difficult to focus on even though she’s relaxing to listen to."

Although a light reading and has some interesting information, I found the tone of the author and the overall content of the book to be too childish (“kid-friendly”) for my taste.

133,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13717595-jake,4,"The history of human knowledge of the body’s structure and mechanism is likely ancient. Through war, times of starvation, and malady and the many horrors that be-struck ancient humans— have knowledge of the inner contents of our shared fleshy casing been gleaned. Now of course for many history books on medicine, the findings prior to Hippocrates -the proclaimed father of medicine - is somewhat neglected , just as it is the case that in the many mythological creation stories, that there lacks a time before the chaos. A time before matter was with form. I have minor squabbles with this historiography starting at Hippocrates as I have suspicion that we underestimate the ancients knowledge and use of empiricism to navigate the world of health, disease and death. This, is a rant for another time. 	In this our rightfully whiggish history of anatomy, this developmental progress in anatomy and physiology came from the use of pretty terrible theories of the bodies workings with ideas of spirits, to humors to where we are now, which we can see as : complex mechanics. We as humans have gone from dabbling in blood lettings to using blood tests. We now search for microscopic balances of the proper proportion particles from types of lipids, proteins, and other things instead of a large scale balance of phlegm, blood, bile and what have you that people like Galen, and Avicenna presumed to explain the body.  So here we are in the modern age. The body is unambiguously a material structure, and its composition: organic likely without souls, or Elan vital.** This is therefore, a modern book. One which represents questions young teenagers have for the author, a mortification eager for responses on gasses, rigor mortis, body twitches, weak bowels and the horrific and undignified behaviors of a corpse. And guess what! This particular mortician is happy to oblige in the creepy world from which she is quite familiar. In fact, she quite seems to enjoy her topic. From cremations, putrefactions, laws on owning dead bodies, or on moving into a place where a body had died, Doughty answers the many queries peculiar and predictable. And in way she does it, it kinda makes the book kinda fun. Despite the inherent grimness of the material, I will admit I chuckled at times from her quirky and at time absurdist meanderings, because she simply is a pretty amusing writer. Well, as amusing as you can get in the context of blood, death, guts and the whole nine yards of disturbing. Her writings, were segmented by questions and answers are almost made to be put down and picked up again for whenever you find yourself with once again interested in the subject. I recommend this book for those interested in morbid scientific curiosities , and for later stage high school, and fear year undergrad students interested in death, health, medicine and science. It is best complimented by the more systematic and arguably more comprehensive Stiff by Mary Roach. ** I am open for discussion if you have a superior hypothesis to my material conception of nature"
134,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63944124-francesca-calarco,4,"I feel like if more textbooks took the approach of mortician and NPR’s death expert Caitlin Doughty, we would have more kids in STEM. In this genius work of comedy, Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? Big Questions from Tiny Mortals About Death, Doughty sets out to answer questions she has received from kids on all matters related to human decomposition. Kids ask the important questions after all, like ”What would happen if you swallowed a bag of popcorn before you died and were cremated?” If this is the type of stuff that keeps you up at night, then I would recommend Doughy’s book. Death definitely becomes her."
135,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18056144-permanently-booked,4,I can honestly say that I've never wondered what happens if someone dies in space or why bugs don't eat our bones. Leave it to the inquiring minds of children to come up with such intriguing questions that lead to such an engrossing book. This is my first non-fiction book of the year and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Though it may not be a novel I'll plop on my shelves to revisit down the road I did learn interesting facts about death that I think everyone should learn in their life. Who would've thought our meat sacks would be so interesting postmortem.
136,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/130372-maree,4,"This honest, quirky little book reminded me very much of Mary Roach’s Stiff, written for a YA or advanced middle grade audience. Most kids are intensely curious, especially about taboo topics having to do with our bodies. Caitlin Doughty answers real questions from children about death with her trademark humor and straightforwardness, using them to demystify one of the most intimidating topics for parents and teachers to tackle. She doesn’t rely on euphemisms to discuss some of the squickiest details of our current and historical handling of dead bodies, but she also manages to write with respect for the personhood of a body and for various cultural traditions. As a librarian, I appreciated her thorough bibliography for each chapter. As a parent, I considered the ways we avoid talking about death with our kids, and how honest, factual conversations can make it feel less scary. I think this book fills a knowledge gap that some kids will really appreciate."
137,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57432835-mila,5,"This was such a fun ride! Just like in the previous two books by Caitlin Doughty, the writing is hilarious and insightful at the same time, her style is very distinct and I love it. And even though this novel is directed towards a younger audience and obviously answers their questions, it's still a great read for adults as well. Overall, I'd really recommend checking out either this book or Caitlin's previous novels and don't forget about her YouTube channel! She's brilliant at what she does."

The subject matter is something that fascinates me, and the author does a good job of keeping her answers thorough but easy to understand. This wasn't perfect, but my minor complaints feel so petty I won't go into detail. On the whole I prefer ""Stiff"" by Mary Roach, just for the level of detail and the variety of scenarios she discusses, but I will absolutely seek out Doughty's other books now."

141,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34044332-virginija-rudyt,5,"It's a book written by mortician and funeral home director Caitlin Doughty and she decided to do that because kids have no filter (compared to adults) and ask very interesting questions about death and corpses. She answers questions lightly, with humor but with true (very interesting) scientific facts and she does that as if she's talking with kids or teens who maybe asked that question, but most of the adults probably should read this book too.Mainly because I (for example) didn't know almost any of that stuff and it just really interesting. Viking funeral? Corpse laws? Cannibalism (fyi, it's legal to eat human meat in most of the countries)? Donating blood after death? Aquamation? So many things unknown because for a lot of people death is still some kind of taboo. No one really wants to talk about it and especially not while joking about filling your stomach with unpopped popcorn kernels just before dying and going into crematorium. (spoiler alert: it won't work) Honestly, i would recommend this to everyone who is interested to know more about mortician's job, decomposition and overall about what happens (or could/couldn't happen) after death."
142,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59371159-ilana,4,"Really enjoyed this book. It's presumably intended for a young audience, but adults will find plenty to enjoy here too. Adults who aren't too squeamish about death and what happens to corpses after the bacteria start doing their work of consuming the person who used to be their host. All kinds of questions by kids are answered, such as ""why is grandma wrapped in plastic under her clothes in the coffin"" and ""what do corpses smell like"" or what process a corpse goes through when it's put in an incinerator and what the dust resulting from the incineration is actually composed of, or describing how cemeteries must contend with restricted space and are building high rises to house the dead around the world. Satisfies the curiosity if you've ever wondered, ""what happens to our bodies after we die?"". Not for the squeamish, but otherwise good fun as Doughty obviously doesn't take herself or her profession as a mortician too seriously. "
143,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42219802-michelle,5,"Another 5 star book from Doughty! I just recently finished “Smoke Gets in your Eyes” and loved that as much if not more than this one. Highly recommend both of these books! I am so sad that I only have one book left to read by her, at least I feel special because it’s an ARC. I think that’s why I’ve been cherishing it to read last! She is one author that I’d really like to meet in person! Come visit the East Coast Caitlin....pretty please!So....for this year’s #spookathon I challenged myself to read something out of my comfort zone ( ahem—-cats eating eyeballs, confronting death head on, middle grade—- definitely NOT my norm but nonetheless here we are.)In “Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs” we find out that the answer is yes, it’s a very real possibility that your pets will eat you if they are hungry enough, as well as many other answers to questions from children, yes children, that I, a 30 year-old adult never knew that I had. This book truly had me wondering the ENTIRE time if these kids were really that much smarter than I am. Caitlin discusses that, “Young people are often more perceptive than the adults. They weren’t shy about guts and gore.” I also realized that Caitlin always states in her books that we-as humans- have a HUGE problem when it comes to discussing death; we avoid it at all costs. “Most people in our culture are death illiterate, which makes them even more afraid.” I concur, the unknown is horrifying. There was a lot of information in this book that I didn’t know, that I now feel that I NEEDED to know ( and also some really bizarre things that I could’ve passed on—but hey out of the mouth of babes, right? ). So I thank you, creepy little children for asking these questions. I consider myself to be fairly knowledgable about the world of death, having lost so many close loved ones and trying to cope with the grief, but here is some new information that I learned and would like to express my thoughts on:(Most of these you will not know what I’m talking about, which is the point in me being brief, you should read the book!)1. As far as the “waiting mortuary”....I’ll let you read about this one yourself. All I have to say is hell- -to -the -no!2. The Viking funeral- Who is this child? I’m concerned for his well-being.3. The popcorn meme- I admit I searched for it, but I couldn’t find it. But, seriously who has time to think about these things? Very troubling!4. Realtors- I definitely thought that they all were legally obligated to tell you about murders. Creepy. Out come those trust issues!5. Plastification- Wait, what???? I wanna see. I’m going to Body Worlds ASAP.6. “How does a whole adult fit in a tiny box after cremation?” I know how the cremation process works, but I must admit to you that this is the most shocking and gut-wrenching moment for myself as well as many others that I know. You can TRY to prepare yourself for this, but carrying your loved one in your hands at about 5-8 lbs is truly a smack in your face. A huge dose of reality, that person is long gone.7. October 2nd aka “Old Mans Day” is now one of my new favorite holidays! I can’t believe that I just missed it!8. Never have I ever, in probably 50 or More flights, have I considered someone dying on a plane ( of natural causes—that is). “...But with 8 million people flying every day, it is almost inevitable that someone will die from heart problems, lung problems, or other ailments related to old age.” Perfect, thank you for that image and also giving me a new fear. That 1 in a million statistic of dying in a plane crash now seems beautiful and quite preferable to me that sitting next to a strangers corpse all buckled in for who knows how long.9. “The idea that a body can be dissolved in water drives some people wild with fear—especially when they find out that the water used in the process, which is not dangerous in any way, is sent into the sewage system.” Wait.....what? Yes I’m freaking out too, it’s a good thing that I drink bottled water. If there’s something wrong with spring water, please don’t tell me. Hah.10. The fact that they charge more for caskets for larger people should be ”sizism.” That should really be a thing. I can’t stand when I get charged $3 more for a larger sized bra at Victoria’s Secret, but do they care? No. I know there is more material and labor involved in both circumstances but unless you somehow purposely made yourself grow a few inches or enhanced your chest, I think that it’s personally not fair.11. Donating blood when you’re dead? Fascinating! Due to my immune system ( or lack thereof) no one would even want my blood when I’m alive!12. The “leasing” system and not having enough room for all of the dead—“Once grandma has had her time to decompose, her bones need to step aside for a whole new generation of rotting corpses.” Stacking people —-Prayer level, heart level, sky level, no thank you! I’ll just be cremated.Last but certainly not least, here are some topics that never crossed my mind. What happens when the ground is too frozen to bury someone? What if you wanted your pet to be buried with you? Did mummys stink? Read to find out!5 stars!"

And Caitlin Doughty loves answering them.Doughty knows a lot about death: she is a mortician, owns a funeral home, and runs a Youtube series called “ask a mortician”. She handles questions about death with a candid (and necessarily, morbid) sense of humor and refreshing naturalness. Because death is natural - and the more we know about it, the less frightening it is. Or at least it seemed to me while reading this slim volume with quirky illustrations that I have borrowed from my daughter’s Christmas stash.This is not my normal fare and would not have occurred to me to read, if my kid had not asked for it for Christmas. Well, it was informative, and I have enjoyed it, well, as much as a book rich in various stages of putrefaction, bodily fluids, corpse leakage, and the possibility of cats/dogs/humans eating dead bodies can be enjoyed. It is not for the faint of heart, but it is written for teens so if they can handle it, so can you. Well, if you are so inclined, anyway.I recommend looking up her Youtube series “Ask a mortician”. She is a character. And has a Morticia Adams hair cut. For real."

I fall cleanly into the 'ignorance is bliss' category on some subjects. So why would I choose to read this book anyway? Well, the technical reason is that it was the non-fiction monthly group read choice for one of my groups. The more accurate reason is that there's a cat on the cover and how could I possibly pass by any book whose title includes the words Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? and not be at least a little curious, especially seeing how my own cat stares at me at times. I need to know if she's just waiting me out while she works on her future meal plan. Caitlin Doughty has written a book that handles a very difficult subject with both fact and humor. The questions posed in the book come from children, and it's their imaginative (and sometimes brutal) curiosity that allows us adults to benefit from the questions we might be too timid to ask. Some might find using a humorous approach to the topic mildly crass or disrespectful, but I appreciated that Doughty broke through the polite barriers in a way that, for me at least, felt safe and enjoyable. She's like the cool science teacher you always wish you'd had. The only downside for me is simply that I started tiring of the subject as I went along. Some questions were more interesting than others, and I found myself only wanting to read the book in small doses at a time. I learned a lot - in some cases much more than I wanted to know - but it's a very well written, engaging and informative book. I don't recommend it for the overly squeamish, but I think most people would enjoy it.★★★ ½ (rounded to 4)"

If you're a fan of Caitlin Doughty's previous book, ""Smoke Get's in Your Eyes"" or Mary Roach's class, ""Stiff,"" then you will absolutely appreciate the smarts and humor that went into making this book. Each chapter centers on a different ""taboo"" question that Caitlin has been asked over her career in the funeral business. From dying in space to cannibalism to viking funerals to corpses pooping. The questions are answered with grace, but also lots of humor and levity. The accompanying illustrations are also creepy and beautiful. This book answers so many questions I didn't even know I had. Truly stellar this book is a must read! "

Caitlin is an amazing person who always makes me laugh and feel grossed out at the same time! Although, the more I read about death and the dying process, the less grossed out I feel, which is a plus (I think). I have read Doughty’s previous novels and especially loved ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"" ever since I read it in full at Barnes and Noble one day, then went back a year later and bought it! Caitlin Doughty has a wonderful way of educating you about all these macabre topics but making it entertaining while ALSO keeping the conversation respectful towards individual beliefs and the dead themselves. And the artwork by Dianné Ruz was absolutely beautiful, matching the book perfectly. I simply devoured this book in a day and I would recommend this to anyone with a morbid interest or even a simple curiosity in what happens when/after we die. Thank you so much to W. W. Norton & Company for the free advanced copy in exchange for an honest review! “Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs?” is published on 9/10/19 and you will NOT want to miss it!"

So of course I had to read this one too. In this the author answers children’s questions about death including the question that is the title. I read most of the book out loud to the First Mate. There were just too many cool facts not to. My two favourite chapters were “What would happen to an astronaut body in space?” and “Can we give Grandma a Viking funeral?” The basic answer to the first question is that sci-fi books tend to get it wrong. And the second question is that the flaming floating boat is a Hollywood trick. The First Mate’s favourite was “Why don’t animals dig up all the graves?” Reasons. I love this book because it be funny, answers concisely and clearly about even the hypotheticals, and really does any excellent job explaining the whys and laws involved. The chapters be short but the book is a blast. Society should be able to discuss death instead of it being taboo. Arrr!Check out me other reviews at https://thecaptainsquartersblog.wordp..."

The art features a girl and a skeleton, minimalist, just a tad creepy, but also adorable. Which is pretty much the same as the text. It's fascinating what questions kids ask, and Doughty is clear and accurate in a casual, slightly snarky tone. The answers are age-appropriate for even quite young children because there's nothing scary: it's all the debunking of scary, really. Really entertaining and clever.

When they start to smell? Etc., as well as related interesting facts. While some stuff I knew from procedurals and mysteries, it is still a nice read with some jokes.The book is chiefly for the US public – they discuss laws regarding desecration of corpses (can I have my mom’s skull if we explicitly allowed it? Short answer is ‘no’), whether real estate agent should tell you about death in property you buy (depends on the state)… several urban legends are debunked (what happens if you eat pop-corn and then cremated?) about which I’ve never heard of.There are also some interesting facts about graves and cemeteries, like multi-story ones in Singapore and Hong Kong or renting grave sites instead of buying them."

The art and ideas are cute, but it's pitched to (I think) a middle-grade audience. Not really my kind of thing. So I'm closing it out as DNF, after reading and skimming half or more -- but you may want to take a look. And read some of the more-enthusiastic reviews! Such as LM Bujold's, https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... A quick and easy read, if it catches your fancy. Weak 3 stars from me."

The humor helps a lot, in a dad-jokey way, because without it this subject could get bleak. Instead, the questions about death are often interesting, and in some cases, wondrous. The author is knowledgeable and scientific in their responses, but also, add a lot of humanity to be served alongside it. So yeah, if books about death interest you and you want the quick/cheeky answer to a lot of morbid questions, then this book is for you."

The answers were filled with factual information and some experiences from the author’s life. It was nice hearing the author’s voice and humor in the book, but she wasn’t the best narrator I’ve listened to. Her voice is low and husky, which can make it difficult to focus on even though she’s relaxing to listen to."

Although a light reading and has some interesting information, I found the tone of the author and the overall content of the book to be too childish (“kid-friendly”) for my taste. Well, that’s what I get for reading a book titled Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs?"
163,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13717595-jake,4,"The history of human knowledge of the body’s structure and mechanism is likely ancient. Through war, times of starvation, and malady and the many horrors that be-struck ancient humans— have knowledge of the inner contents of our shared fleshy casing been gleaned. Now of course for many history books on medicine, the findings prior to Hippocrates -the proclaimed father of medicine - is somewhat neglected , just as it is the case that in the many mythological creation stories, that there lacks a time before the chaos. A time before matter was with form. I have minor squabbles with this historiography starting at Hippocrates as I have suspicion that we underestimate the ancients knowledge and use of empiricism to navigate the world of health, disease and death. This, is a rant for another time. 	In this our rightfully whiggish history of anatomy, this developmental progress in anatomy and physiology came from the use of pretty terrible theories of the bodies workings with ideas of spirits, to humors to where we are now, which we can see as : complex mechanics. We as humans have gone from dabbling in blood lettings to using blood tests. We now search for microscopic balances of the proper proportion particles from types of lipids, proteins, and other things instead of a large scale balance of phlegm, blood, bile and what have you that people like Galen, and Avicenna presumed to explain the body.  So here we are in the modern age. The body is unambiguously a material structure, and its composition: organic likely without souls, or Elan vital.** This is therefore, a modern book. One which represents questions young teenagers have for the author, a mortification eager for responses on gasses, rigor mortis, body twitches, weak bowels and the horrific and undignified behaviors of a corpse. And guess what! This particular mortician is happy to oblige in the creepy world from which she is quite familiar. In fact, she quite seems to enjoy her topic. From cremations, putrefactions, laws on owning dead bodies, or on moving into a place where a body had died, Doughty answers the many queries peculiar and predictable. And in way she does it, it kinda makes the book kinda fun. Despite the inherent grimness of the material, I will admit I chuckled at times from her quirky and at time absurdist meanderings, because she simply is a pretty amusing writer. Well, as amusing as you can get in the context of blood, death, guts and the whole nine yards of disturbing. Her writings, were segmented by questions and answers are almost made to be put down and picked up again for whenever you find yourself with once again interested in the subject. I recommend this book for those interested in morbid scientific curiosities , and for later stage high school, and fear year undergrad students interested in death, health, medicine and science. It is best complimented by the more systematic and arguably more comprehensive Stiff by Mary Roach. ** I am open for discussion if you have a superior hypothesis to my material conception of nature"
164,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63944124-francesca-calarco,4,"I feel like if more textbooks took the approach of mortician and NPR’s death expert Caitlin Doughty, we would have more kids in STEM. In this genius work of comedy, Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? Big Questions from Tiny Mortals About Death, Doughty sets out to answer questions she has received from kids on all matters related to human decomposition. Kids ask the important questions after all, like ”What would happen if you swallowed a bag of popcorn before you died and were cremated?” If this is the type of stuff that keeps you up at night, then I would recommend Doughy’s book. Death definitely becomes her."
165,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18056144-permanently-booked,4,I can honestly say that I've never wondered what happens if someone dies in space or why bugs don't eat our bones. Leave it to the inquiring minds of children to come up with such intriguing questions that lead to such an engrossing book. This is my first non-fiction book of the year and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Though it may not be a novel I'll plop on my shelves to revisit down the road I did learn interesting facts about death that I think everyone should learn in their life. Who would've thought our meat sacks would be so interesting postmortem.
166,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/130372-maree,4,"This honest, quirky little book reminded me very much of Mary Roach’s Stiff, written for a YA or advanced middle grade audience. Most kids are intensely curious, especially about taboo topics having to do with our bodies. Caitlin Doughty answers real questions from children about death with her trademark humor and straightforwardness, using them to demystify one of the most intimidating topics for parents and teachers to tackle. She doesn’t rely on euphemisms to discuss some of the squickiest details of our current and historical handling of dead bodies, but she also manages to write with respect for the personhood of a body and for various cultural traditions. As a librarian, I appreciated her thorough bibliography for each chapter. As a parent, I considered the ways we avoid talking about death with our kids, and how honest, factual conversations can make it feel less scary. I think this book fills a knowledge gap that some kids will really appreciate."
167,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57432835-mila,5,"This was such a fun ride! Just like in the previous two books by Caitlin Doughty, the writing is hilarious and insightful at the same time, her style is very distinct and I love it. And even though this novel is directed towards a younger audience and obviously answers their questions, it's still a great read for adults as well. Overall, I'd really recommend checking out either this book or Caitlin's previous novels and don't forget about her YouTube channel! She's brilliant at what she does."

The subject matter is something that fascinates me, and the author does a good job of keeping her answers thorough but easy to understand. This wasn't perfect, but my minor complaints feel so petty I won't go into detail. On the whole I prefer ""Stiff"" by Mary Roach, just for the level of detail and the variety of scenarios she discusses, but I will absolutely seek out Doughty's other books now."
169,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16910534-amber,4,"I picked this book up because the title made me laugh. I recently adopted two kittens and they would for sure eat my eyeballs. This was a fun, easy read. This book is definitely different from what I normally read"

171,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34044332-virginija-rudyt,5,"It's a book written by mortician and funeral home director Caitlin Doughty and she decided to do that because kids have no filter (compared to adults) and ask very interesting questions about death and corpses. She answers questions lightly, with humor but with true (very interesting) scientific facts and she does that as if she's talking with kids or teens who maybe asked that question, but most of the adults probably should read this book too.Mainly because I (for example) didn't know almost any of that stuff and it just really interesting. Viking funeral? Corpse laws? Cannibalism (fyi, it's legal to eat human meat in most of the countries)? Donating blood after death? Aquamation? So many things unknown because for a lot of people death is still some kind of taboo. No one really wants to talk about it and especially not while joking about filling your stomach with unpopped popcorn kernels just before dying and going into crematorium. (spoiler alert: it won't work) Honestly, i would recommend this to everyone who is interested to know more about mortician's job, decomposition and overall about what happens (or could/couldn't happen) after death."
172,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59371159-ilana,4,"Really enjoyed this book. It's presumably intended for a young audience, but adults will find plenty to enjoy here too. Adults who aren't too squeamish about death and what happens to corpses after the bacteria start doing their work of consuming the person who used to be their host. All kinds of questions by kids are answered, such as ""why is grandma wrapped in plastic under her clothes in the coffin"" and ""what do corpses smell like"" or what process a corpse goes through when it's put in an incinerator and what the dust resulting from the incineration is actually composed of, or describing how cemeteries must contend with restricted space and are building high rises to house the dead around the world. Satisfies the curiosity if you've ever wondered, ""what happens to our bodies after we die?"". Not for the squeamish, but otherwise good fun as Doughty obviously doesn't take herself or her profession as a mortician too seriously. "
173,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42219802-michelle,5,"Another 5 star book from Doughty! I just recently finished “Smoke Gets in your Eyes” and loved that as much if not more than this one. Highly recommend both of these books! I am so sad that I only have one book left to read by her, at least I feel special because it’s an ARC. I think that’s why I’ve been cherishing it to read last! She is one author that I’d really like to meet in person! Come visit the East Coast Caitlin....pretty please!So....for this year’s #spookathon I challenged myself to read something out of my comfort zone ( ahem—-cats eating eyeballs, confronting death head on, middle grade—- definitely NOT my norm but nonetheless here we are.)In “Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs” we find out that the answer is yes, it’s a very real possibility that your pets will eat you if they are hungry enough, as well as many other answers to questions from children, yes children, that I, a 30 year-old adult never knew that I had. This book truly had me wondering the ENTIRE time if these kids were really that much smarter than I am. Caitlin discusses that, “Young people are often more perceptive than the adults. They weren’t shy about guts and gore.” I also realized that Caitlin always states in her books that we-as humans- have a HUGE problem when it comes to discussing death; we avoid it at all costs. “Most people in our culture are death illiterate, which makes them even more afraid.” I concur, the unknown is horrifying. There was a lot of information in this book that I didn’t know, that I now feel that I NEEDED to know ( and also some really bizarre things that I could’ve passed on—but hey out of the mouth of babes, right? ). So I thank you, creepy little children for asking these questions. I consider myself to be fairly knowledgable about the world of death, having lost so many close loved ones and trying to cope with the grief, but here is some new information that I learned and would like to express my thoughts on:(Most of these you will not know what I’m talking about, which is the point in me being brief, you should read the book!)1. As far as the “waiting mortuary”....I’ll let you read about this one yourself. All I have to say is hell- -to -the -no!2. The Viking funeral- Who is this child? I’m concerned for his well-being.3. The popcorn meme- I admit I searched for it, but I couldn’t find it. But, seriously who has time to think about these things? Very troubling!4. Realtors- I definitely thought that they all were legally obligated to tell you about murders. Creepy. Out come those trust issues!5. Plastification- Wait, what???? I wanna see. I’m going to Body Worlds ASAP.6. “How does a whole adult fit in a tiny box after cremation?” I know how the cremation process works, but I must admit to you that this is the most shocking and gut-wrenching moment for myself as well as many others that I know. You can TRY to prepare yourself for this, but carrying your loved one in your hands at about 5-8 lbs is truly a smack in your face. A huge dose of reality, that person is long gone.7. October 2nd aka “Old Mans Day” is now one of my new favorite holidays! I can’t believe that I just missed it!8. Never have I ever, in probably 50 or More flights, have I considered someone dying on a plane ( of natural causes—that is). “...But with 8 million people flying every day, it is almost inevitable that someone will die from heart problems, lung problems, or other ailments related to old age.” Perfect, thank you for that image and also giving me a new fear. That 1 in a million statistic of dying in a plane crash now seems beautiful and quite preferable to me that sitting next to a strangers corpse all buckled in for who knows how long.9. “The idea that a body can be dissolved in water drives some people wild with fear—especially when they find out that the water used in the process, which is not dangerous in any way, is sent into the sewage system.” Wait.....what? Yes I’m freaking out too, it’s a good thing that I drink bottled water. If there’s something wrong with spring water, please don’t tell me. Hah.10. The fact that they charge more for caskets for larger people should be ”sizism.” That should really be a thing. I can’t stand when I get charged $3 more for a larger sized bra at Victoria’s Secret, but do they care? No. I know there is more material and labor involved in both circumstances but unless you somehow purposely made yourself grow a few inches or enhanced your chest, I think that it’s personally not fair.11. Donating blood when you’re dead? Fascinating! Due to my immune system ( or lack thereof) no one would even want my blood when I’m alive!12. The “leasing” system and not having enough room for all of the dead—“Once grandma has had her time to decompose, her bones need to step aside for a whole new generation of rotting corpses.” Stacking people —-Prayer level, heart level, sky level, no thank you! I’ll just be cremated.Last but certainly not least, here are some topics that never crossed my mind. What happens when the ground is too frozen to bury someone? What if you wanted your pet to be buried with you? Did mummys stink? Read to find out!5 stars!"
174,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"Kids ask the darndest questions. Especially from morticians. And Caitlin Doughty loves answering them.Doughty knows a lot about death: she is a mortician, owns a funeral home, and runs a Youtube series called “ask a mortician”. She handles questions about death with a candid (and necessarily, morbid) sense of humor and refreshing naturalness. Because death is natural - and the more we know about it, the less frightening it is. Or at least it seemed to me while reading this slim volume with quirky illustrations that I have borrowed from my daughter’s Christmas stash.This is not my normal fare and would not have occurred to me to read, if my kid had not asked for it for Christmas. Well, it was informative, and I have enjoyed it, well, as much as a book rich in various stages of putrefaction, bodily fluids, corpse leakage, and the possibility of cats/dogs/humans eating dead bodies can be enjoyed. It is not for the faint of heart, but it is written for teens so if they can handle it, so can you. Well, if you are so inclined, anyway.I recommend looking up her Youtube series “Ask a mortician”. She is a character. And has a Morticia Adams hair cut. For real."

It's true that you can never predict what children will say, or in this case, ask; and those bizarre questions have led to a book that it both educational and chortling good. While I am disappointed that a flaming Viking ship is not in my funereal future, I'm somewhat relieved that my Gracie will probably nibble my lips away before going for my eyes. I'm not sure why that makes me feel better, but it does. Caitlin Doughty could go on indefinitely about a host of normally repulsive topics, and I would eat it all up. It should be added that Diane Ruiz's somewhat ghoulish artwork add greatly to the macabre merriment. I offer a challenge: Pick up this book and read a paragraph. I'm betting that you won't put it down until you regretfully run out of pages.Thanks to W. W. Norton & Company and NetGalley for making an advance copy available for an honest review."

It takes a scientific and entertaining look at death by answering some of our most common questions about it. Some of my favorite questions asked were about dying in space (what physically happens to our bodies, as well as if/how we should bring them back to Earth), eating uncooked popcorn before dying and being cremated (will our stomachs explode with popcorn?), and gifting a loved one your skull after death (legally very difficult). I previously read the author's other work From Here to Eternity: Traveling the World to Find the Good Death which was pretty good, but I prefer this question and answer format.

Caitlin is an amazing person who always makes me laugh and feel grossed out at the same time! Although, the more I read about death and the dying process, the less grossed out I feel, which is a plus (I think). I have read Doughty’s previous novels and especially loved ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"" ever since I read it in full at Barnes and Noble one day, then went back a year later and bought it! Caitlin Doughty has a wonderful way of educating you about all these macabre topics but making it entertaining while ALSO keeping the conversation respectful towards individual beliefs and the dead themselves. And the artwork by Dianné Ruz was absolutely beautiful, matching the book perfectly. I simply devoured this book in a day and I would recommend this to anyone with a morbid interest or even a simple curiosity in what happens when/after we die. Thank you so much to W. W.

So of course I had to read this one too. In this the author answers children’s questions about death including the question that is the title. I read most of the book out loud to the First Mate. There were just too many cool facts not to. My two favourite chapters were “What would happen to an astronaut body in space?” and “Can we give Grandma a Viking funeral?” The basic answer to the first question is that sci-fi books tend to get it wrong. And the second question is that the flaming floating boat is a Hollywood trick. The First Mate’s favourite was “Why don’t animals dig up all the graves?” Reasons. I love this book because it be funny, answers concisely and clearly about even the hypotheticals, and really does any excellent job explaining the whys and laws involved. The chapters be short but the book is a blast. Society should be able to discuss death instead of it being taboo. Arrr!Check out me other reviews at https://thecaptainsquartersblog.wordp..."

The art features a girl and a skeleton, minimalist, just a tad creepy, but also adorable. Which is pretty much the same as the text. It's fascinating what questions kids ask, and Doughty is clear and accurate in a casual, slightly snarky tone. The answers are age-appropriate for even quite young children because there's nothing scary: it's all the debunking of scary, really. Really entertaining and clever.

When they start to smell? Etc., as well as related interesting facts. While some stuff I knew from procedurals and mysteries, it is still a nice read with some jokes.The book is chiefly for the US public – they discuss laws regarding desecration of corpses (can I have my mom’s skull if we explicitly allowed it? Short answer is ‘no’), whether real estate agent should tell you about death in property you buy (depends on the state)… several urban legends are debunked (what happens if you eat pop-corn and then cremated?) about which I’ve never heard of.There are also some interesting facts about graves and cemeteries, like multi-story ones in Singapore and Hong Kong or renting grave sites instead of buying them."

The art and ideas are cute, but it's pitched to (I think) a middle-grade audience. Not really my kind of thing. So I'm closing it out as DNF, after reading and skimming half or more -- but you may want to take a look. And read some of the more-enthusiastic reviews!

The humor helps a lot, in a dad-jokey way, because without it this subject could get bleak. Instead, the questions about death are often interesting, and in some cases, wondrous. The author is knowledgeable and scientific in their responses, but also, add a lot of humanity to be served alongside it. So yeah, if books about death interest you and you want the quick/cheeky answer to a lot of morbid questions, then this book is for you."

The answers were filled with factual information and some experiences from the author’s life. It was nice hearing the author’s voice and humor in the book, but she wasn’t the best narrator I’ve listened to. Her voice is low and husky, which can make it difficult to focus on even though she’s relaxing to listen to."

Although a light reading and has some interesting information, I found the tone of the author and the overall content of the book to be too childish (“kid-friendly”) for my taste.

193,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13717595-jake,4,"The history of human knowledge of the body’s structure and mechanism is likely ancient. Through war, times of starvation, and malady and the many horrors that be-struck ancient humans— have knowledge of the inner contents of our shared fleshy casing been gleaned. Now of course for many history books on medicine, the findings prior to Hippocrates -the proclaimed father of medicine - is somewhat neglected , just as it is the case that in the many mythological creation stories, that there lacks a time before the chaos. A time before matter was with form. I have minor squabbles with this historiography starting at Hippocrates as I have suspicion that we underestimate the ancients knowledge and use of empiricism to navigate the world of health, disease and death. This, is a rant for another time. 	In this our rightfully whiggish history of anatomy, this developmental progress in anatomy and physiology came from the use of pretty terrible theories of the bodies workings with ideas of spirits, to humors to where we are now, which we can see as : complex mechanics. We as humans have gone from dabbling in blood lettings to using blood tests. We now search for microscopic balances of the proper proportion particles from types of lipids, proteins, and other things instead of a large scale balance of phlegm, blood, bile and what have you that people like Galen, and Avicenna presumed to explain the body.  So here we are in the modern age. The body is unambiguously a material structure, and its composition: organic likely without souls, or Elan vital.** This is therefore, a modern book. One which represents questions young teenagers have for the author, a mortification eager for responses on gasses, rigor mortis, body twitches, weak bowels and the horrific and undignified behaviors of a corpse. And guess what! This particular mortician is happy to oblige in the creepy world from which she is quite familiar. In fact, she quite seems to enjoy her topic. From cremations, putrefactions, laws on owning dead bodies, or on moving into a place where a body had died, Doughty answers the many queries peculiar and predictable. And in way she does it, it kinda makes the book kinda fun. Despite the inherent grimness of the material, I will admit I chuckled at times from her quirky and at time absurdist meanderings, because she simply is a pretty amusing writer. Well, as amusing as you can get in the context of blood, death, guts and the whole nine yards of disturbing. Her writings, were segmented by questions and answers are almost made to be put down and picked up again for whenever you find yourself with once again interested in the subject. I recommend this book for those interested in morbid scientific curiosities , and for later stage high school, and fear year undergrad students interested in death, health, medicine and science. It is best complimented by the more systematic and arguably more comprehensive Stiff by Mary Roach. ** I am open for discussion if you have a superior hypothesis to my material conception of nature"
194,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63944124-francesca-calarco,4,"I feel like if more textbooks took the approach of mortician and NPR’s death expert Caitlin Doughty, we would have more kids in STEM. In this genius work of comedy, Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? Big Questions from Tiny Mortals About Death, Doughty sets out to answer questions she has received from kids on all matters related to human decomposition. Kids ask the important questions after all, like ”What would happen if you swallowed a bag of popcorn before you died and were cremated?” If this is the type of stuff that keeps you up at night, then I would recommend Doughy’s book. Death definitely becomes her."
195,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18056144-permanently-booked,4,I can honestly say that I've never wondered what happens if someone dies in space or why bugs don't eat our bones. Leave it to the inquiring minds of children to come up with such intriguing questions that lead to such an engrossing book. This is my first non-fiction book of the year and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Though it may not be a novel I'll plop on my shelves to revisit down the road I did learn interesting facts about death that I think everyone should learn in their life. Who would've thought our meat sacks would be so interesting postmortem.
196,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/130372-maree,4,"This honest, quirky little book reminded me very much of Mary Roach’s Stiff, written for a YA or advanced middle grade audience. Most kids are intensely curious, especially about taboo topics having to do with our bodies. Caitlin Doughty answers real questions from children about death with her trademark humor and straightforwardness, using them to demystify one of the most intimidating topics for parents and teachers to tackle. She doesn’t rely on euphemisms to discuss some of the squickiest details of our current and historical handling of dead bodies, but she also manages to write with respect for the personhood of a body and for various cultural traditions. As a librarian, I appreciated her thorough bibliography for each chapter. As a parent, I considered the ways we avoid talking about death with our kids, and how honest, factual conversations can make it feel less scary. I think this book fills a knowledge gap that some kids will really appreciate."
197,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57432835-mila,5,"This was such a fun ride! Just like in the previous two books by Caitlin Doughty, the writing is hilarious and insightful at the same time, her style is very distinct and I love it. And even though this novel is directed towards a younger audience and obviously answers their questions, it's still a great read for adults as well. Overall, I'd really recommend checking out either this book or Caitlin's previous novels and don't forget about her YouTube channel! She's brilliant at what she does."

The subject matter is something that fascinates me, and the author does a good job of keeping her answers thorough but easy to understand. This wasn't perfect, but my minor complaints feel so petty I won't go into detail. On the whole I prefer ""Stiff"" by Mary Roach, just for the level of detail and the variety of scenarios she discusses, but I will absolutely seek out Doughty's other books now."
199,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16910534-amber,4,"I picked this book up because the title made me laugh. I recently adopted two kittens and they would for sure eat my eyeballs. This was a fun, easy read. This book is definitely different from what I normally read"

201,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34044332-virginija-rudyt,5,"It's a book written by mortician and funeral home director Caitlin Doughty and she decided to do that because kids have no filter (compared to adults) and ask very interesting questions about death and corpses. She answers questions lightly, with humor but with true (very interesting) scientific facts and she does that as if she's talking with kids or teens who maybe asked that question, but most of the adults probably should read this book too.Mainly because I (for example) didn't know almost any of that stuff and it just really interesting. Viking funeral? Corpse laws? Cannibalism (fyi, it's legal to eat human meat in most of the countries)? Donating blood after death? Aquamation? So many things unknown because for a lot of people death is still some kind of taboo. No one really wants to talk about it and especially not while joking about filling your stomach with unpopped popcorn kernels just before dying and going into crematorium. (spoiler alert: it won't work) Honestly, i would recommend this to everyone who is interested to know more about mortician's job, decomposition and overall about what happens (or could/couldn't happen) after death."
202,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59371159-ilana,4,"Really enjoyed this book. It's presumably intended for a young audience, but adults will find plenty to enjoy here too. Adults who aren't too squeamish about death and what happens to corpses after the bacteria start doing their work of consuming the person who used to be their host. All kinds of questions by kids are answered, such as ""why is grandma wrapped in plastic under her clothes in the coffin"" and ""what do corpses smell like"" or what process a corpse goes through when it's put in an incinerator and what the dust resulting from the incineration is actually composed of, or describing how cemeteries must contend with restricted space and are building high rises to house the dead around the world. Satisfies the curiosity if you've ever wondered, ""what happens to our bodies after we die?"". Not for the squeamish, but otherwise good fun as Doughty obviously doesn't take herself or her profession as a mortician too seriously. "
203,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42219802-michelle,5,"Another 5 star book from Doughty! I just recently finished “Smoke Gets in your Eyes” and loved that as much if not more than this one. Highly recommend both of these books! I am so sad that I only have one book left to read by her, at least I feel special because it’s an ARC. I think that’s why I’ve been cherishing it to read last! She is one author that I’d really like to meet in person! Come visit the East Coast Caitlin....pretty please!So....for this year’s #spookathon I challenged myself to read something out of my comfort zone ( ahem—-cats eating eyeballs, confronting death head on, middle grade—- definitely NOT my norm but nonetheless here we are.)In “Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs” we find out that the answer is yes, it’s a very real possibility that your pets will eat you if they are hungry enough, as well as many other answers to questions from children, yes children, that I, a 30 year-old adult never knew that I had. This book truly had me wondering the ENTIRE time if these kids were really that much smarter than I am. Caitlin discusses that, “Young people are often more perceptive than the adults. They weren’t shy about guts and gore.” I also realized that Caitlin always states in her books that we-as humans- have a HUGE problem when it comes to discussing death; we avoid it at all costs. “Most people in our culture are death illiterate, which makes them even more afraid.” I concur, the unknown is horrifying. There was a lot of information in this book that I didn’t know, that I now feel that I NEEDED to know ( and also some really bizarre things that I could’ve passed on—but hey out of the mouth of babes, right? ). So I thank you, creepy little children for asking these questions. I consider myself to be fairly knowledgable about the world of death, having lost so many close loved ones and trying to cope with the grief, but here is some new information that I learned and would like to express my thoughts on:(Most of these you will not know what I’m talking about, which is the point in me being brief, you should read the book!)1. As far as the “waiting mortuary”....I’ll let you read about this one yourself. All I have to say is hell- -to -the -no!2. The Viking funeral- Who is this child? I’m concerned for his well-being.3. The popcorn meme- I admit I searched for it, but I couldn’t find it. But, seriously who has time to think about these things? Very troubling!4. Realtors- I definitely thought that they all were legally obligated to tell you about murders. Creepy. Out come those trust issues!5. Plastification- Wait, what???? I wanna see. I’m going to Body Worlds ASAP.6. “How does a whole adult fit in a tiny box after cremation?” I know how the cremation process works, but I must admit to you that this is the most shocking and gut-wrenching moment for myself as well as many others that I know. You can TRY to prepare yourself for this, but carrying your loved one in your hands at about 5-8 lbs is truly a smack in your face. A huge dose of reality, that person is long gone.7. October 2nd aka “Old Mans Day” is now one of my new favorite holidays! I can’t believe that I just missed it!8. Never have I ever, in probably 50 or More flights, have I considered someone dying on a plane ( of natural causes—that is). “...But with 8 million people flying every day, it is almost inevitable that someone will die from heart problems, lung problems, or other ailments related to old age.” Perfect, thank you for that image and also giving me a new fear. That 1 in a million statistic of dying in a plane crash now seems beautiful and quite preferable to me that sitting next to a strangers corpse all buckled in for who knows how long.9. “The idea that a body can be dissolved in water drives some people wild with fear—especially when they find out that the water used in the process, which is not dangerous in any way, is sent into the sewage system.” Wait.....what? Yes I’m freaking out too, it’s a good thing that I drink bottled water. If there’s something wrong with spring water, please don’t tell me. Hah.10. The fact that they charge more for caskets for larger people should be ”sizism.” That should really be a thing. I can’t stand when I get charged $3 more for a larger sized bra at Victoria’s Secret, but do they care? No. I know there is more material and labor involved in both circumstances but unless you somehow purposely made yourself grow a few inches or enhanced your chest, I think that it’s personally not fair.11. Donating blood when you’re dead? Fascinating! Due to my immune system ( or lack thereof) no one would even want my blood when I’m alive!12. The “leasing” system and not having enough room for all of the dead—“Once grandma has had her time to decompose, her bones need to step aside for a whole new generation of rotting corpses.” Stacking people —-Prayer level, heart level, sky level, no thank you! I’ll just be cremated.Last but certainly not least, here are some topics that never crossed my mind. What happens when the ground is too frozen to bury someone? What if you wanted your pet to be buried with you? Did mummys stink? Read to find out!5 stars!"
204,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"Kids ask the darndest questions. Especially from morticians. And Caitlin Doughty loves answering them.Doughty knows a lot about death: she is a mortician, owns a funeral home, and runs a Youtube series called “ask a mortician”. She handles questions about death with a candid (and necessarily, morbid) sense of humor and refreshing naturalness. Because death is natural - and the more we know about it, the less frightening it is. Or at least it seemed to me while reading this slim volume with quirky illustrations that I have borrowed from my daughter’s Christmas stash.This is not my normal fare and would not have occurred to me to read, if my kid had not asked for it for Christmas. Well, it was informative, and I have enjoyed it, well, as much as a book rich in various stages of putrefaction, bodily fluids, corpse leakage, and the possibility of cats/dogs/humans eating dead bodies can be enjoyed. It is not for the faint of heart, but it is written for teens so if they can handle it, so can you. Well, if you are so inclined, anyway.I recommend looking up her Youtube series “Ask a mortician”. She is a character. And has a Morticia Adams hair cut. For real."
205,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3764551-katra,5,"What an incredibly delightful, if creepy, read! It's true that you can never predict what children will say, or in this case, ask; and those bizarre questions have led to a book that it both educational and chortling good. While I am disappointed that a flaming Viking ship is not in my funereal future, I'm somewhat relieved that my Gracie will probably nibble my lips away before going for my eyes. I'm not sure why that makes me feel better, but it does. Caitlin Doughty could go on indefinitely about a host of normally repulsive topics, and I would eat it all up. It should be added that Diane Ruiz's somewhat ghoulish artwork add greatly to the macabre merriment. I offer a challenge: Pick up this book and read a paragraph. I'm betting that you won't put it down until you regretfully run out of pages.Thanks to W. W. Norton & Company and NetGalley for making an advance copy available for an honest review."
206,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64630449-traceyl,5,"This is an excellent book. It takes a scientific and entertaining look at death by answering some of our most common questions about it. Some of my favorite questions asked were about dying in space (what physically happens to our bodies, as well as if/how we should bring them back to Earth), eating uncooked popcorn before dying and being cremated (will our stomachs explode with popcorn?), and gifting a loved one your skull after death (legally very difficult). I previously read the author's other work From Here to Eternity: Traveling the World to Find the Good Death which was pretty good, but I prefer this question and answer format. I hope the author follows up with more of these books."

Caitlin Doughty managed to present the subject matter in a way that was both informative and fun. My only complaint is that the book does end rather abruptly. There is no wrap-up to bring it to a close. She is just answering a question, then it's done. The questions end very suddenly. I would have liked a short conclusion to the book. 4.5 stars "

I fall cleanly into the 'ignorance is bliss' category on some subjects. So why would I choose to read this book anyway? Well, the technical reason is that it was the non-fiction monthly group read choice for one of my groups. The more accurate reason is that there's a cat on the cover and how could I possibly pass by any book whose title includes the words Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? and not be at least a little curious, especially seeing how my own cat stares at me at times. I need to know if she's just waiting me out while she works on her future meal plan. Caitlin Doughty has written a book that handles a very difficult subject with both fact and humor. The questions posed in the book come from children, and it's their imaginative (and sometimes brutal) curiosity that allows us adults to benefit from the questions we might be too timid to ask. Some might find using a humorous approach to the topic mildly crass or disrespectful, but I appreciated that Doughty broke through the polite barriers in a way that, for me at least, felt safe and enjoyable. She's like the cool science teacher you always wish you'd had. The only downside for me is simply that I started tiring of the subject as I went along. Some questions were more interesting than others, and I found myself only wanting to read the book in small doses at a time. I learned a lot - in some cases much more than I wanted to know - but it's a very well written, engaging and informative book. I don't recommend it for the overly squeamish, but I think most people would enjoy it.★★★ ½ (rounded to 4)"

And the second question is that the flaming floating boat is a Hollywood trick. The First Mate’s favourite was “Why don’t animals dig up all the graves?” Reasons. I love this book because it be funny, answers concisely and clearly about even the hypotheticals, and really does any excellent job explaining the whys and laws involved. The chapters be short but the book is a blast. Society should be able to discuss death instead of it being taboo. Arrr!Check out me other reviews at https://thecaptainsquartersblog.wordp..."

When they start to smell? Etc., as well as related interesting facts. While some stuff I knew from procedurals and mysteries, it is still a nice read with some jokes.The book is chiefly for the US public – they discuss laws regarding desecration of corpses (can I have my mom’s skull if we explicitly allowed it? Short answer is ‘no’), whether real estate agent should tell you about death in property you buy (depends on the state)… several urban legends are debunked (what happens if you eat pop-corn and then cremated?) about which I’ve never heard of.There are also some interesting facts about graves and cemeteries, like multi-story ones in Singapore and Hong Kong or renting grave sites instead of buying them."

The art and ideas are cute, but it's pitched to (I think) a middle-grade audience. Not really my kind of thing. So I'm closing it out as DNF, after reading and skimming half or more -- but you may want to take a look. And read some of the more-enthusiastic reviews! Such as LM Bujold's, https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... A quick and easy read, if it catches your fancy. Weak 3 stars from me."

The humor helps a lot, in a dad-jokey way, because without it this subject could get bleak. Instead, the questions about death are often interesting, and in some cases, wondrous. The author is knowledgeable and scientific in their responses, but also, add a lot of humanity to be served alongside it. So yeah, if books about death interest you and you want the quick/cheeky answer to a lot of morbid questions, then this book is for you."

The answers were filled with factual information and some experiences from the author’s life. It was nice hearing the author’s voice and humor in the book, but she wasn’t the best narrator I’ve listened to. Her voice is low and husky, which can make it difficult to focus on even though she’s relaxing to listen to."

Although a light reading and has some interesting information, I found the tone of the author and the overall content of the book to be too childish (“kid-friendly”) for my taste. Well, that’s what I get for reading a book titled Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs?"
223,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13717595-jake,4,"The history of human knowledge of the body’s structure and mechanism is likely ancient. Through war, times of starvation, and malady and the many horrors that be-struck ancient humans— have knowledge of the inner contents of our shared fleshy casing been gleaned. Now of course for many history books on medicine, the findings prior to Hippocrates -the proclaimed father of medicine - is somewhat neglected , just as it is the case that in the many mythological creation stories, that there lacks a time before the chaos. A time before matter was with form. I have minor squabbles with this historiography starting at Hippocrates as I have suspicion that we underestimate the ancients knowledge and use of empiricism to navigate the world of health, disease and death. This, is a rant for another time. 	In this our rightfully whiggish history of anatomy, this developmental progress in anatomy and physiology came from the use of pretty terrible theories of the bodies workings with ideas of spirits, to humors to where we are now, which we can see as : complex mechanics. We as humans have gone from dabbling in blood lettings to using blood tests. We now search for microscopic balances of the proper proportion particles from types of lipids, proteins, and other things instead of a large scale balance of phlegm, blood, bile and what have you that people like Galen, and Avicenna presumed to explain the body.  So here we are in the modern age. The body is unambiguously a material structure, and its composition: organic likely without souls, or Elan vital.** This is therefore, a modern book. One which represents questions young teenagers have for the author, a mortification eager for responses on gasses, rigor mortis, body twitches, weak bowels and the horrific and undignified behaviors of a corpse. And guess what! This particular mortician is happy to oblige in the creepy world from which she is quite familiar. In fact, she quite seems to enjoy her topic. From cremations, putrefactions, laws on owning dead bodies, or on moving into a place where a body had died, Doughty answers the many queries peculiar and predictable. And in way she does it, it kinda makes the book kinda fun. Despite the inherent grimness of the material, I will admit I chuckled at times from her quirky and at time absurdist meanderings, because she simply is a pretty amusing writer. Well, as amusing as you can get in the context of blood, death, guts and the whole nine yards of disturbing. Her writings, were segmented by questions and answers are almost made to be put down and picked up again for whenever you find yourself with once again interested in the subject. I recommend this book for those interested in morbid scientific curiosities , and for later stage high school, and fear year undergrad students interested in death, health, medicine and science. It is best complimented by the more systematic and arguably more comprehensive Stiff by Mary Roach. ** I am open for discussion if you have a superior hypothesis to my material conception of nature"
224,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63944124-francesca-calarco,4,"I feel like if more textbooks took the approach of mortician and NPR’s death expert Caitlin Doughty, we would have more kids in STEM. In this genius work of comedy, Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? Big Questions from Tiny Mortals About Death, Doughty sets out to answer questions she has received from kids on all matters related to human decomposition. Kids ask the important questions after all, like ”What would happen if you swallowed a bag of popcorn before you died and were cremated?” If this is the type of stuff that keeps you up at night, then I would recommend Doughy’s book. Death definitely becomes her."
225,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18056144-permanently-booked,4,I can honestly say that I've never wondered what happens if someone dies in space or why bugs don't eat our bones. Leave it to the inquiring minds of children to come up with such intriguing questions that lead to such an engrossing book. This is my first non-fiction book of the year and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Though it may not be a novel I'll plop on my shelves to revisit down the road I did learn interesting facts about death that I think everyone should learn in their life. Who would've thought our meat sacks would be so interesting postmortem.
226,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/130372-maree,4,"This honest, quirky little book reminded me very much of Mary Roach’s Stiff, written for a YA or advanced middle grade audience. Most kids are intensely curious, especially about taboo topics having to do with our bodies. Caitlin Doughty answers real questions from children about death with her trademark humor and straightforwardness, using them to demystify one of the most intimidating topics for parents and teachers to tackle. She doesn’t rely on euphemisms to discuss some of the squickiest details of our current and historical handling of dead bodies, but she also manages to write with respect for the personhood of a body and for various cultural traditions. As a librarian, I appreciated her thorough bibliography for each chapter. As a parent, I considered the ways we avoid talking about death with our kids, and how honest, factual conversations can make it feel less scary. I think this book fills a knowledge gap that some kids will really appreciate."
227,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57432835-mila,5,"This was such a fun ride! Just like in the previous two books by Caitlin Doughty, the writing is hilarious and insightful at the same time, her style is very distinct and I love it. And even though this novel is directed towards a younger audience and obviously answers their questions, it's still a great read for adults as well. Overall, I'd really recommend checking out either this book or Caitlin's previous novels and don't forget about her YouTube channel! She's brilliant at what she does."

The subject matter is something that fascinates me, and the author does a good job of keeping her answers thorough but easy to understand. This wasn't perfect, but my minor complaints feel so petty I won't go into detail. On the whole I prefer ""Stiff"" by Mary Roach, just for the level of detail and the variety of scenarios she discusses, but I will absolutely seek out Doughty's other books now."
229,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16910534-amber,4,"I picked this book up because the title made me laugh. I recently adopted two kittens and they would for sure eat my eyeballs. This was a fun, easy read. This book is definitely different from what I normally read"
230,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33062796-shannon,4,"Anything that supports tackling the hard issues with young ones gets my approval. Well written, with a sense of cheek throughout, and insightful, Doughty does it again."
231,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34044332-virginija-rudyt,5,"It's a book written by mortician and funeral home director Caitlin Doughty and she decided to do that because kids have no filter (compared to adults) and ask very interesting questions about death and corpses. She answers questions lightly, with humor but with true (very interesting) scientific facts and she does that as if she's talking with kids or teens who maybe asked that question, but most of the adults probably should read this book too.Mainly because I (for example) didn't know almost any of that stuff and it just really interesting. Viking funeral? Corpse laws? Cannibalism (fyi, it's legal to eat human meat in most of the countries)? Donating blood after death? Aquamation? So many things unknown because for a lot of people death is still some kind of taboo. No one really wants to talk about it and especially not while joking about filling your stomach with unpopped popcorn kernels just before dying and going into crematorium. (spoiler alert: it won't work) Honestly, i would recommend this to everyone who is interested to know more about mortician's job, decomposition and overall about what happens (or could/couldn't happen) after death."
232,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59371159-ilana,4,"Really enjoyed this book. It's presumably intended for a young audience, but adults will find plenty to enjoy here too. Adults who aren't too squeamish about death and what happens to corpses after the bacteria start doing their work of consuming the person who used to be their host. All kinds of questions by kids are answered, such as ""why is grandma wrapped in plastic under her clothes in the coffin"" and ""what do corpses smell like"" or what process a corpse goes through when it's put in an incinerator and what the dust resulting from the incineration is actually composed of, or describing how cemeteries must contend with restricted space and are building high rises to house the dead around the world. Satisfies the curiosity if you've ever wondered, ""what happens to our bodies after we die?"". Not for the squeamish, but otherwise good fun as Doughty obviously doesn't take herself or her profession as a mortician too seriously. "
233,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42219802-michelle,5,"Another 5 star book from Doughty! I just recently finished “Smoke Gets in your Eyes” and loved that as much if not more than this one. Highly recommend both of these books! I am so sad that I only have one book left to read by her, at least I feel special because it’s an ARC. I think that’s why I’ve been cherishing it to read last! She is one author that I’d really like to meet in person! Come visit the East Coast Caitlin....pretty please!So....for this year’s #spookathon I challenged myself to read something out of my comfort zone ( ahem—-cats eating eyeballs, confronting death head on, middle grade—- definitely NOT my norm but nonetheless here we are.)In “Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs” we find out that the answer is yes, it’s a very real possibility that your pets will eat you if they are hungry enough, as well as many other answers to questions from children, yes children, that I, a 30 year-old adult never knew that I had. This book truly had me wondering the ENTIRE time if these kids were really that much smarter than I am. Caitlin discusses that, “Young people are often more perceptive than the adults. They weren’t shy about guts and gore.” I also realized that Caitlin always states in her books that we-as humans- have a HUGE problem when it comes to discussing death; we avoid it at all costs. “Most people in our culture are death illiterate, which makes them even more afraid.” I concur, the unknown is horrifying. There was a lot of information in this book that I didn’t know, that I now feel that I NEEDED to know ( and also some really bizarre things that I could’ve passed on—but hey out of the mouth of babes, right? ). So I thank you, creepy little children for asking these questions. I consider myself to be fairly knowledgable about the world of death, having lost so many close loved ones and trying to cope with the grief, but here is some new information that I learned and would like to express my thoughts on:(Most of these you will not know what I’m talking about, which is the point in me being brief, you should read the book!)1. As far as the “waiting mortuary”....I’ll let you read about this one yourself. All I have to say is hell- -to -the -no!2. The Viking funeral- Who is this child? I’m concerned for his well-being.3. The popcorn meme- I admit I searched for it, but I couldn’t find it. But, seriously who has time to think about these things? Very troubling!4. Realtors- I definitely thought that they all were legally obligated to tell you about murders. Creepy. Out come those trust issues!5. Plastification- Wait, what???? I wanna see. I’m going to Body Worlds ASAP.6. “How does a whole adult fit in a tiny box after cremation?” I know how the cremation process works, but I must admit to you that this is the most shocking and gut-wrenching moment for myself as well as many others that I know. You can TRY to prepare yourself for this, but carrying your loved one in your hands at about 5-8 lbs is truly a smack in your face. A huge dose of reality, that person is long gone.7. October 2nd aka “Old Mans Day” is now one of my new favorite holidays! I can’t believe that I just missed it!8. Never have I ever, in probably 50 or More flights, have I considered someone dying on a plane ( of natural causes—that is). “...But with 8 million people flying every day, it is almost inevitable that someone will die from heart problems, lung problems, or other ailments related to old age.” Perfect, thank you for that image and also giving me a new fear. That 1 in a million statistic of dying in a plane crash now seems beautiful and quite preferable to me that sitting next to a strangers corpse all buckled in for who knows how long.9. “The idea that a body can be dissolved in water drives some people wild with fear—especially when they find out that the water used in the process, which is not dangerous in any way, is sent into the sewage system.” Wait.....what? Yes I’m freaking out too, it’s a good thing that I drink bottled water. If there’s something wrong with spring water, please don’t tell me. Hah.10. The fact that they charge more for caskets for larger people should be ”sizism.” That should really be a thing. I can’t stand when I get charged $3 more for a larger sized bra at Victoria’s Secret, but do they care? No. I know there is more material and labor involved in both circumstances but unless you somehow purposely made yourself grow a few inches or enhanced your chest, I think that it’s personally not fair.11. Donating blood when you’re dead? Fascinating! Due to my immune system ( or lack thereof) no one would even want my blood when I’m alive!12. The “leasing” system and not having enough room for all of the dead—“Once grandma has had her time to decompose, her bones need to step aside for a whole new generation of rotting corpses.” Stacking people —-Prayer level, heart level, sky level, no thank you! I’ll just be cremated.Last but certainly not least, here are some topics that never crossed my mind. What happens when the ground is too frozen to bury someone? What if you wanted your pet to be buried with you? Did mummys stink? Read to find out!5 stars!"
234,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"Kids ask the darndest questions. Especially from morticians. And Caitlin Doughty loves answering them.Doughty knows a lot about death: she is a mortician, owns a funeral home, and runs a Youtube series called “ask a mortician”. She handles questions about death with a candid (and necessarily, morbid) sense of humor and refreshing naturalness. Because death is natural - and the more we know about it, the less frightening it is. Or at least it seemed to me while reading this slim volume with quirky illustrations that I have borrowed from my daughter’s Christmas stash.This is not my normal fare and would not have occurred to me to read, if my kid had not asked for it for Christmas. Well, it was informative, and I have enjoyed it, well, as much as a book rich in various stages of putrefaction, bodily fluids, corpse leakage, and the possibility of cats/dogs/humans eating dead bodies can be enjoyed. It is not for the faint of heart, but it is written for teens so if they can handle it, so can you. Well, if you are so inclined, anyway.I recommend looking up her Youtube series “Ask a mortician”. She is a character. And has a Morticia Adams hair cut. For real."
235,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3764551-katra,5,"What an incredibly delightful, if creepy, read! It's true that you can never predict what children will say, or in this case, ask; and those bizarre questions have led to a book that it both educational and chortling good. While I am disappointed that a flaming Viking ship is not in my funereal future, I'm somewhat relieved that my Gracie will probably nibble my lips away before going for my eyes. I'm not sure why that makes me feel better, but it does. Caitlin Doughty could go on indefinitely about a host of normally repulsive topics, and I would eat it all up. It should be added that Diane Ruiz's somewhat ghoulish artwork add greatly to the macabre merriment. I offer a challenge: Pick up this book and read a paragraph. I'm betting that you won't put it down until you regretfully run out of pages.Thanks to W. W. Norton & Company and NetGalley for making an advance copy available for an honest review."
236,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64630449-traceyl,5,"This is an excellent book. It takes a scientific and entertaining look at death by answering some of our most common questions about it. Some of my favorite questions asked were about dying in space (what physically happens to our bodies, as well as if/how we should bring them back to Earth), eating uncooked popcorn before dying and being cremated (will our stomachs explode with popcorn?), and gifting a loved one your skull after death (legally very difficult). I previously read the author's other work From Here to Eternity: Traveling the World to Find the Good Death which was pretty good, but I prefer this question and answer format. I hope the author follows up with more of these books."

Caitlin Doughty managed to present the subject matter in a way that was both informative and fun. My only complaint is that the book does end rather abruptly. There is no wrap-up to bring it to a close. She is just answering a question, then it's done. The questions end very suddenly. I would have liked a short conclusion to the book. 4.5 stars "

240,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105191338-kat,4,"Before reading this book, I would've never imagined the day where a book about death, bodily fluids, corpses and such would be even be on my radar of anything I would want to know about. I fall cleanly into the 'ignorance is bliss' category on some subjects. So why would I choose to read this book anyway? Well, the technical reason is that it was the non-fiction monthly group read choice for one of my groups. The more accurate reason is that there's a cat on the cover and how could I possibly pass by any book whose title includes the words Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? and not be at least a little curious, especially seeing how my own cat stares at me at times. I need to know if she's just waiting me out while she works on her future meal plan. Caitlin Doughty has written a book that handles a very difficult subject with both fact and humor. The questions posed in the book come from children, and it's their imaginative (and sometimes brutal) curiosity that allows us adults to benefit from the questions we might be too timid to ask. Some might find using a humorous approach to the topic mildly crass or disrespectful, but I appreciated that Doughty broke through the polite barriers in a way that, for me at least, felt safe and enjoyable. She's like the cool science teacher you always wish you'd had. The only downside for me is simply that I started tiring of the subject as I went along. Some questions were more interesting than others, and I found myself only wanting to read the book in small doses at a time. I learned a lot - in some cases much more than I wanted to know - but it's a very well written, engaging and informative book. I don't recommend it for the overly squeamish, but I think most people would enjoy it.★★★ ½ (rounded to 4)"

If you're a fan of Caitlin Doughty's previous book, ""Smoke Get's in Your Eyes"" or Mary Roach's class, ""Stiff,"" then you will absolutely appreciate the smarts and humor that went into making this book. Each chapter centers on a different ""taboo"" question that Caitlin has been asked over her career in the funeral business. From dying in space to cannibalism to viking funerals to corpses pooping. The questions are answered with grace, but also lots of humor and levity. The accompanying illustrations are also creepy and beautiful. This book answers so many questions I didn't even know I had. Truly stellar this book is a must read! "

Caitlin is an amazing person who always makes me laugh and feel grossed out at the same time! Although, the more I read about death and the dying process, the less grossed out I feel, which is a plus (I think). I have read Doughty’s previous novels and especially loved ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"" ever since I read it in full at Barnes and Noble one day, then went back a year later and bought it! Caitlin Doughty has a wonderful way of educating you about all these macabre topics but making it entertaining while ALSO keeping the conversation respectful towards individual beliefs and the dead themselves. And the artwork by Dianné Ruz was absolutely beautiful, matching the book perfectly. I simply devoured this book in a day and I would recommend this to anyone with a morbid interest or even a simple curiosity in what happens when/after we die. Thank you so much to W. W.

The answers were filled with factual information and some experiences from the author’s life.

Although a light reading and has some interesting information, I found the tone of the author and the overall content of the book to be too childish (“kid-friendly”) for my taste.

253,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13717595-jake,4,"The history of human knowledge of the body’s structure and mechanism is likely ancient. Through war, times of starvation, and malady and the many horrors that be-struck ancient humans— have knowledge of the inner contents of our shared fleshy casing been gleaned. Now of course for many history books on medicine, the findings prior to Hippocrates -the proclaimed father of medicine - is somewhat neglected , just as it is the case that in the many mythological creation stories, that there lacks a time before the chaos. A time before matter was with form. I have minor squabbles with this historiography starting at Hippocrates as I have suspicion that we underestimate the ancients knowledge and use of empiricism to navigate the world of health, disease and death. This, is a rant for another time. 	In this our rightfully whiggish history of anatomy, this developmental progress in anatomy and physiology came from the use of pretty terrible theories of the bodies workings with ideas of spirits, to humors to where we are now, which we can see as : complex mechanics. We as humans have gone from dabbling in blood lettings to using blood tests. We now search for microscopic balances of the proper proportion particles from types of lipids, proteins, and other things instead of a large scale balance of phlegm, blood, bile and what have you that people like Galen, and Avicenna presumed to explain the body.  So here we are in the modern age. The body is unambiguously a material structure, and its composition: organic likely without souls, or Elan vital.** This is therefore, a modern book. One which represents questions young teenagers have for the author, a mortification eager for responses on gasses, rigor mortis, body twitches, weak bowels and the horrific and undignified behaviors of a corpse. And guess what! This particular mortician is happy to oblige in the creepy world from which she is quite familiar. In fact, she quite seems to enjoy her topic. From cremations, putrefactions, laws on owning dead bodies, or on moving into a place where a body had died, Doughty answers the many queries peculiar and predictable. And in way she does it, it kinda makes the book kinda fun. Despite the inherent grimness of the material, I will admit I chuckled at times from her quirky and at time absurdist meanderings, because she simply is a pretty amusing writer. Well, as amusing as you can get in the context of blood, death, guts and the whole nine yards of disturbing. Her writings, were segmented by questions and answers are almost made to be put down and picked up again for whenever you find yourself with once again interested in the subject. I recommend this book for those interested in morbid scientific curiosities , and for later stage high school, and fear year undergrad students interested in death, health, medicine and science. It is best complimented by the more systematic and arguably more comprehensive Stiff by Mary Roach. ** I am open for discussion if you have a superior hypothesis to my material conception of nature"
254,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63944124-francesca-calarco,4,"I feel like if more textbooks took the approach of mortician and NPR’s death expert Caitlin Doughty, we would have more kids in STEM. In this genius work of comedy, Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? Big Questions from Tiny Mortals About Death, Doughty sets out to answer questions she has received from kids on all matters related to human decomposition. Kids ask the important questions after all, like ”What would happen if you swallowed a bag of popcorn before you died and were cremated?” If this is the type of stuff that keeps you up at night, then I would recommend Doughy’s book. Death definitely becomes her."
255,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18056144-permanently-booked,4,I can honestly say that I've never wondered what happens if someone dies in space or why bugs don't eat our bones. Leave it to the inquiring minds of children to come up with such intriguing questions that lead to such an engrossing book. This is my first non-fiction book of the year and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Though it may not be a novel I'll plop on my shelves to revisit down the road I did learn interesting facts about death that I think everyone should learn in their life. Who would've thought our meat sacks would be so interesting postmortem.
256,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/130372-maree,4,"This honest, quirky little book reminded me very much of Mary Roach’s Stiff, written for a YA or advanced middle grade audience. Most kids are intensely curious, especially about taboo topics having to do with our bodies. Caitlin Doughty answers real questions from children about death with her trademark humor and straightforwardness, using them to demystify one of the most intimidating topics for parents and teachers to tackle. She doesn’t rely on euphemisms to discuss some of the squickiest details of our current and historical handling of dead bodies, but she also manages to write with respect for the personhood of a body and for various cultural traditions. As a librarian, I appreciated her thorough bibliography for each chapter. As a parent, I considered the ways we avoid talking about death with our kids, and how honest, factual conversations can make it feel less scary. I think this book fills a knowledge gap that some kids will really appreciate."
257,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57432835-mila,5,"This was such a fun ride! Just like in the previous two books by Caitlin Doughty, the writing is hilarious and insightful at the same time, her style is very distinct and I love it. And even though this novel is directed towards a younger audience and obviously answers their questions, it's still a great read for adults as well. Overall, I'd really recommend checking out either this book or Caitlin's previous novels and don't forget about her YouTube channel! She's brilliant at what she does."
258,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63987726-rebeccah,4,"This was really interesting! The subject matter is something that fascinates me, and the author does a good job of keeping her answers thorough but easy to understand. This wasn't perfect, but my minor complaints feel so petty I won't go into detail. On the whole I prefer ""Stiff"" by Mary Roach, just for the level of detail and the variety of scenarios she discusses, but I will absolutely seek out Doughty's other books now."

261,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34044332-virginija-rudyt,5,"It's a book written by mortician and funeral home director Caitlin Doughty and she decided to do that because kids have no filter (compared to adults) and ask very interesting questions about death and corpses. She answers questions lightly, with humor but with true (very interesting) scientific facts and she does that as if she's talking with kids or teens who maybe asked that question, but most of the adults probably should read this book too.Mainly because I (for example) didn't know almost any of that stuff and it just really interesting. Viking funeral? Corpse laws? Cannibalism (fyi, it's legal to eat human meat in most of the countries)? Donating blood after death? Aquamation? So many things unknown because for a lot of people death is still some kind of taboo. No one really wants to talk about it and especially not while joking about filling your stomach with unpopped popcorn kernels just before dying and going into crematorium. (spoiler alert: it won't work) Honestly, i would recommend this to everyone who is interested to know more about mortician's job, decomposition and overall about what happens (or could/couldn't happen) after death."
262,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59371159-ilana,4,"Really enjoyed this book. It's presumably intended for a young audience, but adults will find plenty to enjoy here too. Adults who aren't too squeamish about death and what happens to corpses after the bacteria start doing their work of consuming the person who used to be their host. All kinds of questions by kids are answered, such as ""why is grandma wrapped in plastic under her clothes in the coffin"" and ""what do corpses smell like"" or what process a corpse goes through when it's put in an incinerator and what the dust resulting from the incineration is actually composed of, or describing how cemeteries must contend with restricted space and are building high rises to house the dead around the world. Satisfies the curiosity if you've ever wondered, ""what happens to our bodies after we die?"". Not for the squeamish, but otherwise good fun as Doughty obviously doesn't take herself or her profession as a mortician too seriously. "
263,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42219802-michelle,5,"Another 5 star book from Doughty! I just recently finished “Smoke Gets in your Eyes” and loved that as much if not more than this one. Highly recommend both of these books! I am so sad that I only have one book left to read by her, at least I feel special because it’s an ARC. I think that’s why I’ve been cherishing it to read last! She is one author that I’d really like to meet in person! Come visit the East Coast Caitlin....pretty please!So....for this year’s #spookathon I challenged myself to read something out of my comfort zone ( ahem—-cats eating eyeballs, confronting death head on, middle grade—- definitely NOT my norm but nonetheless here we are.)In “Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs” we find out that the answer is yes, it’s a very real possibility that your pets will eat you if they are hungry enough, as well as many other answers to questions from children, yes children, that I, a 30 year-old adult never knew that I had. This book truly had me wondering the ENTIRE time if these kids were really that much smarter than I am. Caitlin discusses that, “Young people are often more perceptive than the adults. They weren’t shy about guts and gore.” I also realized that Caitlin always states in her books that we-as humans- have a HUGE problem when it comes to discussing death; we avoid it at all costs. “Most people in our culture are death illiterate, which makes them even more afraid.” I concur, the unknown is horrifying. There was a lot of information in this book that I didn’t know, that I now feel that I NEEDED to know ( and also some really bizarre things that I could’ve passed on—but hey out of the mouth of babes, right? ). So I thank you, creepy little children for asking these questions. I consider myself to be fairly knowledgable about the world of death, having lost so many close loved ones and trying to cope with the grief, but here is some new information that I learned and would like to express my thoughts on:(Most of these you will not know what I’m talking about, which is the point in me being brief, you should read the book!)1. As far as the “waiting mortuary”....I’ll let you read about this one yourself. All I have to say is hell- -to -the -no!2. The Viking funeral- Who is this child? I’m concerned for his well-being.3. The popcorn meme- I admit I searched for it, but I couldn’t find it. But, seriously who has time to think about these things? Very troubling!4. Realtors- I definitely thought that they all were legally obligated to tell you about murders. Creepy. Out come those trust issues!5. Plastification- Wait, what???? I wanna see. I’m going to Body Worlds ASAP.6. “How does a whole adult fit in a tiny box after cremation?” I know how the cremation process works, but I must admit to you that this is the most shocking and gut-wrenching moment for myself as well as many others that I know. You can TRY to prepare yourself for this, but carrying your loved one in your hands at about 5-8 lbs is truly a smack in your face. A huge dose of reality, that person is long gone.7. October 2nd aka “Old Mans Day” is now one of my new favorite holidays! I can’t believe that I just missed it!8. Never have I ever, in probably 50 or More flights, have I considered someone dying on a plane ( of natural causes—that is). “...But with 8 million people flying every day, it is almost inevitable that someone will die from heart problems, lung problems, or other ailments related to old age.” Perfect, thank you for that image and also giving me a new fear. That 1 in a million statistic of dying in a plane crash now seems beautiful and quite preferable to me that sitting next to a strangers corpse all buckled in for who knows how long.9. “The idea that a body can be dissolved in water drives some people wild with fear—especially when they find out that the water used in the process, which is not dangerous in any way, is sent into the sewage system.” Wait.....what? Yes I’m freaking out too, it’s a good thing that I drink bottled water. If there’s something wrong with spring water, please don’t tell me. Hah.10. The fact that they charge more for caskets for larger people should be ”sizism.” That should really be a thing. I can’t stand when I get charged $3 more for a larger sized bra at Victoria’s Secret, but do they care? No. I know there is more material and labor involved in both circumstances but unless you somehow purposely made yourself grow a few inches or enhanced your chest, I think that it’s personally not fair.11. Donating blood when you’re dead? Fascinating! Due to my immune system ( or lack thereof) no one would even want my blood when I’m alive!12. The “leasing” system and not having enough room for all of the dead—“Once grandma has had her time to decompose, her bones need to step aside for a whole new generation of rotting corpses.” Stacking people —-Prayer level, heart level, sky level, no thank you! I’ll just be cremated.Last but certainly not least, here are some topics that never crossed my mind. What happens when the ground is too frozen to bury someone? What if you wanted your pet to be buried with you? Did mummys stink? Read to find out!5 stars!"
264,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"Kids ask the darndest questions. Especially from morticians. And Caitlin Doughty loves answering them.Doughty knows a lot about death: she is a mortician, owns a funeral home, and runs a Youtube series called “ask a mortician”. She handles questions about death with a candid (and necessarily, morbid) sense of humor and refreshing naturalness. Because death is natural - and the more we know about it, the less frightening it is. Or at least it seemed to me while reading this slim volume with quirky illustrations that I have borrowed from my daughter’s Christmas stash.This is not my normal fare and would not have occurred to me to read, if my kid had not asked for it for Christmas. Well, it was informative, and I have enjoyed it, well, as much as a book rich in various stages of putrefaction, bodily fluids, corpse leakage, and the possibility of cats/dogs/humans eating dead bodies can be enjoyed. It is not for the faint of heart, but it is written for teens so if they can handle it, so can you. Well, if you are so inclined, anyway.I recommend looking up her Youtube series “Ask a mortician”. She is a character. And has a Morticia Adams hair cut. For real."

It's true that you can never predict what children will say, or in this case, ask; and those bizarre questions have led to a book that it both educational and chortling good. While I am disappointed that a flaming Viking ship is not in my funereal future, I'm somewhat relieved that my Gracie will probably nibble my lips away before going for my eyes. I'm not sure why that makes me feel better, but it does. Caitlin Doughty could go on indefinitely about a host of normally repulsive topics, and I would eat it all up. It should be added that Diane Ruiz's somewhat ghoulish artwork add greatly to the macabre merriment. I offer a challenge: Pick up this book and read a paragraph. I'm betting that you won't put it down until you regretfully run out of pages.Thanks to W. W. Norton & Company and NetGalley for making an advance copy available for an honest review."
266,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64630449-traceyl,5,"This is an excellent book. It takes a scientific and entertaining look at death by answering some of our most common questions about it. Some of my favorite questions asked were about dying in space (what physically happens to our bodies, as well as if/how we should bring them back to Earth), eating uncooked popcorn before dying and being cremated (will our stomachs explode with popcorn?), and gifting a loved one your skull after death (legally very difficult). I previously read the author's other work From Here to Eternity: Traveling the World to Find the Good Death which was pretty good, but I prefer this question and answer format. I hope the author follows up with more of these books."

Caitlin Doughty managed to present the subject matter in a way that was both informative and fun. My only complaint is that the book does end rather abruptly. There is no wrap-up to bring it to a close. She is just answering a question, then it's done. The questions end very suddenly. I would have liked a short conclusion to the book. 4.5 stars "

270,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105191338-kat,4,"Before reading this book, I would've never imagined the day where a book about death, bodily fluids, corpses and such would be even be on my radar of anything I would want to know about. I fall cleanly into the 'ignorance is bliss' category on some subjects. So why would I choose to read this book anyway? Well, the technical reason is that it was the non-fiction monthly group read choice for one of my groups. The more accurate reason is that there's a cat on the cover and how could I possibly pass by any book whose title includes the words Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? and not be at least a little curious, especially seeing how my own cat stares at me at times. I need to know if she's just waiting me out while she works on her future meal plan. Caitlin Doughty has written a book that handles a very difficult subject with both fact and humor. The questions posed in the book come from children, and it's their imaginative (and sometimes brutal) curiosity that allows us adults to benefit from the questions we might be too timid to ask. Some might find using a humorous approach to the topic mildly crass or disrespectful, but I appreciated that Doughty broke through the polite barriers in a way that, for me at least, felt safe and enjoyable. She's like the cool science teacher you always wish you'd had. The only downside for me is simply that I started tiring of the subject as I went along. Some questions were more interesting than others, and I found myself only wanting to read the book in small doses at a time. I learned a lot - in some cases much more than I wanted to know - but it's a very well written, engaging and informative book. I don't recommend it for the overly squeamish, but I think most people would enjoy it.★★★ ½ (rounded to 4)"

If you're a fan of Caitlin Doughty's previous book, ""Smoke Get's in Your Eyes"" or Mary Roach's class, ""Stiff,"" then you will absolutely appreciate the smarts and humor that went into making this book. Each chapter centers on a different ""taboo"" question that Caitlin has been asked over her career in the funeral business. From dying in space to cannibalism to viking funerals to corpses pooping. The questions are answered with grace, but also lots of humor and levity. The accompanying illustrations are also creepy and beautiful. This book answers so many questions I didn't even know I had. Truly stellar this book is a must read! "

Caitlin is an amazing person who always makes me laugh and feel grossed out at the same time! Although, the more I read about death and the dying process, the less grossed out I feel, which is a plus (I think). I have read Doughty’s previous novels and especially loved ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"" ever since I read it in full at Barnes and Noble one day, then went back a year later and bought it! Caitlin Doughty has a wonderful way of educating you about all these macabre topics but making it entertaining while ALSO keeping the conversation respectful towards individual beliefs and the dead themselves. And the artwork by Dianné Ruz was absolutely beautiful, matching the book perfectly. I simply devoured this book in a day and I would recommend this to anyone with a morbid interest or even a simple curiosity in what happens when/after we die. Thank you so much to W. W.

So of course I had to read this one too. In this the author answers children’s questions about death including the question that is the title. I read most of the book out loud to the First Mate. There were just too many cool facts not to. My two favourite chapters were “What would happen to an astronaut body in space?” and “Can we give Grandma a Viking funeral?” The basic answer to the first question is that sci-fi books tend to get it wrong. And the second question is that the flaming floating boat is a Hollywood trick. The First Mate’s favourite was “Why don’t animals dig up all the graves?” Reasons. I love this book because it be funny, answers concisely and clearly about even the hypotheticals, and really does any excellent job explaining the whys and laws involved.

280,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5184971-danger,5,"Short segments make this book completely readable, and when I sat down to read the first one, I was compelled to keep going until I finished the entire book. The humor helps a lot, in a dad-jokey way, because without it this subject could get bleak. Instead, the questions about death are often interesting, and in some cases, wondrous. The author is knowledgeable and scientific in their responses, but also, add a lot of humanity to be served alongside it. So yeah, if books about death interest you and you want the quick/cheeky answer to a lot of morbid questions, then this book is for you."
281,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43622386-rachel-aranda,4,"3.75-4 starsThis was a nice book filled with a variety of questions asked by kids. The answers were filled with factual information and some experiences from the author’s life. It was nice hearing the author’s voice and humor in the book, but she wasn’t the best narrator I’ve listened to. Her voice is low and husky, which can make it difficult to focus on even though she’s relaxing to listen to."
282,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54464095-ryan-alsaihaty,2,"I’m just puzzled how has this book won the best science and technology book for 2019. Although a light reading and has some interesting information, I found the tone of the author and the overall content of the book to be too childish (“kid-friendly”) for my taste. Well, that’s what I get for reading a book titled Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs?"
283,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13717595-jake,4,"The history of human knowledge of the body’s structure and mechanism is likely ancient. Through war, times of starvation, and malady and the many horrors that be-struck ancient humans— have knowledge of the inner contents of our shared fleshy casing been gleaned. Now of course for many history books on medicine, the findings prior to Hippocrates -the proclaimed father of medicine - is somewhat neglected , just as it is the case that in the many mythological creation stories, that there lacks a time before the chaos. A time before matter was with form. I have minor squabbles with this historiography starting at Hippocrates as I have suspicion that we underestimate the ancients knowledge and use of empiricism to navigate the world of health, disease and death. This, is a rant for another time. 	In this our rightfully whiggish history of anatomy, this developmental progress in anatomy and physiology came from the use of pretty terrible theories of the bodies workings with ideas of spirits, to humors to where we are now, which we can see as : complex mechanics. We as humans have gone from dabbling in blood lettings to using blood tests. We now search for microscopic balances of the proper proportion particles from types of lipids, proteins, and other things instead of a large scale balance of phlegm, blood, bile and what have you that people like Galen, and Avicenna presumed to explain the body.  So here we are in the modern age. The body is unambiguously a material structure, and its composition: organic likely without souls, or Elan vital.** This is therefore, a modern book. One which represents questions young teenagers have for the author, a mortification eager for responses on gasses, rigor mortis, body twitches, weak bowels and the horrific and undignified behaviors of a corpse. And guess what! This particular mortician is happy to oblige in the creepy world from which she is quite familiar. In fact, she quite seems to enjoy her topic. From cremations, putrefactions, laws on owning dead bodies, or on moving into a place where a body had died, Doughty answers the many queries peculiar and predictable. And in way she does it, it kinda makes the book kinda fun. Despite the inherent grimness of the material, I will admit I chuckled at times from her quirky and at time absurdist meanderings, because she simply is a pretty amusing writer. Well, as amusing as you can get in the context of blood, death, guts and the whole nine yards of disturbing. Her writings, were segmented by questions and answers are almost made to be put down and picked up again for whenever you find yourself with once again interested in the subject. I recommend this book for those interested in morbid scientific curiosities , and for later stage high school, and fear year undergrad students interested in death, health, medicine and science. It is best complimented by the more systematic and arguably more comprehensive Stiff by Mary Roach. ** I am open for discussion if you have a superior hypothesis to my material conception of nature"
284,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63944124-francesca-calarco,4,"I feel like if more textbooks took the approach of mortician and NPR’s death expert Caitlin Doughty, we would have more kids in STEM. In this genius work of comedy, Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? Big Questions from Tiny Mortals About Death, Doughty sets out to answer questions she has received from kids on all matters related to human decomposition. Kids ask the important questions after all, like ”What would happen if you swallowed a bag of popcorn before you died and were cremated?” If this is the type of stuff that keeps you up at night, then I would recommend Doughy’s book. Death definitely becomes her."
285,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18056144-permanently-booked,4,I can honestly say that I've never wondered what happens if someone dies in space or why bugs don't eat our bones. Leave it to the inquiring minds of children to come up with such intriguing questions that lead to such an engrossing book. This is my first non-fiction book of the year and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Though it may not be a novel I'll plop on my shelves to revisit down the road I did learn interesting facts about death that I think everyone should learn in their life. Who would've thought our meat sacks would be so interesting postmortem.
286,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/130372-maree,4,"This honest, quirky little book reminded me very much of Mary Roach’s Stiff, written for a YA or advanced middle grade audience. Most kids are intensely curious, especially about taboo topics having to do with our bodies. Caitlin Doughty answers real questions from children about death with her trademark humor and straightforwardness, using them to demystify one of the most intimidating topics for parents and teachers to tackle. She doesn’t rely on euphemisms to discuss some of the squickiest details of our current and historical handling of dead bodies, but she also manages to write with respect for the personhood of a body and for various cultural traditions. As a librarian, I appreciated her thorough bibliography for each chapter. As a parent, I considered the ways we avoid talking about death with our kids, and how honest, factual conversations can make it feel less scary. I think this book fills a knowledge gap that some kids will really appreciate."
287,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57432835-mila,5,"This was such a fun ride! Just like in the previous two books by Caitlin Doughty, the writing is hilarious and insightful at the same time, her style is very distinct and I love it. And even though this novel is directed towards a younger audience and obviously answers their questions, it's still a great read for adults as well. Overall, I'd really recommend checking out either this book or Caitlin's previous novels and don't forget about her YouTube channel! She's brilliant at what she does."
288,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63987726-rebeccah,4,"This was really interesting! The subject matter is something that fascinates me, and the author does a good job of keeping her answers thorough but easy to understand. This wasn't perfect, but my minor complaints feel so petty I won't go into detail. On the whole I prefer ""Stiff"" by Mary Roach, just for the level of detail and the variety of scenarios she discusses, but I will absolutely seek out Doughty's other books now."
289,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16910534-amber,4,"I picked this book up because the title made me laugh. I recently adopted two kittens and they would for sure eat my eyeballs. This was a fun, easy read. This book is definitely different from what I normally read"
290,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33062796-shannon,4,"Anything that supports tackling the hard issues with young ones gets my approval. Well written, with a sense of cheek throughout, and insightful, Doughty does it again."
291,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34044332-virginija-rudyt,5,"It's a book written by mortician and funeral home director Caitlin Doughty and she decided to do that because kids have no filter (compared to adults) and ask very interesting questions about death and corpses. She answers questions lightly, with humor but with true (very interesting) scientific facts and she does that as if she's talking with kids or teens who maybe asked that question, but most of the adults probably should read this book too.Mainly because I (for example) didn't know almost any of that stuff and it just really interesting. Viking funeral? Corpse laws? Cannibalism (fyi, it's legal to eat human meat in most of the countries)? Donating blood after death? Aquamation? So many things unknown because for a lot of people death is still some kind of taboo. No one really wants to talk about it and especially not while joking about filling your stomach with unpopped popcorn kernels just before dying and going into crematorium. (spoiler alert: it won't work) Honestly, i would recommend this to everyone who is interested to know more about mortician's job, decomposition and overall about what happens (or could/couldn't happen) after death."
292,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59371159-ilana,4,"Really enjoyed this book. It's presumably intended for a young audience, but adults will find plenty to enjoy here too. Adults who aren't too squeamish about death and what happens to corpses after the bacteria start doing their work of consuming the person who used to be their host. All kinds of questions by kids are answered, such as ""why is grandma wrapped in plastic under her clothes in the coffin"" and ""what do corpses smell like"" or what process a corpse goes through when it's put in an incinerator and what the dust resulting from the incineration is actually composed of, or describing how cemeteries must contend with restricted space and are building high rises to house the dead around the world. Satisfies the curiosity if you've ever wondered, ""what happens to our bodies after we die?"". Not for the squeamish, but otherwise good fun as Doughty obviously doesn't take herself or her profession as a mortician too seriously. "
293,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42219802-michelle,5,"Another 5 star book from Doughty! I just recently finished “Smoke Gets in your Eyes” and loved that as much if not more than this one. Highly recommend both of these books! I am so sad that I only have one book left to read by her, at least I feel special because it’s an ARC. I think that’s why I’ve been cherishing it to read last! She is one author that I’d really like to meet in person! Come visit the East Coast Caitlin....pretty please!So....for this year’s #spookathon I challenged myself to read something out of my comfort zone ( ahem—-cats eating eyeballs, confronting death head on, middle grade—- definitely NOT my norm but nonetheless here we are.)In “Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs” we find out that the answer is yes, it’s a very real possibility that your pets will eat you if they are hungry enough, as well as many other answers to questions from children, yes children, that I, a 30 year-old adult never knew that I had. This book truly had me wondering the ENTIRE time if these kids were really that much smarter than I am. Caitlin discusses that, “Young people are often more perceptive than the adults. They weren’t shy about guts and gore.” I also realized that Caitlin always states in her books that we-as humans- have a HUGE problem when it comes to discussing death; we avoid it at all costs. “Most people in our culture are death illiterate, which makes them even more afraid.” I concur, the unknown is horrifying. There was a lot of information in this book that I didn’t know, that I now feel that I NEEDED to know ( and also some really bizarre things that I could’ve passed on—but hey out of the mouth of babes, right? ). So I thank you, creepy little children for asking these questions. I consider myself to be fairly knowledgable about the world of death, having lost so many close loved ones and trying to cope with the grief, but here is some new information that I learned and would like to express my thoughts on:(Most of these you will not know what I’m talking about, which is the point in me being brief, you should read the book!)1. As far as the “waiting mortuary”....I’ll let you read about this one yourself. All I have to say is hell- -to -the -no!2. The Viking funeral- Who is this child? I’m concerned for his well-being.3. The popcorn meme- I admit I searched for it, but I couldn’t find it. But, seriously who has time to think about these things? Very troubling!4. Realtors- I definitely thought that they all were legally obligated to tell you about murders. Creepy. Out come those trust issues!5. Plastification- Wait, what???? I wanna see. I’m going to Body Worlds ASAP.6. “How does a whole adult fit in a tiny box after cremation?” I know how the cremation process works, but I must admit to you that this is the most shocking and gut-wrenching moment for myself as well as many others that I know. You can TRY to prepare yourself for this, but carrying your loved one in your hands at about 5-8 lbs is truly a smack in your face. A huge dose of reality, that person is long gone.7. October 2nd aka “Old Mans Day” is now one of my new favorite holidays! I can’t believe that I just missed it!8. Never have I ever, in probably 50 or More flights, have I considered someone dying on a plane ( of natural causes—that is). “...But with 8 million people flying every day, it is almost inevitable that someone will die from heart problems, lung problems, or other ailments related to old age.” Perfect, thank you for that image and also giving me a new fear. That 1 in a million statistic of dying in a plane crash now seems beautiful and quite preferable to me that sitting next to a strangers corpse all buckled in for who knows how long.9. “The idea that a body can be dissolved in water drives some people wild with fear—especially when they find out that the water used in the process, which is not dangerous in any way, is sent into the sewage system.” Wait.....what? Yes I’m freaking out too, it’s a good thing that I drink bottled water. If there’s something wrong with spring water, please don’t tell me. Hah.10. The fact that they charge more for caskets for larger people should be ”sizism.” That should really be a thing. I can’t stand when I get charged $3 more for a larger sized bra at Victoria’s Secret, but do they care? No. I know there is more material and labor involved in both circumstances but unless you somehow purposely made yourself grow a few inches or enhanced your chest, I think that it’s personally not fair.11. Donating blood when you’re dead? Fascinating! Due to my immune system ( or lack thereof) no one would even want my blood when I’m alive!12. The “leasing” system and not having enough room for all of the dead—“Once grandma has had her time to decompose, her bones need to step aside for a whole new generation of rotting corpses.” Stacking people —-Prayer level, heart level, sky level, no thank you! I’ll just be cremated.Last but certainly not least, here are some topics that never crossed my mind. What happens when the ground is too frozen to bury someone? What if you wanted your pet to be buried with you? Did mummys stink? Read to find out!5 stars!"
294,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"Kids ask the darndest questions. Especially from morticians. And Caitlin Doughty loves answering them.Doughty knows a lot about death: she is a mortician, owns a funeral home, and runs a Youtube series called “ask a mortician”. She handles questions about death with a candid (and necessarily, morbid) sense of humor and refreshing naturalness. Because death is natural - and the more we know about it, the less frightening it is. Or at least it seemed to me while reading this slim volume with quirky illustrations that I have borrowed from my daughter’s Christmas stash.This is not my normal fare and would not have occurred to me to read, if my kid had not asked for it for Christmas. Well, it was informative, and I have enjoyed it, well, as much as a book rich in various stages of putrefaction, bodily fluids, corpse leakage, and the possibility of cats/dogs/humans eating dead bodies can be enjoyed. It is not for the faint of heart, but it is written for teens so if they can handle it, so can you. Well, if you are so inclined, anyway.I recommend looking up her Youtube series “Ask a mortician”. She is a character. And has a Morticia Adams hair cut. For real."
295,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3764551-katra,5,"What an incredibly delightful, if creepy, read! It's true that you can never predict what children will say, or in this case, ask; and those bizarre questions have led to a book that it both educational and chortling good. While I am disappointed that a flaming Viking ship is not in my funereal future, I'm somewhat relieved that my Gracie will probably nibble my lips away before going for my eyes. I'm not sure why that makes me feel better, but it does. Caitlin Doughty could go on indefinitely about a host of normally repulsive topics, and I would eat it all up. It should be added that Diane Ruiz's somewhat ghoulish artwork add greatly to the macabre merriment. I offer a challenge: Pick up this book and read a paragraph. I'm betting that you won't put it down until you regretfully run out of pages.Thanks to W. W. Norton & Company and NetGalley for making an advance copy available for an honest review."
296,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64630449-traceyl,5,"This is an excellent book. It takes a scientific and entertaining look at death by answering some of our most common questions about it. Some of my favorite questions asked were about dying in space (what physically happens to our bodies, as well as if/how we should bring them back to Earth), eating uncooked popcorn before dying and being cremated (will our stomachs explode with popcorn?), and gifting a loved one your skull after death (legally very difficult). I previously read the author's other work From Here to Eternity: Traveling the World to Find the Good Death which was pretty good, but I prefer this question and answer format. I hope the author follows up with more of these books."
297,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7897151-amanda,4,"Very similar to Caitlin’s original Ask A Mortician videos on her YouTube channel. Full of facts, fun information and Caitlin’s macabre and punny sense of humor. Not a ton of new information in here for me, a long-time fan, but still an enjoyable read!"
298,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13798293-kristie,5,"I thought this was a really entertaining and interesting read. It's written for a younger audience, but still kept my attention. Caitlin Doughty managed to present the subject matter in a way that was both informative and fun. My only complaint is that the book does end rather abruptly. There is no wrap-up to bring it to a close. She is just answering a question, then it's done. The questions end very suddenly. I would have liked a short conclusion to the book. 4.5 stars "
299,0393358496,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9395475-hayley,5,Laugh out loud funny. Great book.
