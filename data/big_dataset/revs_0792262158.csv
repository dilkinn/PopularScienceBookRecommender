0,0792262158,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,3,"Deep Ancestry: The Landmark DNA Quest to Decipher Our Distant Past by Spencer Wells“Deep Ancestry"" takes the reader on a scientific journey to the past with the goal of seeking our common ancestors of everyone alive today. With the focus predominately on reading DNA as a historical document and with the assistance of converging scientific knowledge, the author provides an overview of what we know today. While the topic is fascinating and the book is accessible the prose lacks panache. This mildly disappointing and brief 256-page book is composed of the following six chapters: 1. The Block, 2. Odine’s Story: The Exception, 3. Margaret’s Story: The Hearth, 4. Phil’s Story: The Ice, 5. Virumandi’s Story: The Beach, and 6. Julius’s Story: The Cradle. Positives:1.	The fascinating topic of genetics in the hands of Dr. Wells.2.	Accessible book for the masses.3.	Good use of charts and diagrams. 4.	Each chapter revolves around a human story and the author injects our knowledge of genetics as it applies to said story.5.	Many interesting tidbits interspersed throughout book.6.	The origins of the Genographic Project and its goals.7.	A brief history of migration. Well argumented theories backed by good science. Mapping the migrations.8.	Genetics at a basic level. The author does a good job of laying down the basics. He also provides a helpful glossary. The use of genetics to help us discover our past. “Our scientific goal is to explain global patterns of human diversity”.9.	Human evolution…it does a species “good”. “If we go back far enough, all human share a common ancestor at some point in the past”.10.	The concept of race in proper scientific context.11.	Important topics discussed: the importance of the Y chromosome, haplogroups, mitochondrial DNA, mutations. These genetic topics form the foundation of this book.12.	The use of archeology to complement genetics. 13.	The impact of climate to human evolution. “Cool” stuff.14.	One of the joys of this book is learning about different cultures: the Chukchi, Yakut, and the Hadzabe.15.	A look into Neanderthals. 16.	The cause of genetic differences. “As humans moved through Eurasia, then, the forces of genetic drift, climatic adaption, and sexual selection combined to change their physical appearance”. 17.	The evolution of language. “The speech-enabling hyoid bones (the bone in your Adam’s apple) found in Neanderthal remains attest to a throat structure that would allow spoken language…” Interesting.18.	The deepest lineages discussed. The level of variations.19.	The future of the Genographic Project. 20.	Appendix describing haplogroups, a formal bibliography and web addresses.Negatives:1.	The writing style is quite dry, it is standard science fare. Where’s the passion? The love of discovery… 2.	There are simply many books that cover this topic better. Please check my further suggestions.In summary, this is an average book. Genetics is a fascinating topic and Dr. Wells is a gifted scientist and documentary filmmaker but for whatever reason the book lacked the panache and substance of his documentaries. There are many books that have covered this interesting topic better. That being stated, I commend Dr. Wells on his important work on the Genographic Project and wish him much success in his endeavors. Borrow this one from your local library. Further suggestions: “The 10,000 Year Explosion” by Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending, “Written in Stone” by Brian Switek, “Why Evolution Is True” by Jerry A. Coyne, “The Making of the Fittest” by Sean B. Carroll, “Your Inner Fish” by Neil Shubin, “Relics of Eden” by Daniel J. Fairbanks, “Only a Theory” by Kenneth R. Miller, and “Life Ascending: The Ten Great Inventions of Evolution” by Nick Lane, “Before the Dawn: Recovering the Lost History of Our Ancestors” by Nicholas Wade, and “The Violinist’s Thumb” by Sam Kean. “DNA USA” by Bryan Sykes might be of interest but it is also dry. I have reviewed all of the aforementioned books look under the tag, “Book Shark Reviews”. "
1,0792262158,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1502451-angiea,4,"As part of my goal to read more non-fiction, I created a mini anthropology class. It started a few years ago with ""The Seven Daughters of Eve"" by Bryan Sykes. I then read 4 more books in quick succession beginning with this book by Spencer Wells. Wells discusses, through representative stories, the travels of the human species around the world and how the genographic project will map the human experience. There are instructions for obtaining a kit to add your DNA to the data. I enjoyed the book as it was written for the non-scientist; but I was glad I had some vocab background in the subject already. As a person of faith, it's always interesting to reconcile the science with what I believe to be God's plan for us. This was quite interesting and a good read, but not as good as Wells' other book I read, ""The Journey of Man."""
2,0792262158,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17999985-brendan,4,"I can't give this book a 5 because even Spencer Wells states it's an overview. I discovered Wells during a podcast NPR ted talks radio hour, this was such an interesting project I sourced this book. I'm now awaiting The Journey of Man but this book has opened the DNA world to me. I really liked the book and it had probing studies that are like a thrilling Tv show, each chapter leading into another. I've been setting my mind on fire at the moment, not a lot of fictional books sneaking through. It's interesting to see Eves connection plays deeper than Adams. This is a defining project for our species and I think it points to our future pioneering discoveries, this planet is just too small for us. Moving on to my next book but this was a very interesting overview of mankinds long journey."
3,0792262158,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5939179-michael-mcclelland,3,"There was potential here to make this a much more fascinating book. The science itself should be fascinating enough (noting inherited mutations and ""copying errors"" in DNA, across indigenous societies, to determine probable migration paths - and the timing of such - of humans from where they first arose), but the delivery is quite dry. Much of it reads as a thesis introduction or a submission to a network for a TV documentary special. Perhaps I simply wanted the author to appear as excited as I felt the subject warranted.More interesting were the crossovers between DNA study and findings in archaeology, linguistics, indigenous cultural belief and politics (the last with regard to a similar, preceding collection effort and why it failed). The book progresses using personal stories, and it is these that are probably in equal parts the most interesting, and most disappointing aspect of the book. In most cases they are just touched upon, when I really wanted to find out how difficult it was for the researchers to get to these places, why they selected them, who they chose there and why, what sort of cajoling did the ""natives"" need to participate, what did they feel about their participation, etc. Perhaps the author was wary of portraying a 19th century exploitation-style collection expedition, or maybe he thought the science was far more exciting than any one person's story. What is certain though is that the program is ongoing and that there is still more to tell. Hopefully, next time, it's told in a fashion that's a bit more to my liking! ;)"
4,0792262158,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1974182-kathleen,3,"Describes for the common reader the methodology and results so far of a study of human genetic roots through DNA in Y-chromosomes and mitochondria in females which demonstrates migration patterns of our earliest ancestors.This arc has been lying around since 2006, but it was well worth the wait. Now I want to know more -- what new has been learned. I went right to the website - but discovered that it costs $100 to fit yourself into that data. The arc did not have the illustrations, but for the most part the text is so clearly written so they weren't necessary. It is also missing a hefty appendix that was one reviewer's favorite part. The project attempts to collect DNA from populations still relatively unmixed and he uses as his examples a Navajo, an South Indian villager, and a member of the Tanzanian Hadzabe group as well as his Danish grandmother and a descendent of Thomas Jefferson's slave Sally Hemings. Wells, a geneticist, is Explorer-in-Residence at the National Geographic and director of the project. "
5,0792262158,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"This book, which follows Wells’ 2002 Journey of Man, traces the male and female migrations out of Africa and then across the globe. This story is fascinating and Wells’ TV special on this topic was excellent. The same cannot be said for this book, however. Deep Ancestry is a muddle of hard-to-follow labeling designations that are a nightmare to sort out.* Apparently there’s a consortium that supervises these designations, at least for mtDNA, and I suppose it all makes excellent sense to those involved. But this book would have benefited by a lay-friendly chapter on this topic alone as it is essential to tracing the various migration lines. *The book doesn’t describe why the African Eve is labeled “L” (Actually, L0/1, L2, L3 – for three lines within Africa), as opposed to “E” for “Eve” or “A” for the first letter in the alphabet. The L3 line moved out of Africa in two waves, M and N lines. Then M divides into 1, C, D, Z and M2-6 lines, making the reader wonder how numbers and letters end up having equal status (e.g., M1, C), and N goes to XW, 1, A, B, I lines, and the R “clan” is U, T and J, and J is “pre HV, HV, HV1 and V). I’m also wondering what happened to O and P and Q that follow M and N, and wonder now M and N got designated before A-L. I also wonder what happened with the Sykes lines (Seven Daughters of Eve – Ursula, Xenia, Katrine, Helena, Velda, Jasmine, Tara) and how they match up with what Wells puts forward in this book. We know that haplogroups describe large groupings of people with the same genetic heritage, but we also see references to clans and clades and sub clans and sub clades, but Wells calls all of his groupings haplogroups, even when they are clearly subdesignations (sequentially, they follow L3, M and N). To confuse things even more, both the YDNA and mtDNA markers also have alphabetical designations (A, B, C, etc) so it’s not always clear in the text whether Wells is talking about mtDNA or Y DNA, particularly when Y DNA has an L, M, and N designation, the same as the mtDNA. Then Wells throws another curve ball with his male haplogroup by inserting a YAP haplogroup between C3 and D. We also see a E3B designation, prompting the question why the second “b” is “B” and not “b” and we bump into an “LLY22G” designation off the N YDNA line, which makes one wonder how that designation came to be. "
6,0792262158,http://goodreads.com/user/show/725357-nate,5,"Very accessible intro to the Genographic Project, which aims to map out human migration over the past 100,000 years by comparing genetic similarities and differences between X and Y chromosomes. The section at the end describing the major haplogroups around the world was very interesting. It inspired me to buy a kit to test my own Y chromosome. Fascinating to see how related we are and how concepts like race don't mean anything at a genetic level. "
7,0792262158,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4555940-stella,5,"Short, comprehensive, simple and written for beginners- what else can you ask from a book on a really complicated scientific project! I found it engrossing and I immediately purchased the National Geographic kit after I read it. Having my mtDNA analyzed was an amazing experience. Highly recommended!I support this project wholeheartedly!Well done Spencer Wells and National Geographic. "
8,0792262158,http://goodreads.com/user/show/782114-nathan-albright,4,"I am going to have a lot of harsh things to say about this book and its approach, so I would like to begin by saying that I believe enough in the importance of understanding my own ancestry that I am a participant in the Genographic project myself through my own interest in genetic genealogy [1].  It does not particularly surprise me that so many people around the world wish to have some deeper understanding of their connection with other parts of humanity, or that genetic research has been involved in solving some exciting mysteries and in raising lots of questions for further research.  Nor does it surprise me that the National Geographic wishes to involve itself in this exciting research and to view the matter in a way that is particularly well-suited to better understanding historical geography and some of its puzzles.  This was not a book that brought many surprises, although on a certain level at least it was a pleasant book to read and an enjoyable one despite its flaws and shortcomings, about which I will have more to say anon.This short book over a bit over 200 pages is divided into six chapters as well as an interesting appendix.  The first chapter gives a brief explanation of human migration patterns as well as genetic history.  After this the next chapter focus on an exploration of Y-DNA research with a look at the interesting genetic history of Thomas Jefferson and his descendants through Sally Hemmings.  The next chapter focuses on mtDNA and its importance in the trace of genetic information through women.  Another chapter looks at the transportation of genetic information through the settlement of North and South America by immigrants from Siberia and the phenomenon of genetic drift.  A look at the genome of South India and its role as part of a littoral immigration from Africa to Australia follows before the book looks at Africa as the supposed cradle of modern mankind and some of the mysteries of human habitation on that continent.  The book then contains a sizable appendix that describes the various haplogroups and their geographic distribution.  The book is full of maps and pleasant accounts of people whose interest in finding out more of their personal genetic background has helped increase our understanding for the history of humanity at large.So far, so good, but there is a rub here.  What makes this book less enjoyable and certainly a great deal less insightful than it would otherwise be is the fact that the author appears to be devoted to a few bogus aspects of pseudoscience.  For one, the book is wedded to the evolutionary perspective, with shortcomings as diverse as a belief in bogus views on the origins of human beings and a mistaken belief that non-coding DNA is ""junk,"" which have been mercifully dispelled by a better understanding of DNA in the time after this book was written.  Likewise, the book posits beliefs in the ""out of Africa"" theory of human development and a belief in a consistent rate of DNA mutation which may or may not be true.  There is still a great deal in this book to enjoy, but the author's explanations for the past are often just-so stories without a great deal of credibility.  Whatever we are able to find out about our history through genetic testing, something I am personally involved in, it is likely to tell us something different than what the author would expect based on his incorrect scientific worldview.  That does not mean, though, that this work is without its pleasures for those who are able to overcome the author's shortcomings as an explainer of scientific advances in genetic genealogy.[1] See, for example:https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2012...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2015...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2017...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2018..."
9,0792262158,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9936209-zoann,4,"I heard part of a story on NPR with this author and was intrigued enough to read the book. So I'm a bit of a genealogy nut, but this is going far beyond that! Wells leads a project that uses DNA analysis to map the history and migration of humans in all of history. Some of my favorite insights or facts from the book: *the mapping of the human genome meant that ""genetics was on course to become ""big science"" in the way that physics...had done decades before.""*by analyzing samples from people who have been living in the same place for a long period of time, so-called indigenous people, it is possible to infer details about the genetic patterns of their ancestors.""*""people move for three reasons: a lack of opportunities at home, the perception of better opportunities elsewhere, or forced relocation.""*The world is currently experiencing a cultural mass extinction similar to the biodiversity crisis. One symptom is the loss of languages. Linguists believe that as many as 15,000 languages may have been spoken in the year 1500...Today only 6,000 spoken languages are left.""*""people from more than 180 nations (and there are only 192 in the world) have made their way [to New York City]. More languages (138) are spoken in Queens...than in most countries.""*""People feel the pull of an ancestral homeland that most have never visited, and many know little about. [People are looking for something]--something that binds them together in a way that the venerable constitution of a 200-year-old country cannot: a blood relationship. Roots."" This explains genealogy to me in a way I've never thought of it before.*The largest mass migration in human history took place between 1840 and 1920 when nearly 40 million people (more than double the U.S. population in 1840) moved from Europe to the United States...Nearly half of all Americans alive today have ancestors that passed through the main immigration facility on Ellis Island in New York Harbor.""*""Genealogy is the second most popular American hobby after gardening (and the second most visited category of Web sites after pornography).""*""if the DNA inside one of your cells were stretched end to end, it would be nearly six feet long.""*""85 percent of the variation in our species is found among individuals within a population--in other words, it is shared across all populations and races."" ""What this meant was that human races accounted for less than 10 percent of the genetic variation in our species, and over 90 percent was found among people within a race...""Humans are part of one big extended family."" ""Humans are 99.9% identical at the DNA level.""*""a 'mobility revolution'. Most spouses lived only a few miles from each other--most people were marrying people from the same or neighboring village. Today that distance is ten times as far.There's lots more, but I'll stop there. A small book, but dense with ideas, facts and technical concepts. I enjoyed it!"
10,0792262158,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76297629-melvin-marsh-m-s,4,"“Deep Ancestry: Inside the Genographic Project” as the name suggests takes us inside the genographic project in a quest to solve who we are and where we came from. It gives a nice history of the project proving examples of individuals who donated DNA to the project and what scientists were able to learn from them. Although some of the topics can be a little complex to those who might not have a significant biology background or even those whose last biology class was several years ago, it is perfectly understandable to the layperson and Dr. Wells is able to translate between the technical jargon used by scientists and the common language of the layperson. A glossary in the back of the book, just in case something is not explained fully in the text, is also present. For those of us who might like a little more detail other than that which is provided in the main text, there is a fairly decent sized appendix in the back, which offers details about all the various “families” that scientists can trace via their mutations on the mitochondrial DNA (provided from the mother to all children) as well as the mutations on the Y marker which is passed down from father to son. "
11,0792262158,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2096885-jeffrey-williams,4,"This is a pretty basic introduction to the Genographic Project, which began in 2005 shortly before this book was published. There is an incredible amount of detail on the origin of man's diaspora and the routes taken. While it is a pretty broad overview, it did leave me wanting to know more. I had previously read Bryan Sykes book ""Saxons, Vikings, and Celts,"" and had taken DNA tests through Family Tree DNA and Ancestry, so I was somewhat familiar with the topic. However, Wells answered some basic questions that I had and still leaves me wanting to know more. This is a fascinating book that deserves an update, especially since the project has advanced to Geno 2.0. "
12,0792262158,http://goodreads.com/user/show/970632-mitchell,3,"It was interesting to read a slightly older book on such a fast moving subject. There is a lot of this subject that hasn't moved that much since 2006 - more than I thought. And yet this book wasn't all that different. And the appendix in the back almost certainly works better as a web site. My Genetics List seems to capture this subject well and I'm continuing to read down it. There are better choices than this one, though it certainly wasn't bad."
13,0792262158,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53944487-jenny-m-webster,5,"It is a great basic genetic ancestry book for those with no clue on the topic. It is old and some info is outdated —it’s ancient considering how much this science has evolved since the book was published 13 years ago. I’d love to see an update from the author on the whole program. Nonetheless, the personal stories and basic concepts are a great place for a beginner to start."
14,0792262158,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90583610-whitney-rivera,3,"Liked it, and fascinating research! But I don't share his worldview, so I believe in order for his worldview to remain cohesive, he has to place the first human starting in Africa, rather than the Fertile Crescent. I just don't know if the evidence actually lines up with that."
15,0792262158,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76263262-tim,3,This is well-written and probably serves as a good introduction to DNA and its use in tracing populations.
16,0792262158,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1416647-jukka,0,"Deep Ancestry - Spencer WellsI definitely recommend this.Well written and presented, this is a fascinating story of human pre-history. It's a playful sort of dialogue and it gives source to much imagining for the reader.There is so much new with human population genetics, it's good to find a source that draws it all together, and gives it a story and a voice. This book definitely swept me along as it zooms round the globe, forward and back in time, and through arcane bits of science and historic lore. The book is well organized each chapter unveiling another topic and moving deeper.There are a few times though when i think Wells is guessing too much, projecting what is likely but not completely nailed down. This is not often but i do think he needs to mark these suppositions better.Even though this is published in 2006, science in human genetics is moving quickly. The knowledge behind the discussion on pages 107-111 of interbreeding with Neanderthals has changed. It now seems likely that interbreeding did occur, and that Neanderthal genes are present in non-African populations, largely in Europe but also ranging into Asia and as far east as Papua New Guinea. For reference see an article in the May 7, 2010 issue of Science by Richard E. Green of UC Santa Cruz. It is significant that Wells did include the extended discussion and indeed he referenced the earlier work on which in part Green's work is based.A small detail of interest to me is the 18th century racial fallacies originating with Carl Linnaeus, that still prejudice current thought. (See my review on Bounce by Matthew Syed for one aspect of this now in the US census.)NOTE: You'll need at least a little science background (biology and anthropology, and some idea about statistics) or this will be hard to follow in spite of a concise introductory background in the book, glossary, etc.I am looking forward to Pandora's Seed the most recent book from Spencer Wells, which seems to have gone off in another direction. From what i can make out this book would be classified as 'deep green', a pleasant surprise."
17,0792262158,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12976478-mike-cook,4,"While this book is nine years old, it explains very well what DNA is and how it is used to trace not only our direct recent ancestors, but the migration of prehistoric humans across the globe. In the back of the book is a list of all haplotypes, both male and female, that were known to exist at the time of printing. Each one is traced geographically from first known emergence to present. Having said that, the facts, as they were known then, may not be the facts that are known now. The Project is still in progress and they have added hundreds of thousands of DNA samples since the book was published, some from totally new locations. It seems that some ""tweeking"" of previously declared ""facts"" would be inevitable as more information became available. I just visited the Project's website and found that recently they have been able to trace the peopling of New Zealand, and have discovered a previously unknown migration from Spain to Central Europe. Reading ""Deep Ancestry"" will give you a good understanding of DNA and how it's being used in genealogy today, and how DNA is being used as a telescope looking into prehistory. In the time before paper and writing and language, the human story is written in our genes."
18,0792262158,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5905953-mike-smith,3,"The style is a bit dry, and the content doesn't seem to add much to Wells's earlier book ""The Journey of Man"", but it still provides a fascinating glimpse into what modern genetics is teaching us about mankind's origins. This book provides early results of a project to unravel the history of human migration around the globe by charting the variations in our DNA. The key to this work is finding populations of indigenous peoples who have been living and, more importantly, reproducing in the same geographic area for thousands of years, and taking genetic samples from them. Wells shows how we all descend from ancestors in Eastern Africa and how at least two major waves of migration tens of thousands of years ago led to all the various peoples of the modern world. One wave gave rise to Australian aborigines, while the other wave produced pretty much everyone else, from Middle Easterns to Europeans to Asians to ancient North and South Americans. For $100 (US), you can order a sample-taking kit and find where you fit in this great human story."
19,0792262158,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3040195-robin,5,"This was a very meaningful book for me the first time I read it, so it was 5 stars for me then. I read it again but was disappointed the second time. I knew much of the information. There were parts I had forgotten, but the essence of the information wasn’t new to me. The second reading was more like 3-4 stars, but I gave it 5 because I loved it so much the first time.As a genealogist, the subject of finding familial relationships via genes is fascinating! It was good to be reminded again about what studying genes can do. As a result, I intend to get into the genographic project again and look at the Ramsthaler/Ramsenthaler connection again."
20,0792262158,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22416979-meg-bortin,5,"Another fascinating look back in time by Spencer Wells, head of the Genographic Project and specialist on deciphering the secrets of human ancestry. While his previous book on the subject, 'The Journey of Man', concentrated on exploring human roots via the Y-chromosome - which women do not share - this one also includes mitochondrial DNA, which is passed along through the female line. Thus we learn much about how the genes of both men and women can reveal our haplogroups, helping to answer the ultimate question: Where do we come from?"
21,0792262158,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4996855-timothy-riley,3,"This was my second introduction to genetics after high school Biology class. Lots of good stuff in here including helpful ""maps"" of haplogroups. I have a basic handle of migrations out of Africa and into Eurasia, coastal Asia and Europe. When there was a wave of modern humans from Africa to Europe there were already Neanderthals there. Some warfare and some interbreeding meant that modern Europeans are on average 2% Neanderthal, who were out-performed and went extinct. This book has to be followed up with other books on human migrations and genetics. "
22,0792262158,http://goodreads.com/user/show/644865-kim,3,"I'm not good at writing reviews of books I like, especially non-fiction ones. With that said, Deep Ancestry lays out an enormous, ongoing scientific project in a way that laypeople can understand. It's a fascinating introduction to the topic of genography, and next on my to-read list is The Seven Daughters of Eve. This book inspired me to participate in the Genographic Project myself, and I now know more about my ancestry than I ever thought possible. I highly recommend this book."

The book filled in many of the gaps in my knowledge of this complex puzzle. The DNA story collapses our many differences our at least puts them in a more scientific context, which I think is a good thing. An illustrated, more atlas-like version with big maps would be helpful."

The combination of these two books is powerful - like the backstory to lots of archeological, anthropological, historic, and linguistic information I've gathered over my life.
