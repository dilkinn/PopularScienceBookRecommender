0,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"This is a remarkably good book, and anyone who's remotely interested in claims that there might be inherent differences in mental function between men and women should read it. It's insightful, carefully researched, well-written and often very funny. And if it doesn't make you change your mind about at least a few things in this area, you are either a remarkably knowledgable person or an incurable bigot.I had read a few books and articles that touched on the subject of inherent gender differences, and I'm afraid I had swallowed them rather uncritically. Without understanding any of the details, I had absorbed the vague idea that science had now established, with the help of modern neuro-imaging techniques, that there were clear differences between male and female brains. Men had stronger spatial and mathematical skills, and women had stronger verbal and emotional skills, and this all dovetailed sensibly with various biological and evolutionary stories.Fine, who works in psychology and appears to know the literature well, demonstrates that this story absolutely fails to stand up to critical examination. The science of gender differences turns out to be very bad science indeed; it seems that everyone has an agenda, and is willing to do whatever it takes to advance it. Researchers carry out poorly designed experiments with inadequate numbers of subjects, and then draw sweeping conclusions from differences which are not even clearly significant. They look at coarse measures of activation in parts of the brain whose functions are still largely unclear and mysteriously deduce general cognitive principles, relying on the fact that few people know how to interpret a brain scan. In surprisingly many cases, they flat-out lie. I am shocked, though I suppose this just shows how naive I am: I have worked for a long time in Artificial Intelligence, a field that is notorious for overhyping its achievements. Somehow, I had thought these people were better than us, but that does not appear to be true.Having read Fine's masterly demolition job, it is tempting to jump to the other extreme and conclude that there are no inherent differences between male and female minds, and that those differences we see are entirely due to social conditioning. I do not think, however, that that would be true to the deeper spirit of the book. Fine, who comes across as an admirable person, is upfront about the fact that no one is neutral in this debate, and she does not even pretend to be neutral herself; this is indeed one of the things which makes her writing so amusing. She shows how researchers, time after time, have made claims about gender differences which in hindsight have turned out to be utterly absurd. The rational response is to be as skeptical as possible about all such claims, and I will pay Fine the compliment of treating her own arguments with the same skepticism. I am indeed convinced by the way she refutes arguments that women are incapable of performing as well as men on a variety of tasks where they have traditionally been supposed inferior. (The section on the notorious spatial rotation task was particularly startling). But there are, all the same, a number of facts which I do not think are obviously explained inside the framework she describes here. With some misgivings, I will outline what they are. To begin, there is the uncontroversial fact that autism and Asperger's Syndrome are far more common in men than in women. I know a fair amount about this from personal experience; my older son is autistic, and I have spent a large part of my life interacting with chessplayers, computer scientists, mathematicians, and other groups where Asperger's types turn out to be common. It is hard to believe that this is coincidential. The highly-focused, obsessive, narrow Asperger's mindset seems to be a natural fit to these occupations, or more exactly to certain ways of approaching these occupations. I would like to make it clear that I am in no way saying that women cannot be chessplayers, mathematicians or computer scientists: I know many women who are world-class in these fields. But there is a way of doing such things which is characteristically Asperger's/autistic, and hence characteristically male. The clearest and most extreme example I can come up with is inventing a new chess opening. There are several hundred accepted chess openings, and, to the best of my knowledge, none of them have been invented by women. Why is this? Obviously, I don't know, but here are some thoughts. Inventing a chess opening is something that requires a great deal of talent and hard work, but there is something more to it than that, which is hard to pin down: the best description I have seen is in Lev Polugaevsky's wonderful book 
Grandmaster Preparation
, which I have read many times. Basically, inventing an opening is not a useful activity in any normal sense of the word. Most strong chessplayers - most World Champions, even - have never invented an opening. It is not likely to make you more successful competitively, since most new openings are soon refuted and fall into disuse; the rational thing to do from this point of view is to use other people's openings. It is not necessarily very creative. The real reward is that it appeals to a kind of stubbornness. The person who invents the opening goes his own way, against the whole world, just to show that he can. Thinking in this way is a kind of madness that is much commoner in men. It is not so much that women can't do it; it is more that hardly any women can see why they would want to do it, which is entirely sensible. But, somehow, society as a whole seems to benefit from the existence of this small group of people who are willfully different, even if the majority of them have wasted their lives without achieving anything. Chess is a richer and more interesting game because there are all these different paths one can take.So Fine hasn't convinced me that men and women really do think alike at the deepest level; I believe it will be a long time before we understand what's going on there. But she has convinced me that the facile arguments about brain scans proving that women are inherently wired to read emotions but not to understand calculus are utter crap. If you haven't already done so, check out this book._________________________________[Postscript, about a year and a half later]I'm glad to say that I might have been wrong about women and chess openings. Looking at Bologan's book on the Chebanenko Slav, it certainly seems like there's a case for a Stefanova Variation; it goes 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 a6 5. a4 e6 6. Bg5 and now Stefanova's trademark reply is 6... a5!?, reaching the following position:Bologan thinks it may be the best move and explicitly mentions former Women's World Champion Antoaneta Stefanova as the person who's done most to help make it respectable; indeed, a quick look at the Chessbase online game database shows that she's defended this position eight times, drawing seven and winning one. One of her opponents was Beliavsky, a previous top 10 player and still very strong.Go Stefanova! Surely others will follow where she has led?_________________________________[Update, Apr 20 2015]Former World Championship finalist Nigel Short enters the debate: more details here.Despite the fact that my lifetime score against Grandmaster Short is 2-0 in my favor, I would like to make it clear that I in no way consider myself more intelligent than he is. Statistics can be very misleading when taken out of context._________________________________[Update, May 30 2015]The Chessbase site today posted another piece on gender differences in chess and academia, ""Women in chess: the role of innate-ability beliefs"" by Wei Ji Ma. Although the paper is interesting and makes some excellent points, I'm struck by the way the participants in this debate seem to be talking past each other. Ma says early on that... the available statistical evidence indicates that gender differences in achievement are largely or entirely due to differences in participation. But this is exactly what the Howard study quoted by Short claims is not true.I think we need more actual data here. It would be particularly interesting to see the Howard analysis repeated with proper attention paid to obvious sources of bias introduced by the fact that women play disproportionately often against other women._________________________________[Update, Feb 2 2016]Nigel Short, whose comments about women and chess have been widely circulated, lost earlier this week to Harika Dronavalli, India, in the third round of the Gibraltar Masters. Despite the fact that GM Harika thoroughly outplayed him and won a good game as Black, it would be premature to draw any sweeping conclusions from a single result._________________________________[Update, Apr 15 2017]Hou Yifan, the highest rated woman player in the world, posted a disappointing loss against Vassily Ivanchuk in their recent match. But today she came back strong in the first round of the GRENKE Classic and destroyed Fabiano Caruana, who's currently World #4. She then followed up by beating Meier, a normally very solid German grandmaster, and drawing with World Champion Carlsen.Go Hou!_________________________________[Update, Apr 19 2017]From a recent interview with chess legend Alexander Morozevich:Between a man and a woman there are differences, and significant ones, but we’re all, first and foremost, people. Can I, simply looking at the notation of a game, say that it was played by a woman? I tried it a couple of times and I didn’t manage – there are no clear differences. In the results, meanwhile, there are differences, and only a few women have so far been capable of playing on the level of the men’s Top 100, and I don’t fully understand why that’s the case. In other intellectual games the proportions are more or less the same, with the very top occupied by men. It would be interesting to do research on that topic. Women in chess have one undoubted advantage: they can play in men’s tournaments, while we can’t play in women’s. I once asked a FIDE official: “Why is there such an injustice?” His answer surpassed all my expectations: “You understand, there’s a World Championship for women and a World Championship for people”._________________________________[Update, Aug 2 2017]Hou Yifan just won the Biel Grandmaster tournament, ahead of a field that included a former world champion, a former world championship challenger, and three other players currently in the world top 40. Details here.Nice going, Hou!"
1,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"Didn't realise Cordelia was Australian - This is a lovely video of her views: http://fora.tv/2010/10/02/Cordelia_Fi...Let’s say you have read a couple of books on the ‘science’ that ‘explains’ the differences between the sexes. So, just what are you likely to have been told? Well, one thing would be that men have brains that are built to be more logical and mathematical than women’s brains (this is due to men’s better spatial rotational abilities that are a consequence of right brain localisation) and that this helps to explain why men end up in most of the high status jobs like Engineering or Science, just as their greater aggression ensures they end up President or CEO. But that this comes at a cost – men tend to be more socially dysfunctional – a consequence of their limited ability to use their somewhat larger brains ‘laterally’. This hinders them in their linguistic abilities, men being simply not as fluent as women. But this is okay, because it is women who need to be able to look after kids and do the house work – something how their brains are ordered allows them to specialise in (you know, ‘Darling, did you see where I left my car keys?’). So while men are off hunting and thereby using their aggression to bring home the bacon, women are pacifying the kids with their delightful socialising skills so suited to recognising the emotional needs of others and cleaning the cave. These are the tasks the sexes have separately evolved to perform and while these may not have been the brains we would have chosen for the sexes ourselves so as to make the world more fair – well, look, the world simply isn’t fair. There’s no point getting all PC about this. If evolution and biology have decided that half of the population need to be ‘caring’ rather than ‘logical’, well, all I can say is, ‘poor dears’ – there is about as much point in complaining about women’s innate difference (inferiority is such an ugly word) as complaining that fish are forced to live out their lives in water. Viva la difference.Such ideas (essentially modern day eugenics) are not only peddled by authors of limited intelligence trying to make a quick buck from the enhanced sales such sexist rubbish ensures for their books with titles like Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus or Why Men Don't Have a Clue and Women Always Need More Shoes – but even by people with impressive sounding qualifications who write books called The Female Brain or The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature.Like I said, if you have read some of these books you will either be feeling rather smug at the moment (as if the benefits of having a penis weren’t already ample) or rather annoyed. It can’t be nice for one half of our population to be told they are innately lesser people. But is that really what the latest science does tell us about the differences between male and female brains? Actually, the truth may well surprise you.Recently I wrote on one of Choupette’s reviews that I would love to find a book that explained just how the latest brain imaging technology works. I mean, the idea we have been encouraged to have is that it is all a bit like a video game, or rather a direct window into the brain. No, bugger the brain, a direct window into the mind as it is being constructed by the brain. You lie back in an incredibly expensive piece of machinery (and as the author says, one that uses quantum mechanics for god sake – but she could just as easily have said, and I think even more impressively, that uses anti-matter!) and they get you to think of something or other (solve a maths problem perhaps) and then blobs light up on the parts of your brain that are doing the thinking. How much more proof do you need than that? Thought equals blob equals male superiority. QEDNo one explains that this isn’t quite ‘real time’ imaging. No one explains that this is averaged difference. No one explains that we don’t really know what to make of these averaged differences, at what level these differences become significant, for example. No one explains that when the brains of dead salmon have been tested sometimes they have shown ‘significant’ emotional responses to visual stimuli. All we get to see are the blobs of colour lighting up – and we assume someone smarter than us has worked out that those blobs mean something significant.You might have been lead to believe that they have done these tests and seen the blobs lighting up and they (by they I mean the guys in white) have seen more blobs firing away in the touchy-feely side of women’s brains and at the same time and with the same stimuli more blobs lighting up in the hard-edged logical sides of men’s brains – so everything still holds true – right? Well, it’s not quite as simply as that. When the author set out to follow up on some of the research that leads to the million sale books of neurosexism mentioned earlier, sometimes that research was found to be somewhat lacking. Did you know that the much quoted (and much relied on) ‘fact’ that women are better able to use both sides of their brain for tasks due to their much more extensive corpus callosum was actually based on research on only fourteen brains and besides which the result from this research (upon which so many sexist assumptions have been based) didn’t even reach statistical significance? The thing that this book shows time and again is just how much edifice can be built on incredibly shaky foundations. Sometimes it shows no foundations at all.Her demolition of just a small section of The Female Brain is worth the price of the book. Surely the fraudulent behaviour of the author of The Female Brain ought to disqualify her for life from being able to write another book – but I see that despite a review in Nature after her first book was printed pointing out the remarkable (in fact, incomprehensible and gobsmacking) weaknesses and down-right misinformation in that book, she was able to publish another on much the same topic called The Male Brain. I cannot begin to tell you how outraged I am about this. Quite simply such work is lying and there should be an appropriate punishment.This book contains a long section on what is becoming a particularly fascinating area of research for me – called stereotype threat. This is detailed in Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions, and I spent the first half of the year reading many of the research papers she discusses here – if I’d read this book at the start of the year, it would have made my life so much easier. Stereotype threat is the remarkable situation where you can take a group of Asian women and prime half of them to think of themselves as women and the other half to think of themselves as Asian and given our stereotypes of both groups, they will perform either better or worse on a maths test depending on how they have been primed. And the more subtle the priming, the more effective the result will be. Merely getting women to tick a box on an exam paper stating whether they are male or female is enough to reduce their potential score.There is a pervasive belief, particularly among middleclass parents, that they already have tried to bring their kids up in a way that is ‘gender neutral’ and it simply hasn’t worked. The only explanation left is that biology ‘will out in the end’ and we should just get used to the idea that gender differences are innate. This book makes a remarkably strong case for the fact that our society is so ‘gendered’ it is simply impossible for anyone to bring up their children in a ‘gender neutral’ way and that really, no one tries. It is like we have ‘half changed our minds’ as she says repeatedly – our conscious minds tell us sexism is wrong, but our actions repeatedly confirm sexism. From before we are born we are constructed as male or female (mothers who are told the sex of their child before it is born imagine boys kick inside them more vigorously than mothers of boys who have not been told the sex of their unborn child). Pinker may joke that only childless people believe in the social construction of gender – but I think it is very hard to argue that gender is not the most reinforced division in human societies.This book is quite simply a must read. There is a remarkable example in the book – a kind of Tiresias moment (Tiresias being a Greek turned into a woman for seven years to settle a bet between the gods) - where a female lawyer undergoes a sex change operation and overhears someone say that he has proven to be much smarter than his sister.I know, I’m always telling you to do this, but do read this book. And if you do remember it is very important to read the notes as you go. For some reason Cordelia Fine has put all of the very best and most interesting information in the book (particularly in the first ten chapters or so) in the end notes."
2,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1199525-cecily,2,"A detailed but informal look at the pervasive power of gender stereotypes, backed by science. Sounds good, doesn't it? Not for me, though. My reading of this included International Women's Day; that wasn't intentional, but it felt like undeserved penance for such a day. The 2* rating indicates how interesting and enjoyable this book was for me. Were I rating in purely objective terms, it would be a solid 3* (maybe even 4*, given the importance of the intended message).In a NutshellFine debunks the deterministic views of gender that are often based on brain structure and organisation. She seems to believe there are NO innate differences between the sexes, which is a bit of a stretch to me. However, she clearly shows the impossibility of investigating possible brain differences without overestimating the multiple, and often subtle, effects of culture. You can't raise or measure children in a societal vacuum. She ridicules poorly designed experiments that assume too much from too little, but presents less in her own defence. It was better at giving concrete examples of how research can be misinterpreted (examples below) than it was at revealing anything much about gender.Problems I had with This Book* It doesn't know what it is: it's too self-consciously jokey for a serious text, but with 100 (of ~350) pages being notes, bibliography and index, it's more thorough than one expects in pop-sci. The jovial tone makes it a quick casual read, but the exhaustive references would be more suited to following up with one's own investigation.* It is painfully repetitive. Fine makes good and important points, but she makes the sames ones again and again and again. I've summarised them below.* Fine is angry about bad and misinterpreted research. Such things need pointing out, but sometimes she picks very easy targets (papers by 18th century doctors, for instance), or lays into one or two individuals at excessive length - principally Simon Baron-Cohen and Louann Brizendine. * Conversely, she is utterly sure of her own rightness, even when using anecdotal cases, rather than proper studies to back up her points. She criticises others for lazy stereotyping and in the next sentence suggests that men are not so keen on attending male-dominated conferences because there's less opportunity for sex. I am left unsure how much I trust her or those she criticises. The important points she makes got lost in the haze of my mounting irritation. * It is narrowly about male/female gender roles, rather than the broad spectrum of gender identity, which is what I am more interested in. However, that's a fault of my expectations, rather than the book itself.* I don't feel I learned much. I read plenty of examples of experiments and studies and how to judge their validity, but people like Ben Goldacre have long covered that ground very well. The gender angle was the context of the debunking, but largely confirmed what I already believed. Key MessagesMost of these are probably familiar to the sort of people who read a book like this:* Stereotypes: they're pervasive and powerful. Even more so than you think. They start before birth and imbue our life, as self-fulfilling prophesies, however much we try to go against them. Even pre-schoolers extrapolate beyond what they've been told, seeing pointy shapes as inherently more masculine than more rounded ones (like the bouba/kiki effect often used in synaesthesia studies: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouba/ki...). Gender matters to them, because it's the main social grouping they have, other than adult/child (no geeks, sporty types, arty divisions yet). * Context is all. This applies to most things in life (a crucial consideration in angry online grammar debates!). Where gender is concerned, if we prime people to think of gender (e.g. a maths exam that has a M/F tick box), people are more likely to conform strongly to gendered expectations.* Neuroplasticity: very little behaviour is ""hard-wired"" in our brains. Even if something is typical, that doesn't mean it's necessary or inevitable.* Look carefully at psychology research:  ** Is it testing what it claims to test? Comparisons based on different levels of foetal testosterone use a variety of proxies, of dubious accuracy (the amount found in amniotic fluid, mother's blood, baby's digit length). ** Is there unconscious bias or knowledge in the testers? If testers know the sex of a baby (as they usually will), that may skew how they interact. ** Are the results borne out by the numbers? Just under 50% of women have what Baron-Cohen classes as a female brain.  ** Are the assumptions fallacious? When testing toy choice, are the toys really gendered the way the testers assume? Why is a pan ""feminine"" to a monkey? ** Reporting bias: it's more interesting to report a difference. Studies that fail to find one may not be published. ** Various sorts of brain imaging are sexy.They use expensive equipment to produce scientific pictures. But they don't necessarily show what we think they do.  ** Beware of using biology as a fall-back explanation.If a little girl loves pink despite her parents' best efforts to the contrary, surely huge marketing hype and peer pressure are at least as much of a factor as hormones? As for the mother who couldn't understand why her daughter swaddled, cuddled and put to bed her toy hammer - perhaps the reason was that it was always her mother, and never her father, that put her to bed.* Gender-neutral parenting is almost impossible to achieve. Yet until a century ago, it was normal for all under-5s to be dressed similarly (white dresses), and when colours became common, it was strong red or pink for boys and pretty blue for girls. When we read picture books, we tend to use male pronouns for all the unspecified characters, human or animal. Female leads are remarkably rare in junior fiction (none in 42 Dr Seuss!), but although there are occasional tomboys, you never get a ""sissy"" boy.* There's a glass ceiling for ambitious women, and a glass escalator for men in traditionally female-dominated jobs.* Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar: ""When are a few dirty cups a symbol of the exertion of male privilege, and when are they merely unwashed dishes?""* ""Having it all never meant doing it all."" Gloria Steinem.* Men aren't from Mars and women aren't from Venus. We're probably all from the moon.SmilesSome have enjoyed the humour of this. It certainly raised a couple of smiles for me, but most of the witty asides struck me as rather sarcastic, or just cheap uses of the sort of stereotypes she purports to hate. For instance, when pointing out that the widespread use of strip clubs in corporate hospitality excludes women from important networking, she weakens her outrage imo, by suggesting that female colleagues fake a headache and stay home.I want to end on a positive note, so here are the two best ones:* In a passage explaining that after about 7, children tend to become slightly more flexible in their thinking about gender, she adds that those who don't, end up with successful careers writing books based on rigid gender stereotypes - with a footnote! The footnote says, ""This is a joke, rather than a scientific fact."" Yep, that really was the second-best one, imo.* Following on from caveats about over-reliance on neuroimaging, Fine cites an empathy study... performed on salmon... that were dead. It produced pretty pictures of brain activity, though!See Also•	Bongiovanni and Jimerson's A Quick & Easy Guide to They/Them Pronouns, which I reviewed HERE. It’s a comic book that is mainly about non-binary and genderfluid people who don’t identify fully and consistently as either male or female, so prefer non-gendered nouns and pronouns. •	Sally Hines' Is Gender Fluid?, which I reviewed HERE. It also has a very youthful, funky format, though not comic book.•	Alex Iantaffi and Meg-John Barker’s Life Isn’t Binary, which I reviewed HERE. It starts with sexualities and genders, but goes on to relationships, bodies, emotions, and thinking. Barker likes “they” because “I experience myself as pretty plural”.•	Robert Webb's autobiography, How Not to be a Boy, which I reviewed HERE. He cites this book as an influence on his ideas about gender preferences not being innate."

Because it is hilarious. And fascinating. Cordelia Fine goes through all the old lines that I'm sure you've heard a thousand times (I know I have): that men's brains are just better at building stuff and making money while women are just natural nurturers, they just want to nurture the shit out of everything, because FEELINGS. Anyways, she takes a closer look at all these claims and experiments and disputes just about every one of them with scientific criticism. And she does it in a way that is sarcastic and witty and readable and interesting. This book mainly focuses on white, middle- to upper-class gender construction and brain research, which makes sense, because most claims about brain sex differences are based on middle- to upper-class white folks. It would be interesting, however, if she wrote a sequel with a wider focus. And occasionally the scientific terms get a tad bit overwhelming, but if you want a readable academic book about neurosexism, you aren't going to find a better, more interesting, more readable book.This book should be on the bestseller list. Everyone should read this. This should be in the waiting room of every maternity ward and in the break room of every public school. I am so glad that I stumbled across this gem of a book, and I can't recommend it highly enough. It's funny and substantive, and that is about the rarest a combination there is."

5,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/211278-simon,5,"Truly a brilliant book. (And laugh-out-loud funny in quite a few places.) It's a book so full of interesting information, it's very tempting to write a review in which one relates one's favorite experiments, factoids, or statistics. But I will (mostly) resist. What I'd like to highlight are two features.We have all heard (and perhaps told) stories like the following. ""I wanted to bring up my children in a gender-neutral way, but at a certain point, the boy naturally took to smashing up trucks and the girl naturally took to worshipping pink princess paraphernalia. So I guess these things must be innate after all."" This phenomenon is known to sociologists as the ""biology as fallback"" position. In one particularly grating and smug riff on this theme, Steven Pinker is quoted as saying: ""there is a technical term for people who believe that little boys and little girls are born indistinguishable and are molded into their natures by parental socialization. The term is 'childless'."" And Fine goes on to comment: ""The frustration of the naively nonsexist parent has become a staple joke. An all but obligatory paragraph in contemporary books and articles about hardwired gender differences gleefully describes a parent's valiant, but always comically hopeless, attempts at gender-neutral parenting"" (190-1). But then Fine tells us about the Bems, psychologists who, in the 1970s, decided to try gender-neutral parenting seriously. And what a lot it involved. They would doctor all their children’s books, whiting out beards, lengthening hair, and adding breasts to some of the illustrations (no doubt to rectify the fact that in the illustrations of children’s books, even today, males are represented at a ratio of 2:1 relative to females – oops, a factoid just slipped out!), “deleting or altering sections of the text that described females or males in a sex-stereotyped manner” (215), and so on. They also taught their children only to allocate people to a gender on the basis of their anatomy and reproductive functions. (In an amusing story, the 4 year old son decided to wear barrettes in his hair to kindergarten. He tried to correct his classmate’s misconception by saying that he wasn’t a girl because he had a penis, not a vagina. The other boy retorted “Everyone has a penis, but only girls wear barrettes.”)As Fine points out, the moral of this story is not to elicit admiration (or contempt) for the Bems, but to illustrate just how hard it is to raise a child in a gender-neutral way. The best efforts of the comically frustrated liberal parents who find their kids acting according to stereotype do not show that differences in gender behavior are innate. As Fine describes, gendering of children is ubiquitous in the culture, and intense to an almost unimaginable degree. Not even the Bem children could avoid it altogether. And children are acutely sensitive to the multiple instructions they receive, in the very air they breathe, about how to conform to their genders. (Children randomly assigned at preschool to a ‘red’ group or a ‘blue’ group, and wearing the appropriate colored T-shirts to school each day, after three weeks, with no further reinforcement, will find themselves conforming to what they take to be the norms for their respective groups. One needs little imagination to see how much more intrusive the pressures on gender conformity will be, even if the parents are like the Bems.)This brings me to the second point I want to emphasize. A host of brain researchers now present themselves as radical iconoclasts because they claim that the evidence of fMRIs, etc. prove that there are innate differences between male and female brains, forcing them to buck the prevailing norms of political correctness, in the starry-eyed gender-neutral utopias of which they would so much love to believe. Boo hoo! As Fine’s book makes amply clear, science has always alighted on the newest thing – brain size, spinal chord strength, nerve fragility, energy-sapping ovaries – to show why gender inequalities (that always accord greater status and power to men) are natural. Seen in this light, fMRIs are just the latest fad. Of course, that doesn’t prove that the claims made about what they show are false. Fine has plenty more to say about how shoddy a lot of the research is, how biased the interpretations of it, and so on. But this history is certainly salient enough that anyone presenting themselves as providing scientific evidence for gender differences in psychology and behavior risks looking somewhat ridiculous. And it places a burden on such researchers to be doubly careful about extrapolating from their results. This is even more true in light of the fact that the existence of the claims made for what brain scans show itself influences how well people perform. In tests, women do less well at male-stereotypical tasks when asked to read some ‘scientific’ claims about women’s innate inferiority in such tasks than if asked to read something else first. These irresponsible and popular interpretations of neurological evidence (neuro-bollocks as they have been called) do not just support the status quo; they reinforce it.Fine’s book packs a huge punch. In a funny and easy-to-read way, she explodes so much neuro-bollocks, she ought to get a prize for it."

I would probably have enough money to buy a new Kindle. As a male who loves books and aims for a career in clinical/counseling psychology - a more and more female-dominated field - part of me has always wondered whether I just lack the typical ""male"" brain. Are girls biologically geared toward the humanities and males toward the hard sciences? Do women really empathize more than men because of their brain chemistry?Cordelia Fine offers a clear answer: no. In Delusions of Gender, she unravels the myth that we can chalk up gender differences to our neurology. With a keen and unrelenting eye, she examines scientific theories and misconceptions, like the role testosterone plays in the fetus. She dedicates a large portion of the book to knocking down neurosexism. In recent years several individuals have boasted about experiments that use fMRI and PET scans to detect differences in the brain; Fine makes sure to reveal the flaws associated with those studies and why we should be skeptical of the conclusions they espouse.Instead of relying on faulty science, Fine approaches gender differences from a psychological and sociological perspective. As a psychology major, I loved her incorporation of self-fulfilling prophecy and stereotype threat, such as including a study about how women who had to check a gender box (either ""male"" or ""female"") performed worse on an exam than women who took the test without marking their gender. The section about gender-neutral parenting stood out to me too. It's not enough to just offer our children toys stereotypically associated with the opposing gender, especially when gender distinctions arise so soon.Highly recommended for those interested in feminism, neuroscience, psychology, or gender studies. In contemporary society we often cling to claims made by people with scientific backgrounds, even though some of those claims have no legitimate support. I didn't go into too much depth about all of Fine's arguments in this review, but she invested a laudable amount of effort into Delusions of Gender: the book has about 100 pages of citations, and her writing conveys her passion as well."
7,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072582-kaethe-douglas,5,"Let me boil the book down for the busy reader: whenever someone* chooses to ignore all the documented evidence of discrimination in favor of just-so stories about biology, in order to keep right on discriminating, you can take their evidence as having all the validity of the presenter's good intentions to end discrimination.Sorry, that was a long and awkward summation. In justice to the book, I'd prefer to be pithy, funny, and understandable. Fine has tackled an immense and largely thankless task. First, she's read all those awful gender-essentialist pop psych books**, for which she should receive medals, cookies, and probably hazard pay. Next, she's actually gone through all the books and articles making claims about how neurobiology is gender destiny. That task involved a lot of the work of Simon Baron-Cohen, who among other things publishes on autism in a sexist and really annoying way. Then she went through the references of these many works and actually looked at the studies, to show where they were bad, and more often, where they just plain don't say what the authors claim they do. Finally, she puts it all together, along with research from many other areas, in a way that is dryly amusing, occasionally snarky, but I think probably very clear even for those who don't read medical journals for work.***A sample which amused me:So let us, with healthy skepticism, summarize all of this as clearly as we can. Nonexistent sex differences in language lateralization, mediated by nonexistent sex differences in corpus callosum structure, are widely believed to explain nonexistent sex differences in language skills.Confused?We've only just begun. It's brilliant and authoritative and she loathes bad science reporting just as much as I do, so of course I love it. But I recommend it to others who might be curious about the topic, as well as those who enjoy seeing bad science thoroughly mocked.*Lawrence Sumner, for example**Men Can't Be Bothered to Be Nice, Women Can't be Taught to Be Smart and the like.***I do, so I'm just guessing what the non-scientist would think.Library copy. Israeli study shows that blinding math tests lowers boys' grades and raises girls', just as blinded auditions changed orchestras.Just to be clear: It is not possible to find biological determinants of gender, because gender is learned social behavior, and, as such, varies significantly between social groups and over time."
8,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22591633-zanna,5,"I really think all educators need to read this book. Fine's target is the new gender essentialism, the reconstructed sexism that attempts to put women back in their traditional roles as 'unbenders of husbands' brows' and caregivers to children, and to keep them out of politics, mathematics and the sciences, by asserting that they are fitted for their place by essential female abilities and incapacities. In 1869 the philosopher John Stuart Mill, in his book The Subjection of Women, was severe on this fallacy, but like a zombie it just keeps getting up, backed by the bad-science fad of the day. 'Neurosexists' are advising school-leaders to adjust their teaching for gender differences, and with the threat of 'empathy-based math' looming Fine felt she must call a halt. She selects some choice quotes to show us how little the new sexism differs from the old (this is a very funny book), then proceeds to dismantle it with a three-pronged attack.First, she explores the construction of gender and explains aspects of the present inequality from her perspective in social psychology. She quotes trans woman Jan Morris who describes her former competence in matters of car-reversing and bottle-opening evaporating after her transition in the face of others' assumptions about her. The power of stereotyping is not to be ignored; Fine quotes study after study to show how strongly most people, whether consciously or not, associate women with empathy and caregiving, and men with maths, science and power, and how priming gender affects subsequent thinking and performance. Simply reminding a candidate that she is a woman drastically reduces her score on a maths test, demonstrating an effect called 'stereotype threat' which is amazingly easy to remove - including an introduction to a test telling participants that 'in ten years of data-gathering, no gender-related performance difference has been found' dramatically boosts the performance of women and girls. Cross-cultural comparisons also prove instructive, making nonsense of ethnocentric gender assumptions.Fine explores how stereotypes and the lack of role models work against women in the workplace and in education. This section is more broadly relevant to racial, social class, disabled, LGBTQ etc representation and the double bind problem of administrators appointing people like themselves on one side, and aspirations being damped by the invisibility of marginalised groups on the other. CVs with female names are rated lower and receive fewer responses than identical ones with male names. Fine also indicts sexist work practices such as entertaining clients in strip-clubs. Stereotypes also operate in the home, where men are conditioned to believe themselves incompetent (the hunter brings home the the carcass and collapses to stare into the fire) unless jar-opening brawn or plug-wiring brains are required. Fine demonstrates that men are very competent parents. Even rat-dads, with no hormone-tampering, are readily able to raise perfectly adjusted rat-kids.Surveying the data, Fine finds very scant evidence for the assumption that women are more empathic than men; there is no magical female ability to read people's thoughts, and slight differences in young children could easily be due to parents talking more to infant girls. The evidence for male superiority in mathematical/analytical tasks is also thin, restricted to performance at mentally rotating 3D objects. Even this could be due to more exposure to active toys, and in any case hardly constitutes an excuse to exclude women from the workplace. Fine is hilarious when exposing the loaded survey questions that have been used to find gender differences. Research makes it very clear that people will rate themselves higher or lower on abilities stereotyped to or against their gender, especially when that aspect of their identity has been primed. The search for gender-determined ability differences continues with a painstaking survey and critique of the popular literature enthusiastically claiming they exist and the neurological and psychological research which has supposedly found them. Fine is incisive in her discussion and criticism of studies around the effect of testosterone, including play differences, but she is damning when it comes to the shocking dishonesty and misrepresentation employed by 'neurosexist' popular 'science' books. Oh, and if you don't manage to read this book, please take it from me here and now, that anyone trying to persuade you of a gender difference on the basis of pictures from brain scans is to be scornfully ignored.The final section deals with how children are socialised to perform gender. Many parents assume they are providing gender-neutral parenting and 'fall back' on a biological explanation when their little girls demand pink dresses and dolls. Fine shows just how far parents have to go to eliminate the pressure to perform gender by recording the hilarious experience of the Bem family, forced to such lengths as denying that they knew the gender of friends, and erasing beards from picture books. How can a preference for pink be genetic? In Victorian times, it was a male colour, while girls wore tranquil Virgin-Mary blue. Fine demonstrates with survey after survey and study after brilliant study that gender roles are pushed on us by our culture, not our chromosomes.'As neurophysiologist Ruth Bleier put it over two decades ago, we should ""view biology as potential, as capacity and not as static identity. Biology itself is socially influenced and defined; it changes and develops in interaction with and in response to our minds and environment, as our behaviours do. Biology can be said to define possibilities but not determine them; it is never irrelevant but it is also not determinant""'"
9,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/971451-marshall,2,"This nature vs. nurture debate is getting old.This book argues against the claim that women and men have different brains and that this difference causes women to be significantly better or worse at some things and men significantly better or worse at others. As far as I knew, few legitimate scientists today make this claim, which is clearly sexist and would justify discrimination, so I was pretty surprised and somewhat skeptical to discover this immense sexist contingent among brain scientists and psychologists, some of whom are women. I've heard of some of them. Steven and Susan Pinker were clearly misrepresented. Others, such John Gray, aren't even scientists.This book spends most of its pages presenting psychological studies showing that people are suggestible, that messages from the culture can influence one's confidence and feeling of belonging, even their very identity and personality, and that this can impact their abilities to perform or their interest in a subject. All this does is show that society can influence people, not that brain differences can't.Many of the studies in this book seem legitimate and factual. Some of it was pretty persuasive and really made me think. But the presentation of these studies often seemed to exaggerate them. For example, after discussing subtle ways social cues and whether one feels they belong can influence people to prefer and perform differently, all very reasonable, the book concludes: ""A few words to the effect that a Y chromosome will serve in your favor, or a sprucing up of the interior design, is all that it takes to bring about surprisingly substantial changes in career interest. Having seen what effect on career interests a simple, brief manipulation in the lab can have, one can't help but wonder at the cumulative influence of that giant, inescapable social psychology lab known as life.""Wait, so there were some findings of subtle influence in a lab, and so the book's conclusion, based only on ""one can't help but wonder"" is that only ""a few words"" is ""all it takes"" for ""substantial changes in career interest"" in life? That's a huge exaggeration of the findings. It's also pure speculation based on ideology, not facts based on evidence. Actually, it seems pretty sexist to claim that women are so flimsy and suggestible. It sounds suspiciously like the ""delicate flower"" argument of traditionalists. Be careful what you say to girls, lest you crush their fragile little spirits! I know it would take a hell of a lot more than ""a few words"" to talk me out of my dreams.Here's another gem: ""This anecdote suggests a workplace environment that tolerates a deep disrespect for women."" Mmm, anecodotes suggesting deep things. Now there's some seriously rigorous research.Sometimes she's clearly reaching. Like when she talks about a study that found gender differences in babies who are only one day old. She claims this study was flawed because there could have been some socialization that happened in that one day since their birth.An argument this book uses over and over again is: scientists were wrong before. I can almost hear ""neener neener"" behind the words. So what? Scientists are wrong all the time. That's how science works. Being wrong isn't cause for dismissal in science. That's what ideology does. Being wrong in the past does not imply claims in the present are false. This is called the continuum fallacy, and it's usually employed by pseudoscience cranks like creationists and global warming deniers.Consider the facts that are not in dispute. We know that humans are a sexually dimorphic species. Men and women are physically different. They have different reproductive systems and different physical proportions. We know that sexual selection is a part of the evolutionary process, and we know that males and females have had vastly different selective pressures, which have manifested as different mating behaviors in all other dimorphic species.So this theory that all of gender psychology is socialized is extremely tenuous. It does not square with what we know about evolution. All that is required to falsify it is evidence of only one difference. It only takes evidence of one innate psychological difference between men and women to prove that there is at least SOME difference. Once that is established, then it's only a question of which differences are genetic and how significant they are.Since that is all that is required, and since this theory is based more on presuppositions from feminist ideology than evidence-based, the easiest way to disprove it is to offer one piece of evidence that coincides with mainstream feminist ideology, so they cannot possibly dispute it. I will do that now:Most psychologists now agree that sexual preference is, at least in part, an innate psychological characteristic. Homosexuality is innate in some individuals. For the rest of us, men are innately attracted to women and women are innately attracted to men. On average, there is a vast difference between men and women as to which gender they find sexually appealing. You cannot socialize children to be gay, so there is no reason to deny gays the right to marry, and it's abusive to try to socialize young homosexuals to be heterosexual. This is a position most feminists take very strongly, and it's clearly an innate psychological difference between men and women.The exception is lesbian feminism. This is the position that sexual orientation is socialized, and that lesbianism is a choice and therefore a legitimate political act. However, this form of feminism is extremely contentious within the movement, as it opens the door for homophobia.Oh, and then you have difference feminism, complete with their own quack psychologists such as Carol Gilligan who claim that, yes, there are innate differences between men and women, but that women's ""way of knowing"" is superior to men's. I wonder why this wasn't one of those sexist psychologists, with talk of brain differences between men and women, to be debunked in this book. Strange, that. It seems fallacious gender research gets a free pass as long as it's sexist in the right direction. Indeed, this book seems to be on board with difference feminism in the chapter, ""Backwards and in High Heels"" (i.e. everything a man can do, a woman can do better, in spite of all society does to limit her, that's how bad ass she is.)This isn't science. It's reasoning based on what's politically expedient and expecting reality to conform to that. If there are innate differences, then she should just say so and stop equivocating. Then we can get on to the more interesting discussion of how much difference is innate, and how significant those differences are. It may very well turn out that women are superior to men, but they can't simultaneously be better and the same.The sad thing is, this book is very interesting and insightful in so many other ways, in outlining some ways human behavior is socialized. It could very easily have been a valuable part of that discussion. Why can't that be enough? The intellectually honest position would have been to admit that there is much we still don't understand about human psychology, and the evidence so far seems to indicate that there is at least some difference between the psychology of men and women, but that it is the belief of the author that these differences are not hugely significant, and that socialization also plays a major role. If that's all she did, I'd have trusted this book so much more. As it stands, I find myself dubious even of claims that sound reasonable.Advice for the author: check your ideology at the door and let the evidence speak for itself, rather than trying to exaggerate or stretch it to fit into your worldview. Oh, and knock off all the outrage. How you feel about what scientists discover has no bearing on the merit of their research. It only discredits your presentation of it by making readers suspicious of confirmation bias and emotional reasoning. It feels less like science and more like propaganda. At best, it is merely distracting.If you like this book, please read The Blank Slate. It will show you a completely different side of this issue."
10,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1910836-lobstergirl,4,"Cordelia Fine, a psychologist, decided to write this book after discovering her son's kindergarten teacher ""reading a book that claimed his brain was incapable of forging the connection between emotion and language.""The first section of the book was slow reading for me. Fine engages in occasional snark, which was a little tiresome, followed by a lot of discussion of studies in which subjects are either told or not told statements about gender and then asked to perform certain tasks, to see if a focus on gender impairs their abilities. For example, one group of girls is told that boys do better than girls on math tests, and that scientists believe this difference is innate. Another group is told that boys and girls perform the same on math tests. Both groups then take a math test. The girls in the second group perform better. Once through this psychological study-filled section and a glimpse back into our anti-feminist past and our female-executives-who-still-do-most-of-the-housework present (which, in fairness, will be necessary reading for some), Fine moves on to the field of neuroscience. She debunks the notion of the brain's ""hardwired[ness],"" a concept borrowed from computer science, which ""translate[s] poorly to the domain of neural circuits that change and learn throughout life,"" constantly adapting to a person's environment and experiences. In addition to the really bad popular literature on gender difference (see John Gray, and Louann Brizendine's The Female Brain), which she analyzes, there's a lot of really bad science. Poorly conducted studies with flawed methodologies, too-small studies, confusion of correlation with causation. Some scientists have been known to extrapolate conclusions that their own studies did not determine. Shockingly, the media often compound the problem with poor reporting and cluelessness about junk science. Then, there's the kind of important issue that studies which fail to find gender differences tend not to get published, while the minority that do, do.I personally was quite alarmed at the quantity and quality of conclusions being drawn from brain scans, where it seems like the technology has outpaced researchers' ability to understand it in any truly meaningful way. Chapters 12-13 address real vs. spurious results in brain imaging, the limitations of culling insights into psychological function from brain imaging, and the risks of ""reverse inference,"" e.g., ""the amygdala was activated so that means our participants were fearful."" Fine argues that gender is one of the first lenses through which babies and toddlers learn to view the world and discriminate among different choices. Once they know what gender they belong to, their ideas about it and their choices become more fixed. At 17 months, boys and girls in one study were equally interested in playing with dolls, tea sets, brushes, combs, and blocks; four months later girls had increased their doll play while boys had decreased it. Belonging to a group - such as a gender group - is a powerful motivator to stay within that group and adhere to its norms. ""Four year old children will play for three times as long with a xylophone or balloon if it is labeled as being for their own sex rather than for children of the other sex,"" notes Fine. Gender norms are reinforced all around the child: none of Dr. Seuss's 42 books has a female lead in its central story; a study of 41 Caldecott winners and runners-up from 1984 to 1994 ""found that female characters were most commonly described as beautiful, frightened, worthy, sweet, weak, and scared, while male characters were big, horrible, fierce, great, terrible, furious, brave, and proud.""Even where parents make efforts toward gender-neutral parenting, peer influence is unavoidable, and a child's peers are often the most constant reinforcer of gender boundaries. A boy who chose to wear barrettes to school was reminded by other children that barrettes are for girls. A study of preschoolers found that boys who wouldn't play with dolls at school would play with them at home, where the peer group wasn't present to enforce the ""rules."" Children learn from TV commercials which genders are supposed to play with what toys, but when researchers replaced the boys in a Playmobil Airport Set ad with girls, first and second graders were twice as likely to believe that the toy was intended for girls as well as boys.Fine quotes a researcher, Emily Kane: ""...[B]ecause gendered preferences often appear to develop despite their best efforts, parents often assume that they must come from within the child: the biology-as-fallback position."" Kane ""suggests that the rapidity with which highly educated and privileged parents fall back on biological explanations reflects their position at 'the vanguard of a limited sociological imagination.'""Fine isn't arguing that there aren't any gender differences; she's pleading for better science and a clearer understanding of how biology and environment interact. Her writing is clear and unjargoned, though amply sourced and footnoted, and her arguments are admirably sane.-----------------------------------------------------------I wish I had the edition with the doll on the cover.Won in Giveaway; review to come.

It was the early seventies and she was a huge hit with the boys - big tits and sexy legs - and the teachers - big tits, sexy legs...arrhh, no, I mean great mind, they all admired her mind no end. They admired the way it went all the way up to her breasts. I mean the top of her head. All the way up there. One of the reasons she left was because they were all so very kind to her. 'Monica,' they'd kindly say to her, 'you don't have to bother going to staff meetings.' The fact that she protested and insisted she wanted to go to staff meetings was of no avail. It is one of those things, isn't it? Nobody wants to go to staff meetings, every man there must have rather envied the idea that femininity could excuse her, and yet my mother had to insist on her innate right to go to the darn things. To be fair, my mother's the exception, one of those who really did like doing stuff like that, a trait I have most certainly neither inherited nor acquired.So she left and went to Methodist Ladies College, the posh girls equivalent. At some point two of the kind male teachers from PAC happened to be visiting MLC, so she took them to the staff room for a cuppa. Afterwards she washed her cup and said to them 'If you are wondering why I don't wash yours, I happen to believe that men are just as good as women at washing up.' 'Oh, better,' said one of them to her, 'Much better.'And that is pretty much the point of this guide to the literature on the brain differences between men and women. If there were some reason why men suddenly thought that washing teacups was a desirable occupation, there would be an academic redefinition of the brain to fit this. In fact for now it is the other way around. The desirable occupations in life, the ones that are seen as the plums, must be taken up by men rather than women because they have the right brain composition. Depending on how good your sense of humour is, it is either discomforting or hilarious to discover that neuroscience is not above redefining what is 'necessary' depending on how their business of deciphering the brain develops.This explains the choice of word in the subtitle - neurosexism - but it is the sort of thing that irritated me as I read this - I don't like the current style of pop science where impartiality is a positive defect. It's like there is something going on which we might call 'extreme pop science'. You have to outdo the last writer in outrageousness. But while I was aghast at some of the ways she put things, I imagine the reader at large would not have noticed, let alone taken umbrage. Fine probably thinks it was acceptable to do so because all that mattered was getting her very important point across. I couldn't disagree more. Her material spoke for itself, the relentless mass of it which she brings to bear. She didn't need to be spurious on top of it. She should have left that for her publicly disgraced subjects. As it is, by waving the flag of her partiality - which she somehow attempts to do whilst claiming that this is the issue with the other side - right in our faces, she left me wondering if she is as trustworthy as she wants to be. Having the longest bibliography in the world doesn't cut the mustard if the reader is left gasping at the shamelessness with which she prejudicially discusses her data.

13,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3443770-jenny-schwartz,5,"Nearly 20 years ago I studied sociology at a feminist, Marxist university. I’m pretty much disposed to accept the argument that culture heavily influences behaviour, i.e. I’m on the nurture side of the nature versus nurture debate. So I thought reading “Delusions of Gender” would simply be a matter of nodding as new data supported that view.Oh boy (pun intended!) was I deluded.Well-researched, well-argued, wittily written, Cordelia Fine hits hard at the wide spread (and I’d argue, lazy) assumption of biology-as-destiny. The gender implications of that attitude of so deeply imprinted in our culture that we’re often blind to our own behaviours that perpetuate them.Reading through studies and anecdotes I was shocked out of my complacent assumption that I’m non-sexist, indeed feminist. Far from it. In fact – and this is a rare achievement for a book – it started me re-assessing my life from way back and seeing … well, seeing how often I had lived within gender assumptions and even played to them just because it made life not simply easier, but pleasanter. Fighting the culture we live in isn’t a job for cowards.I liked how Cordelia quoted “experts” from history on the biologically determined differences between the sexes. The examples show in pitiless detail that their biological determinism was merely supergluing on cultural blinkers. As her argument runs, later decades are likely to look back and have the same response to our use of neuroscience to plaster authority onto scientifically unsupported notions of gender.It’s depressingly no surprise to realise that where the biologically determined gender differences argument is run (and it runs freely through popular science) it generally supports a cultural power balance in favour of males.There are many, many examples of our gendered culture in this strongly argued but easily read book. One that has particularly stayed with me is a study (student subjects, not real world HR folk) who flip flopped 180 degrees so that whatever the male candidate’s qualifications and experience, those were what the job required. Hmm.For me, the scariest part of the book was its assertion that as sexism buries itself deeper, we believe we aren’t sexist but our behaviour (what sneaks out when we’re tired or not monitoring ourselves) shows otherwise – and this implicit sexism has an arguably stronger impact on our self-perception than the overt stuff that we can grasp hold of and challenge.Read the book – male or female, the impact of culture on your self-perception, and therefore, your life and choices will rock your assumptions of autonomy."
14,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/538517-alissa-thorne,2,"Warning: ranty.I was hoping for a balanced examination of the scientific evidence of biological/brain gender differences or the lack thereof. What I got was, firstly a heavy handed review of the sociological and cultural explanations for gender differences in society, and second a condescending and clearly biased review of the scientific evidence for biological/brain gender differences as an explanation for cultural gender differences.I did learn some interesting things. One study showed a clear gender prejudice in hiring for engineering roles. Identical resumes were sent to companies with only a change in the name being obviously female versus obviously male, and the male resumes had a higher response rate. A theme throughout the book was the relationship of self-identification and social grouping--basically the influence that feeling that ""people like me"" has on our self-image, and in turn our actions, behavior, aptitude. A simple example is the study in which female college students were asked if they were interested in pursuing engineering studies, but in differing environments. One environment featured a classic geek decor, while the other featured a more preppy decor. The female students were about equal to the male students in positively responding to the idea of studying engineering in the preppy lab, while response rate dropped when asked surrounded by D&D and candy wrappers. (This seems much broader than a gender issue to me, but it's a gender book, so ok.)When it came to the potential non-social influences though... bias and condescension, oh my! (I think the narration made this particularly cringe-worthy--the sneer when describing a competing theory, or the pompus and self-important voice used when quoting an opponent were particularly off-putting.) In a study showing evidence in favor of biological explanations for gender differences in behavior, the author would (rightly) lambaste the study for using self-reports valid evidence. Then pages later, in a study intended to offer an alternate explanation would be a phrase like, ""Mothers of infants report..."" Peppered throughout the book, most often on opening chapters, were arguments that amounted to:""Here's an obviously incorrect or invalid argument that would horrify modern readers with current data."" --some sexist dude from 100 years ago""Here's a current hypothesis regarding gender differences that deserves further study."" --some modern scientistSee how they're the same! Obviously the modern scientist is wrong because their hypothesis bears some surface similarities to someone from a different time who held beliefs we know to be untrue!While I did learn that there was little or no valid evidence for some of the biological gender differences that I had previously heard touted, it was hardly a review of what differences are known to exist. This was most obvious when the author mentioned in passing that one known gender difference--smaller brains of females versus males--results in extensive structural differences in the brain. And that this most likely served to make the genders more similar, as the different structures achieved different things in the same way.Such a key piece of data and the huge assertion must be backed by chapters of exposition of the evidence and detailed critique of the studies backing it--in short, the same treatment given to any other hypothesis in the book, right? In a book about how gender based brain differences may impact gender behaviors, surely the fact that there is allegedly structural brain differences will be examined in detail. And the hypothesis that these differences may work to achieve gender similarities will be backed by multiple studies, each carefully critiqued, right? No, this statement was simply made, and then passed right on by.I'm glad I forced myself through this book--you can still learn a lot from a biased account. But man, it was tough to get through. "

Cordelia Fine has seen them too, but instead of simply accepting their assertions because they sound scientific, she delved into the research, tracking down the studies that purportedly establish these claims, as well as the substantial body of research showing quite the opposite. The result is this book. It is not pop science – there is nothing dumbed-down about it, and Dr. Fine’s points are supported by extensive research, included in the endnotes and bibliography – but nor is it dry, academic material. It is aimed at the intelligent reader who may or may not have a science background; I do not, but found the book fascinating, clear, and well-organized, with strong, logical analysis of the research and even a few moments of humor.There is a strange tendency to view differences in current achievements between men and women as proof of inherently different abilities. This was true even in the 19th century, when women lacked the educational tools and the freedom to even begin to compete. Regardless of that small detail and the fact that gender roles in society continue to change, there are always those who claim that whatever women are achieving at the moment is the absolute biologically-determined limit. Now that we have at least officially achieved equality, some writers continue to make the same claims, conveniently setting aside differences in expectations, role models, and differing social demands on women’s time (women still do the bulk of the housework – even when they’re employed and their male partners are not!). This book deals with three main areas of gender research, to see what has actually been proven.First, tweaking the environment can eliminate gender differences in test performance: tell women before a test that they as good at math as men, and they will be; tell them they’re biologically limited, and they fall behind. Show a commercial featuring women behaving in stereotypical ways before a math test, and women’s performance goes down. On a test in mental rotation of objects, tell participants that it predicts ability in fields such as engineering and navigation, and men do much better; say it predicts ability in clothing design and interior decoration, and men’s scores go down. On the other hand, remind participants that women are supposed to be better at empathizing than men, and they’ll do better at recognizing emotions. Women report more empathetic ability than men do, but in in real-life situations, no gender differences in mind-reading have been found. Women will respond to an ethical dilemma in more caring ways than men after an exercise forcing participants to think about gender, but both genders will respond in the same way after non-gender-related exercises. In other words, emphasizing gender makes us more stereotypical; it reminds us how we are supposed to behave and what our strengths and weaknesses should be. And if a simple reminder right before a test can alter performance, how much more growing up in a world with constant reminders of gender?Second, the book takes on brain research that has been used to “prove” inherent differences between men and women. We should approach this research with a healthy dose of skepticism, for several reasons. This field is still experimental, tends to use very small sample sizes, and the actual studies often show much less than (or something completely different from) what pop science authors claim. (In one particularly egregious example, an author drew gender differences from a study with only female participants.) But the unsuspecting public tends to take as immutable fact anything labeled “brain science,” even if the results aren’t borne out in observed human behavior. Nevertheless, every generation seems to have its own pseudoscientific theories for why women are inferior, whether it’s that women’s smaller bodies or energy-sapping ovaries prevent sustained mental activity, or that men use one brain hemisphere at a time while women use both (a theory that will presumably be revised based on research showing that interaction between the hemispheres is associated with strong math abilities).Third, there’s the section on gender development in children. Many parents, finding that their daughters love princess costumes and their sons toy trucks without need for parental encouragement, conclude that these differences must be hardwired. But unless your children consume no media and interact with no one outside the family, it’s impossible to prevent their picking up on societal expectations, and kids are always searching for information about how the world works and how to categorize themselves within it. That’s leaving aside unconscious differences in the way parents (and researchers) treat children: for instances, studies have found mothers talking more to baby girls than baby boys, and underestimating girls’ crawling abilities while overestimating boys’.One can see, then, how all of these areas work together to create continuing perceptions of different abilities. As the author puts it: “So far, the items on that list of brain differences that are thought to explain the gender status quo have always, in the end, been crossed off. But before this happens, speculation becomes elevated to the status of fact, especially in the hands of some popular writers. Once in the public domain these supposed facts about male and female brains become part of the culture, often lingering on well past their best-by dates. Here, they reinforce and legitimate the gender stereotypes that interact with our minds, helping to create the very gender inequalities that the neuroscientific claims seek to explain.”And I’ve only scratched the surface of the information found in this book. Definitely a must-read for anyone interested in gender (and with the possible added benefit of reducing your own stereotypical behavior!)."
16,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,5,"This is not what I'd call a ""popular science"" book -- it's aimed at an intellectual audience with some understanding of science and a willingness to deal with academic language. That makes it less accessible than a lot of the talk show-fodder books it's debunking, like all those ridiculous ""Why Men Are Insensitive Horndogs Who Suck at Housework (Surprise! It's Biology!) and Women Are Born Loving Ponies and High Heels"" books. Fine takes on pretty much the entire field of neuroscience, or rather, that segment of the field that's publishing books claiming that men and women are hardwired to act like sitcom characters.Her conclusion (which she argues convincingly with thorough deconstructions of one study after another, and/or how that study was reported) is that a lot of what people think has been ""proven"" -- that the language centers in a woman's brain are more closely tied to the emotion centers than those of a man, that boys demonstrate greater aptitude for spatial manipulation, that boys think with their left-brain and girls think with their right-brain, that toddlers ""naturally"" exhibit gendered behavior regardless of efforts to raise them in a gender-neutral manner -- is simply false, or at least, far from proven.I found this a very balanced entry in the nature vs. nurture debate. Contrary to the characterizations of some of her critics, Fine is neither strident nor ignorant of the science. She's a feminist, to be sure, and she gets a bit snarky with some of the more ridiculous modern claims of gender essentialists (and is a bit too fond of making a point by leading with a particularly egregious howler from a hundred years ago), but she isn't trying to wish away innate sex differences, nor claiming that everything is a social construct. However, anyone who reads this and remains unconvinced that there's a whole lot of socialization going on in both your right-brain and your left-brain will probably not be convinced by any other mountain of evidence."
17,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1808983-alex,5,"It can be incredibly frustrating to argue against someone who is convinced by the idea of preformed gender roles in society because they feel that ""scientists have proven that male/female brains are different"" and that to think otherwise somehow flies in the face of common sesne. Gender roles in society are supposedly natural and pre-ordained and we should learn to like them and love them.It's so easy to believe in the myth and Cordelia Fine does an excellent job of outlining why this is a myth and why the scientific methodologies and experiments behind studies that supposedly prove that men and women are inherently different are so often flawed. She's done her research thoroughly and come up with good counters to the conclusions of popular experiments, and what's more she writes with confidence and persuasiveness both scientifically and sociologically putting forth plenty of alternative reasons as to why Women might be seen as more caring, or why that female baby supposedly reared in a gender neutral fashion is still reaching for pink barbie dolls to play with.Skeptically you could argue that Fine has an agenda, but then her argument that male scientists and popular writers on gender also have an agenda and I think it's pretty fair to get all sides of this story. Tjere were a few moments where I felt that Fine was less inclined to talk deeply about the conclusions of studies that seemed to support her viewpoints althouh this may in part be to keep the writing fluid and readable, since neuroscience can be a damn boring topic. Thankfully her wit, sarcasm and brisk pace stop the book from ever getting dry. Ultimately, too, she's not concluding that there's absolutely nothing in these scientific studies, merely that the work being done doesn't warrant such massive conclusions being drawn. I'm certainly convinced of that."
18,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4802663-deborah-ideiosepius,5,"My last Australian book of 2019; this was a brilliant, non fiction review, analysis and occasionally refutal of the science between gender differences.It was really interesting to me because I do not often follow science pertaining to gender differences, I think most of it is a steaming pile of hose apples and I get annoyed by people doing obviously bad science. In that way this book was perfect for me as it addresses a lot of bad science and I loved the erudite, witty way in which the author critiques them. There is a lot of explanation and buildup on the ways in which, historically, science has manipulated social thought into believing that the genders are different. Fine then links the historically patriarchal sexism of our culture to the more modern discipline of neuroscience and shows how this science is also being used to reinforce the 'just so story' of why females are different from males. It was very interesting very easy to read stuff and while it is a subject that is difficult to address lightheartedly and with humour the author does so most excellently.Now, for those of my friends who are more inclined to read popular science (or even no science) but are interested in this book: Do not be intimidated, it is beautifully written and accessible to any reader. The ways in which the scientific experiments are described are all very simple, adequate but basic. Fine is more interested in describing why something in a study went the way it did, rather than going over the science behind the research. In many ways that is a good thing, as quite a bit of the so called 'research' is so bad it is horrific.Now I will admit, this book is basically making points I have always believed, so it was very much preaching to the converted. However, I was impressed by the detail and depth of the research done in order to demonstrate why much of the science 'proving' that little girls are 'hardwired' to like pink dresses and Barbie dolls is nonsense. I was also delighted to find a person who actually works in that field, who shares my dislike for the term 'hardwired' which I have always though to be utterly unsuited to descriptions of organisms, however suited it might be to a smartphone.Anyway, great book which gives a fascinating, accessible look at the poor science of modern gender segregation, it is far more easy to read and much more fun than I had any expectations of. I do recommend, most especially to those of us who wishfully wish for a society of equals in which 'war of the sexes' is a distant memory. To end this review, I am going to quote the last paragraph from the book - because I enjoyed it so much. If you too like the quote; read the book. If you disagree with it; read the book. Are you getting the point that I feel you might want to read this book?""Our minds, society and neurosexism create difference. Together, they wire gender. But the wiring is soft, not hard. It is flexible, malleable and changeable. And, if we only believe this,it will continue to unravel."""
19,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,3,"Pink is for girls and blue is for boys, and that’s just the way it is, right? Girls like nurturing toys and boys like toys that involve motion or action, and don’t even bother trying to change those habits—they’re ingrained at birth, yeah? Doubtless you’ve heard these and other stereotypes and claims about the biological origins of sex differences. In some cases, such as the pink/blue divide, you might already be aware of the history of the phenomenon, including the fact that the colour assignments used to be reversed. Nevertheless, like any area of science, pseudoscience has set up shop in the study of gender, bolstered by media’s intense desire to seize on anything that has the patina of advanced, hi-tech science even when the results come from flawed research.Delusions of Gender is a thorough debunking by Cordelia Fine of scientific studies and scientific posturing regarding what we know about the biological (and particularly, neurological) differences between sexes. Fine basically wants to restore the reader’s doubt and uncertainty, challenging us to be a little more sceptical and critical of what we read and hear. She isn’t making the claim that sex and gender are entirely social constructs with no biological influences. Rather, her thesis is that the scientific study of sex and gender is still fraught with uncertainty, and we really don’t know as much as some people claim we know. There are a few reasons for this: firstly, although our technology for studying the brain has advanced considerably, we’re still a long way off from understanding it; secondly, it seems like people doing these studies are really vulnerable to spurious correlations; thirdly, the biological influences on sex and gender are complex because they interact with cultural conditioning in ways that are difficult to replicate reliably in a lab.Somehow, Fine manages to distill this into a 250-page book, and it mostly works. She does a good job of wading through recentish (from my perspective, given that this book is verging on a decade old) research and writing, picking apart arguments and debunking theories. She links these ideas to much older ideas about sex and gender. And she provides some guidance to the layperson in terms of how we can approach learning about sex and gender, from a scientific perspective, in the future.In Part 1, “'Half-Changed World,' Half-Changed Minds”, Fine catalogues the sex differences seen in modern society (mostly American, though often her homeland of Australia and sometimes the unhelpfully nebulous “West” in general). She reviews the standard gaps in workforce distribution, in pay, in equity of housework and other caring labour. This part is interesting but perhaps the least memorable, in my opinion, particularly if you’re not someone who needs much convincing of the inequities that exist owing to one’s gender. Perhaps the most interesting chapter was “XX-clusion and XXX-clusion”, in which Fine discusses the difficulties of defining gender in any concrete biological sense. This seems particularly topical given absurd rumblings from the US government about defining gender in law. Again, I was already well aware of a lot of what Fine said in thsi chapter, but she lays it out clearly.Part 2, “Neurosexism”, is where the book really starts to come into its own. This is where Fine tackles claims about differences between “male” and “female” brains. This whole part is valuable because she talks specifics, right down to the study and the scientists conducting them. Laypeople (myself included) often put a lot of stock into scientific results that come from what appear to be more rigorous or “hard” experiments, like MRI scans, as contrasted with a “soft” experiment like a psychological study. This is a bias that’s really hard, at least in my experience, to counteract. So it’s well worth my time to check that bias by being reminded of all the ways in which scientists (who are human, and therefore faulty) can draw faulty conclusions from these types of experiments. Fine challenges the shallow understanding most people have of the links between testosterone and masculinity; she points out that animal behaviour (even primate behaviour) can’t always be used as an analogy for unsocialized human behaviour, etc. This section is just a great reminder in general that science is a human process, and like any human process, is prone to error and a good tonic against thinking of science as this black box that we put experimental data into and get facts about the world out of.The final part, “Recycling Gender”, is where Fine provides some opinion and analysis of the state of the field. She basically says: we don’t really know a lot about gender, and it’s really hard to test, and I’m not going to tell you there are no biological differences between sexes—but can we please stop falling back on this explanation because we think gender-neutral parenting is futile? She points out that gender-neutral parenting often seems to “fail” (as in, kids still adopt gender stereotypes) because no matter how good the parents are at being neutral (and they usually aren’t as good as they think), the rest of our society is still hella stereotypical, and, you know, most families end up being part of society. I like the inclusion of this part in the book, because it encourages readers to consider how we actually apply scientific discoveries to our lives. That being said, this part of the book is probably the most scattered of the three and the least interesting from a scientific perspective.Delusions of Gender endears itself to me because, at the end of the day, Fine is basically saying we need to stay skeptical of claims that appear to be scientific on the surface but, if you scratch that surface, reveal supposition. Beyond its subjects of sex and gender, this book encourages critical thinking about doing science, and that is something that is sorely needed in society today. Lastly, although I have long been interested in gender and thinking more deeply about it, this book definitely got me thinking about gender along different tracks. While I already knew much of what Fine explains or alludes to, I learned more things and even had my own unconscious biases checked at some points. And really, that’s what I want from a pop science book!

20,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4928576-marta,4,"A spirited debunking of the perennial claims that women are different (and usually, it so happens that this difference is in truth inferiority) from men because SCIENCE. It is both amusing and infuriating to read how sexist scientists and journalists try angle after angle, and when one is debunked (say, no, brain size does not actually matter), they find another, even more dubious claim. This is not a book without faults. Firstly, the author veers to the verbose side, and secondly, the book pays almost no attentions to people outside the gender binary - a serious flaw and one that Cordelia Fine would do well to repair in any further editions. Still, I found it interesting, well-researched (the author has a knack for presenting scientific research in an accessible way, even if the empiricist in me would prefer more hard data - but bibliographical information provided is exceptional!), and even enlightening about the subtle and non-subtle ways gender stereotypes permeate our entire social world - and why is that not a good thing. I especially recommend it to parents interested in gender-neutral parenting, women in male-dominated professions, and everyone interested in the fascinating ways our biases inform scientific research (both with regards to interpretation as well as planning experiments themselves)."
21,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3932962-barbara-the-bibliophage,4,"Cordelia Fine is a scientist, feminist, and a mom. Her book debunks studies that purport to be solid science, but ultimately just support gender stereotypes. She discusses how gender neutral parenting is nearly impossible in today’s society. And how this, along with neuroplasticity, mean that brains cannot possibly be hard-wired by gender. (Neuroplasticity = brain’s ability to change.) Many more details in my review at TheBibliophage."
22,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53674-the-crimson-fucker,5,God damn! This book actually changed the way I see the world!! I shall do it justice with a worthy review! Just way till I get my hands on a computer! 
23,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1462364-kogiopsis,4,"Many of the general ideas presented in this book were familiar to me: claims of true neurological basis for differences between the sexes are bunk; areas in which people seem to be 'deficient' are often socially created rather than biological; current conceptions of binary gender essentialism must be abandoned. However, for all that the conclusions Cordelia Fine drew were hardly surprising to me, reading this book had a significant impact. It felt almost like an out of body experience, to read about these studies and then look at similar cases in my own life and, all of a sudden, to be able to see the strings. This is probably what Neo felt like when he learned to see the Matrix. It's disorienting.I read this book on a road trip with my parents, and I'm sure they wish I hadn't because I would not shut up about it. Partly, that's because I couldn't really process it without talking about it and applying it; partly, that's because my mom is a teacher and my dad is an engineer and I feel like the things I was learning from Cordelia Fine are intimately applicable to their work and dealing with other people. That's probably true of most people, though; but since one has direct impact on how confident students feel speaking in her courses and the other interacts with younger engineers, this seemed very relevant. I think I've probably brought the book up once a week since, too.The one concept that sticks with me the most is that of stereotype threat. Simply put, stereotype threat describes an effect when someone, being aware that a group they are part of is believed to have a certain capability, changes the way they approach that task. (For instance, women who are reminded of the stereotype that women are bad at math perform worse on math tests.) I had to set the book aside when I read that, because it explained so much about things I've struggled with: when you're under stereotype threat, your brain switches from trying to achieve success to trying to avoid failure, making you less innovative and confident, and slowing you down in completing the task. It's a feeling of being stifled, being trapped, that I've experienced a lot more than I'd like to, and finally having an explanation for it is clearing up a lot in my life.I wound up taking a star off of my rating for this book for two reasons - one, Fine's very binarist, cis-normative handling of gender erases or ignores trans* people, and while I see the rhetorical reasoning for that given the book's argument, it's still a weakness; and two, while she dissected research that she disagreed with very thoroughly, I found myself wondering if the studies she cited would stand up to a similar level of scrutiny. Given the nature of the book, I assume her research was thoroughly done, but there's still a distinct rhetorical strategy to the final work and I couldn't stop wondering if that had shaped the results presented."
24,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5759337-robin,3,"Cordelia Fine attempts to refute the popular idea that men and women have an innate neurological difference which results in different brains. I read this book after ""The Essential Difference"" by Simon Baron-Cohen. I recommend reading them in that order because Fine's book refutes many of the points made in Baron-Cohen's. Fine makes a good case that many of the differences we see in gender could readily be traced back to cultural or sociological phenomena, and that it is too early to declare that brain differences in men and women are innate. She does an excellent job of pointing out the flaws in many of the studies cited by the other side. This book is a much-needed dose of caution in the rush to say men and women just are innately different. She does a great job of reminding us that the reinforcement for gender roles is all around us in ways we can't even see.One weakness in the book is that she doesn't adequately address the cross-cultural studies. If gender-based tendencies in brains are not inherent, then how come some appear in cultures world-wide? What are the chances that such diverse cultures would have developed similar gender roles if they do not have some biological basis?"
25,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5842167-deema,5,"I’ve been meaning to review this book for ages, but whenever I attempt to write something, I’m lost at what to include and what to leave out. All of it was so important in shaping my understanding of gender and I don’t know how to write a review convincing enough to get other people to read it. That being said, I’ve raved about this book to enough friends to know that it’s made an impact on me, and so I will sit down and attempt this for the fifth time and hope that I will finally be able to get the right words out.Delusions of Gender is split into three sections, all of which argue the same thing: there are no discernible neurological differences between males and females. But society, our minds, and badly designed scientific experiments have made us believe that there are.I have no background in cognitive psychology or neuroscience, so I picked this up as a beginner, and worried that I wouldn’t be able to understand the more technical parts. As it turns out, Cordelia Fine has an accessible writing style and is able to take complex concepts and explain them in relatively simple terms, so I never found myself lost or confused. I may have slightly benefited by preceding this book with David McRaney’s You Are Not So Smart, which explained “priming” to me – a concept mentioned heavily in Delusions of Gender, and a concept everyone should be familiar with.Priming, by the way, is the way our minds are affected by subtle changes in our surroundings. These changes in surroundings, which would seem insignificant to you and me, can affect our brains so drastically that they seep into our performance on tasks and our perceptions of reality. For example, if a girl who is just about to write an exam is told that girls normally perform worse than boys on this type of exam, then her brain will be primed to do worse, regardless of her actual skill level. Similarly, if she is told that girls normally perform better than boys on this type of exam, then she will do better, regardless of her skill level. We have been primed by society to perform according to our genders, and this process starts early. The continuous nature of this priming, which comes to us in the form of advertisements, television programs, teachers, school peers, and even our parents, has led to a cycle of self-confirming “biological certainties,” such as “girls are better than boys at communication” and “boys are better than girls at math”. The more we are taught these differences, the more we perform according to them. The more we perform according to them, the more we believe in biological differences between genders. The more we believe in biological differences between genders… you get the picture. It’s fascinating, and shocking, and phrased a whole lot better by Cordelia Fine.When you take this theory and expand it on a mass level, it makes sense why people think women and girls aren’t good at math, science, sports, and other typically “male” things and why their behaviors normally align with these gendered expectations. In the next section of the book, Fine carefully rebuts the many scientific experiments and studies that claim to prove the inherent differences between male and female brains. Scientists and the public have used these experiments for decades to support their sexist claims about girls and women, but Fine is here to tell us that those experiments had small sample sizes, flimsy experiment designs, and other glaring holes that should make us all question their scientific authority. Each claim she makes in this section is backed up by solid research, and all her sources are outlined in the endnotes and bibliography, which together span about 80 pages. She also provides counter-studies along the way to disprove these experiments, all of which help drive her initial point home. At the end of this section, she points to a mass study, or meta-analysis, that puts together data from thousands of participants from various studies investigating the same question, and showed that, when using a large sample size (as opposed to the small ones normally used in these experiments), most of the trends that scientists have claimed to find on gender differences turn out to be statistically insignificant, and therefore unsupported by science. Fine also points to the important concept of neuroplasticity, or how our brains are constantly being shaped by external factors, such as our social environment and experiences: “where else but in the brain would we see the effects of socialization or experience?” As such, it isn’t as simple as making X discovery about the female brain and then making Y pronouncement about “hardwired” gender differences. Our brains are malleable and heavily influenced by external factors, which, more often than not, are working against us, and these factors need to be honestly discussed by scientists who enter into this field of work.All in all, I have benefited greatly from this book. It has reshaped the way I think about gender, and has made me much more wary of oft-repeated statements on “gender differences” and “female psychology”. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in gender, science, neuroscience, or even just in a good book on psychology, because it’s well written, funny, and highly informative."

According to what Fine uncovered we have mutable brains, continuously influenced and changed by our cultural environment.

28,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5858624-beth-bibliobeth,4,"In my other, non-blogging life, I work as a scientist and every so often you’ll see a review popping up on my blog about a non-fiction book I’ve read that has more than likely been science-y. I’m also a firm believer in gender equality and women’s rights so Delusions of Gender seemed like the perfect mix of science and feminism which encouraged me to pick it up. I found it to be a fascinating read which I learned a lot from and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the differences between our two genders. The book is divided into short chapters with intriguing titles such as “Why You Should Cover Your Head with a Paper Bag if You Have A Secret You Don’t Want Your Wife to Find Out,” “Sex and Premature Speculation,” and “Gender Detectives.” With titles like these you may want to read this book already but let me assure you that the author backs up the humour in her writing with clear facts, possible theories and very strong evidence that lends a note of seriousness into why exactly we still have gender inequality in a modern, 21st century society.You’d think we’d have come a long way in achieving more rights for women since say, the nineteenth century yet consider this point that the author makes in the introduction. An English clergyman called Thomas Gisborne wrote a manual called “An Enquiry into the Duties of the Female Sex,” and noted that things such as legislation, political economy and the conduct of government should be assigned to men as they have “the powers of close and comprehensive reasoning, and of intensive and continued application.” Whereas, females enjoy “powers adapted to unbend the brow of the learned, to refresh the over-laboured faculties of the wise, and to diffuse the enlivening and endearing smile of cheerfulness.” Ladies, I hope you are extremely insulted right now. But then Fine encourages us to move forward 200 years and look at The Essential Difference written by Simon Baron-Cohen, a Cambridge University psychologist who states “the female brain is pre-dominantly hard-wired for empathy. The male brain is predominantly hard-wired for understanding and building systems.” Hmm… sounds pretty much the same thing as what Gisborne was trying to say in the nineteenth century?Throughout the book, Cordelia Fine investigates how different males and females really are. Are we all so hard-wired into our gender that there is no wiggle room in terms of qualities we should possess? Is it really a man’s world? Is it absolutely pointless for a woman to even consider a top level management job as it requires stereotypically more aggressive characteristics that for a woman is considered unattractive? I did enjoy the way that the author discredits work carried out by Baron-Cohen, and theories from the author of A Female Brain, Louann Brizendine that seem to want to put males and females in their own little boxes. For example, the assumption that a woman can use more areas of the brain than a man i.e. multi-tasking, was an experiment based on only 14 brains and the conclusions weren’t even statistically significant? In this way, a lot of experiments dealing with differences between the sexes have used just a few subjects, or made scientific “guesses,” depending on what their own stereotypical views were.This is a brilliant and fascinating book, injected with a little bit of wit and sarcasm which I always appreciate in a non-fiction book and which I think is needed when dealing with this subject which can sometimes be a little bit touchy. I don’t think Baron-Cohen or Brizendine will be amongst her fans if they ever read it but I really enjoyed the way she picked apart neurosexism and shone a light upon the shadier areas of gender research. Oh, and you don’t need to be a scientist to read or enjoy this, it’s very accessible without being patronising.Please see my full review at http://www.bibliobeth.com"
29,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,4,"Delusions of Gender is an enjoyably acerbic and eloquent takedown of evolutionary psychologists and their neuroscientist collaborators—those practitioners of Bad Science, whose work is often repeated uncritically in tabloid newspapers or used to shape educational curricula. Cordelia Fine examines a number of supposedly scientific studies, together with the books and newspaper articles which have popularised them for a general audience (Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus and their odious ilk), which seek to explain gender difference and inequality through neurological differences. Many of these studies, as Fine points out, have shoddy methodology, questionable assumptions and/or have conclusions which rely on circular logic. Researchers conflate the brain and the mind in order for their findings to conform with gender stereotypes. Men and women have biological differences, Fine states, which may reflect on different brains, but there is no proof that these differences map onto tasks, preferences, modes of thinking, etc. Indeed, there may be more similarities between a man and a woman who both have a comparatively large brain relative to their body mass than between a woman with a comparatively large brain and a woman with a comparatively small brain. Gender difference doesn't create gender inequality—it may well be vice versa. As someone who works in the humanities and not the sciences, I did learn a lot from this book, particularly in terms of how to interpret (or not) neuroscientific data. Fine has done a good job of synthesising a lot of secondary material in a very readable way. However, I did think there were some surprising omissions here—there is no consideration, or even mention, of societies in which there are more than two genders, and there's no mention of transgender or genderqueer people. While I'm sure that most of the scientific data that Fine deals with assume binary gender, and was gathered from predominantly white Westerners, I do think that had she done a bit more digging, she would have unearthed a wealth of work which would have undermined the assumption of the Western-centric gender binary while supporting the very point she's trying to make.

30,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Subtitle: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference. Cordelia Fine, while an apparently well-read and quite competent scientist, makes no pretense of objectivity in this book. She's got an axe to grind with a whole school of research that aims to use modern brain science to convince us that male and female brains are intrinsically, fundamentally, and irrevocably different. Oh, and I also think the picture of her on the dust jacket is pretty hot. I just love imagining her getting all worked up about this. Wait, did I say that out loud?Anyway, Fine's point is best illustrated by an anecdote from the experience of a four year old named Jeremy, who had been raised by parents who were extraordinarily zealous gender-neutral parents. He decided one day to wear barrettes to nursery school, and gets into an argument with another boy, who says that he is a girl. Finally, Jeremy pulls down his pants and points out that he has a penis, as a way of making his point. The other boy says, “Everybody has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.”Whether you think the parents who let their boy wear barrettes to school were weird here, or the society that teaches a boy that the difference between male and female has more to do with hairstyle than genitals, depends on your opinions about gender (and society) generally. So does a lot of other (less amusing but more substantial) evidence, published in scientific journals or mainstream media, that Fine takes us on a tour of.Some of it is related to the general fallacy of all brain-scan evidence. Just because we see a difference in brain activity (using MRI or some other method), doesn't mean it's genetic or otherwise hardwired. All it shows is that it happens in the brain, and really, if we're talking about thoughts, attitudes, emotions, and so forth, where else would we expect it to happen? Also, like muscles, areas of the brain can grow larger or smaller over time as they are used more or less (whether for cultural reasons or any other), so again evidence from brain scans, while perhaps useful for other purposes, tells us nothing about whether differences in behavior are primarily biological or cultural. Seeing a brain scan, however, tells us that it has something to do with biology, and our instinctive reaction is still to divide things into biological and cultural, and if it's one it must not be the other.There is a long and well-documented history of scientific attempts to explain to us why women and men are Just Different, in ways that have nothing (directly) to do with procreation. The suspicious thing is that, while the rationales differ from decade to decade and from one century to the next, the conclusions always point in the same direction. Fine takes us on a thoroughly readable tour of this history, spiced up a bit by her, at times, barely contained rage.Make no mistake, this is not an even-handed weighing of the evidence; it is rather a very well-documented and data-driven polemic. If it were written by a man, I'd say that the confrontational and science-oriented analysis is very typical of a masculine style. Instead, I'll say it's an emotional treatment, showing a feminine inability to maintain objectivity on scientific topics. Either way, it's a hoot to read."
31,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6537005-daniel,3,"""Delusions of Gender"" is an engaging read, well-written and incisive. Cordelia Fine makes a convincing argument that gender differences in performance assessed through various metrics are to a large extent the result of social cues, reactions to internalized stereotypes, and unconscious priming. Her critique of studies of gender differences in psychological experiments is comprehensive, and her depiction of the current state of sexism is both convincing and often horrifying.Unfortunately, her fixation on discrediting both contemporary pop-psychology books selling innate gender differences and the arguments of dusty sexists from centuries past comes off a bit like clubbing baby seals (or possibly arm-wrestling five-year-olds). Her arguments against current neuroscientific techniques--especially neuroimaging using techniques like fMRI--fall particularly flat, as she relies repeatedly upon equating sophisticated real-time 3d measurements of blood-flow in the brain with crude volumetric measurements of skull capacity used by those sexist scientists of yore. This is trite and annoying.Likewise, she fails to engage biological and evolutionary arguments in any meaningful sense, instead relying on the tired allegation that evolutionary psychology and biology are only sexist justifications for relegating women to lives of domestic drudgery. She perhaps hopes that her readers are not savvy enough to Wikipedia the fields. Her argument that structural differences between the brains of men and women (after criticizing imaging and anatomical studies, she grudgingly admits that these do exist) compensate for differences in physiology to produce similar behaviors in males and females is interesting and may even be true to some extent--humans male and female, after all, must accomplish many of the same tasks to survive--but is unsupported and feels like hand-waving. She does not engage with the concepts of hormonal modulation of brain activity or neurotransmitter/receptor distribution and prevalence to any great degree. She brushes off the striking possibility that biological differences may predispose men and women toward different goals irrespective of nebulous measures of aptitude or spurious notions of ""natural gender roles."" The human brain she seems to prefer is the black box too intricate to be understood on a mechanistic level, a network of abstract associations accessible only to psychologists distributing questionnaires and bubble sheets to college students participating in studies for course credit.So, while entertaining (and perhaps convincing to audiences disinclined to read it critically or who already embrace its ideological underpinnings), the book's thesis does not strike home, and Fine's claim that it is dangerous for researchers to ask these questions at all should be disturbing to any reader who values science over ideology."

If I had read this in audio, a format my brain can handle for serious subjects, I probably would have rated it much higher, and gotten through it much faster (and I'll be honest, retained more than 10% of it). So take this review with a grain of salt. (P.S. I just googled that phrase, and it evolved from something Pliny the Elder wrote in 77 A.D. Language is so weird.) I will be trying it again maybe in a couple of years by audio. Unless someone can point me in the direction of a book on the same subject that is more recent that I should read first (this was published in 2010).Aside from that issue, this book is also less of a thing on its own than it is the author debunking other scientific studies or books, things that people take as a given, or as ""proven"" by science. Cognitive bias plays a huge role not only in the behavior of test subjects, but in the minds of the scientists performing the studies. Which is enjoyable in its own way, but not quite what I was expecting. The book is very heavy on cautioning the reader about these types of studies, since gender is so hard to study, and really just instills a healthy amount of scientific skepticism. I remember it being a lot of, this isn't proven, we actually don't ""know"" as much as we think we do.I can't emphasize how much my brain did not retain any of the information I read, so this is really just a useless review. Judging by my friends' reviews on Goodreads, I just really need to give it a break, and then pick this up again some time down the road when my brain is being more amenable."

Honestly though, some male scientists... if you have to create and pursue patently absurd theories about differences in the brain to justify why you can't patiently listen to your wife or make your kids a sandwich, that's pretty undeniably pathetic.

36,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113545-nancy,5,"READ IT.Cordelia Fine's examination of the many popular books and research studies which purport to prove that the male and female brains might as well belong to different species is simply brilliant. I gobbled this non-fiction up like it was a light lunch after a hard day's manual labor. Every page was packed with jaw-dropping information - horrifying methodological flaws, research which argues two diametrically opposed concepts, and outright deception, all designed to prove that men and women are not and cannot possibly be equal. Like, here's one example: Fine mentions the author of a popular book on the subject, who cites research about ""mirror neurons,"" (women have more of them, which supposedly makes them more empathetic.) The author mentions a study of therapists which indicated that the most successful therapists are those that ""mirror"" their clients words, gestures, and verbal patterns. Interestingly, (says the author), ALL of the successful therapists were women. Because they have more mirror neurons, and are more attuned to others, right?WRONG. Cordelia Fine looked up the study (thank you, Cordelia! That would be a big nuisance for the Average Reader) and as it turns out? ALL OF THE THERAPISTS IN THE STUDY WERE WOMEN. Yeah, that's right. They only recruited women for the study, so the study proves absolutely nothing about men vs. women. And if you think this sort of thing is an anomaly, wrong again - Fine's detailed work found this sort of thing occurring over and over again. Moreover, Fine is terrific at highlighting how the social context of everything men and women do contributes to these gender stereotypes, and at explaining how gender bias affects the neuroscientific research. This is an absolutely fantastic book - I have the urge to acquire copies for every teacher, every employer, every parent on the planet. It made me rethink more of my life that I would have believed possible. Seriously, even if you think you would disagree with it: READ IT. If nothing else, you will enjoy Fine's smooth and witty prose."

If you’re the type of person who enjoys nitpicking underpowered studies over methodological errors that affect validity and throwing shade at poor referencing while also being a flagrant feminist this is for you. I am not sure how this would go down for other people without a background in neuroscience because those parts were undoubtedly my favorite although I see how that part of the book could be too technical and heavy. I didn’t learn anything new science-wise but I did discover that there still are some fucking assholes willing to forgo the science completely just in order to tell you that your female brain HAS TO KNOW HOW TO EMPATHIZE AND BE NURTURING and that of course those morons have a wide audience just dying for any shard of pseudo-evidence that may point to the fact that their daughters are meant to be breeding subservient cows and that their sons will bring about the rapture. Of course this book proves yet again the only truth known to humans besides inevitable death and that is that men are trash. Besides that, I wholeheartedly enjoyed the psychology aspects of the book and if I had any doubt about the ubiquity of gender then it was all erased in the last part where she lists study after study proving how the idea of gender and how everything is gendered almost from birth and how early toddlers take on these ideas and digest them almost regardless of how unisex parents attempt to make their environments at home; the world at large is sexist. Go figure. And then there’s the ever expanding body of evidence that simply makes it clear that women have always always always been just as capable as men and that as the gender gap closes (despite the screeching and howling of men) women find their ways into board room and ORs and mines and factories and fucking haters continue to come up with more sophisticated schemes of bullshit to make it seem like we can’t but we’re doing it anyway.

39,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14821636-andrew-fish,1,"The differences between men and women have probably been a topic of debate since the dawn of time. In recent decades, however, as society has progressed from subsistence and survival to consumerism and choice the issue has gained a degree of salience. The question of whether women are actively held down in their careers or whether they passively make decisions which close off paths to advancement becomes more than a curiosity when careers become both a means to achieve a better life and a source of fulfilment in themselves. And earlier in life, the science of gender difference could make a significant difference to educational outcomes if it could be robustly investigated. The time, it seems, is right for a good scientific look at the subject.Unfortunately, this isn't it.Fine is a psychologist by training, and whilst there's definitely scope to study the issue of gender difference through psychology, she seems reluctant to do this in any depth. The opening section of the book which nominally covers this ground is quite thin on actual studies and seems instead to rely heavily on anecdote, giving the book the feel more of a polemic rather than an academic assessment. What science there is, meanwhile, is treated in an uneven manner, promoting the studies which suit the central thesis and denigrating any which don't. Frequently, Fine goes beyond the studies and draws conclusions which aren't supported by any of the evidence she has presented.So, for example, when looking at a study about the effect of priming on women's mathematical abilities, she not only accepts the results without question, she positively crows about the fact that the women did better than the men without the priming. For this to be a valid observation, both male and female participants would have to have an even spread of intellect, presumably using some kind of test as part of the selection process. The trouble with this is that you are then pre-determining the results: if the selection test were gender-neutral, the gender-neutral part of the study would be consistent with the selection process and you would end up with roughly equal results for men and women. If the theory were correct, there would then be lower results for the women in the gender-biased part. If the selection process were not gender-neutral, meanwhile, then if the theory held the women would seem equal to the men in the selection process and better in the gender-neutral study itself.From those results you could prove that priming made a difference to the test results, but not that there was any inherent difference between male and female aptitude in itself. To go further would be circular reasoning (something Fine criticises about another study later in the book).It's like the constant claim that girls are better at school - fifty years ago, the reverse was claimed. What changed in between? The education system. Clearly there is some kind of difference between the sexes there (something Fine seems pathologically averse to) but if one system of education produced stronger male results and the other stronger female all you can say is that different methods favour the sexes differently - you can't claim this makes one superior to the other.In other places, such as the behaviour of women in male-dominated careers, it seems there are no studies Fine can draw on. By definition, you'd find it hard to create a female-dominated version of the same career for comparison, but it doesn't stop the author from coming to conclusions about the effect of those environments without anything beyond anecdote and hypothesis.The most detailed analysis in favour of her argument comes toward the end of the book, when looking at the gender stereotypes to which children are exposed in their early years and how this affects their choice of toys and sense of dress. Unfortunately, here she has narrowed the argument too much: it may be demonstrable that social forces drive boys to wear blue and girls pink, but this would hardly explain the more abstract alleged differences between the sexes. When was the last time your child came home claiming they'd been excluded from the spatial reasoning group on the basis of gender?With the results which don't suit her, the author is more exacting. When looking at a study about infant response to faces and mobile phones, for example, she casts aspersions on the methodology, hypothesises about all kinds of ways the results could have been skewed (always assuming such skews would be systematically biased in the same direction) and even implies that the experimenters could have been acting out of an unconscious gender bias themselves. Apart from the unprofessionalism of casting aspersions without evidence, it seems weak to subject a study you don't like to this level of criticism when it could have been equally true of any of the studies supporting the case. Stepping outside her field, Fine is dismissive of biological studies and applies an extremely shaky attack on neurology - regarding it as an inadequately direct proxy measure of brain activity that is subject to confirmation bias. If that's true of neurology, what it does it say about psychology as a reliable indicator? This attack allows her to dismiss any conclusions from the field she doesn't like, but again she's all too quick to accept any that she does. She constantly falls for the same fallacy, that if you can debunk a very specific prediction made by someone in a particular field, you can dismiss any evidence from that field when it doesn't suit your agenda. The constant comparisons to long-dismissed theories such as brain-pan measurement are a reductio ad absurdum argument with little logical validity and the quotes which open most chapters - generally over a century old and clearly not acceptable to modern readers - come across as an attempt to prime the reader into a form of indignation which switches off their reasoning faculties for the rest of the chapter and allows them to accept Fine's arguments without criticism. I even spotted a very old psychologists' trick - starting a sentence with ""by now you will all be thinking"" - which is a blatant attempt at manipulation of the reader.Here and there we find snippets of actual information - a chance remark about spatial reasoning differing in babies of only a few months old, for example - but unless they fit the central argument, they are passed over quickly. An anecdote about a woman having been masturbated over, by contrast, is alluded to several times across a chapter. And there's little gender-balance in the topics themselves either: apart from a brief mention of female intuition right at the beginning, the book focuses almost entirely on areas where women are alleged to be deficient. The impression given is that this is a book written by someone working out their own issues rather than dispassionately looking at the field.And this is often a problem with psychologists. Freud's obsession with mother fantasies reeked of projection, Kahneman's instinct over reason view of the brain suggests a man struggling to justify his own bad decisions. To see what Fine's problems are you need only look at the language she uses, the metaphors she chooses and the examples she latches onto. The book is riddled with misandistric metaphor and there are a number of coded attacks on her husband. Take the chapter where she envisages a hypothetical job-swap with her spouse. When looking at his ability to do her job, she attacks his literacy - comparing it to a ten year-old. She then looks at her ability to do his job, but rather than admit any limitation on her own part, she sidesteps the issue and instead turns it into another backhanded attack on her husband - in this case the likelihood of his nagging her from beyond the grave. It doesn't take a degree in psychology to spot the signs of an inferiority complex.I don't pretend to know what the biological basis for behaviour is, and I accept that there are a lot of bad studies out there and bad books using the results. But for a book whose byline is ""the real science behind gender difference"" I was expecting more than just a series of attacks. And it's a shame, because the issue is both interesting and important. In my opinion, there clearly are elements of behaviour that are inherited (how else would cuckoos transmit their parasitical tendencies?) but what that inheritance mechanism is and how far it reaches into human behaviour has, as far as I can see, yet to be established. To claim it has no effect on humans would be to think as those who attacked Darwin because whilst they could accept evolution, they felt that to claim humans were a product of evolution was a step too far. One science Fine didn't look at all is anthropology, which for anyone who is genuinely looking for the true reasons for gender difference would seem the obvious place to start. I suggest for those who are after a book which informs them rather than just gives them a reason to be angry at the state of the world, that would be a better field to explore."
40,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17161968-fergus-murray,5,"Delusions of Gender, by Cordelia Fine, is an extended critique of efforts to scientifically study differences between the sexes, and the efforts of many writers to apply alleged science in their writings about such differences. The book is rich in technical detail, which might bog down some readers, but most of those details are fascinating. Fine is a lucid and entertaining writer, especially in her more acerbic moments - of which there are plenty here. She finds a lot of shoddy science and shameless misuse of would-be science that would raise the hackles of any neuroscientist or feminist, let alone someone like her who happens to be both.This is a book with an agenda, and political agendas tend not to sit comfortably with science - but to pretend that politics never seeps into science while nobody is looking would be disingenuous. In fact, Fine's agenda - to bring out the reasons to doubt science that supposedly demonstrates innate differences between sexes - is at least as much scientific as political, and I think it is legitimate. It is something to bear in mind while reading this book, though, and there are times she goes out of her way to present things in such a way as to minimise the possibility of interpretation in terms of innate differences. As far as I can see she always stops short of misrepresenting the science, though, and the whole approach needs to be seen in the context of discourse which routinely takes essential differences for granted, whether the evidence supports them or not.The book is divided into three parts. The first is 'Half-changed World', Half-Changed Minds, which largely focuses on the interplay of cultural expectations and attempts to measure sex differences scientifically. This largely consists of accounts of experiments demonstrating the effects of cultural norms on things that people might be interested in measuring, and experiments which fail to take these factors into account. For example, she looks at experiments investigating the effect of telling the subjects what 'the latest science' has to say about the sorts of tests they are about to perform, to show that girls do significantly better on mathematical tasks if they think that science says they should. Even more subtly, females rate their mathematical ability as worse after they have just been reminded of their sex by having to tick a box at the beginning to say they are females. This gives us an interesting lens for looking at gender differences in maths tests which disregard the weight of cultural expectations, and indeed at systematic tendencies for females to choose less mathematical study and career paths. Having established many profound and subtle ways that social expectations and structures shape behaviours and perfomance, the theme of the second part of the book is Neurosexism - premature efforts to explain differences in behaviour and performance with reference to the brain, rather than society. Fine's most basic point is that it is rather soon to be looking for explanations of most of these things in neuroscience, when societal explanations have not been ruled out, and the relationship between the mind and the brain is still so unclear. More than that, she shows time and again that many authors are disturbingly willing to go way beyond what neurology can tell us, while pretending that they are not. Perhaps the single worst offender here is Louann Brizendine, author of The Female Brain, a serial abuser and inventor of neuroscience to back up her ideas about the differences between males and females - but she is one of many. Fine makes the point that people have been finding 'explanations' for sex differences in the brain for well over a century, from the observation that female brains tend to be a bit lighter than male ones through to modern notions of hardwiring. At the same time, people have routinely assumed that all kinds of observed differences between the sexes are natural and inevitable, when later experience has regularly shown them to be no such thing.The final section is titled Re-Cycling Gender, and it concerns itself with the future of gender relations and the science of sex. Fine is worried about the cyclical nature of some kinds of self-fulfilling prophecy - about dodgy science being used to teach yet another generation of young men and women that there are certain natural roles that they ought to be filling, certain characteristics they should expect to have. She emphasises again how difficult it is to pick apart innate and culturally conditioned differences, and the importance of keeping an open mind about questions that science has not yet been able to settle. With a better scientific understanding of the role of society in forming the mind and the brain, and a sceptical eye on the interesting but inconclusive findings of neuroscience, we may approach true sexual equality yet. Without such circumspection, as Fine argues, we may find ourselves sliding back to ideas about the sexes which are both unhelpful and ill-founded.This is an important book, because the trend towards explaining sex differences with impressive-sounding neurological findings has great potential to set back ideas about gender roles, on the basis of evidence which is far flimsier than it might look. Because we are shaped by our ideas, this has major practical, political ramifications - it is not just good science that is at stake here. There is no doubt that some will resist Fine's approach for its politicisation of science, but I would be inclined to see it more as exploring the role of pre-existing, unexamined political bias, rather than introducing politics to the debate. Delusions of Gender is compelling, informative and perhaps most impressively, funny. I recommend this highly to anyone with any interest in neuroscience or gender.'This review first appeared at http://everything2.com/title/Delusion..."
41,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11030012-jade,4,"There have always been many (pseudo)scientific books on the shelves attempting to explain the differences between the sexes, of which the most common differences usually consist of men having a more result-orientated, mathematical approach, and women having a more relationship-orientated, emotional or empathic approach (never mind about non-binary people, queers, etc.). This is usually shown as something that’s unchangeable; something written down by genetics and made clear by the way our brains differ so much from each other. Also, some (if not most) of these books claim that that’s what also causes traditional gender roles – women are simply better suited for housework, and men better suited for business. Often, this is also where an evolutionary argument about caves, hunting, and gathering comes in.Unfortunately, the tendency to display such dated, sexist views isn’t only found in pseudoscientific writers (an example being the ever annoying book always present in every single bookstore I visit, Men Are from Mars Women Are from Venus by John Gray), but also in qualified scientists or psychologists: The Female Brain by Louann Brizendine, being a great example, or The Sexual Paradox: Extreme Men Gifted Women and the Real Gender Gap by Susan Pinker. Though I can’t deny the big influence popular ‘science’ books have on the general reading audience, as an aspiring psychologist myself, the fact that qualified psychologists spew this kind of garbage worries me intensely.Which is why I’m quite glad to have found this wonderfully well-researched book by Cordelia Fine, in which she attempts to refute many claims made by popular psychology books concerning traditional gender roles/behaviour, and differences between the sexes. Does she succeed? In my opinion, yes, and she does so with humour, solid arguments, and a critical approach. I really enjoyed the fact that she doesn’t only bring up arguments to counter interpretations and results of research used in the aforementioned popular psychology books, but she also attacks the way certain methods of research are used and interpreted (case in point: neuroimaging).A very complete, interesting, witty, and fun read. I commend Cordelia Fine for writing such a wonderfully clear answer to the dated views on the differences between the sexes, and emphasizing the importance of valid research (and the interpretation of it). I can definitely recommend this to anyone who’s interested in reading more about gender roles/behaviour."

It made me want to do a dance of joy. Also, when talking about neuroimaging experiments which supposedly prove these ""hardwired"" differences, Cordelia Fine wrote this paragraph:[...] When looking for changes in blood flow between two conditions, researchers search in thousands of tiny sections of the brain (called voxels), and many researchers are now arguing that the threshold commonly set for declaring that a difference is ""significant"" just isn't high enough. To illustrate this point, some researchers recently scanned an Atlantic salmon while showing it emotionally charged photographs. The salmon--which, by the way, ""was not alive at the time of scanning""--was ""asked to determine what emotion the individual in the photo must have been experiencing."" Using standard statistical procedures, they found significant brain activity in one small region of the dead fish's brain while it performed the empathizing task, compared with brain activity during ""rest."" The researchers conclude not that this particular region of the brain is involved in postmortem piscine empathizing, but that the kind of statistical thresholds commonly used in neuroimaging studies [...] are inadequate because they allow too many spurious results through the net.If that doesn't make you want to read at least a little more, I have no idea how to talk to you."

This author doesn't think so and after reading her book, I'm convinced.She says that gender distinctions continue to exist and that they start from our very beginnings - pink is for girls, blue is for boys. Gender comes to define us and these distinctions shape our abilities and interests. Certain skills are identified as male or female: Men are rational and brave; and Women are empathetic and nurturing. These assumed traits then impact our adult lives and the choices we make such as what fields to study in college, and what careers to pursue afterwards.Most alarming to the author is that the new fancy pants field of neuroscience observes physical differences in the brain between men and women and they are using those results to explain pre-conceived notions about the abilities of men vs. women instead of considering the impact of outside social forces. To create a causal relationship where none exists is to eliminate a possible true explanation before it is ever considered.A thought provoking book."

I was given, the less said the better), and whose index finger is shorter than her ring finger, but who grew up to be much better at language than math (but my mom was great at math) and is more empathetic than competitive, I've always found these gender assumptions questionable, as I seem to be all over the board.

Many different studies are discussed in some detail and lots of flaws in those studies are shown: lack of controls and/or statistical power, multiple testing, the general problems of fMRI, alternative explanations fitting the data as well or even better etc. Recommended for: everyone who likes to see overselling scientific claims destroyed, people who want to disarm the arguments of those who believe in inherent gender differences.

Fine expertly destroys so-called 'evidence' that gender is a product solely of differences in female and male brains, using neuroscience and clear experimental examples. As intelligent and involved as it is, nonetheless this book is accessible, easy to comprehend and - because of Fine's voice and narrative style - a swift and compelling read. I shall be recommending to everyone. "

There is much in current popular literature suggesting gender differences are innate, therefore we should adapt to them. This book treats us to even more of this kind of thinking found in the older literature, which looks absurd to modern eyes. The author asks if the modern stuff is really much different. She has two main points: Neuroscience is not nearly advanced enough to reach any conclusions that link brain structure to behaviour. And it is difficult to distinguish between genetic and culturally acquired characteristics from observing society, because there are so many confounding factors and sources of bias. So what is all this recent writing really based on?Things Don’t Seem So Bad in My BubbleI appear to live in a bubble. The reports I read about sexual discrimination and harassment are shocking, and do not reflect my personal experience. I realize that my brain’s shrivelled left hemisphere renders me oblivious to any social interaction that is not blindingly obvious, but I am married to a successful female senior manager. We even talk sometimes (when she makes me). I don’t hear much about discrimination, while I do hear about a lot else. And there are plenty of women in senior positions where she works. But society is not uniform, and large parts of it are clearly very different from where I stand.Beyond Reason: Why I Would See it That WayWhy is gender stereotyping so persistent when many of us claim to have moved beyond that? She tells us,
“One can be reflective about explicitly held (rational) knowledge, and it may be reasonably consistent. However, associative knowledge seems to be fairly indiscriminate about what it takes on board. So you may not be consciously sexist, yet sexist patterns you have unconsciously picked up may assert themselves.”
Our unconscious attitudes are learned when we are young, and they are learned from the behaviour one sees, not the words our parents or schools use to tell us how they think we should be. Now in our daily lives our choices are made instinctively, and the rational mind finds a justification that is not sexist. Thus gender discrimination is perpetuated without us even knowing or wanting to do it.As a male systemiser, I have done the job expected of me. I will now get in touch with my feminine side and talk about personal experience. Yes, personal anecdotes do not add up to data, but apparently there is no worthwhile data anyway, so why not?The Geek SpeaksI spent my career writing software, so the following got my attention:
“What, for example, springs to mind when you think of a computer scientist? A man, of course, but not just any man. You’re probably thinking of the sort of man who would not be an asset at a tea party. The sort of man who leaves a trail of soft-drink cans, junk-food wrappers, and tech magazines behind him as he makes his way to the sofa to watch Star Trek for the hundredth time.”
I went to a university that did not yet have a computer science department. A few friends and myself invented our own. We failed the courses we were supposed to be taking because we spent all day playing on the computers we hacked into. Need I mention that none of us were women?The reason has nothing to do with junk-food wrappers, or that the female devotes too much of her brain to emotion processing to write code. It is more about obsession. We males may or may not be better systemisers, but we are more willing to blow an entire school year to spend all day systemising about one thing. What, women can’t afford to take risks like that? Don’t be silly, they can always get married and have babies if things don’t work out. Or they can switch into social sciences, and get an easy degree doing sloppy research that verifies pre-existing beliefs. Our author delights in presenting examples of that. Oh, that was typically insensitive of me. My oxytocin levels must be low again.The only hint of truth in her paragraph is the lack of social skills of many of us in the industry. Combine obsession with that lack of social skills, and one suspects the presence of a few autism-linked genes in the crowd. But I am sure Ms. Fine can cherry-pick a few flawed autism studies to demolish that notion.One can argue that these different attitudes are entirely socially constructed. But it is also possible that something real is being socially reinforced. There is some evidence, especially from identical twin studies, which link personal characteristics to genetics. It is hard to believe that there is no sex linkage involved. It is easy to mock jumping to evolutionary conclusions about math skills or preferring pink to blue. But the human species does have a long history with a gender devoted to hunting and warfare. Add in the fact that males are expendable, and a genetic inclination toward risk taking does seem somewhat credible. Obsession may have been selected for similar reasons. Those autism genes must be there for a reason. You know, men have to focus on their hunting, while the women multitask feeding the baby while inventing agriculture, food storage and other requirements for civilization.Oops, I have slipped back into systemising again. It must be the lack of connection between my hippocampus and cerebral cortex.Empathising Has Its RewardsThere were not many female programmers where I worked, and they did not last long. They get promoted into management. Oh, the discrimination! The gender distribution at my company was interesting. As one might expect, the programmers were generally male and the quality control people were female. Were women excluded from the more creative jobs because of their sex? Perhaps the difference is that while I would think about work when I got home, they were thinking about home while they were at work. A more demanding job gets in the way. And if that is because of social conditioning, it is hardly the fault of corporate management.The other female “ghetto” at our company was in program management. This critical senior position requires both strong technical knowledge and excellent social skills to deal with our external clients. It was mainly women who had the magic to pull it off. (I suppose that more developed inferior parietal lobe makes all the difference.) The consequences of gender stereotyping, legitimate or not, can cut both ways.I lost my job there because I did not step up into a more collaborative role. I was lucky to last as long as I did happily coding away. Industry is changing, communicating and collaborating across boundaries is becoming ever more important. My stereotypical mind sees these as female qualities, but does it matter? Any company that discriminates against women is suicidal, because it needs those skills. But then, a lot of companies are slowly committing suicide. I suspect there may be a connection here.Social Skills in the Strip ClubsApparently there is an increasing tendency to use strip clubs for conducting business. Ms. Fine documents this and concludes,
“In effect, just as their fathers might have taken clients to one of the gentlemen’s clubs of Pall Mall, so brokers today take their business associates to see lap dancers. The old gentlemen’s clubs banned women – some still do – whereas the lap-dancing establishments merely intimidate them.”
My emotional reaction (yes, I do have them) is anger and disgust. Gentlemen’s clubs, for all their faults, at least had some class. Strip clubs are for scum. Reducing men to scum to preserve their pathetic privileges is beneath contempt.I can’t help wondering if some of those men are not entirely comfortable with what is going on, but feel they have little choice. It looks like nothing has changed – the bullies are still in charge.Geeks like me tend to go to Star Trek conventions rather than strip clubs, if they go anywhere at all. (I go to a book club.) We also cannot help noticing that the more sexist the man, the more women are attracted to him. (They appeal to her associative memory rather than her reason, which should know better.) Bullies get what they want. Sexism is a social skill, and one that is well rewarded. But I suspect some of these organizations are going to bully themselves into bankruptcy because they can’t keep up with a changing world. It can’t come soon enough.But there is another explanation for this behaviour: the men have been desensitized to sexual stimulation by constant exposure to pornography. For some reason Fine chooses to completely ignore this issue. So tell me, which affects men’s attitudes toward women: a dubious book by Louann Brizendine or twenty hours a week of hard-core degrading pornography?Second ThoughtsThis conclusion is being written a several weeks after the rest of the review. What I wrote above is essentially an emotional response to the book. Now the emotion has worn off, I will treat this book as the scientific work it claims to be.The material about how women are limited by social conditioning and outright repression, while socially important, leads to only one scientific insight: we cannot judge the potential of women by their present level of achievement. That is all. But it does serve to soften up the reader for her message. It worked on me.The book may serve as a needed corrective for some of the simplistic stereotyping in the name of science out there. But is it also guilty of similar distortion in pursuit of an agenda that claims gender differences are a social construction? In other words, is this simply the other side in a culture war being fought using science as the battleground?That culture war has been raging for hundreds of years. Conservatives claim human nature is fixed, and we dare not change the ancient wisdom that keeps our impulses contained. Liberals contend that the mind is a blank slate, and humanity is perfectible with the right thinking and social intervention. I suspect those of you who like this book are really cheering that our side is beating up their side, like in a sporting event. And she is administering quite a beating. But this is an empirical question, not a matter of opinion. If you don’t understand the science, how can you possibly know if the scientific arguments here are valid?I don’t know much about neuroscience either, but I detect a number of serious warning signs pointing to a lack of objectivity. Despite the cheery tone, this book mainly consists of an unrelenting attack on any viewpoint that suggests gender differences are innate. It is hard to tell when she is criticizing scientific studies or amateur opinion, which has the effect of implying that the dumbest ideas are also the opinions of any scientists she is opposed to. This kind of polarization has no place in science. A look at the author’s publication list shows mainly commentaries rather than research, mainly aimed at a popular audience. This looks more like a campaigner rather than a scientist.Good science writing shows a passion for understanding the subject and a desire to explain it to the reader. There is none of that here. Instead, explanations are presented only as necessary for the reader to understand the words in her debunking effort. She overwhelms the reader with the sheer volume of scientific information. But volume does not add up to truth if that information is selective.I do not know to what degree gender differences are innate. Who knows, maybe our author has it mostly right. I simply cannot not trust this work to tell me that. Even when she tells me that neuroscience is not advanced enough to draw conclusions about gender, my response is that seems reasonable, but I will look elsewhere to find out. [A quick look suggests she is wrong.]This book is a great reminder that there is a lot of bad science writing out there. Unfortunately it is also a good example of that, yet another example of science corrupted by ideology."
52,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4973578-iset,5,"You've probably heard that men are just naturally better at spatial awareness and logical tasks whilst women are just naturally better at verbal and nurturing tasks. You've probably heard that men and women's brains are different. You may even have heard exasperated parents trying out gender neutral parenting exclaiming that their little girl/boy just seems to naturally gravitate towards pink dolls/blue trucks - it must be biological! Delusions of Gender debunks it all, delving into the real science behind these spurious claims.The book is divided into three sections. First, the sociological and psychological studies of gender differences. How are we to explain, for example, the fact that men seem to consistently do well in maths and women in verbal reasoning? It turns out - quite easily. The notion that men are better at certain things and women are better at other things is an entrenched stereotype. Consistently, in a scientific testing environment, when groups are primed before the test to buy into these stereotypes, they conform to cultural and societal demands of their gender - but when the groups are primed beforehand with a statement that no gender differences have ever been found, then both men and women defy the stereotypes and perform better even than the other gender at tasks that their own gender is supposedly bad at. This result bears out over countless tests, and reveals that when a categorised group is placed under 'stereotype threat', the distracting negative thinking that results significantly impacts on their performance in a given task - conversely, when the group is relaxed and not under threat, their true abilities are freed. There's more. When asked to self-report about how analytical/empathising they are, men and women will report that they fall into the stereotypes about their gender. However, when rigorous scientific is set up - for example, unwittingly recording two individuals in a room, after the fact asking one to note down their thoughts as they watch back the video, and then asking the other to guess what the first was thinking; both men and women show the same amount of ability to read people's faces and intuit their emotional state. In other words, self-reporting is unreliable as a true test of gender differences, and many tests claiming to prove a difference are unscientific, inadvertantly priming the subjects beforehand to perform according to existing social pressures.Okay, so social pressure is affecting people. But what about all that medical evidence that men and women's brains are different? It's actually very flimsy. Testosterone testing of babies in utero is not actually done by testing the baby's blood - but by testing the mother's blood, or the amniotic content. There are significant problems with several of the studies involving scanning the brains of adults - such as some studies only using female test subjects and not comparing against men in any way. Other studies are post-mortem. Several employ circular reasoning in their write ups to assert some sort of gender difference. ""But I've seen those different coloured scan images of male versus female brains on the internet!"" you may cry.
""It’s important to realise that the patches of colour you see on brain scans don’t actually show brain activity. Although it may seem as though fMRI and PET enable you to see a snapshot of the brain at work (or, as popular writers Allan and Barbara Pease claim, ‘to see your brain operating live on a television screen’), this simply isn’t the case. ‘Unfortunately, these pretty pictures hide the sausage factory’, as one neurologist put it. fMRI doesn’t measure neuronal activity directly. Instead, it uses a proxy: changes in blood oxygen levels. (PET uses a radioactive tracer isotope, which attaches itself to glucose or water molecules, to indirectly track blood flow.) Busier neurons need more oxygen and (after an initial dip) active brain regions have higher levels of oxygenated blood, because blood flow to that area increases. The oxygen is carried by the haemoglobin in red blood cells, and haemoglobin has slightly different magnetic qualities depending on how much oxygen it’s carrying. This creates a signal in the scanner (which pulses a magnetic field on and off). Neuroscientists then compare the difference in blood flow in brain regions during the task they’re interested in, with blood flow during a control task or rest state. (Ideally, the control task involves everything the experimental task entails – button pressing, word reading and so on – except for the psychological process you’re particularly interested in.) Researchers test for significant differences in blood flow in various locations of the brain regions during the two tasks, and if tests indicate that it is significant, a blob of colour is placed at the appropriate location on the picture of the brain. In other words, those coloured spots on the brain represent statistical significance at the end of several stages of complicated analysis – which means there’s plenty of scope for spurious findings of sex differences in neuroimaging research.""
Moreover, for every 1 neuroscience study claiming to find a difference between genders, there are 19 where both men and women were tested, no difference was discovered, and since the researcher's topic of interest was something other than gender differences the write up does not draw attention to the result - that no gender differences were found. The studies that do claim to find a difference also receive significantly more attention from people specifically looking for evidence to prove biological gender differences, and because the topic is so hot in our modern world.Alright, so neuroscience evidence is flimsy at best, and psychological testing of adults is unreliable unless performed with proper rigour. But what about children? Haven't there been tests of babies that show they prefer blue trucks/pink dolls? Unfortunately many of the tests claiming to prove such are also highly suspect. One study, for example, tested 3 month old male and female babies to see whether they preferred a Human face or a geometric mobile. Lo and behold, the male babies seemed to prefer the mobile, whilst female babies seemed to prefer the faces. Aha! But the face and the mobiles were presented to the babies separately, not simultaneously as is usual in such tests to truly determine if a baby prefers one thing over another - it's impossible therefore to say whether a preference was displayed. Furthermore, the researchers in the study knew what gender each baby they tested was, and there's reason to suspect they themselves may have been biasing the results by presenting a more friendly face to the female babies and moving the mobile around more with the male babies - creating the result they expected to see. Oh. Oh, indeed. More scientifically rigorous studies of babies' habits show that there is no difference in a six month old's preference between trucks and dolls - but this does kick in from around 9 months onwards. Is it nature asserting itself over nurture? Well, no. Another study tested whether babies truly do prefer a female face over a male one (i.e. testing whether we are biologically predisposed to think of women in a nurturing role). The babies seemed to prefer the female face - but all the babies in the first test group were being looked after primarily by their mothers. The test was repeated with babies who were being primarily raised by their fathers - those babies preferred male faces. Consistently, the results show environment over biology is the determining factor.The mother who had attempted gender neutral parenting only to wail; ""In the end I found her tucking the toy truck into bed and cuddling it! It must be biology!"" was asked by a shrewd researcher whether, in that household, one of the parents did most of the putting to bed - of course, it turned out the mother always put her daughter to bed. The fact of the matter is, even the most determined parents trying to employ gender neutral upbringing face an uphill struggle. Most actually bias the result, implicitly disapproving certain activities for their child despite outspokenly advocating them, and testing of children's reactions to words versus body language clearly demonstrates that they pick up on implict cues much more than verbal ones. Even with dedicated parents, the outside world is often intent on reinforcing gender roles, from multinational companies to the disapproving looks of less progressive parents. Gender is in fact the most strongly emphasised of any of the ways of categorising people, and children pick up on this from an exceptionally young age - it therefore becomes important for them to seek out clues about how to discover a person's gender and how to identify themselves, so they can fit in with a social group and be accepted - even when the parents at home are encouraging them to explore all kinds of play and activities.I'm going to conclude with the account of a couple who went the extra mile in their determination to raise their son and daughter in a truly gender neutral environment. Sandra and Daryl Bem, two psychologists;
""did all that they could to reduce the normally ubiquitous gender associations in their children’s environment: the information that lets children know what toys, behaviours, skills, personality traits, occupations, hobbies, responsibilities, clothing, hairstyles, accessories, colours, shapes, emotions and so on go with being male and female. This entailed, at its foundation, a meticulously managed commitment to equally shared parenting and household responsibilities. Trucks and dolls, needless to say, were offered with equal enthusiasm to both children; but also pink and blue clothing, and male and female playmates. Care was taken to make sure that the children saw men and women doing cross-gender jobs. By way of censorship, and the judicious use of editing, WhiteOut and marker pens, the Bems also ensured that the children’s bookshelves offered an egalitarian picture-book world... The second part of the Bems’ strategy was to, in place of the usual information about what it means to be male or female, promote the idea that the difference between males and females lies in their anatomy and reproductive functions. Your typical preschooler enjoys a detailed knowledge of gender roles, but remains a bit hazy regarding the hard, biological fact that males differ from females when it comes to the allocation of such items as penises, testicles and vaginas.'[O]ur son Jeremy, then age four, … decided to wear barrettes [hair slides] to nursery school. Several times that day, another little boy told Jeremy that he, Jeremy, must be a girl because ‘only girls wear barrettes.’ After trying to explain to this child that ‘wearing barrettes doesn’t matter’ and that ‘being a boy means having a penis and testicles,’ Jeremy finally pulled down his pants as a way of making his point more convincingly. The other child was not impressed. He simply said, ‘Everybody has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.’'Unlike their peers, Jeremy and Emily were discouraged from using socially determined trappings such as hairstyle, clothing, accessories or profession as a guide to a person’s biological sex. If the children asked whether someone was male or female, their parents ‘frequently denied certain knowledge of the person’s sex, emphasizing that without being able to see whether there was a penis or a vagina under the person’s clothes, [they] had no definitive information.’Step forward, please, all those parents who go to similar lengths to protect their children from acquiring prevailing cultural assumptions about gender. And do try to avoid being trampled in the rush. The Bems’ efforts, I think you’ll agree, seriously outclass what we normally, generously, think of as gender-neutral parenting... The intensity and scope of the Bems’ efforts offer a helpful hint as to just how gendered children’s environments are. To this day social structure, media and peers offer no shortage of information to children about masculinity and femininity.""

53,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"Delusions of Gender: The Real Science Behind Sex Differences by Cordelia Fine“Delusions of Gender” is an outstanding book that compels you to take a closer look at society and our science as it relates to gender issues. Academic psychologist and author, Dr. Cordelia Fine with a sharp sense of humor and an excellent grasp of what constitutes good science dismantles many claims of what can be considered neurosexism. This is a very provocative book as it tackles claims about male and female brains, and the gender cycle. This fascinating 371-page book is broken out into the following three parts: 1. Half-Changed World, Half-Changed Minds, 2. Neurosexism, and Recycling Gender.Positives:1. Engaging, witty, and provocative book. This is also a well-researched book that is not afraid to tackle head on popular misconceptions on gender.2. A fascinating and often misunderstood topic of sex differences.3. The science is accessible and the narrative flows nicely thanks to an infusion of humor. The book is also full of interesting anecdotes.4. Great use of counter-research to combat what Dr. Fine has concluded is poor science.5. One of the best features of this book is Dr. Fine’s relentless research against commonly held misconceptions by well-known scientists and authors. She makes a very compelling case against at best poor science or worst pseudoscience.6. Makes the very strong case on how society can impact associative memory. “Unlike explicitly held knowledge, where you can be reflective and picky about what you believe, associative memory seems to be fairly indiscriminate in what it takes on board. Most likely, it picks up and responds to cultural patterns in society, media and advertising, which may well be reinforcing implicit associations you don’t consciously endorse.” “When gender is salient in the environment, or we categories someone as male or female, gender stereotypes are automatically primed.”7. The impact of stereotypes. “Research suggests that the deadly combination of ‘knowing-and-being’ (women are bad at math and I am a woman) can lower performance expectations, as well as trigger performance anxiety and other negative emotions.”8. A look at mothers versus single women. “While parenthood served as no disadvantage at all to men, there was evidence of a substantial ‘motherhood penalty’. Mothers received only half as many callbacks as their identically qualified childless counterparts.”9. The reality of sexual harassment.10. Covers many issues regarding gender equality, including at home. “As Gloria Steinem recently reminded a journalist, “The idea of having it all never meant doing it all. Men are parents, too, and actually women will never be equal outside the home until men are equal inside the home.” Great quote.11. So are there biological roots to gender inequality? This is a recurring theme in the book.12. The reality is that there is a lot of poor science involving gender issues. “There’s something a little shocking about the discrepancy between the weakness of the scientific data on the one hand and the strength of the popular claims on the other.”13. A fascinating look at Neurosexism. “The sheer complexity of the brain makes interpreting and understanding the meaning of any sex differences we find in the brain a very difficult task.” “Neurosexism promotes damaging, limiting, potentially self-fulfilling stereotypes.”14. The file-drawer phenomenon. “This contributes to the so-called file-drawer phenomenon, whereby studies that do find sex differences get published, but those that don’t languish unpublished and unseen in a researcher’s file drawer.”15. Debunks myths with glee. “So let us, with healthy skepticism, summarize all of this as clearly as we can. Nonexistent sex differences in language lateralization, mediated by nonexistent sex differences in corpus callosum structure, are widely believed to explain nonexistent sex differences in language skills.” “The speculations of a few scientists quickly evolve into the colorful fabrications of popular neurosexism – the subspecialty within the larger discipline of neurononsense.”16. The four basic pieces of advice for anyone considering incorporating neuroscientific findings into a popular book or article about gender.17. One of the most astute observations of the books, too good not to share. “Genes don’t determine our brains (or our bodies), but they do constrain them. The developmental possibilities for an individual are neither infinitely malleable nor solely in the hands of the environment. But the insight that thinking, behavior and experiences change the brain, directly, or through changes in genetic activity, seems to strip the word ‘hardwiring’ of much useful meaning. As neurophysiologist Ruth Bleier put it over two decades ago, we should ‘view biology as potential, as capacity and not as static entity. Biology itself is socially influenced and defined; it changes and develops in interaction with and response to our minds and environment, as our behaviors do. Biology can be said to define possibilities but not determine them; it is never irrelevant but it is also not determinant.” Read that again, and again.18. A look at parenting. “It seems, then, that gender stereotypes, even if perhaps only implicitly held, affect parents’ behavior towards their babies.”19. Interesting facts that have an impact. “The Dr. Seuss books are rightly classics, adored by children and a joy of rediscovery for parents. Yet as Lamb and Brown observe, in all the forty-two books he wrote, not one has a female lead in its central story.”20. Copious amounts of notes and they are linked. A comprehensive bibliography.Negatives:1. Very little not to like about this excellent book but I would have probably started with defining the differences between key terms like sex and gender. The layperson tends to use these terms indiscriminately.2. The book does a phenomenal job of at the very least casting doubt or outright debunking commonly held misconceptions on gender issues; however, it doesn’t succeed nowhere near as well on defining the real science behind sex differences.3. Using scientific claims from centuries ago to debunk easily comes across as strawman arguments or low hanging fruits to grab on to.4. At times I feel she doesn’t necessarily apply the same amount of scrutiny to those studies that support her argument versus those that don’t. I prefer the instances where she simply states that we just don’t know.In summary, this was truly an eye opening and cognitive-dissonance inducing book. One of the great things I take from this book is to not fall prey to poor science and specifically, be alert of neurosexism. I’m not a neuroscience to know if all the conclusions that Dr. Fine makes are sound or not, but she is very persuasive and the book made me think. Witty, provocative and just fun to read, I highly recommend it!Further suggestions: “Science and Gender” by Ruth Bleier, “The Myths of Gender” and “Sexing the Body” by Gisela Kaplan, “Gene Worship” by Lesley Roger, “Sexual Science” by Cynthia Russett, and “The Social Psychology of Gender” by Laurie Rudman and Peter Glick. These books were recommended notably by the author."

It makes sense to me.There're a lot of dog-ears and underlines, but some of them are angry marks. I got very frustrated with about the middle two-fourths of it. The first fourth and the last fourth, I was much more interested in.The last fourth was what I thought the entire book was to be about---about how society and subtle clues train modern ""gender identity."" Because, dude, kids are sponges.The first one-fourth had some great lines and sentiments I agreed with, at their base. That is, perception is reality.The middle two-fourths? (Okay, I'd say, half, but it sounds wrong, since it's in the middle.) Yeah, that frustrated the ever-loving shit out of me. Because it seemed (to me, at least) she spent all that time leading up to making a point that I already knew. And I kept thinking, over an over, what she waited to say until the end of all that.And it just about killed me.Basically, I'm a fucking amateur, and I know that the way you live your life---your thought processes change the way your brain works. That is to say, nothing is hard-wired.Guess what; you spend your life obsessing over math, and the parts of your brain that deal with math are going to be larger than someone who's not obsessed with math, Einstein.So the fact that she laid it on thick, and laid on all this evidence, without just saying that until the end, just about killed me.Well, now, if she'd said it in the beginning of that section and went on, I would have had no problem. It just---it kept making me wonder if she was ever even going to point that out.And it drove me nuts.A mild frustration had nothing to do with her, but with a few of experiments they carried out. I mean, yeah, I was frustrated with the (sometimes) wild interpretations of some of them (as I was meant to be), but there were a few that hit me, personally. A few for which, all I could think, ""And then they had one more step to do."" Especially with the empathy tests. Oh, I could come up with such an awesome empathy test...There were even a couple of times that Fine really let me down. One, when she cited the behavior of rats to prove her point. And then, later, when rats didn't quite prove her point, she mentions how we really can't equate the behavior of rats to humans. It made me sad, because she had a point both times, but... Oof.Lots of good stuff, but a lot of frustration as well. And not nearly as much ""hard information"" as I was expecting. At least, not the kind I was expecting, because the kind of hard information I was looking forward to was only in the last quarter of the book. And there was not nearly as much of it as I had been hoping for. It barely went beyond what I already knew. It didn't challenge me the way I was hoping to be challenged.But enough of that. Let's end on my favorite line of the book. It has to do with the Bem children, who were raised as just about as ""gender nuetral"" as anyone could ever manage. The boy tells a classmante, "" 'being a boy means having a penis and testicles.' ""The boy who was critisizing him for wearing barrettes to nursery school comes back with, ""Everyone has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.""That right there made the whole book for me.Anyway, the point of the rating is not that I really liked it, but that I really like that it exists."
55,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,5,"I was really impressed with ‘Delusions of Gender’. It dissects and summarises research clearly, critiques stereotypes intelligently and analytically, and keeps the tone witty and readable yet more academic than journalistic. I found the synthesis of neuroscientific research on sex differences extremely helpful. Media articles that cheerfully claim sexist stereotypes are biological inevitabilities make me very angry. Fine channelled that same anger into writing an excellent rebuttal, which will be very useful to remember when the next wave of pseudo-scientific claims hit the papers.This book makes an excellent accompaniment to Living Dolls: The Return of Sexism, which focuses more on the societal implications of biological determinism-based sexism. It also brings up the important debate about applying scientific methodologies to research questions that are based on unquestioned stereotypes and assumptions. An example of this is the use of 'masculinity' as an objective index, like height and weight. As Fine states, including fMRI scans makes any research findings appear more weighty and scientific. Yet inferring major psychological differences between the sexes from disputed differences in brain structure is very problematic. The brain and the mind are not congruent. I’d also pick out for praise the latter chapters on young children learning about gender. That was not something I’d ever really thought about before, but of course kids observe how carefully adults sort people into the ‘man’ and ‘woman’ boxes. This part of the book includes amusing summaries of research investigating whether and/or why girls play more with ‘girl toys’ and boys with ‘boy toys’. I particularly liked the idea that some researchers made a My Little Pony into a desirable boy’s toy by painting it black, trimming its mane, and sharpening its teeth. Conversely, girls were ‘enchanted by… the lavender-satin-covered guns and holster, and the pink furred war helmet’. By the age of five, these children had picked up from their surrounding the sexual dimorphism of toys. As Fine points out, even clothes for newborns are gendered. She makes a strong argument for social over biological gender determinism.Apologies for eliding sex and gender in the paragraph above. Fine does not critique the gender binary or cover intersectionality issues in much depth, as these are not the focus of her book. Neither are they ever mentioned (that I’ve seen) by media articles that oversimplify and distort neuroscience to excuse sexism. Nonetheless, similar effects (regarding ‘stereotype threat’ for example) are noted to impact on women and ethnic minorities in the earlier chapters covering sociological research. There’s clearly a lot more work needed in the fields of sociology and neuroscience, but I agree with Fine that scientists have a responsibility to consider their unwitting assumptions about gender. As well as the ways in which their findings will be treated by a depressingly sexist media."
56,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie,4,"All those studies that say that women are bad at math and men are bad at relationships because their brains are hardwired that way can be very discouraging, and there are a LOT of those studies. But Cordelia Fine has looked into those studies and found flaws in them. Add into that a large number of studies that show how easy it is to jigger people’s minds into doing better or worse at tasks depending on how they are psychologically primed before hand and we can see where the author is coming from. Fine’s thesis is rather than there being any physical difference between male and female brains, the differences that we see in math scores are there because our culture expects them to be there. Even when people attempt to raise their children in a gender neutral environment, culture intervenes. On TV, in schools, in children’s books, in the clothing sold to children- everything is divided into genders, and females end up less adventuresome, more nurturing, expected to be nicer and not fight, and to focus on home and caring rather than invented and discovering. Toys for girls and boys are separated, and children who choose to play with toys for the opposite gender are disapproved of, especially boys who play with dolls or other ‘girl’ toys. Tomboys may be told to act more ladylike, but boys will get beat up by other boys. The core of her argument is that studies where test takers are primed to consider themselves members of sets other than gender yield different results than tests taken when the test takers are told things like “men traditionally do better on this test”. For instance, when a group of males and females take a test and are told before hand that people who go to certain colleges (colleges that some of the test takers go to) do better on this same test, the test takers conform to this and the males and females who belong to the colleges mentioned both do better on the test than the non-certain collegians- and the males and females in that group score the same as each other on the test under these conditions. These tests have been done numerous times by different researchers, and the results are always the same- the test takers conform to expectations set up before the test. Therefore, psychology trumps brain structure where intellectual subjects are concerned. It’s an interesting proposition, and one I think needs to be investigated more- much more. There’s a lot still to be untangled in gender studies. Intellectual abilities are jumbled in with emotional tendencies, and I definitely think they should be considered separately. She pretty much ignores the effect of hormones on emotional states except for the case of fetal testosterone. I think that while this book doesn’t settle any gender issue questions, it does cast a lot of doubt on previous studies and urges us to look at them much harder."
57,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237879-elaine-nelson,5,"I happened to run across this book at the library having forgotten that it was in my ""to-read"" list. I'm SO glad I did, and given a certain pair of somewhat ranty posts a couple of months back, only wish I'd read it sooner! I literally could not put it down - as in: ""no really, I need to go to bed/back to my desk from lunch/off the bus, I have to put the book away.""In short, social construction of gender: you're soaking in it. (And especially, your brain is soaking in it.)1) Priming & stereotype threat affect everything. Just checking gender on a form before taking a test changes womens' performance, especially on math tests. More priming (being told that the test relates to gender, watching a gender-stereotyped commercial, etc) increases the effect.2) Most of the ""science"" as it's filtered through to the popular media is a disaster of half-baked assumptions, small and/or poorly-constructed experiments, and willful misunderstanding of the actual results. (She tears apart one popular writer; it's kinda fun.)3) Worse, those lame results create a feedback loop, combined with the impossibility of gender-neutral child-rearing, that increases the problem of stereotype threat, and makes genuine social change more difficult.Le sigh. Not only is the feminist struggle not over, we may actually be hitting a really hard spot.On the plus side, I'm fired up now. Not just that, but I'm thinking more about my own personal construction of gender identity, including my history with math and science. There's a post I wrote about my life with math a while back, and there I wrote about it as a choice between writing and math - now I'm seriously looking back and wondering about the effect of gender stereotypes, and whether I might have come to computing sooner given different circumstances. I think it's worth noticing that choices exist in a constrained environment, constrained both by the external world, and by our own unexamined or incompletely-formed attitudes.As for the writing style, it's a delightful read. She's got a sharp conversational tone that pulled me in; I even read the footnotes.HIGHLY recommended, great in combination with Pink Brain Blue Brain."
58,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5324619-noor,5,"""Delusions of Gender"" has proved to be one of the most informative and interesting books I've read this year. The book consists of three parts that essentially discuss gender-stereotypes, Neurosexism, and the struggles of attempting to raise children in a gender-neutral environment.Cordelia starts by explaining how implicit and explicit beliefs are two separate things that don't always correlate. Despite ""consciously"" holding certain beliefs, there is a clash between the reflective self and our associative memory which is heavily influenced by the social environment surrounding us. When gender becomes salient and constantly primed in our daily life, it seeps into our perception of others and of ourselves, and we often do it in stereotypical ways. The book is filled with numerous experiments that support this idea. When we categorise people as male or female, we are instantly activating gender associations that affect our behaviour, values, performance etc. A perfect manifestation of this activated gender-inequality is how women are treated in a workplace dominated by men. Women experience segregation, exclusion, harassment and attack just by showing up to work basically.The second part of the book focuses on neurosexism and was the most difficult for me to digest; simply because I was unaware of just how much these popular neuroscientific claims are based on shaky empirical evidence. Gender stereotypes are legitimised by these pseudo-scientific explanations, and often become part of popular media. Neurosexism activates gender stereotypes which feeds into the public sphere + affects attitudes, identity & performance. It all leads us to become our own self-fulfilling prophecies.And the last bit of the book should be read by all parents who try to raise their children in a gender-neutral environment. It goes way beyond giving boys barbie dolls and giving girls fire trucks.All in all, this was an eye-opener for me when it comes to neuroscience and how it's used to reinforce old-fashioned stereotypes/roles through covering them with the finery of science.PS: Cordelia is quite witty. Found myself laughing out loud at times."
59,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4508080-julie-bozza,5,"A bit of a hard slog to read, especially as the few moments of humour didn't really suit me (too sarcastic). However, the important thing is that Fine makes vital headway towards an understanding of gender that I can really get behind. Gender difference is not 'hardwired' into us, and Fine deftly demolishes the pseudo-science that tells us otherwise. Fine quotes Kimmel in asserting 'gender difference is the product of gender inequality'; that is, we create and recreate gender difference while interacting with our society. The process begins at such an early age that many new parents, no matter how gender-neutral they try to be, end up assuming that gender difference is biologically or neurologically innate in their children. Fine does a good job of explaining why this happens, and how it will ultimately be worth it if we keep plugging away the gender-neutral objective. Fine also articulates how permeable the boundaries can be between our own sense of self and society's sense of who we are - or should be. I've struggled to articulate my struggles with this, but I've often felt like an asymmetrical heptagonal peg who is nevertheless forced (by otherwise well-meaning folk) to fit into the round hole that society makes available to me. Gender is certainly one aspect of this. My social sciences tutor told me I was making too much of the external forces - but now I've found Fine to back me up and explore the implications, and I feel inordinately grateful. Lastly, Fine ends with a note of hope. While she has shown how deeply woven gender difference (and hence gender inequality) is in our society, she has also shown that it is malleable. We can change this, though it will take time and effort. Let's keep trying! I would love to see what we can become when we are so much freer to be ourselves, whoever we may be."
60,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Subtitle: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference. Cordelia Fine, while an apparently well-read and quite competent scientist, makes no pretense of objectivity in this book. She's got an axe to grind with a whole school of research that aims to use modern brain science to convince us that male and female brains are intrinsically, fundamentally, and irrevocably different. Oh, and I also think the picture of her on the dust jacket is pretty hot. I just love imagining her getting all worked up about this. Wait, did I say that out loud?Anyway, Fine's point is best illustrated by an anecdote from the experience of a four year old named Jeremy, who had been raised by parents who were extraordinarily zealous gender-neutral parents. He decided one day to wear barrettes to nursery school, and gets into an argument with another boy, who says that he is a girl. Finally, Jeremy pulls down his pants and points out that he has a penis, as a way of making his point. The other boy says, “Everybody has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.”Whether you think the parents who let their boy wear barrettes to school were weird here, or the society that teaches a boy that the difference between male and female has more to do with hairstyle than genitals, depends on your opinions about gender (and society) generally. So does a lot of other (less amusing but more substantial) evidence, published in scientific journals or mainstream media, that Fine takes us on a tour of.Some of it is related to the general fallacy of all brain-scan evidence. Just because we see a difference in brain activity (using MRI or some other method), doesn't mean it's genetic or otherwise hardwired. All it shows is that it happens in the brain, and really, if we're talking about thoughts, attitudes, emotions, and so forth, where else would we expect it to happen? Also, like muscles, areas of the brain can grow larger or smaller over time as they are used more or less (whether for cultural reasons or any other), so again evidence from brain scans, while perhaps useful for other purposes, tells us nothing about whether differences in behavior are primarily biological or cultural. Seeing a brain scan, however, tells us that it has something to do with biology, and our instinctive reaction is still to divide things into biological and cultural, and if it's one it must not be the other.There is a long and well-documented history of scientific attempts to explain to us why women and men are Just Different, in ways that have nothing (directly) to do with procreation. The suspicious thing is that, while the rationales differ from decade to decade and from one century to the next, the conclusions always point in the same direction. Fine takes us on a thoroughly readable tour of this history, spiced up a bit by her, at times, barely contained rage.Make no mistake, this is not an even-handed weighing of the evidence; it is rather a very well-documented and data-driven polemic. If it were written by a man, I'd say that the confrontational and science-oriented analysis is very typical of a masculine style. Instead, I'll say it's an emotional treatment, showing a feminine inability to maintain objectivity on scientific topics. Either way, it's a hoot to read."
61,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6537005-daniel,3,"""Delusions of Gender"" is an engaging read, well-written and incisive. Cordelia Fine makes a convincing argument that gender differences in performance assessed through various metrics are to a large extent the result of social cues, reactions to internalized stereotypes, and unconscious priming. Her critique of studies of gender differences in psychological experiments is comprehensive, and her depiction of the current state of sexism is both convincing and often horrifying.Unfortunately, her fixation on discrediting both contemporary pop-psychology books selling innate gender differences and the arguments of dusty sexists from centuries past comes off a bit like clubbing baby seals (or possibly arm-wrestling five-year-olds). Her arguments against current neuroscientific techniques--especially neuroimaging using techniques like fMRI--fall particularly flat, as she relies repeatedly upon equating sophisticated real-time 3d measurements of blood-flow in the brain with crude volumetric measurements of skull capacity used by those sexist scientists of yore. This is trite and annoying.Likewise, she fails to engage biological and evolutionary arguments in any meaningful sense, instead relying on the tired allegation that evolutionary psychology and biology are only sexist justifications for relegating women to lives of domestic drudgery. She perhaps hopes that her readers are not savvy enough to Wikipedia the fields. Her argument that structural differences between the brains of men and women (after criticizing imaging and anatomical studies, she grudgingly admits that these do exist) compensate for differences in physiology to produce similar behaviors in males and females is interesting and may even be true to some extent--humans male and female, after all, must accomplish many of the same tasks to survive--but is unsupported and feels like hand-waving. She does not engage with the concepts of hormonal modulation of brain activity or neurotransmitter/receptor distribution and prevalence to any great degree. She brushes off the striking possibility that biological differences may predispose men and women toward different goals irrespective of nebulous measures of aptitude or spurious notions of ""natural gender roles."" The human brain she seems to prefer is the black box too intricate to be understood on a mechanistic level, a network of abstract associations accessible only to psychologists distributing questionnaires and bubble sheets to college students participating in studies for course credit.So, while entertaining (and perhaps convincing to audiences disinclined to read it critically or who already embrace its ideological underpinnings), the book's thesis does not strike home, and Fine's claim that it is dangerous for researchers to ask these questions at all should be disturbing to any reader who values science over ideology."

If I had read this in audio, a format my brain can handle for serious subjects, I probably would have rated it much higher, and gotten through it much faster (and I'll be honest, retained more than 10% of it). So take this review with a grain of salt. (P.S. I just googled that phrase, and it evolved from something Pliny the Elder wrote in 77 A.D. Language is so weird.) I will be trying it again maybe in a couple of years by audio. Unless someone can point me in the direction of a book on the same subject that is more recent that I should read first (this was published in 2010).Aside from that issue, this book is also less of a thing on its own than it is the author debunking other scientific studies or books, things that people take as a given, or as ""proven"" by science. Cognitive bias plays a huge role not only in the behavior of test subjects, but in the minds of the scientists performing the studies. Which is enjoyable in its own way, but not quite what I was expecting. The book is very heavy on cautioning the reader about these types of studies, since gender is so hard to study, and really just instills a healthy amount of scientific skepticism. I remember it being a lot of, this isn't proven, we actually don't ""know"" as much as we think we do.I can't emphasize how much my brain did not retain any of the information I read, so this is really just a useless review. Judging by my friends' reviews on Goodreads, I just really need to give it a break, and then pick this up again some time down the road when my brain is being more amenable."

Honestly though, some male scientists... if you have to create and pursue patently absurd theories about differences in the brain to justify why you can't patiently listen to your wife or make your kids a sandwich, that's pretty undeniably pathetic.

66,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113545-nancy,5,"READ IT.Cordelia Fine's examination of the many popular books and research studies which purport to prove that the male and female brains might as well belong to different species is simply brilliant. I gobbled this non-fiction up like it was a light lunch after a hard day's manual labor. Every page was packed with jaw-dropping information - horrifying methodological flaws, research which argues two diametrically opposed concepts, and outright deception, all designed to prove that men and women are not and cannot possibly be equal. Like, here's one example: Fine mentions the author of a popular book on the subject, who cites research about ""mirror neurons,"" (women have more of them, which supposedly makes them more empathetic.) The author mentions a study of therapists which indicated that the most successful therapists are those that ""mirror"" their clients words, gestures, and verbal patterns. Interestingly, (says the author), ALL of the successful therapists were women. Because they have more mirror neurons, and are more attuned to others, right?WRONG. Cordelia Fine looked up the study (thank you, Cordelia! That would be a big nuisance for the Average Reader) and as it turns out? ALL OF THE THERAPISTS IN THE STUDY WERE WOMEN. Yeah, that's right. They only recruited women for the study, so the study proves absolutely nothing about men vs. women. And if you think this sort of thing is an anomaly, wrong again - Fine's detailed work found this sort of thing occurring over and over again. Moreover, Fine is terrific at highlighting how the social context of everything men and women do contributes to these gender stereotypes, and at explaining how gender bias affects the neuroscientific research. This is an absolutely fantastic book - I have the urge to acquire copies for every teacher, every employer, every parent on the planet. It made me rethink more of my life that I would have believed possible. Seriously, even if you think you would disagree with it: READ IT. If nothing else, you will enjoy Fine's smooth and witty prose."

If you’re the type of person who enjoys nitpicking underpowered studies over methodological errors that affect validity and throwing shade at poor referencing while also being a flagrant feminist this is for you. I am not sure how this would go down for other people without a background in neuroscience because those parts were undoubtedly my favorite although I see how that part of the book could be too technical and heavy. I didn’t learn anything new science-wise but I did discover that there still are some fucking assholes willing to forgo the science completely just in order to tell you that your female brain HAS TO KNOW HOW TO EMPATHIZE AND BE NURTURING and that of course those morons have a wide audience just dying for any shard of pseudo-evidence that may point to the fact that their daughters are meant to be breeding subservient cows and that their sons will bring about the rapture. Of course this book proves yet again the only truth known to humans besides inevitable death and that is that men are trash. Besides that, I wholeheartedly enjoyed the psychology aspects of the book and if I had any doubt about the ubiquity of gender then it was all erased in the last part where she lists study after study proving how the idea of gender and how everything is gendered almost from birth and how early toddlers take on these ideas and digest them almost regardless of how unisex parents attempt to make their environments at home; the world at large is sexist. Go figure. And then there’s the ever expanding body of evidence that simply makes it clear that women have always always always been just as capable as men and that as the gender gap closes (despite the screeching and howling of men) women find their ways into board room and ORs and mines and factories and fucking haters continue to come up with more sophisticated schemes of bullshit to make it seem like we can’t but we’re doing it anyway.

69,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14821636-andrew-fish,1,"The differences between men and women have probably been a topic of debate since the dawn of time. In recent decades, however, as society has progressed from subsistence and survival to consumerism and choice the issue has gained a degree of salience. The question of whether women are actively held down in their careers or whether they passively make decisions which close off paths to advancement becomes more than a curiosity when careers become both a means to achieve a better life and a source of fulfilment in themselves. And earlier in life, the science of gender difference could make a significant difference to educational outcomes if it could be robustly investigated. The time, it seems, is right for a good scientific look at the subject.Unfortunately, this isn't it.Fine is a psychologist by training, and whilst there's definitely scope to study the issue of gender difference through psychology, she seems reluctant to do this in any depth. The opening section of the book which nominally covers this ground is quite thin on actual studies and seems instead to rely heavily on anecdote, giving the book the feel more of a polemic rather than an academic assessment. What science there is, meanwhile, is treated in an uneven manner, promoting the studies which suit the central thesis and denigrating any which don't. Frequently, Fine goes beyond the studies and draws conclusions which aren't supported by any of the evidence she has presented.So, for example, when looking at a study about the effect of priming on women's mathematical abilities, she not only accepts the results without question, she positively crows about the fact that the women did better than the men without the priming. For this to be a valid observation, both male and female participants would have to have an even spread of intellect, presumably using some kind of test as part of the selection process. The trouble with this is that you are then pre-determining the results: if the selection test were gender-neutral, the gender-neutral part of the study would be consistent with the selection process and you would end up with roughly equal results for men and women. If the theory were correct, there would then be lower results for the women in the gender-biased part. If the selection process were not gender-neutral, meanwhile, then if the theory held the women would seem equal to the men in the selection process and better in the gender-neutral study itself.From those results you could prove that priming made a difference to the test results, but not that there was any inherent difference between male and female aptitude in itself. To go further would be circular reasoning (something Fine criticises about another study later in the book).It's like the constant claim that girls are better at school - fifty years ago, the reverse was claimed. What changed in between? The education system. Clearly there is some kind of difference between the sexes there (something Fine seems pathologically averse to) but if one system of education produced stronger male results and the other stronger female all you can say is that different methods favour the sexes differently - you can't claim this makes one superior to the other.In other places, such as the behaviour of women in male-dominated careers, it seems there are no studies Fine can draw on. By definition, you'd find it hard to create a female-dominated version of the same career for comparison, but it doesn't stop the author from coming to conclusions about the effect of those environments without anything beyond anecdote and hypothesis.The most detailed analysis in favour of her argument comes toward the end of the book, when looking at the gender stereotypes to which children are exposed in their early years and how this affects their choice of toys and sense of dress. Unfortunately, here she has narrowed the argument too much: it may be demonstrable that social forces drive boys to wear blue and girls pink, but this would hardly explain the more abstract alleged differences between the sexes. When was the last time your child came home claiming they'd been excluded from the spatial reasoning group on the basis of gender?With the results which don't suit her, the author is more exacting. When looking at a study about infant response to faces and mobile phones, for example, she casts aspersions on the methodology, hypothesises about all kinds of ways the results could have been skewed (always assuming such skews would be systematically biased in the same direction) and even implies that the experimenters could have been acting out of an unconscious gender bias themselves. Apart from the unprofessionalism of casting aspersions without evidence, it seems weak to subject a study you don't like to this level of criticism when it could have been equally true of any of the studies supporting the case. Stepping outside her field, Fine is dismissive of biological studies and applies an extremely shaky attack on neurology - regarding it as an inadequately direct proxy measure of brain activity that is subject to confirmation bias. If that's true of neurology, what it does it say about psychology as a reliable indicator? This attack allows her to dismiss any conclusions from the field she doesn't like, but again she's all too quick to accept any that she does. She constantly falls for the same fallacy, that if you can debunk a very specific prediction made by someone in a particular field, you can dismiss any evidence from that field when it doesn't suit your agenda. The constant comparisons to long-dismissed theories such as brain-pan measurement are a reductio ad absurdum argument with little logical validity and the quotes which open most chapters - generally over a century old and clearly not acceptable to modern readers - come across as an attempt to prime the reader into a form of indignation which switches off their reasoning faculties for the rest of the chapter and allows them to accept Fine's arguments without criticism. I even spotted a very old psychologists' trick - starting a sentence with ""by now you will all be thinking"" - which is a blatant attempt at manipulation of the reader.Here and there we find snippets of actual information - a chance remark about spatial reasoning differing in babies of only a few months old, for example - but unless they fit the central argument, they are passed over quickly. An anecdote about a woman having been masturbated over, by contrast, is alluded to several times across a chapter. And there's little gender-balance in the topics themselves either: apart from a brief mention of female intuition right at the beginning, the book focuses almost entirely on areas where women are alleged to be deficient. The impression given is that this is a book written by someone working out their own issues rather than dispassionately looking at the field.And this is often a problem with psychologists. Freud's obsession with mother fantasies reeked of projection, Kahneman's instinct over reason view of the brain suggests a man struggling to justify his own bad decisions. To see what Fine's problems are you need only look at the language she uses, the metaphors she chooses and the examples she latches onto. The book is riddled with misandistric metaphor and there are a number of coded attacks on her husband. Take the chapter where she envisages a hypothetical job-swap with her spouse. When looking at his ability to do her job, she attacks his literacy - comparing it to a ten year-old. She then looks at her ability to do his job, but rather than admit any limitation on her own part, she sidesteps the issue and instead turns it into another backhanded attack on her husband - in this case the likelihood of his nagging her from beyond the grave. It doesn't take a degree in psychology to spot the signs of an inferiority complex.I don't pretend to know what the biological basis for behaviour is, and I accept that there are a lot of bad studies out there and bad books using the results. But for a book whose byline is ""the real science behind gender difference"" I was expecting more than just a series of attacks. And it's a shame, because the issue is both interesting and important. In my opinion, there clearly are elements of behaviour that are inherited (how else would cuckoos transmit their parasitical tendencies?) but what that inheritance mechanism is and how far it reaches into human behaviour has, as far as I can see, yet to be established. To claim it has no effect on humans would be to think as those who attacked Darwin because whilst they could accept evolution, they felt that to claim humans were a product of evolution was a step too far. One science Fine didn't look at all is anthropology, which for anyone who is genuinely looking for the true reasons for gender difference would seem the obvious place to start. I suggest for those who are after a book which informs them rather than just gives them a reason to be angry at the state of the world, that would be a better field to explore."

The book is rich in technical detail, which might bog down some readers, but most of those details are fascinating. Fine is a lucid and entertaining writer, especially in her more acerbic moments - of which there are plenty here. She finds a lot of shoddy science and shameless misuse of would-be science that would raise the hackles of any neuroscientist or feminist, let alone someone like her who happens to be both.This is a book with an agenda, and political agendas tend not to sit comfortably with science - but to pretend that politics never seeps into science while nobody is looking would be disingenuous. In fact, Fine's agenda - to bring out the reasons to doubt science that supposedly demonstrates innate differences between sexes - is at least as much scientific as political, and I think it is legitimate. It is something to bear in mind while reading this book, though, and there are times she goes out of her way to present things in such a way as to minimise the possibility of interpretation in terms of innate differences. As far as I can see she always stops short of misrepresenting the science, though, and the whole approach needs to be seen in the context of discourse which routinely takes essential differences for granted, whether the evidence supports them or not.The book is divided into three parts. The first is 'Half-changed World', Half-Changed Minds, which largely focuses on the interplay of cultural expectations and attempts to measure sex differences scientifically. This largely consists of accounts of experiments demonstrating the effects of cultural norms on things that people might be interested in measuring, and experiments which fail to take these factors into account. For example, she looks at experiments investigating the effect of telling the subjects what 'the latest science' has to say about the sorts of tests they are about to perform, to show that girls do significantly better on mathematical tasks if they think that science says they should. Even more subtly, females rate their mathematical ability as worse after they have just been reminded of their sex by having to tick a box at the beginning to say they are females. This gives us an interesting lens for looking at gender differences in maths tests which disregard the weight of cultural expectations, and indeed at systematic tendencies for females to choose less mathematical study and career paths. Having established many profound and subtle ways that social expectations and structures shape behaviours and perfomance, the theme of the second part of the book is Neurosexism - premature efforts to explain differences in behaviour and performance with reference to the brain, rather than society. Fine's most basic point is that it is rather soon to be looking for explanations of most of these things in neuroscience, when societal explanations have not been ruled out, and the relationship between the mind and the brain is still so unclear. More than that, she shows time and again that many authors are disturbingly willing to go way beyond what neurology can tell us, while pretending that they are not. Perhaps the single worst offender here is Louann Brizendine, author of The Female Brain, a serial abuser and inventor of neuroscience to back up her ideas about the differences between males and females - but she is one of many. Fine makes the point that people have been finding 'explanations' for sex differences in the brain for well over a century, from the observation that female brains tend to be a bit lighter than male ones through to modern notions of hardwiring. At the same time, people have routinely assumed that all kinds of observed differences between the sexes are natural and inevitable, when later experience has regularly shown them to be no such thing.The final section is titled Re-Cycling Gender, and it concerns itself with the future of gender relations and the science of sex. Fine is worried about the cyclical nature of some kinds of self-fulfilling prophecy - about dodgy science being used to teach yet another generation of young men and women that there are certain natural roles that they ought to be filling, certain characteristics they should expect to have. She emphasises again how difficult it is to pick apart innate and culturally conditioned differences, and the importance of keeping an open mind about questions that science has not yet been able to settle. With a better scientific understanding of the role of society in forming the mind and the brain, and a sceptical eye on the interesting but inconclusive findings of neuroscience, we may approach true sexual equality yet. Without such circumspection, as Fine argues, we may find ourselves sliding back to ideas about the sexes which are both unhelpful and ill-founded.This is an important book, because the trend towards explaining sex differences with impressive-sounding neurological findings has great potential to set back ideas about gender roles, on the basis of evidence which is far flimsier than it might look. Because we are shaped by our ideas, this has major practical, political ramifications - it is not just good science that is at stake here. There is no doubt that some will resist Fine's approach for its politicisation of science, but I would be inclined to see it more as exploring the role of pre-existing, unexamined political bias, rather than introducing politics to the debate. Delusions of Gender is compelling, informative and perhaps most impressively, funny. I recommend this highly to anyone with any interest in neuroscience or gender.'This review first appeared at http://everything2.com/title/Delusion..."
71,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11030012-jade,4,"There have always been many (pseudo)scientific books on the shelves attempting to explain the differences between the sexes, of which the most common differences usually consist of men having a more result-orientated, mathematical approach, and women having a more relationship-orientated, emotional or empathic approach (never mind about non-binary people, queers, etc.). This is usually shown as something that’s unchangeable; something written down by genetics and made clear by the way our brains differ so much from each other. Also, some (if not most) of these books claim that that’s what also causes traditional gender roles – women are simply better suited for housework, and men better suited for business. Often, this is also where an evolutionary argument about caves, hunting, and gathering comes in.Unfortunately, the tendency to display such dated, sexist views isn’t only found in pseudoscientific writers (an example being the ever annoying book always present in every single bookstore I visit, Men Are from Mars Women Are from Venus by John Gray), but also in qualified scientists or psychologists: The Female Brain by Louann Brizendine, being a great example, or The Sexual Paradox: Extreme Men Gifted Women and the Real Gender Gap by Susan Pinker. Though I can’t deny the big influence popular ‘science’ books have on the general reading audience, as an aspiring psychologist myself, the fact that qualified psychologists spew this kind of garbage worries me intensely.Which is why I’m quite glad to have found this wonderfully well-researched book by Cordelia Fine, in which she attempts to refute many claims made by popular psychology books concerning traditional gender roles/behaviour, and differences between the sexes. Does she succeed? In my opinion, yes, and she does so with humour, solid arguments, and a critical approach. I really enjoyed the fact that she doesn’t only bring up arguments to counter interpretations and results of research used in the aforementioned popular psychology books, but she also attacks the way certain methods of research are used and interpreted (case in point: neuroimaging).A very complete, interesting, witty, and fun read. I commend Cordelia Fine for writing such a wonderfully clear answer to the dated views on the differences between the sexes, and emphasizing the importance of valid research (and the interpretation of it). I can definitely recommend this to anyone who’s interested in reading more about gender roles/behaviour."

It made me want to do a dance of joy. Also, when talking about neuroimaging experiments which supposedly prove these ""hardwired"" differences, Cordelia Fine wrote this paragraph:[...] When looking for changes in blood flow between two conditions, researchers search in thousands of tiny sections of the brain (called voxels), and many researchers are now arguing that the threshold commonly set for declaring that a difference is ""significant"" just isn't high enough. To illustrate this point, some researchers recently scanned an Atlantic salmon while showing it emotionally charged photographs. The salmon--which, by the way, ""was not alive at the time of scanning""--was ""asked to determine what emotion the individual in the photo must have been experiencing."" Using standard statistical procedures, they found significant brain activity in one small region of the dead fish's brain while it performed the empathizing task, compared with brain activity during ""rest."" The researchers conclude not that this particular region of the brain is involved in postmortem piscine empathizing, but that the kind of statistical thresholds commonly used in neuroimaging studies [...] are inadequate because they allow too many spurious results through the net.If that doesn't make you want to read at least a little more, I have no idea how to talk to you."

This author doesn't think so and after reading her book, I'm convinced.She says that gender distinctions continue to exist and that they start from our very beginnings - pink is for girls, blue is for boys. Gender comes to define us and these distinctions shape our abilities and interests. Certain skills are identified as male or female: Men are rational and brave; and Women are empathetic and nurturing. These assumed traits then impact our adult lives and the choices we make such as what fields to study in college, and what careers to pursue afterwards.Most alarming to the author is that the new fancy pants field of neuroscience observes physical differences in the brain between men and women and they are using those results to explain pre-conceived notions about the abilities of men vs. women instead of considering the impact of outside social forces. To create a causal relationship where none exists is to eliminate a possible true explanation before it is ever considered.A thought provoking book."

Fine looks at gender essentialism and at the biases of studies and media reporting, and suggests that we've been too quick to throw up our hands and say, ""but it's biological!"" If little girls have only been wearing pink for fifty years, then clearly that can't be a hard-wired preference.As a woman who preferred baby blue to pink for my childhood frilly dresses, liked to play with my brother's trucks and robots as well as my own stuffed animals (dolls are creepy and as for the toy . . . ironing board?!!! . . . I was given, the less said the better), and whose index finger is shorter than her ring finger, but who grew up to be much better at language than math (but my mom was great at math) and is more empathetic than competitive, I've always found these gender assumptions questionable, as I seem to be all over the board. Fine, writing for a popular audience, sometimes seems to skim the surface, but her work is clear, logical, and sometimes pleasantly snarky."

It always irks me if people want to use scientific publications to justify stuff like this. Not because I'd prefer them not to be true, but because I'm only too aware that making it through peer review isn't a good indicator about how well done the experiments were. Just ask Rosie Redfield and her successful push against the stupid arsenic life-stuff. Many different studies are discussed in some detail and lots of flaws in those studies are shown: lack of controls and/or statistical power, multiple testing, the general problems of fMRI, alternative explanations fitting the data as well or even better etc. Recommended for: everyone who likes to see overselling scientific claims destroyed, people who want to disarm the arguments of those who believe in inherent gender differences.

81,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25360918-blair,2,"Are Men Systemisers and Women Empathisers?We all know that men are from Mars and women are from Venus, right? There is much in current popular literature suggesting gender differences are innate, therefore we should adapt to them. This book treats us to even more of this kind of thinking found in the older literature, which looks absurd to modern eyes. The author asks if the modern stuff is really much different. She has two main points: Neuroscience is not nearly advanced enough to reach any conclusions that link brain structure to behaviour. And it is difficult to distinguish between genetic and culturally acquired characteristics from observing society, because there are so many confounding factors and sources of bias. So what is all this recent writing really based on?Things Don’t Seem So Bad in My BubbleI appear to live in a bubble. The reports I read about sexual discrimination and harassment are shocking, and do not reflect my personal experience. I realize that my brain’s shrivelled left hemisphere renders me oblivious to any social interaction that is not blindingly obvious, but I am married to a successful female senior manager. We even talk sometimes (when she makes me). I don’t hear much about discrimination, while I do hear about a lot else. And there are plenty of women in senior positions where she works. But society is not uniform, and large parts of it are clearly very different from where I stand.Beyond Reason: Why I Would See it That WayWhy is gender stereotyping so persistent when many of us claim to have moved beyond that? She tells us,
“One can be reflective about explicitly held (rational) knowledge, and it may be reasonably consistent. However, associative knowledge seems to be fairly indiscriminate about what it takes on board. So you may not be consciously sexist, yet sexist patterns you have unconsciously picked up may assert themselves.”
Our unconscious attitudes are learned when we are young, and they are learned from the behaviour one sees, not the words our parents or schools use to tell us how they think we should be. Now in our daily lives our choices are made instinctively, and the rational mind finds a justification that is not sexist. Thus gender discrimination is perpetuated without us even knowing or wanting to do it.As a male systemiser, I have done the job expected of me. I will now get in touch with my feminine side and talk about personal experience. Yes, personal anecdotes do not add up to data, but apparently there is no worthwhile data anyway, so why not?The Geek SpeaksI spent my career writing software, so the following got my attention:
“What, for example, springs to mind when you think of a computer scientist? A man, of course, but not just any man. You’re probably thinking of the sort of man who would not be an asset at a tea party. The sort of man who leaves a trail of soft-drink cans, junk-food wrappers, and tech magazines behind him as he makes his way to the sofa to watch Star Trek for the hundredth time.”
I went to a university that did not yet have a computer science department. A few friends and myself invented our own. We failed the courses we were supposed to be taking because we spent all day playing on the computers we hacked into. Need I mention that none of us were women?The reason has nothing to do with junk-food wrappers, or that the female devotes too much of her brain to emotion processing to write code. It is more about obsession. We males may or may not be better systemisers, but we are more willing to blow an entire school year to spend all day systemising about one thing. What, women can’t afford to take risks like that? Don’t be silly, they can always get married and have babies if things don’t work out. Or they can switch into social sciences, and get an easy degree doing sloppy research that verifies pre-existing beliefs. Our author delights in presenting examples of that. Oh, that was typically insensitive of me. My oxytocin levels must be low again.The only hint of truth in her paragraph is the lack of social skills of many of us in the industry. Combine obsession with that lack of social skills, and one suspects the presence of a few autism-linked genes in the crowd. But I am sure Ms. Fine can cherry-pick a few flawed autism studies to demolish that notion.One can argue that these different attitudes are entirely socially constructed. But it is also possible that something real is being socially reinforced. There is some evidence, especially from identical twin studies, which link personal characteristics to genetics. It is hard to believe that there is no sex linkage involved. It is easy to mock jumping to evolutionary conclusions about math skills or preferring pink to blue. But the human species does have a long history with a gender devoted to hunting and warfare. Add in the fact that males are expendable, and a genetic inclination toward risk taking does seem somewhat credible. Obsession may have been selected for similar reasons. Those autism genes must be there for a reason. You know, men have to focus on their hunting, while the women multitask feeding the baby while inventing agriculture, food storage and other requirements for civilization.Oops, I have slipped back into systemising again. It must be the lack of connection between my hippocampus and cerebral cortex.Empathising Has Its RewardsThere were not many female programmers where I worked, and they did not last long. They get promoted into management. Oh, the discrimination! The gender distribution at my company was interesting. As one might expect, the programmers were generally male and the quality control people were female. Were women excluded from the more creative jobs because of their sex? Perhaps the difference is that while I would think about work when I got home, they were thinking about home while they were at work. A more demanding job gets in the way. And if that is because of social conditioning, it is hardly the fault of corporate management.The other female “ghetto” at our company was in program management. This critical senior position requires both strong technical knowledge and excellent social skills to deal with our external clients. It was mainly women who had the magic to pull it off. (I suppose that more developed inferior parietal lobe makes all the difference.) The consequences of gender stereotyping, legitimate or not, can cut both ways.I lost my job there because I did not step up into a more collaborative role. I was lucky to last as long as I did happily coding away. Industry is changing, communicating and collaborating across boundaries is becoming ever more important. My stereotypical mind sees these as female qualities, but does it matter? Any company that discriminates against women is suicidal, because it needs those skills. But then, a lot of companies are slowly committing suicide. I suspect there may be a connection here.Social Skills in the Strip ClubsApparently there is an increasing tendency to use strip clubs for conducting business. Ms. Fine documents this and concludes,
“In effect, just as their fathers might have taken clients to one of the gentlemen’s clubs of Pall Mall, so brokers today take their business associates to see lap dancers. The old gentlemen’s clubs banned women – some still do – whereas the lap-dancing establishments merely intimidate them.”
My emotional reaction (yes, I do have them) is anger and disgust. Gentlemen’s clubs, for all their faults, at least had some class. Strip clubs are for scum. Reducing men to scum to preserve their pathetic privileges is beneath contempt.I can’t help wondering if some of those men are not entirely comfortable with what is going on, but feel they have little choice. It looks like nothing has changed – the bullies are still in charge.Geeks like me tend to go to Star Trek conventions rather than strip clubs, if they go anywhere at all. (I go to a book club.) We also cannot help noticing that the more sexist the man, the more women are attracted to him. (They appeal to her associative memory rather than her reason, which should know better.) Bullies get what they want. Sexism is a social skill, and one that is well rewarded. But I suspect some of these organizations are going to bully themselves into bankruptcy because they can’t keep up with a changing world. It can’t come soon enough.But there is another explanation for this behaviour: the men have been desensitized to sexual stimulation by constant exposure to pornography. For some reason Fine chooses to completely ignore this issue. So tell me, which affects men’s attitudes toward women: a dubious book by Louann Brizendine or twenty hours a week of hard-core degrading pornography?Second ThoughtsThis conclusion is being written a several weeks after the rest of the review. What I wrote above is essentially an emotional response to the book. Now the emotion has worn off, I will treat this book as the scientific work it claims to be.The material about how women are limited by social conditioning and outright repression, while socially important, leads to only one scientific insight: we cannot judge the potential of women by their present level of achievement. That is all. But it does serve to soften up the reader for her message. It worked on me.The book may serve as a needed corrective for some of the simplistic stereotyping in the name of science out there. But is it also guilty of similar distortion in pursuit of an agenda that claims gender differences are a social construction? In other words, is this simply the other side in a culture war being fought using science as the battleground?That culture war has been raging for hundreds of years. Conservatives claim human nature is fixed, and we dare not change the ancient wisdom that keeps our impulses contained. Liberals contend that the mind is a blank slate, and humanity is perfectible with the right thinking and social intervention. I suspect those of you who like this book are really cheering that our side is beating up their side, like in a sporting event. And she is administering quite a beating. But this is an empirical question, not a matter of opinion. If you don’t understand the science, how can you possibly know if the scientific arguments here are valid?I don’t know much about neuroscience either, but I detect a number of serious warning signs pointing to a lack of objectivity. Despite the cheery tone, this book mainly consists of an unrelenting attack on any viewpoint that suggests gender differences are innate. It is hard to tell when she is criticizing scientific studies or amateur opinion, which has the effect of implying that the dumbest ideas are also the opinions of any scientists she is opposed to. This kind of polarization has no place in science. A look at the author’s publication list shows mainly commentaries rather than research, mainly aimed at a popular audience. This looks more like a campaigner rather than a scientist.Good science writing shows a passion for understanding the subject and a desire to explain it to the reader. There is none of that here. Instead, explanations are presented only as necessary for the reader to understand the words in her debunking effort. She overwhelms the reader with the sheer volume of scientific information. But volume does not add up to truth if that information is selective.I do not know to what degree gender differences are innate. Who knows, maybe our author has it mostly right. I simply cannot not trust this work to tell me that. Even when she tells me that neuroscience is not advanced enough to draw conclusions about gender, my response is that seems reasonable, but I will look elsewhere to find out. [A quick look suggests she is wrong.]This book is a great reminder that there is a lot of bad science writing out there. Unfortunately it is also a good example of that, yet another example of science corrupted by ideology."
82,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4973578-iset,5,"You've probably heard that men are just naturally better at spatial awareness and logical tasks whilst women are just naturally better at verbal and nurturing tasks. You've probably heard that men and women's brains are different. You may even have heard exasperated parents trying out gender neutral parenting exclaiming that their little girl/boy just seems to naturally gravitate towards pink dolls/blue trucks - it must be biological! Delusions of Gender debunks it all, delving into the real science behind these spurious claims.The book is divided into three sections. First, the sociological and psychological studies of gender differences. How are we to explain, for example, the fact that men seem to consistently do well in maths and women in verbal reasoning? It turns out - quite easily. The notion that men are better at certain things and women are better at other things is an entrenched stereotype. Consistently, in a scientific testing environment, when groups are primed before the test to buy into these stereotypes, they conform to cultural and societal demands of their gender - but when the groups are primed beforehand with a statement that no gender differences have ever been found, then both men and women defy the stereotypes and perform better even than the other gender at tasks that their own gender is supposedly bad at. This result bears out over countless tests, and reveals that when a categorised group is placed under 'stereotype threat', the distracting negative thinking that results significantly impacts on their performance in a given task - conversely, when the group is relaxed and not under threat, their true abilities are freed. There's more. When asked to self-report about how analytical/empathising they are, men and women will report that they fall into the stereotypes about their gender. However, when rigorous scientific is set up - for example, unwittingly recording two individuals in a room, after the fact asking one to note down their thoughts as they watch back the video, and then asking the other to guess what the first was thinking; both men and women show the same amount of ability to read people's faces and intuit their emotional state. In other words, self-reporting is unreliable as a true test of gender differences, and many tests claiming to prove a difference are unscientific, inadvertantly priming the subjects beforehand to perform according to existing social pressures.Okay, so social pressure is affecting people. But what about all that medical evidence that men and women's brains are different? It's actually very flimsy. Testosterone testing of babies in utero is not actually done by testing the baby's blood - but by testing the mother's blood, or the amniotic content. There are significant problems with several of the studies involving scanning the brains of adults - such as some studies only using female test subjects and not comparing against men in any way. Other studies are post-mortem. Several employ circular reasoning in their write ups to assert some sort of gender difference. ""But I've seen those different coloured scan images of male versus female brains on the internet!"" you may cry.
""It’s important to realise that the patches of colour you see on brain scans don’t actually show brain activity. Although it may seem as though fMRI and PET enable you to see a snapshot of the brain at work (or, as popular writers Allan and Barbara Pease claim, ‘to see your brain operating live on a television screen’), this simply isn’t the case. ‘Unfortunately, these pretty pictures hide the sausage factory’, as one neurologist put it. fMRI doesn’t measure neuronal activity directly. Instead, it uses a proxy: changes in blood oxygen levels. (PET uses a radioactive tracer isotope, which attaches itself to glucose or water molecules, to indirectly track blood flow.) Busier neurons need more oxygen and (after an initial dip) active brain regions have higher levels of oxygenated blood, because blood flow to that area increases. The oxygen is carried by the haemoglobin in red blood cells, and haemoglobin has slightly different magnetic qualities depending on how much oxygen it’s carrying. This creates a signal in the scanner (which pulses a magnetic field on and off). Neuroscientists then compare the difference in blood flow in brain regions during the task they’re interested in, with blood flow during a control task or rest state. (Ideally, the control task involves everything the experimental task entails – button pressing, word reading and so on – except for the psychological process you’re particularly interested in.) Researchers test for significant differences in blood flow in various locations of the brain regions during the two tasks, and if tests indicate that it is significant, a blob of colour is placed at the appropriate location on the picture of the brain. In other words, those coloured spots on the brain represent statistical significance at the end of several stages of complicated analysis – which means there’s plenty of scope for spurious findings of sex differences in neuroimaging research.""
Moreover, for every 1 neuroscience study claiming to find a difference between genders, there are 19 where both men and women were tested, no difference was discovered, and since the researcher's topic of interest was something other than gender differences the write up does not draw attention to the result - that no gender differences were found. The studies that do claim to find a difference also receive significantly more attention from people specifically looking for evidence to prove biological gender differences, and because the topic is so hot in our modern world.Alright, so neuroscience evidence is flimsy at best, and psychological testing of adults is unreliable unless performed with proper rigour. But what about children? Haven't there been tests of babies that show they prefer blue trucks/pink dolls? Unfortunately many of the tests claiming to prove such are also highly suspect. One study, for example, tested 3 month old male and female babies to see whether they preferred a Human face or a geometric mobile. Lo and behold, the male babies seemed to prefer the mobile, whilst female babies seemed to prefer the faces. Aha! But the face and the mobiles were presented to the babies separately, not simultaneously as is usual in such tests to truly determine if a baby prefers one thing over another - it's impossible therefore to say whether a preference was displayed. Furthermore, the researchers in the study knew what gender each baby they tested was, and there's reason to suspect they themselves may have been biasing the results by presenting a more friendly face to the female babies and moving the mobile around more with the male babies - creating the result they expected to see. Oh. Oh, indeed. More scientifically rigorous studies of babies' habits show that there is no difference in a six month old's preference between trucks and dolls - but this does kick in from around 9 months onwards. Is it nature asserting itself over nurture? Well, no. Another study tested whether babies truly do prefer a female face over a male one (i.e. testing whether we are biologically predisposed to think of women in a nurturing role). The babies seemed to prefer the female face - but all the babies in the first test group were being looked after primarily by their mothers. The test was repeated with babies who were being primarily raised by their fathers - those babies preferred male faces. Consistently, the results show environment over biology is the determining factor.The mother who had attempted gender neutral parenting only to wail; ""In the end I found her tucking the toy truck into bed and cuddling it! It must be biology!"" was asked by a shrewd researcher whether, in that household, one of the parents did most of the putting to bed - of course, it turned out the mother always put her daughter to bed. The fact of the matter is, even the most determined parents trying to employ gender neutral upbringing face an uphill struggle. Most actually bias the result, implicitly disapproving certain activities for their child despite outspokenly advocating them, and testing of children's reactions to words versus body language clearly demonstrates that they pick up on implict cues much more than verbal ones. Even with dedicated parents, the outside world is often intent on reinforcing gender roles, from multinational companies to the disapproving looks of less progressive parents. Gender is in fact the most strongly emphasised of any of the ways of categorising people, and children pick up on this from an exceptionally young age - it therefore becomes important for them to seek out clues about how to discover a person's gender and how to identify themselves, so they can fit in with a social group and be accepted - even when the parents at home are encouraging them to explore all kinds of play and activities.I'm going to conclude with the account of a couple who went the extra mile in their determination to raise their son and daughter in a truly gender neutral environment. Sandra and Daryl Bem, two psychologists;
""did all that they could to reduce the normally ubiquitous gender associations in their children’s environment: the information that lets children know what toys, behaviours, skills, personality traits, occupations, hobbies, responsibilities, clothing, hairstyles, accessories, colours, shapes, emotions and so on go with being male and female. This entailed, at its foundation, a meticulously managed commitment to equally shared parenting and household responsibilities. Trucks and dolls, needless to say, were offered with equal enthusiasm to both children; but also pink and blue clothing, and male and female playmates. Care was taken to make sure that the children saw men and women doing cross-gender jobs. By way of censorship, and the judicious use of editing, WhiteOut and marker pens, the Bems also ensured that the children’s bookshelves offered an egalitarian picture-book world... The second part of the Bems’ strategy was to, in place of the usual information about what it means to be male or female, promote the idea that the difference between males and females lies in their anatomy and reproductive functions. Your typical preschooler enjoys a detailed knowledge of gender roles, but remains a bit hazy regarding the hard, biological fact that males differ from females when it comes to the allocation of such items as penises, testicles and vaginas.'[O]ur son Jeremy, then age four, … decided to wear barrettes [hair slides] to nursery school. Several times that day, another little boy told Jeremy that he, Jeremy, must be a girl because ‘only girls wear barrettes.’ After trying to explain to this child that ‘wearing barrettes doesn’t matter’ and that ‘being a boy means having a penis and testicles,’ Jeremy finally pulled down his pants as a way of making his point more convincingly. The other child was not impressed. He simply said, ‘Everybody has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.’'Unlike their peers, Jeremy and Emily were discouraged from using socially determined trappings such as hairstyle, clothing, accessories or profession as a guide to a person’s biological sex. If the children asked whether someone was male or female, their parents ‘frequently denied certain knowledge of the person’s sex, emphasizing that without being able to see whether there was a penis or a vagina under the person’s clothes, [they] had no definitive information.’Step forward, please, all those parents who go to similar lengths to protect their children from acquiring prevailing cultural assumptions about gender. And do try to avoid being trampled in the rush. The Bems’ efforts, I think you’ll agree, seriously outclass what we normally, generously, think of as gender-neutral parenting... The intensity and scope of the Bems’ efforts offer a helpful hint as to just how gendered children’s environments are. To this day social structure, media and peers offer no shortage of information to children about masculinity and femininity.""

83,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"Delusions of Gender: The Real Science Behind Sex Differences by Cordelia Fine“Delusions of Gender” is an outstanding book that compels you to take a closer look at society and our science as it relates to gender issues. Academic psychologist and author, Dr. Cordelia Fine with a sharp sense of humor and an excellent grasp of what constitutes good science dismantles many claims of what can be considered neurosexism. This is a very provocative book as it tackles claims about male and female brains, and the gender cycle. This fascinating 371-page book is broken out into the following three parts: 1. Half-Changed World, Half-Changed Minds, 2. Neurosexism, and Recycling Gender.Positives:1. Engaging, witty, and provocative book. This is also a well-researched book that is not afraid to tackle head on popular misconceptions on gender.2. A fascinating and often misunderstood topic of sex differences.3. The science is accessible and the narrative flows nicely thanks to an infusion of humor. The book is also full of interesting anecdotes.4. Great use of counter-research to combat what Dr. Fine has concluded is poor science.5. One of the best features of this book is Dr. Fine’s relentless research against commonly held misconceptions by well-known scientists and authors. She makes a very compelling case against at best poor science or worst pseudoscience.6. Makes the very strong case on how society can impact associative memory. “Unlike explicitly held knowledge, where you can be reflective and picky about what you believe, associative memory seems to be fairly indiscriminate in what it takes on board. Most likely, it picks up and responds to cultural patterns in society, media and advertising, which may well be reinforcing implicit associations you don’t consciously endorse.” “When gender is salient in the environment, or we categories someone as male or female, gender stereotypes are automatically primed.”7. The impact of stereotypes. “Research suggests that the deadly combination of ‘knowing-and-being’ (women are bad at math and I am a woman) can lower performance expectations, as well as trigger performance anxiety and other negative emotions.”8. A look at mothers versus single women. “While parenthood served as no disadvantage at all to men, there was evidence of a substantial ‘motherhood penalty’. Mothers received only half as many callbacks as their identically qualified childless counterparts.”9. The reality of sexual harassment.10. Covers many issues regarding gender equality, including at home. “As Gloria Steinem recently reminded a journalist, “The idea of having it all never meant doing it all. Men are parents, too, and actually women will never be equal outside the home until men are equal inside the home.” Great quote.11. So are there biological roots to gender inequality? This is a recurring theme in the book.12. The reality is that there is a lot of poor science involving gender issues. “There’s something a little shocking about the discrepancy between the weakness of the scientific data on the one hand and the strength of the popular claims on the other.”13. A fascinating look at Neurosexism. “The sheer complexity of the brain makes interpreting and understanding the meaning of any sex differences we find in the brain a very difficult task.” “Neurosexism promotes damaging, limiting, potentially self-fulfilling stereotypes.”14. The file-drawer phenomenon. “This contributes to the so-called file-drawer phenomenon, whereby studies that do find sex differences get published, but those that don’t languish unpublished and unseen in a researcher’s file drawer.”15. Debunks myths with glee. “So let us, with healthy skepticism, summarize all of this as clearly as we can. Nonexistent sex differences in language lateralization, mediated by nonexistent sex differences in corpus callosum structure, are widely believed to explain nonexistent sex differences in language skills.” “The speculations of a few scientists quickly evolve into the colorful fabrications of popular neurosexism – the subspecialty within the larger discipline of neurononsense.”16. The four basic pieces of advice for anyone considering incorporating neuroscientific findings into a popular book or article about gender.17. One of the most astute observations of the books, too good not to share. “Genes don’t determine our brains (or our bodies), but they do constrain them. The developmental possibilities for an individual are neither infinitely malleable nor solely in the hands of the environment. But the insight that thinking, behavior and experiences change the brain, directly, or through changes in genetic activity, seems to strip the word ‘hardwiring’ of much useful meaning. As neurophysiologist Ruth Bleier put it over two decades ago, we should ‘view biology as potential, as capacity and not as static entity. Biology itself is socially influenced and defined; it changes and develops in interaction with and response to our minds and environment, as our behaviors do. Biology can be said to define possibilities but not determine them; it is never irrelevant but it is also not determinant.” Read that again, and again.18. A look at parenting. “It seems, then, that gender stereotypes, even if perhaps only implicitly held, affect parents’ behavior towards their babies.”19. Interesting facts that have an impact. “The Dr. Seuss books are rightly classics, adored by children and a joy of rediscovery for parents. Yet as Lamb and Brown observe, in all the forty-two books he wrote, not one has a female lead in its central story.”20. Copious amounts of notes and they are linked. A comprehensive bibliography.Negatives:1. Very little not to like about this excellent book but I would have probably started with defining the differences between key terms like sex and gender. The layperson tends to use these terms indiscriminately.2. The book does a phenomenal job of at the very least casting doubt or outright debunking commonly held misconceptions on gender issues; however, it doesn’t succeed nowhere near as well on defining the real science behind sex differences.3. Using scientific claims from centuries ago to debunk easily comes across as strawman arguments or low hanging fruits to grab on to.4. At times I feel she doesn’t necessarily apply the same amount of scrutiny to those studies that support her argument versus those that don’t. I prefer the instances where she simply states that we just don’t know.In summary, this was truly an eye opening and cognitive-dissonance inducing book. One of the great things I take from this book is to not fall prey to poor science and specifically, be alert of neurosexism. I’m not a neuroscience to know if all the conclusions that Dr. Fine makes are sound or not, but she is very persuasive and the book made me think. Witty, provocative and just fun to read, I highly recommend it!Further suggestions: “Science and Gender” by Ruth Bleier, “The Myths of Gender” and “Sexing the Body” by Gisela Kaplan, “Gene Worship” by Lesley Roger, “Sexual Science” by Cynthia Russett, and “The Social Psychology of Gender” by Laurie Rudman and Peter Glick. These books were recommended notably by the author."

It makes sense to me.There're a lot of dog-ears and underlines, but some of them are angry marks. I got very frustrated with about the middle two-fourths of it. The first fourth and the last fourth, I was much more interested in.The last fourth was what I thought the entire book was to be about---about how society and subtle clues train modern ""gender identity."" Because, dude, kids are sponges.The first one-fourth had some great lines and sentiments I agreed with, at their base. That is, perception is reality.The middle two-fourths? (Okay, I'd say, half, but it sounds wrong, since it's in the middle.) Yeah, that frustrated the ever-loving shit out of me. Because it seemed (to me, at least) she spent all that time leading up to making a point that I already knew. And I kept thinking, over an over, what she waited to say until the end of all that.And it just about killed me.Basically, I'm a fucking amateur, and I know that the way you live your life---your thought processes change the way your brain works. That is to say, nothing is hard-wired.Guess what; you spend your life obsessing over math, and the parts of your brain that deal with math are going to be larger than someone who's not obsessed with math, Einstein.So the fact that she laid it on thick, and laid on all this evidence, without just saying that until the end, just about killed me.Well, now, if she'd said it in the beginning of that section and went on, I would have had no problem. It just---it kept making me wonder if she was ever even going to point that out.And it drove me nuts.A mild frustration had nothing to do with her, but with a few of experiments they carried out. I mean, yeah, I was frustrated with the (sometimes) wild interpretations of some of them (as I was meant to be), but there were a few that hit me, personally. A few for which, all I could think, ""And then they had one more step to do."" Especially with the empathy tests. Oh, I could come up with such an awesome empathy test...There were even a couple of times that Fine really let me down. One, when she cited the behavior of rats to prove her point. And then, later, when rats didn't quite prove her point, she mentions how we really can't equate the behavior of rats to humans. It made me sad, because she had a point both times, but... Oof.Lots of good stuff, but a lot of frustration as well. And not nearly as much ""hard information"" as I was expecting. At least, not the kind I was expecting, because the kind of hard information I was looking forward to was only in the last quarter of the book. And there was not nearly as much of it as I had been hoping for. It barely went beyond what I already knew. It didn't challenge me the way I was hoping to be challenged.But enough of that. Let's end on my favorite line of the book. It has to do with the Bem children, who were raised as just about as ""gender nuetral"" as anyone could ever manage. The boy tells a classmante, "" 'being a boy means having a penis and testicles.' ""The boy who was critisizing him for wearing barrettes to nursery school comes back with, ""Everyone has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.""That right there made the whole book for me.Anyway, the point of the rating is not that I really liked it, but that I really like that it exists."
85,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,5,"I was really impressed with ‘Delusions of Gender’. It dissects and summarises research clearly, critiques stereotypes intelligently and analytically, and keeps the tone witty and readable yet more academic than journalistic. I found the synthesis of neuroscientific research on sex differences extremely helpful. Media articles that cheerfully claim sexist stereotypes are biological inevitabilities make me very angry. Fine channelled that same anger into writing an excellent rebuttal, which will be very useful to remember when the next wave of pseudo-scientific claims hit the papers.This book makes an excellent accompaniment to Living Dolls: The Return of Sexism, which focuses more on the societal implications of biological determinism-based sexism. It also brings up the important debate about applying scientific methodologies to research questions that are based on unquestioned stereotypes and assumptions. An example of this is the use of 'masculinity' as an objective index, like height and weight. As Fine states, including fMRI scans makes any research findings appear more weighty and scientific. Yet inferring major psychological differences between the sexes from disputed differences in brain structure is very problematic. The brain and the mind are not congruent. I’d also pick out for praise the latter chapters on young children learning about gender. That was not something I’d ever really thought about before, but of course kids observe how carefully adults sort people into the ‘man’ and ‘woman’ boxes. This part of the book includes amusing summaries of research investigating whether and/or why girls play more with ‘girl toys’ and boys with ‘boy toys’. I particularly liked the idea that some researchers made a My Little Pony into a desirable boy’s toy by painting it black, trimming its mane, and sharpening its teeth. Conversely, girls were ‘enchanted by… the lavender-satin-covered guns and holster, and the pink furred war helmet’. By the age of five, these children had picked up from their surrounding the sexual dimorphism of toys. As Fine points out, even clothes for newborns are gendered. She makes a strong argument for social over biological gender determinism.Apologies for eliding sex and gender in the paragraph above. Fine does not critique the gender binary or cover intersectionality issues in much depth, as these are not the focus of her book. Neither are they ever mentioned (that I’ve seen) by media articles that oversimplify and distort neuroscience to excuse sexism. Nonetheless, similar effects (regarding ‘stereotype threat’ for example) are noted to impact on women and ethnic minorities in the earlier chapters covering sociological research. There’s clearly a lot more work needed in the fields of sociology and neuroscience, but I agree with Fine that scientists have a responsibility to consider their unwitting assumptions about gender. As well as the ways in which their findings will be treated by a depressingly sexist media."
86,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie,4,"All those studies that say that women are bad at math and men are bad at relationships because their brains are hardwired that way can be very discouraging, and there are a LOT of those studies. But Cordelia Fine has looked into those studies and found flaws in them. Add into that a large number of studies that show how easy it is to jigger people’s minds into doing better or worse at tasks depending on how they are psychologically primed before hand and we can see where the author is coming from. Fine’s thesis is rather than there being any physical difference between male and female brains, the differences that we see in math scores are there because our culture expects them to be there. Even when people attempt to raise their children in a gender neutral environment, culture intervenes. On TV, in schools, in children’s books, in the clothing sold to children- everything is divided into genders, and females end up less adventuresome, more nurturing, expected to be nicer and not fight, and to focus on home and caring rather than invented and discovering. Toys for girls and boys are separated, and children who choose to play with toys for the opposite gender are disapproved of, especially boys who play with dolls or other ‘girl’ toys. Tomboys may be told to act more ladylike, but boys will get beat up by other boys. The core of her argument is that studies where test takers are primed to consider themselves members of sets other than gender yield different results than tests taken when the test takers are told things like “men traditionally do better on this test”. For instance, when a group of males and females take a test and are told before hand that people who go to certain colleges (colleges that some of the test takers go to) do better on this same test, the test takers conform to this and the males and females who belong to the colleges mentioned both do better on the test than the non-certain collegians- and the males and females in that group score the same as each other on the test under these conditions. These tests have been done numerous times by different researchers, and the results are always the same- the test takers conform to expectations set up before the test. Therefore, psychology trumps brain structure where intellectual subjects are concerned. It’s an interesting proposition, and one I think needs to be investigated more- much more. There’s a lot still to be untangled in gender studies. Intellectual abilities are jumbled in with emotional tendencies, and I definitely think they should be considered separately. She pretty much ignores the effect of hormones on emotional states except for the case of fetal testosterone. I think that while this book doesn’t settle any gender issue questions, it does cast a lot of doubt on previous studies and urges us to look at them much harder."
87,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237879-elaine-nelson,5,"I happened to run across this book at the library having forgotten that it was in my ""to-read"" list. I'm SO glad I did, and given a certain pair of somewhat ranty posts a couple of months back, only wish I'd read it sooner! I literally could not put it down - as in: ""no really, I need to go to bed/back to my desk from lunch/off the bus, I have to put the book away.""In short, social construction of gender: you're soaking in it. (And especially, your brain is soaking in it.)1) Priming & stereotype threat affect everything. Just checking gender on a form before taking a test changes womens' performance, especially on math tests. More priming (being told that the test relates to gender, watching a gender-stereotyped commercial, etc) increases the effect.2) Most of the ""science"" as it's filtered through to the popular media is a disaster of half-baked assumptions, small and/or poorly-constructed experiments, and willful misunderstanding of the actual results. (She tears apart one popular writer; it's kinda fun.)3) Worse, those lame results create a feedback loop, combined with the impossibility of gender-neutral child-rearing, that increases the problem of stereotype threat, and makes genuine social change more difficult.Le sigh. Not only is the feminist struggle not over, we may actually be hitting a really hard spot.On the plus side, I'm fired up now. Not just that, but I'm thinking more about my own personal construction of gender identity, including my history with math and science. There's a post I wrote about my life with math a while back, and there I wrote about it as a choice between writing and math - now I'm seriously looking back and wondering about the effect of gender stereotypes, and whether I might have come to computing sooner given different circumstances. I think it's worth noticing that choices exist in a constrained environment, constrained both by the external world, and by our own unexamined or incompletely-formed attitudes.As for the writing style, it's a delightful read. She's got a sharp conversational tone that pulled me in; I even read the footnotes.HIGHLY recommended, great in combination with Pink Brain Blue Brain."
88,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5324619-noor,5,"""Delusions of Gender"" has proved to be one of the most informative and interesting books I've read this year. The book consists of three parts that essentially discuss gender-stereotypes, Neurosexism, and the struggles of attempting to raise children in a gender-neutral environment.Cordelia starts by explaining how implicit and explicit beliefs are two separate things that don't always correlate. Despite ""consciously"" holding certain beliefs, there is a clash between the reflective self and our associative memory which is heavily influenced by the social environment surrounding us. When gender becomes salient and constantly primed in our daily life, it seeps into our perception of others and of ourselves, and we often do it in stereotypical ways. The book is filled with numerous experiments that support this idea. When we categorise people as male or female, we are instantly activating gender associations that affect our behaviour, values, performance etc. A perfect manifestation of this activated gender-inequality is how women are treated in a workplace dominated by men. Women experience segregation, exclusion, harassment and attack just by showing up to work basically.The second part of the book focuses on neurosexism and was the most difficult for me to digest; simply because I was unaware of just how much these popular neuroscientific claims are based on shaky empirical evidence. Gender stereotypes are legitimised by these pseudo-scientific explanations, and often become part of popular media. Neurosexism activates gender stereotypes which feeds into the public sphere + affects attitudes, identity & performance. It all leads us to become our own self-fulfilling prophecies.And the last bit of the book should be read by all parents who try to raise their children in a gender-neutral environment. It goes way beyond giving boys barbie dolls and giving girls fire trucks.All in all, this was an eye-opener for me when it comes to neuroscience and how it's used to reinforce old-fashioned stereotypes/roles through covering them with the finery of science.PS: Cordelia is quite witty. Found myself laughing out loud at times."
89,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4508080-julie-bozza,5,"A bit of a hard slog to read, especially as the few moments of humour didn't really suit me (too sarcastic). However, the important thing is that Fine makes vital headway towards an understanding of gender that I can really get behind. Gender difference is not 'hardwired' into us, and Fine deftly demolishes the pseudo-science that tells us otherwise. Fine quotes Kimmel in asserting 'gender difference is the product of gender inequality'; that is, we create and recreate gender difference while interacting with our society. The process begins at such an early age that many new parents, no matter how gender-neutral they try to be, end up assuming that gender difference is biologically or neurologically innate in their children. Fine does a good job of explaining why this happens, and how it will ultimately be worth it if we keep plugging away the gender-neutral objective. Fine also articulates how permeable the boundaries can be between our own sense of self and society's sense of who we are - or should be. I've struggled to articulate my struggles with this, but I've often felt like an asymmetrical heptagonal peg who is nevertheless forced (by otherwise well-meaning folk) to fit into the round hole that society makes available to me. Gender is certainly one aspect of this. My social sciences tutor told me I was making too much of the external forces - but now I've found Fine to back me up and explore the implications, and I feel inordinately grateful. Lastly, Fine ends with a note of hope. While she has shown how deeply woven gender difference (and hence gender inequality) is in our society, she has also shown that it is malleable. We can change this, though it will take time and effort. Let's keep trying! I would love to see what we can become when we are so much freer to be ourselves, whoever we may be."
90,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Subtitle: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference. Cordelia Fine, while an apparently well-read and quite competent scientist, makes no pretense of objectivity in this book. She's got an axe to grind with a whole school of research that aims to use modern brain science to convince us that male and female brains are intrinsically, fundamentally, and irrevocably different. Oh, and I also think the picture of her on the dust jacket is pretty hot. I just love imagining her getting all worked up about this. Wait, did I say that out loud?Anyway, Fine's point is best illustrated by an anecdote from the experience of a four year old named Jeremy, who had been raised by parents who were extraordinarily zealous gender-neutral parents. He decided one day to wear barrettes to nursery school, and gets into an argument with another boy, who says that he is a girl. Finally, Jeremy pulls down his pants and points out that he has a penis, as a way of making his point. The other boy says, “Everybody has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.”Whether you think the parents who let their boy wear barrettes to school were weird here, or the society that teaches a boy that the difference between male and female has more to do with hairstyle than genitals, depends on your opinions about gender (and society) generally. So does a lot of other (less amusing but more substantial) evidence, published in scientific journals or mainstream media, that Fine takes us on a tour of.Some of it is related to the general fallacy of all brain-scan evidence. Just because we see a difference in brain activity (using MRI or some other method), doesn't mean it's genetic or otherwise hardwired. All it shows is that it happens in the brain, and really, if we're talking about thoughts, attitudes, emotions, and so forth, where else would we expect it to happen? Also, like muscles, areas of the brain can grow larger or smaller over time as they are used more or less (whether for cultural reasons or any other), so again evidence from brain scans, while perhaps useful for other purposes, tells us nothing about whether differences in behavior are primarily biological or cultural. Seeing a brain scan, however, tells us that it has something to do with biology, and our instinctive reaction is still to divide things into biological and cultural, and if it's one it must not be the other.There is a long and well-documented history of scientific attempts to explain to us why women and men are Just Different, in ways that have nothing (directly) to do with procreation. The suspicious thing is that, while the rationales differ from decade to decade and from one century to the next, the conclusions always point in the same direction. Fine takes us on a thoroughly readable tour of this history, spiced up a bit by her, at times, barely contained rage.Make no mistake, this is not an even-handed weighing of the evidence; it is rather a very well-documented and data-driven polemic. If it were written by a man, I'd say that the confrontational and science-oriented analysis is very typical of a masculine style. Instead, I'll say it's an emotional treatment, showing a feminine inability to maintain objectivity on scientific topics. Either way, it's a hoot to read."
91,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6537005-daniel,3,"""Delusions of Gender"" is an engaging read, well-written and incisive. Cordelia Fine makes a convincing argument that gender differences in performance assessed through various metrics are to a large extent the result of social cues, reactions to internalized stereotypes, and unconscious priming. Her critique of studies of gender differences in psychological experiments is comprehensive, and her depiction of the current state of sexism is both convincing and often horrifying.Unfortunately, her fixation on discrediting both contemporary pop-psychology books selling innate gender differences and the arguments of dusty sexists from centuries past comes off a bit like clubbing baby seals (or possibly arm-wrestling five-year-olds). Her arguments against current neuroscientific techniques--especially neuroimaging using techniques like fMRI--fall particularly flat, as she relies repeatedly upon equating sophisticated real-time 3d measurements of blood-flow in the brain with crude volumetric measurements of skull capacity used by those sexist scientists of yore. This is trite and annoying.Likewise, she fails to engage biological and evolutionary arguments in any meaningful sense, instead relying on the tired allegation that evolutionary psychology and biology are only sexist justifications for relegating women to lives of domestic drudgery. She perhaps hopes that her readers are not savvy enough to Wikipedia the fields. Her argument that structural differences between the brains of men and women (after criticizing imaging and anatomical studies, she grudgingly admits that these do exist) compensate for differences in physiology to produce similar behaviors in males and females is interesting and may even be true to some extent--humans male and female, after all, must accomplish many of the same tasks to survive--but is unsupported and feels like hand-waving. She does not engage with the concepts of hormonal modulation of brain activity or neurotransmitter/receptor distribution and prevalence to any great degree. She brushes off the striking possibility that biological differences may predispose men and women toward different goals irrespective of nebulous measures of aptitude or spurious notions of ""natural gender roles."" The human brain she seems to prefer is the black box too intricate to be understood on a mechanistic level, a network of abstract associations accessible only to psychologists distributing questionnaires and bubble sheets to college students participating in studies for course credit.So, while entertaining (and perhaps convincing to audiences disinclined to read it critically or who already embrace its ideological underpinnings), the book's thesis does not strike home, and Fine's claim that it is dangerous for researchers to ask these questions at all should be disturbing to any reader who values science over ideology."

93,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley,3,"I tried to read this book near the beginning of quarantine, in hard copy, and my poor overloaded brain just couldn't handle it. If I had read this in audio, a format my brain can handle for serious subjects, I probably would have rated it much higher, and gotten through it much faster (and I'll be honest, retained more than 10% of it). So take this review with a grain of salt. (P.S. I just googled that phrase, and it evolved from something Pliny the Elder wrote in 77 A.D. Language is so weird.) I will be trying it again maybe in a couple of years by audio. Unless someone can point me in the direction of a book on the same subject that is more recent that I should read first (this was published in 2010).Aside from that issue, this book is also less of a thing on its own than it is the author debunking other scientific studies or books, things that people take as a given, or as ""proven"" by science. Cognitive bias plays a huge role not only in the behavior of test subjects, but in the minds of the scientists performing the studies. Which is enjoyable in its own way, but not quite what I was expecting. The book is very heavy on cautioning the reader about these types of studies, since gender is so hard to study, and really just instills a healthy amount of scientific skepticism. I remember it being a lot of, this isn't proven, we actually don't ""know"" as much as we think we do.I can't emphasize how much my brain did not retain any of the information I read, so this is really just a useless review. Judging by my friends' reviews on Goodreads, I just really need to give it a break, and then pick this up again some time down the road when my brain is being more amenable."

96,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113545-nancy,5,"READ IT.Cordelia Fine's examination of the many popular books and research studies which purport to prove that the male and female brains might as well belong to different species is simply brilliant. I gobbled this non-fiction up like it was a light lunch after a hard day's manual labor. Every page was packed with jaw-dropping information - horrifying methodological flaws, research which argues two diametrically opposed concepts, and outright deception, all designed to prove that men and women are not and cannot possibly be equal. Like, here's one example: Fine mentions the author of a popular book on the subject, who cites research about ""mirror neurons,"" (women have more of them, which supposedly makes them more empathetic.) The author mentions a study of therapists which indicated that the most successful therapists are those that ""mirror"" their clients words, gestures, and verbal patterns. Interestingly, (says the author), ALL of the successful therapists were women. Because they have more mirror neurons, and are more attuned to others, right?WRONG. Cordelia Fine looked up the study (thank you, Cordelia! That would be a big nuisance for the Average Reader) and as it turns out? ALL OF THE THERAPISTS IN THE STUDY WERE WOMEN. Yeah, that's right. They only recruited women for the study, so the study proves absolutely nothing about men vs. women. And if you think this sort of thing is an anomaly, wrong again - Fine's detailed work found this sort of thing occurring over and over again. Moreover, Fine is terrific at highlighting how the social context of everything men and women do contributes to these gender stereotypes, and at explaining how gender bias affects the neuroscientific research. This is an absolutely fantastic book - I have the urge to acquire copies for every teacher, every employer, every parent on the planet. It made me rethink more of my life that I would have believed possible. Seriously, even if you think you would disagree with it: READ IT. If nothing else, you will enjoy Fine's smooth and witty prose."

If you’re the type of person who enjoys nitpicking underpowered studies over methodological errors that affect validity and throwing shade at poor referencing while also being a flagrant feminist this is for you. I am not sure how this would go down for other people without a background in neuroscience because those parts were undoubtedly my favorite although I see how that part of the book could be too technical and heavy. I didn’t learn anything new science-wise but I did discover that there still are some fucking assholes willing to forgo the science completely just in order to tell you that your female brain HAS TO KNOW HOW TO EMPATHIZE AND BE NURTURING and that of course those morons have a wide audience just dying for any shard of pseudo-evidence that may point to the fact that their daughters are meant to be breeding subservient cows and that their sons will bring about the rapture. Of course this book proves yet again the only truth known to humans besides inevitable death and that is that men are trash. Besides that, I wholeheartedly enjoyed the psychology aspects of the book and if I had any doubt about the ubiquity of gender then it was all erased in the last part where she lists study after study proving how the idea of gender and how everything is gendered almost from birth and how early toddlers take on these ideas and digest them almost regardless of how unisex parents attempt to make their environments at home; the world at large is sexist. Go figure. And then there’s the ever expanding body of evidence that simply makes it clear that women have always always always been just as capable as men and that as the gender gap closes (despite the screeching and howling of men) women find their ways into board room and ORs and mines and factories and fucking haters continue to come up with more sophisticated schemes of bullshit to make it seem like we can’t but we’re doing it anyway.

99,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14821636-andrew-fish,1,"The differences between men and women have probably been a topic of debate since the dawn of time. In recent decades, however, as society has progressed from subsistence and survival to consumerism and choice the issue has gained a degree of salience. The question of whether women are actively held down in their careers or whether they passively make decisions which close off paths to advancement becomes more than a curiosity when careers become both a means to achieve a better life and a source of fulfilment in themselves. And earlier in life, the science of gender difference could make a significant difference to educational outcomes if it could be robustly investigated. The time, it seems, is right for a good scientific look at the subject.Unfortunately, this isn't it.Fine is a psychologist by training, and whilst there's definitely scope to study the issue of gender difference through psychology, she seems reluctant to do this in any depth. The opening section of the book which nominally covers this ground is quite thin on actual studies and seems instead to rely heavily on anecdote, giving the book the feel more of a polemic rather than an academic assessment. What science there is, meanwhile, is treated in an uneven manner, promoting the studies which suit the central thesis and denigrating any which don't. Frequently, Fine goes beyond the studies and draws conclusions which aren't supported by any of the evidence she has presented.So, for example, when looking at a study about the effect of priming on women's mathematical abilities, she not only accepts the results without question, she positively crows about the fact that the women did better than the men without the priming. For this to be a valid observation, both male and female participants would have to have an even spread of intellect, presumably using some kind of test as part of the selection process. The trouble with this is that you are then pre-determining the results: if the selection test were gender-neutral, the gender-neutral part of the study would be consistent with the selection process and you would end up with roughly equal results for men and women. If the theory were correct, there would then be lower results for the women in the gender-biased part. If the selection process were not gender-neutral, meanwhile, then if the theory held the women would seem equal to the men in the selection process and better in the gender-neutral study itself.From those results you could prove that priming made a difference to the test results, but not that there was any inherent difference between male and female aptitude in itself. To go further would be circular reasoning (something Fine criticises about another study later in the book).It's like the constant claim that girls are better at school - fifty years ago, the reverse was claimed. What changed in between? The education system. Clearly there is some kind of difference between the sexes there (something Fine seems pathologically averse to) but if one system of education produced stronger male results and the other stronger female all you can say is that different methods favour the sexes differently - you can't claim this makes one superior to the other.In other places, such as the behaviour of women in male-dominated careers, it seems there are no studies Fine can draw on. By definition, you'd find it hard to create a female-dominated version of the same career for comparison, but it doesn't stop the author from coming to conclusions about the effect of those environments without anything beyond anecdote and hypothesis.The most detailed analysis in favour of her argument comes toward the end of the book, when looking at the gender stereotypes to which children are exposed in their early years and how this affects their choice of toys and sense of dress. Unfortunately, here she has narrowed the argument too much: it may be demonstrable that social forces drive boys to wear blue and girls pink, but this would hardly explain the more abstract alleged differences between the sexes. When was the last time your child came home claiming they'd been excluded from the spatial reasoning group on the basis of gender?With the results which don't suit her, the author is more exacting. When looking at a study about infant response to faces and mobile phones, for example, she casts aspersions on the methodology, hypothesises about all kinds of ways the results could have been skewed (always assuming such skews would be systematically biased in the same direction) and even implies that the experimenters could have been acting out of an unconscious gender bias themselves. Apart from the unprofessionalism of casting aspersions without evidence, it seems weak to subject a study you don't like to this level of criticism when it could have been equally true of any of the studies supporting the case. Stepping outside her field, Fine is dismissive of biological studies and applies an extremely shaky attack on neurology - regarding it as an inadequately direct proxy measure of brain activity that is subject to confirmation bias. If that's true of neurology, what it does it say about psychology as a reliable indicator? This attack allows her to dismiss any conclusions from the field she doesn't like, but again she's all too quick to accept any that she does. She constantly falls for the same fallacy, that if you can debunk a very specific prediction made by someone in a particular field, you can dismiss any evidence from that field when it doesn't suit your agenda. The constant comparisons to long-dismissed theories such as brain-pan measurement are a reductio ad absurdum argument with little logical validity and the quotes which open most chapters - generally over a century old and clearly not acceptable to modern readers - come across as an attempt to prime the reader into a form of indignation which switches off their reasoning faculties for the rest of the chapter and allows them to accept Fine's arguments without criticism. I even spotted a very old psychologists' trick - starting a sentence with ""by now you will all be thinking"" - which is a blatant attempt at manipulation of the reader.Here and there we find snippets of actual information - a chance remark about spatial reasoning differing in babies of only a few months old, for example - but unless they fit the central argument, they are passed over quickly. An anecdote about a woman having been masturbated over, by contrast, is alluded to several times across a chapter. And there's little gender-balance in the topics themselves either: apart from a brief mention of female intuition right at the beginning, the book focuses almost entirely on areas where women are alleged to be deficient. The impression given is that this is a book written by someone working out their own issues rather than dispassionately looking at the field.And this is often a problem with psychologists. Freud's obsession with mother fantasies reeked of projection, Kahneman's instinct over reason view of the brain suggests a man struggling to justify his own bad decisions. To see what Fine's problems are you need only look at the language she uses, the metaphors she chooses and the examples she latches onto. The book is riddled with misandistric metaphor and there are a number of coded attacks on her husband. Take the chapter where she envisages a hypothetical job-swap with her spouse. When looking at his ability to do her job, she attacks his literacy - comparing it to a ten year-old. She then looks at her ability to do his job, but rather than admit any limitation on her own part, she sidesteps the issue and instead turns it into another backhanded attack on her husband - in this case the likelihood of his nagging her from beyond the grave. It doesn't take a degree in psychology to spot the signs of an inferiority complex.I don't pretend to know what the biological basis for behaviour is, and I accept that there are a lot of bad studies out there and bad books using the results. But for a book whose byline is ""the real science behind gender difference"" I was expecting more than just a series of attacks. And it's a shame, because the issue is both interesting and important. In my opinion, there clearly are elements of behaviour that are inherited (how else would cuckoos transmit their parasitical tendencies?) but what that inheritance mechanism is and how far it reaches into human behaviour has, as far as I can see, yet to be established. To claim it has no effect on humans would be to think as those who attacked Darwin because whilst they could accept evolution, they felt that to claim humans were a product of evolution was a step too far. One science Fine didn't look at all is anthropology, which for anyone who is genuinely looking for the true reasons for gender difference would seem the obvious place to start. I suggest for those who are after a book which informs them rather than just gives them a reason to be angry at the state of the world, that would be a better field to explore."
100,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17161968-fergus-murray,5,"Delusions of Gender, by Cordelia Fine, is an extended critique of efforts to scientifically study differences between the sexes, and the efforts of many writers to apply alleged science in their writings about such differences. The book is rich in technical detail, which might bog down some readers, but most of those details are fascinating. Fine is a lucid and entertaining writer, especially in her more acerbic moments - of which there are plenty here. She finds a lot of shoddy science and shameless misuse of would-be science that would raise the hackles of any neuroscientist or feminist, let alone someone like her who happens to be both.This is a book with an agenda, and political agendas tend not to sit comfortably with science - but to pretend that politics never seeps into science while nobody is looking would be disingenuous. In fact, Fine's agenda - to bring out the reasons to doubt science that supposedly demonstrates innate differences between sexes - is at least as much scientific as political, and I think it is legitimate. It is something to bear in mind while reading this book, though, and there are times she goes out of her way to present things in such a way as to minimise the possibility of interpretation in terms of innate differences. As far as I can see she always stops short of misrepresenting the science, though, and the whole approach needs to be seen in the context of discourse which routinely takes essential differences for granted, whether the evidence supports them or not.The book is divided into three parts. The first is 'Half-changed World', Half-Changed Minds, which largely focuses on the interplay of cultural expectations and attempts to measure sex differences scientifically. This largely consists of accounts of experiments demonstrating the effects of cultural norms on things that people might be interested in measuring, and experiments which fail to take these factors into account. For example, she looks at experiments investigating the effect of telling the subjects what 'the latest science' has to say about the sorts of tests they are about to perform, to show that girls do significantly better on mathematical tasks if they think that science says they should. Even more subtly, females rate their mathematical ability as worse after they have just been reminded of their sex by having to tick a box at the beginning to say they are females. This gives us an interesting lens for looking at gender differences in maths tests which disregard the weight of cultural expectations, and indeed at systematic tendencies for females to choose less mathematical study and career paths. Having established many profound and subtle ways that social expectations and structures shape behaviours and perfomance, the theme of the second part of the book is Neurosexism - premature efforts to explain differences in behaviour and performance with reference to the brain, rather than society. Fine's most basic point is that it is rather soon to be looking for explanations of most of these things in neuroscience, when societal explanations have not been ruled out, and the relationship between the mind and the brain is still so unclear. More than that, she shows time and again that many authors are disturbingly willing to go way beyond what neurology can tell us, while pretending that they are not. Perhaps the single worst offender here is Louann Brizendine, author of The Female Brain, a serial abuser and inventor of neuroscience to back up her ideas about the differences between males and females - but she is one of many. Fine makes the point that people have been finding 'explanations' for sex differences in the brain for well over a century, from the observation that female brains tend to be a bit lighter than male ones through to modern notions of hardwiring. At the same time, people have routinely assumed that all kinds of observed differences between the sexes are natural and inevitable, when later experience has regularly shown them to be no such thing.The final section is titled Re-Cycling Gender, and it concerns itself with the future of gender relations and the science of sex. Fine is worried about the cyclical nature of some kinds of self-fulfilling prophecy - about dodgy science being used to teach yet another generation of young men and women that there are certain natural roles that they ought to be filling, certain characteristics they should expect to have. She emphasises again how difficult it is to pick apart innate and culturally conditioned differences, and the importance of keeping an open mind about questions that science has not yet been able to settle. With a better scientific understanding of the role of society in forming the mind and the brain, and a sceptical eye on the interesting but inconclusive findings of neuroscience, we may approach true sexual equality yet. Without such circumspection, as Fine argues, we may find ourselves sliding back to ideas about the sexes which are both unhelpful and ill-founded.This is an important book, because the trend towards explaining sex differences with impressive-sounding neurological findings has great potential to set back ideas about gender roles, on the basis of evidence which is far flimsier than it might look. Because we are shaped by our ideas, this has major practical, political ramifications - it is not just good science that is at stake here. There is no doubt that some will resist Fine's approach for its politicisation of science, but I would be inclined to see it more as exploring the role of pre-existing, unexamined political bias, rather than introducing politics to the debate. Delusions of Gender is compelling, informative and perhaps most impressively, funny. I recommend this highly to anyone with any interest in neuroscience or gender.'This review first appeared at http://everything2.com/title/Delusion..."
101,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11030012-jade,4,"There have always been many (pseudo)scientific books on the shelves attempting to explain the differences between the sexes, of which the most common differences usually consist of men having a more result-orientated, mathematical approach, and women having a more relationship-orientated, emotional or empathic approach (never mind about non-binary people, queers, etc.). This is usually shown as something that’s unchangeable; something written down by genetics and made clear by the way our brains differ so much from each other. Also, some (if not most) of these books claim that that’s what also causes traditional gender roles – women are simply better suited for housework, and men better suited for business. Often, this is also where an evolutionary argument about caves, hunting, and gathering comes in.Unfortunately, the tendency to display such dated, sexist views isn’t only found in pseudoscientific writers (an example being the ever annoying book always present in every single bookstore I visit, Men Are from Mars Women Are from Venus by John Gray), but also in qualified scientists or psychologists: The Female Brain by Louann Brizendine, being a great example, or The Sexual Paradox: Extreme Men Gifted Women and the Real Gender Gap by Susan Pinker. Though I can’t deny the big influence popular ‘science’ books have on the general reading audience, as an aspiring psychologist myself, the fact that qualified psychologists spew this kind of garbage worries me intensely.Which is why I’m quite glad to have found this wonderfully well-researched book by Cordelia Fine, in which she attempts to refute many claims made by popular psychology books concerning traditional gender roles/behaviour, and differences between the sexes. Does she succeed? In my opinion, yes, and she does so with humour, solid arguments, and a critical approach. I really enjoyed the fact that she doesn’t only bring up arguments to counter interpretations and results of research used in the aforementioned popular psychology books, but she also attacks the way certain methods of research are used and interpreted (case in point: neuroimaging).A very complete, interesting, witty, and fun read. I commend Cordelia Fine for writing such a wonderfully clear answer to the dated views on the differences between the sexes, and emphasizing the importance of valid research (and the interpretation of it). I can definitely recommend this to anyone who’s interested in reading more about gender roles/behaviour."

It made me want to do a dance of joy. Also, when talking about neuroimaging experiments which supposedly prove these ""hardwired"" differences, Cordelia Fine wrote this paragraph:[...] When looking for changes in blood flow between two conditions, researchers search in thousands of tiny sections of the brain (called voxels), and many researchers are now arguing that the threshold commonly set for declaring that a difference is ""significant"" just isn't high enough. To illustrate this point, some researchers recently scanned an Atlantic salmon while showing it emotionally charged photographs. The salmon--which, by the way, ""was not alive at the time of scanning""--was ""asked to determine what emotion the individual in the photo must have been experiencing."" Using standard statistical procedures, they found significant brain activity in one small region of the dead fish's brain while it performed the empathizing task, compared with brain activity during ""rest."" The researchers conclude not that this particular region of the brain is involved in postmortem piscine empathizing, but that the kind of statistical thresholds commonly used in neuroimaging studies [...] are inadequate because they allow too many spurious results through the net.If that doesn't make you want to read at least a little more, I have no idea how to talk to you."

This author doesn't think so and after reading her book, I'm convinced.She says that gender distinctions continue to exist and that they start from our very beginnings - pink is for girls, blue is for boys. Gender comes to define us and these distinctions shape our abilities and interests. Certain skills are identified as male or female: Men are rational and brave; and Women are empathetic and nurturing. These assumed traits then impact our adult lives and the choices we make such as what fields to study in college, and what careers to pursue afterwards.Most alarming to the author is that the new fancy pants field of neuroscience observes physical differences in the brain between men and women and they are using those results to explain pre-conceived notions about the abilities of men vs. women instead of considering the impact of outside social forces. To create a causal relationship where none exists is to eliminate a possible true explanation before it is ever considered.A thought provoking book."

Fine looks at gender essentialism and at the biases of studies and media reporting, and suggests that we've been too quick to throw up our hands and say, ""but it's biological!"" If little girls have only been wearing pink for fifty years, then clearly that can't be a hard-wired preference.As a woman who preferred baby blue to pink for my childhood frilly dresses, liked to play with my brother's trucks and robots as well as my own stuffed animals (dolls are creepy and as for the toy . . . ironing board?!!! . . . I was given, the less said the better), and whose index finger is shorter than her ring finger, but who grew up to be much better at language than math (but my mom was great at math) and is more empathetic than competitive, I've always found these gender assumptions questionable, as I seem to be all over the board. Fine, writing for a popular audience, sometimes seems to skim the surface, but her work is clear, logical, and sometimes pleasantly snarky."

It always irks me if people want to use scientific publications to justify stuff like this. Not because I'd prefer them not to be true, but because I'm only too aware that making it through peer review isn't a good indicator about how well done the experiments were. Just ask Rosie Redfield and her successful push against the stupid arsenic life-stuff. Many different studies are discussed in some detail and lots of flaws in those studies are shown: lack of controls and/or statistical power, multiple testing, the general problems of fMRI, alternative explanations fitting the data as well or even better etc. Recommended for: everyone who likes to see overselling scientific claims destroyed, people who want to disarm the arguments of those who believe in inherent gender differences.

There is much in current popular literature suggesting gender differences are innate, therefore we should adapt to them. This book treats us to even more of this kind of thinking found in the older literature, which looks absurd to modern eyes. The author asks if the modern stuff is really much different. She has two main points: Neuroscience is not nearly advanced enough to reach any conclusions that link brain structure to behaviour. And it is difficult to distinguish between genetic and culturally acquired characteristics from observing society, because there are so many confounding factors and sources of bias. So what is all this recent writing really based on?Things Don’t Seem So Bad in My BubbleI appear to live in a bubble. The reports I read about sexual discrimination and harassment are shocking, and do not reflect my personal experience. I realize that my brain’s shrivelled left hemisphere renders me oblivious to any social interaction that is not blindingly obvious, but I am married to a successful female senior manager. We even talk sometimes (when she makes me). I don’t hear much about discrimination, while I do hear about a lot else. And there are plenty of women in senior positions where she works. But society is not uniform, and large parts of it are clearly very different from where I stand.Beyond Reason: Why I Would See it That WayWhy is gender stereotyping so persistent when many of us claim to have moved beyond that? She tells us,
“One can be reflective about explicitly held (rational) knowledge, and it may be reasonably consistent. However, associative knowledge seems to be fairly indiscriminate about what it takes on board. So you may not be consciously sexist, yet sexist patterns you have unconsciously picked up may assert themselves.”
Our unconscious attitudes are learned when we are young, and they are learned from the behaviour one sees, not the words our parents or schools use to tell us how they think we should be. Now in our daily lives our choices are made instinctively, and the rational mind finds a justification that is not sexist. Thus gender discrimination is perpetuated without us even knowing or wanting to do it.As a male systemiser, I have done the job expected of me. I will now get in touch with my feminine side and talk about personal experience. Yes, personal anecdotes do not add up to data, but apparently there is no worthwhile data anyway, so why not?The Geek SpeaksI spent my career writing software, so the following got my attention:
“What, for example, springs to mind when you think of a computer scientist? A man, of course, but not just any man. You’re probably thinking of the sort of man who would not be an asset at a tea party. The sort of man who leaves a trail of soft-drink cans, junk-food wrappers, and tech magazines behind him as he makes his way to the sofa to watch Star Trek for the hundredth time.”
I went to a university that did not yet have a computer science department. A few friends and myself invented our own. We failed the courses we were supposed to be taking because we spent all day playing on the computers we hacked into. Need I mention that none of us were women?The reason has nothing to do with junk-food wrappers, or that the female devotes too much of her brain to emotion processing to write code. It is more about obsession. We males may or may not be better systemisers, but we are more willing to blow an entire school year to spend all day systemising about one thing. What, women can’t afford to take risks like that? Don’t be silly, they can always get married and have babies if things don’t work out. Or they can switch into social sciences, and get an easy degree doing sloppy research that verifies pre-existing beliefs. Our author delights in presenting examples of that. Oh, that was typically insensitive of me. My oxytocin levels must be low again.The only hint of truth in her paragraph is the lack of social skills of many of us in the industry. Combine obsession with that lack of social skills, and one suspects the presence of a few autism-linked genes in the crowd. But I am sure Ms. Fine can cherry-pick a few flawed autism studies to demolish that notion.One can argue that these different attitudes are entirely socially constructed. But it is also possible that something real is being socially reinforced. There is some evidence, especially from identical twin studies, which link personal characteristics to genetics. It is hard to believe that there is no sex linkage involved. It is easy to mock jumping to evolutionary conclusions about math skills or preferring pink to blue. But the human species does have a long history with a gender devoted to hunting and warfare. Add in the fact that males are expendable, and a genetic inclination toward risk taking does seem somewhat credible. Obsession may have been selected for similar reasons. Those autism genes must be there for a reason. You know, men have to focus on their hunting, while the women multitask feeding the baby while inventing agriculture, food storage and other requirements for civilization.Oops, I have slipped back into systemising again. It must be the lack of connection between my hippocampus and cerebral cortex.Empathising Has Its RewardsThere were not many female programmers where I worked, and they did not last long. They get promoted into management. Oh, the discrimination! The gender distribution at my company was interesting. As one might expect, the programmers were generally male and the quality control people were female. Were women excluded from the more creative jobs because of their sex? Perhaps the difference is that while I would think about work when I got home, they were thinking about home while they were at work. A more demanding job gets in the way. And if that is because of social conditioning, it is hardly the fault of corporate management.The other female “ghetto” at our company was in program management. This critical senior position requires both strong technical knowledge and excellent social skills to deal with our external clients. It was mainly women who had the magic to pull it off. (I suppose that more developed inferior parietal lobe makes all the difference.) The consequences of gender stereotyping, legitimate or not, can cut both ways.I lost my job there because I did not step up into a more collaborative role. I was lucky to last as long as I did happily coding away. Industry is changing, communicating and collaborating across boundaries is becoming ever more important. My stereotypical mind sees these as female qualities, but does it matter? Any company that discriminates against women is suicidal, because it needs those skills. But then, a lot of companies are slowly committing suicide. I suspect there may be a connection here.Social Skills in the Strip ClubsApparently there is an increasing tendency to use strip clubs for conducting business. Ms. Fine documents this and concludes,
“In effect, just as their fathers might have taken clients to one of the gentlemen’s clubs of Pall Mall, so brokers today take their business associates to see lap dancers. The old gentlemen’s clubs banned women – some still do – whereas the lap-dancing establishments merely intimidate them.”
My emotional reaction (yes, I do have them) is anger and disgust. Gentlemen’s clubs, for all their faults, at least had some class. Strip clubs are for scum. Reducing men to scum to preserve their pathetic privileges is beneath contempt.I can’t help wondering if some of those men are not entirely comfortable with what is going on, but feel they have little choice. It looks like nothing has changed – the bullies are still in charge.Geeks like me tend to go to Star Trek conventions rather than strip clubs, if they go anywhere at all. (I go to a book club.) We also cannot help noticing that the more sexist the man, the more women are attracted to him. (They appeal to her associative memory rather than her reason, which should know better.) Bullies get what they want. Sexism is a social skill, and one that is well rewarded. But I suspect some of these organizations are going to bully themselves into bankruptcy because they can’t keep up with a changing world. It can’t come soon enough.But there is another explanation for this behaviour: the men have been desensitized to sexual stimulation by constant exposure to pornography. For some reason Fine chooses to completely ignore this issue. So tell me, which affects men’s attitudes toward women: a dubious book by Louann Brizendine or twenty hours a week of hard-core degrading pornography?Second ThoughtsThis conclusion is being written a several weeks after the rest of the review. What I wrote above is essentially an emotional response to the book. Now the emotion has worn off, I will treat this book as the scientific work it claims to be.The material about how women are limited by social conditioning and outright repression, while socially important, leads to only one scientific insight: we cannot judge the potential of women by their present level of achievement. That is all. But it does serve to soften up the reader for her message. It worked on me.The book may serve as a needed corrective for some of the simplistic stereotyping in the name of science out there. But is it also guilty of similar distortion in pursuit of an agenda that claims gender differences are a social construction? In other words, is this simply the other side in a culture war being fought using science as the battleground?That culture war has been raging for hundreds of years. Conservatives claim human nature is fixed, and we dare not change the ancient wisdom that keeps our impulses contained. Liberals contend that the mind is a blank slate, and humanity is perfectible with the right thinking and social intervention. I suspect those of you who like this book are really cheering that our side is beating up their side, like in a sporting event. And she is administering quite a beating. But this is an empirical question, not a matter of opinion. If you don’t understand the science, how can you possibly know if the scientific arguments here are valid?I don’t know much about neuroscience either, but I detect a number of serious warning signs pointing to a lack of objectivity. Despite the cheery tone, this book mainly consists of an unrelenting attack on any viewpoint that suggests gender differences are innate. It is hard to tell when she is criticizing scientific studies or amateur opinion, which has the effect of implying that the dumbest ideas are also the opinions of any scientists she is opposed to. This kind of polarization has no place in science. A look at the author’s publication list shows mainly commentaries rather than research, mainly aimed at a popular audience. This looks more like a campaigner rather than a scientist.Good science writing shows a passion for understanding the subject and a desire to explain it to the reader. There is none of that here. Instead, explanations are presented only as necessary for the reader to understand the words in her debunking effort. She overwhelms the reader with the sheer volume of scientific information. But volume does not add up to truth if that information is selective.I do not know to what degree gender differences are innate. Who knows, maybe our author has it mostly right. I simply cannot not trust this work to tell me that. Even when she tells me that neuroscience is not advanced enough to draw conclusions about gender, my response is that seems reasonable, but I will look elsewhere to find out. [A quick look suggests she is wrong.]This book is a great reminder that there is a lot of bad science writing out there. Unfortunately it is also a good example of that, yet another example of science corrupted by ideology."
112,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4973578-iset,5,"You've probably heard that men are just naturally better at spatial awareness and logical tasks whilst women are just naturally better at verbal and nurturing tasks. You've probably heard that men and women's brains are different. You may even have heard exasperated parents trying out gender neutral parenting exclaiming that their little girl/boy just seems to naturally gravitate towards pink dolls/blue trucks - it must be biological! Delusions of Gender debunks it all, delving into the real science behind these spurious claims.The book is divided into three sections. First, the sociological and psychological studies of gender differences. How are we to explain, for example, the fact that men seem to consistently do well in maths and women in verbal reasoning? It turns out - quite easily. The notion that men are better at certain things and women are better at other things is an entrenched stereotype. Consistently, in a scientific testing environment, when groups are primed before the test to buy into these stereotypes, they conform to cultural and societal demands of their gender - but when the groups are primed beforehand with a statement that no gender differences have ever been found, then both men and women defy the stereotypes and perform better even than the other gender at tasks that their own gender is supposedly bad at. This result bears out over countless tests, and reveals that when a categorised group is placed under 'stereotype threat', the distracting negative thinking that results significantly impacts on their performance in a given task - conversely, when the group is relaxed and not under threat, their true abilities are freed. There's more. When asked to self-report about how analytical/empathising they are, men and women will report that they fall into the stereotypes about their gender. However, when rigorous scientific is set up - for example, unwittingly recording two individuals in a room, after the fact asking one to note down their thoughts as they watch back the video, and then asking the other to guess what the first was thinking; both men and women show the same amount of ability to read people's faces and intuit their emotional state. In other words, self-reporting is unreliable as a true test of gender differences, and many tests claiming to prove a difference are unscientific, inadvertantly priming the subjects beforehand to perform according to existing social pressures.Okay, so social pressure is affecting people. But what about all that medical evidence that men and women's brains are different? It's actually very flimsy. Testosterone testing of babies in utero is not actually done by testing the baby's blood - but by testing the mother's blood, or the amniotic content. There are significant problems with several of the studies involving scanning the brains of adults - such as some studies only using female test subjects and not comparing against men in any way. Other studies are post-mortem. Several employ circular reasoning in their write ups to assert some sort of gender difference. ""But I've seen those different coloured scan images of male versus female brains on the internet!"" you may cry.
""It’s important to realise that the patches of colour you see on brain scans don’t actually show brain activity. Although it may seem as though fMRI and PET enable you to see a snapshot of the brain at work (or, as popular writers Allan and Barbara Pease claim, ‘to see your brain operating live on a television screen’), this simply isn’t the case. ‘Unfortunately, these pretty pictures hide the sausage factory’, as one neurologist put it. fMRI doesn’t measure neuronal activity directly. Instead, it uses a proxy: changes in blood oxygen levels. (PET uses a radioactive tracer isotope, which attaches itself to glucose or water molecules, to indirectly track blood flow.) Busier neurons need more oxygen and (after an initial dip) active brain regions have higher levels of oxygenated blood, because blood flow to that area increases. The oxygen is carried by the haemoglobin in red blood cells, and haemoglobin has slightly different magnetic qualities depending on how much oxygen it’s carrying. This creates a signal in the scanner (which pulses a magnetic field on and off). Neuroscientists then compare the difference in blood flow in brain regions during the task they’re interested in, with blood flow during a control task or rest state. (Ideally, the control task involves everything the experimental task entails – button pressing, word reading and so on – except for the psychological process you’re particularly interested in.) Researchers test for significant differences in blood flow in various locations of the brain regions during the two tasks, and if tests indicate that it is significant, a blob of colour is placed at the appropriate location on the picture of the brain. In other words, those coloured spots on the brain represent statistical significance at the end of several stages of complicated analysis – which means there’s plenty of scope for spurious findings of sex differences in neuroimaging research.""
Moreover, for every 1 neuroscience study claiming to find a difference between genders, there are 19 where both men and women were tested, no difference was discovered, and since the researcher's topic of interest was something other than gender differences the write up does not draw attention to the result - that no gender differences were found. The studies that do claim to find a difference also receive significantly more attention from people specifically looking for evidence to prove biological gender differences, and because the topic is so hot in our modern world.Alright, so neuroscience evidence is flimsy at best, and psychological testing of adults is unreliable unless performed with proper rigour. But what about children? Haven't there been tests of babies that show they prefer blue trucks/pink dolls? Unfortunately many of the tests claiming to prove such are also highly suspect. One study, for example, tested 3 month old male and female babies to see whether they preferred a Human face or a geometric mobile. Lo and behold, the male babies seemed to prefer the mobile, whilst female babies seemed to prefer the faces. Aha! But the face and the mobiles were presented to the babies separately, not simultaneously as is usual in such tests to truly determine if a baby prefers one thing over another - it's impossible therefore to say whether a preference was displayed. Furthermore, the researchers in the study knew what gender each baby they tested was, and there's reason to suspect they themselves may have been biasing the results by presenting a more friendly face to the female babies and moving the mobile around more with the male babies - creating the result they expected to see. Oh. Oh, indeed. More scientifically rigorous studies of babies' habits show that there is no difference in a six month old's preference between trucks and dolls - but this does kick in from around 9 months onwards. Is it nature asserting itself over nurture? Well, no. Another study tested whether babies truly do prefer a female face over a male one (i.e. testing whether we are biologically predisposed to think of women in a nurturing role). The babies seemed to prefer the female face - but all the babies in the first test group were being looked after primarily by their mothers. The test was repeated with babies who were being primarily raised by their fathers - those babies preferred male faces. Consistently, the results show environment over biology is the determining factor.The mother who had attempted gender neutral parenting only to wail; ""In the end I found her tucking the toy truck into bed and cuddling it! It must be biology!"" was asked by a shrewd researcher whether, in that household, one of the parents did most of the putting to bed - of course, it turned out the mother always put her daughter to bed. The fact of the matter is, even the most determined parents trying to employ gender neutral upbringing face an uphill struggle. Most actually bias the result, implicitly disapproving certain activities for their child despite outspokenly advocating them, and testing of children's reactions to words versus body language clearly demonstrates that they pick up on implict cues much more than verbal ones. Even with dedicated parents, the outside world is often intent on reinforcing gender roles, from multinational companies to the disapproving looks of less progressive parents. Gender is in fact the most strongly emphasised of any of the ways of categorising people, and children pick up on this from an exceptionally young age - it therefore becomes important for them to seek out clues about how to discover a person's gender and how to identify themselves, so they can fit in with a social group and be accepted - even when the parents at home are encouraging them to explore all kinds of play and activities.I'm going to conclude with the account of a couple who went the extra mile in their determination to raise their son and daughter in a truly gender neutral environment. Sandra and Daryl Bem, two psychologists;
""did all that they could to reduce the normally ubiquitous gender associations in their children’s environment: the information that lets children know what toys, behaviours, skills, personality traits, occupations, hobbies, responsibilities, clothing, hairstyles, accessories, colours, shapes, emotions and so on go with being male and female. This entailed, at its foundation, a meticulously managed commitment to equally shared parenting and household responsibilities. Trucks and dolls, needless to say, were offered with equal enthusiasm to both children; but also pink and blue clothing, and male and female playmates. Care was taken to make sure that the children saw men and women doing cross-gender jobs. By way of censorship, and the judicious use of editing, WhiteOut and marker pens, the Bems also ensured that the children’s bookshelves offered an egalitarian picture-book world... The second part of the Bems’ strategy was to, in place of the usual information about what it means to be male or female, promote the idea that the difference between males and females lies in their anatomy and reproductive functions. Your typical preschooler enjoys a detailed knowledge of gender roles, but remains a bit hazy regarding the hard, biological fact that males differ from females when it comes to the allocation of such items as penises, testicles and vaginas.'[O]ur son Jeremy, then age four, … decided to wear barrettes [hair slides] to nursery school. Several times that day, another little boy told Jeremy that he, Jeremy, must be a girl because ‘only girls wear barrettes.’ After trying to explain to this child that ‘wearing barrettes doesn’t matter’ and that ‘being a boy means having a penis and testicles,’ Jeremy finally pulled down his pants as a way of making his point more convincingly. The other child was not impressed. He simply said, ‘Everybody has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.’'Unlike their peers, Jeremy and Emily were discouraged from using socially determined trappings such as hairstyle, clothing, accessories or profession as a guide to a person’s biological sex. If the children asked whether someone was male or female, their parents ‘frequently denied certain knowledge of the person’s sex, emphasizing that without being able to see whether there was a penis or a vagina under the person’s clothes, [they] had no definitive information.’Step forward, please, all those parents who go to similar lengths to protect their children from acquiring prevailing cultural assumptions about gender. And do try to avoid being trampled in the rush. The Bems’ efforts, I think you’ll agree, seriously outclass what we normally, generously, think of as gender-neutral parenting... The intensity and scope of the Bems’ efforts offer a helpful hint as to just how gendered children’s environments are. To this day social structure, media and peers offer no shortage of information to children about masculinity and femininity.""

113,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"Delusions of Gender: The Real Science Behind Sex Differences by Cordelia Fine“Delusions of Gender” is an outstanding book that compels you to take a closer look at society and our science as it relates to gender issues. Academic psychologist and author, Dr. Cordelia Fine with a sharp sense of humor and an excellent grasp of what constitutes good science dismantles many claims of what can be considered neurosexism. This is a very provocative book as it tackles claims about male and female brains, and the gender cycle. This fascinating 371-page book is broken out into the following three parts: 1. Half-Changed World, Half-Changed Minds, 2. Neurosexism, and Recycling Gender.Positives:1. Engaging, witty, and provocative book. This is also a well-researched book that is not afraid to tackle head on popular misconceptions on gender.2. A fascinating and often misunderstood topic of sex differences.3. The science is accessible and the narrative flows nicely thanks to an infusion of humor. The book is also full of interesting anecdotes.4. Great use of counter-research to combat what Dr. Fine has concluded is poor science.5. One of the best features of this book is Dr. Fine’s relentless research against commonly held misconceptions by well-known scientists and authors. She makes a very compelling case against at best poor science or worst pseudoscience.6. Makes the very strong case on how society can impact associative memory. “Unlike explicitly held knowledge, where you can be reflective and picky about what you believe, associative memory seems to be fairly indiscriminate in what it takes on board. Most likely, it picks up and responds to cultural patterns in society, media and advertising, which may well be reinforcing implicit associations you don’t consciously endorse.” “When gender is salient in the environment, or we categories someone as male or female, gender stereotypes are automatically primed.”7. The impact of stereotypes. “Research suggests that the deadly combination of ‘knowing-and-being’ (women are bad at math and I am a woman) can lower performance expectations, as well as trigger performance anxiety and other negative emotions.”8. A look at mothers versus single women. “While parenthood served as no disadvantage at all to men, there was evidence of a substantial ‘motherhood penalty’. Mothers received only half as many callbacks as their identically qualified childless counterparts.”9. The reality of sexual harassment.10. Covers many issues regarding gender equality, including at home. “As Gloria Steinem recently reminded a journalist, “The idea of having it all never meant doing it all. Men are parents, too, and actually women will never be equal outside the home until men are equal inside the home.” Great quote.11. So are there biological roots to gender inequality? This is a recurring theme in the book.12. The reality is that there is a lot of poor science involving gender issues. “There’s something a little shocking about the discrepancy between the weakness of the scientific data on the one hand and the strength of the popular claims on the other.”13. A fascinating look at Neurosexism. “The sheer complexity of the brain makes interpreting and understanding the meaning of any sex differences we find in the brain a very difficult task.” “Neurosexism promotes damaging, limiting, potentially self-fulfilling stereotypes.”14. The file-drawer phenomenon. “This contributes to the so-called file-drawer phenomenon, whereby studies that do find sex differences get published, but those that don’t languish unpublished and unseen in a researcher’s file drawer.”15. Debunks myths with glee. “So let us, with healthy skepticism, summarize all of this as clearly as we can. Nonexistent sex differences in language lateralization, mediated by nonexistent sex differences in corpus callosum structure, are widely believed to explain nonexistent sex differences in language skills.” “The speculations of a few scientists quickly evolve into the colorful fabrications of popular neurosexism – the subspecialty within the larger discipline of neurononsense.”16. The four basic pieces of advice for anyone considering incorporating neuroscientific findings into a popular book or article about gender.17. One of the most astute observations of the books, too good not to share. “Genes don’t determine our brains (or our bodies), but they do constrain them. The developmental possibilities for an individual are neither infinitely malleable nor solely in the hands of the environment. But the insight that thinking, behavior and experiences change the brain, directly, or through changes in genetic activity, seems to strip the word ‘hardwiring’ of much useful meaning. As neurophysiologist Ruth Bleier put it over two decades ago, we should ‘view biology as potential, as capacity and not as static entity. Biology itself is socially influenced and defined; it changes and develops in interaction with and response to our minds and environment, as our behaviors do. Biology can be said to define possibilities but not determine them; it is never irrelevant but it is also not determinant.” Read that again, and again.18. A look at parenting. “It seems, then, that gender stereotypes, even if perhaps only implicitly held, affect parents’ behavior towards their babies.”19. Interesting facts that have an impact. “The Dr. Seuss books are rightly classics, adored by children and a joy of rediscovery for parents. Yet as Lamb and Brown observe, in all the forty-two books he wrote, not one has a female lead in its central story.”20. Copious amounts of notes and they are linked. A comprehensive bibliography.Negatives:1. Very little not to like about this excellent book but I would have probably started with defining the differences between key terms like sex and gender. The layperson tends to use these terms indiscriminately.2. The book does a phenomenal job of at the very least casting doubt or outright debunking commonly held misconceptions on gender issues; however, it doesn’t succeed nowhere near as well on defining the real science behind sex differences.3. Using scientific claims from centuries ago to debunk easily comes across as strawman arguments or low hanging fruits to grab on to.4. At times I feel she doesn’t necessarily apply the same amount of scrutiny to those studies that support her argument versus those that don’t. I prefer the instances where she simply states that we just don’t know.In summary, this was truly an eye opening and cognitive-dissonance inducing book. One of the great things I take from this book is to not fall prey to poor science and specifically, be alert of neurosexism. I’m not a neuroscience to know if all the conclusions that Dr. Fine makes are sound or not, but she is very persuasive and the book made me think. Witty, provocative and just fun to read, I highly recommend it!Further suggestions: “Science and Gender” by Ruth Bleier, “The Myths of Gender” and “Sexing the Body” by Gisela Kaplan, “Gene Worship” by Lesley Roger, “Sexual Science” by Cynthia Russett, and “The Social Psychology of Gender” by Laurie Rudman and Peter Glick. These books were recommended notably by the author."
114,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1917722-chy,4,"Okay, look. I'm rounding up from about a 3.3---yes, rounding up from that. It makes sense to me.There're a lot of dog-ears and underlines, but some of them are angry marks. I got very frustrated with about the middle two-fourths of it. The first fourth and the last fourth, I was much more interested in.The last fourth was what I thought the entire book was to be about---about how society and subtle clues train modern ""gender identity."" Because, dude, kids are sponges.The first one-fourth had some great lines and sentiments I agreed with, at their base. That is, perception is reality.The middle two-fourths? (Okay, I'd say, half, but it sounds wrong, since it's in the middle.) Yeah, that frustrated the ever-loving shit out of me. Because it seemed (to me, at least) she spent all that time leading up to making a point that I already knew. And I kept thinking, over an over, what she waited to say until the end of all that.And it just about killed me.Basically, I'm a fucking amateur, and I know that the way you live your life---your thought processes change the way your brain works. That is to say, nothing is hard-wired.Guess what; you spend your life obsessing over math, and the parts of your brain that deal with math are going to be larger than someone who's not obsessed with math, Einstein.So the fact that she laid it on thick, and laid on all this evidence, without just saying that until the end, just about killed me.Well, now, if she'd said it in the beginning of that section and went on, I would have had no problem. It just---it kept making me wonder if she was ever even going to point that out.And it drove me nuts.A mild frustration had nothing to do with her, but with a few of experiments they carried out. I mean, yeah, I was frustrated with the (sometimes) wild interpretations of some of them (as I was meant to be), but there were a few that hit me, personally. A few for which, all I could think, ""And then they had one more step to do."" Especially with the empathy tests. Oh, I could come up with such an awesome empathy test...There were even a couple of times that Fine really let me down. One, when she cited the behavior of rats to prove her point. And then, later, when rats didn't quite prove her point, she mentions how we really can't equate the behavior of rats to humans. It made me sad, because she had a point both times, but... Oof.Lots of good stuff, but a lot of frustration as well. And not nearly as much ""hard information"" as I was expecting. At least, not the kind I was expecting, because the kind of hard information I was looking forward to was only in the last quarter of the book. And there was not nearly as much of it as I had been hoping for. It barely went beyond what I already knew. It didn't challenge me the way I was hoping to be challenged.But enough of that. Let's end on my favorite line of the book. It has to do with the Bem children, who were raised as just about as ""gender nuetral"" as anyone could ever manage. The boy tells a classmante, "" 'being a boy means having a penis and testicles.' ""The boy who was critisizing him for wearing barrettes to nursery school comes back with, ""Everyone has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.""That right there made the whole book for me.Anyway, the point of the rating is not that I really liked it, but that I really like that it exists."
115,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,5,"I was really impressed with ‘Delusions of Gender’. It dissects and summarises research clearly, critiques stereotypes intelligently and analytically, and keeps the tone witty and readable yet more academic than journalistic. I found the synthesis of neuroscientific research on sex differences extremely helpful. Media articles that cheerfully claim sexist stereotypes are biological inevitabilities make me very angry. Fine channelled that same anger into writing an excellent rebuttal, which will be very useful to remember when the next wave of pseudo-scientific claims hit the papers.This book makes an excellent accompaniment to Living Dolls: The Return of Sexism, which focuses more on the societal implications of biological determinism-based sexism. It also brings up the important debate about applying scientific methodologies to research questions that are based on unquestioned stereotypes and assumptions. An example of this is the use of 'masculinity' as an objective index, like height and weight. As Fine states, including fMRI scans makes any research findings appear more weighty and scientific. Yet inferring major psychological differences between the sexes from disputed differences in brain structure is very problematic. The brain and the mind are not congruent. I’d also pick out for praise the latter chapters on young children learning about gender. That was not something I’d ever really thought about before, but of course kids observe how carefully adults sort people into the ‘man’ and ‘woman’ boxes. This part of the book includes amusing summaries of research investigating whether and/or why girls play more with ‘girl toys’ and boys with ‘boy toys’. I particularly liked the idea that some researchers made a My Little Pony into a desirable boy’s toy by painting it black, trimming its mane, and sharpening its teeth. Conversely, girls were ‘enchanted by… the lavender-satin-covered guns and holster, and the pink furred war helmet’. By the age of five, these children had picked up from their surrounding the sexual dimorphism of toys. As Fine points out, even clothes for newborns are gendered. She makes a strong argument for social over biological gender determinism.Apologies for eliding sex and gender in the paragraph above. Fine does not critique the gender binary or cover intersectionality issues in much depth, as these are not the focus of her book. Neither are they ever mentioned (that I’ve seen) by media articles that oversimplify and distort neuroscience to excuse sexism. Nonetheless, similar effects (regarding ‘stereotype threat’ for example) are noted to impact on women and ethnic minorities in the earlier chapters covering sociological research. There’s clearly a lot more work needed in the fields of sociology and neuroscience, but I agree with Fine that scientists have a responsibility to consider their unwitting assumptions about gender. As well as the ways in which their findings will be treated by a depressingly sexist media."
116,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie,4,"All those studies that say that women are bad at math and men are bad at relationships because their brains are hardwired that way can be very discouraging, and there are a LOT of those studies. But Cordelia Fine has looked into those studies and found flaws in them. Add into that a large number of studies that show how easy it is to jigger people’s minds into doing better or worse at tasks depending on how they are psychologically primed before hand and we can see where the author is coming from. Fine’s thesis is rather than there being any physical difference between male and female brains, the differences that we see in math scores are there because our culture expects them to be there. Even when people attempt to raise their children in a gender neutral environment, culture intervenes. On TV, in schools, in children’s books, in the clothing sold to children- everything is divided into genders, and females end up less adventuresome, more nurturing, expected to be nicer and not fight, and to focus on home and caring rather than invented and discovering. Toys for girls and boys are separated, and children who choose to play with toys for the opposite gender are disapproved of, especially boys who play with dolls or other ‘girl’ toys. Tomboys may be told to act more ladylike, but boys will get beat up by other boys. The core of her argument is that studies where test takers are primed to consider themselves members of sets other than gender yield different results than tests taken when the test takers are told things like “men traditionally do better on this test”. For instance, when a group of males and females take a test and are told before hand that people who go to certain colleges (colleges that some of the test takers go to) do better on this same test, the test takers conform to this and the males and females who belong to the colleges mentioned both do better on the test than the non-certain collegians- and the males and females in that group score the same as each other on the test under these conditions. These tests have been done numerous times by different researchers, and the results are always the same- the test takers conform to expectations set up before the test. Therefore, psychology trumps brain structure where intellectual subjects are concerned. It’s an interesting proposition, and one I think needs to be investigated more- much more. There’s a lot still to be untangled in gender studies. Intellectual abilities are jumbled in with emotional tendencies, and I definitely think they should be considered separately. She pretty much ignores the effect of hormones on emotional states except for the case of fetal testosterone. I think that while this book doesn’t settle any gender issue questions, it does cast a lot of doubt on previous studies and urges us to look at them much harder."
117,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237879-elaine-nelson,5,"I happened to run across this book at the library having forgotten that it was in my ""to-read"" list. I'm SO glad I did, and given a certain pair of somewhat ranty posts a couple of months back, only wish I'd read it sooner! I literally could not put it down - as in: ""no really, I need to go to bed/back to my desk from lunch/off the bus, I have to put the book away.""In short, social construction of gender: you're soaking in it. (And especially, your brain is soaking in it.)1) Priming & stereotype threat affect everything. Just checking gender on a form before taking a test changes womens' performance, especially on math tests. More priming (being told that the test relates to gender, watching a gender-stereotyped commercial, etc) increases the effect.2) Most of the ""science"" as it's filtered through to the popular media is a disaster of half-baked assumptions, small and/or poorly-constructed experiments, and willful misunderstanding of the actual results. (She tears apart one popular writer; it's kinda fun.)3) Worse, those lame results create a feedback loop, combined with the impossibility of gender-neutral child-rearing, that increases the problem of stereotype threat, and makes genuine social change more difficult.Le sigh. Not only is the feminist struggle not over, we may actually be hitting a really hard spot.On the plus side, I'm fired up now. Not just that, but I'm thinking more about my own personal construction of gender identity, including my history with math and science. There's a post I wrote about my life with math a while back, and there I wrote about it as a choice between writing and math - now I'm seriously looking back and wondering about the effect of gender stereotypes, and whether I might have come to computing sooner given different circumstances. I think it's worth noticing that choices exist in a constrained environment, constrained both by the external world, and by our own unexamined or incompletely-formed attitudes.As for the writing style, it's a delightful read. She's got a sharp conversational tone that pulled me in; I even read the footnotes.HIGHLY recommended, great in combination with Pink Brain Blue Brain."
118,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5324619-noor,5,"""Delusions of Gender"" has proved to be one of the most informative and interesting books I've read this year. The book consists of three parts that essentially discuss gender-stereotypes, Neurosexism, and the struggles of attempting to raise children in a gender-neutral environment.Cordelia starts by explaining how implicit and explicit beliefs are two separate things that don't always correlate. Despite ""consciously"" holding certain beliefs, there is a clash between the reflective self and our associative memory which is heavily influenced by the social environment surrounding us. When gender becomes salient and constantly primed in our daily life, it seeps into our perception of others and of ourselves, and we often do it in stereotypical ways. The book is filled with numerous experiments that support this idea. When we categorise people as male or female, we are instantly activating gender associations that affect our behaviour, values, performance etc. A perfect manifestation of this activated gender-inequality is how women are treated in a workplace dominated by men. Women experience segregation, exclusion, harassment and attack just by showing up to work basically.The second part of the book focuses on neurosexism and was the most difficult for me to digest; simply because I was unaware of just how much these popular neuroscientific claims are based on shaky empirical evidence. Gender stereotypes are legitimised by these pseudo-scientific explanations, and often become part of popular media. Neurosexism activates gender stereotypes which feeds into the public sphere + affects attitudes, identity & performance. It all leads us to become our own self-fulfilling prophecies.And the last bit of the book should be read by all parents who try to raise their children in a gender-neutral environment. It goes way beyond giving boys barbie dolls and giving girls fire trucks.All in all, this was an eye-opener for me when it comes to neuroscience and how it's used to reinforce old-fashioned stereotypes/roles through covering them with the finery of science.PS: Cordelia is quite witty. Found myself laughing out loud at times."
119,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4508080-julie-bozza,5,"A bit of a hard slog to read, especially as the few moments of humour didn't really suit me (too sarcastic). However, the important thing is that Fine makes vital headway towards an understanding of gender that I can really get behind. Gender difference is not 'hardwired' into us, and Fine deftly demolishes the pseudo-science that tells us otherwise. Fine quotes Kimmel in asserting 'gender difference is the product of gender inequality'; that is, we create and recreate gender difference while interacting with our society. The process begins at such an early age that many new parents, no matter how gender-neutral they try to be, end up assuming that gender difference is biologically or neurologically innate in their children. Fine does a good job of explaining why this happens, and how it will ultimately be worth it if we keep plugging away the gender-neutral objective. Fine also articulates how permeable the boundaries can be between our own sense of self and society's sense of who we are - or should be. I've struggled to articulate my struggles with this, but I've often felt like an asymmetrical heptagonal peg who is nevertheless forced (by otherwise well-meaning folk) to fit into the round hole that society makes available to me. Gender is certainly one aspect of this. My social sciences tutor told me I was making too much of the external forces - but now I've found Fine to back me up and explore the implications, and I feel inordinately grateful. Lastly, Fine ends with a note of hope. While she has shown how deeply woven gender difference (and hence gender inequality) is in our society, she has also shown that it is malleable. We can change this, though it will take time and effort. Let's keep trying! I would love to see what we can become when we are so much freer to be ourselves, whoever we may be."
120,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Subtitle: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference. Cordelia Fine, while an apparently well-read and quite competent scientist, makes no pretense of objectivity in this book. She's got an axe to grind with a whole school of research that aims to use modern brain science to convince us that male and female brains are intrinsically, fundamentally, and irrevocably different. Oh, and I also think the picture of her on the dust jacket is pretty hot. I just love imagining her getting all worked up about this. Wait, did I say that out loud?Anyway, Fine's point is best illustrated by an anecdote from the experience of a four year old named Jeremy, who had been raised by parents who were extraordinarily zealous gender-neutral parents. He decided one day to wear barrettes to nursery school, and gets into an argument with another boy, who says that he is a girl. Finally, Jeremy pulls down his pants and points out that he has a penis, as a way of making his point. The other boy says, “Everybody has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.”Whether you think the parents who let their boy wear barrettes to school were weird here, or the society that teaches a boy that the difference between male and female has more to do with hairstyle than genitals, depends on your opinions about gender (and society) generally. So does a lot of other (less amusing but more substantial) evidence, published in scientific journals or mainstream media, that Fine takes us on a tour of.Some of it is related to the general fallacy of all brain-scan evidence. Just because we see a difference in brain activity (using MRI or some other method), doesn't mean it's genetic or otherwise hardwired. All it shows is that it happens in the brain, and really, if we're talking about thoughts, attitudes, emotions, and so forth, where else would we expect it to happen? Also, like muscles, areas of the brain can grow larger or smaller over time as they are used more or less (whether for cultural reasons or any other), so again evidence from brain scans, while perhaps useful for other purposes, tells us nothing about whether differences in behavior are primarily biological or cultural. Seeing a brain scan, however, tells us that it has something to do with biology, and our instinctive reaction is still to divide things into biological and cultural, and if it's one it must not be the other.There is a long and well-documented history of scientific attempts to explain to us why women and men are Just Different, in ways that have nothing (directly) to do with procreation. The suspicious thing is that, while the rationales differ from decade to decade and from one century to the next, the conclusions always point in the same direction. Fine takes us on a thoroughly readable tour of this history, spiced up a bit by her, at times, barely contained rage.Make no mistake, this is not an even-handed weighing of the evidence; it is rather a very well-documented and data-driven polemic. If it were written by a man, I'd say that the confrontational and science-oriented analysis is very typical of a masculine style. Instead, I'll say it's an emotional treatment, showing a feminine inability to maintain objectivity on scientific topics. Either way, it's a hoot to read."
121,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6537005-daniel,3,"""Delusions of Gender"" is an engaging read, well-written and incisive. Cordelia Fine makes a convincing argument that gender differences in performance assessed through various metrics are to a large extent the result of social cues, reactions to internalized stereotypes, and unconscious priming. Her critique of studies of gender differences in psychological experiments is comprehensive, and her depiction of the current state of sexism is both convincing and often horrifying.Unfortunately, her fixation on discrediting both contemporary pop-psychology books selling innate gender differences and the arguments of dusty sexists from centuries past comes off a bit like clubbing baby seals (or possibly arm-wrestling five-year-olds). Her arguments against current neuroscientific techniques--especially neuroimaging using techniques like fMRI--fall particularly flat, as she relies repeatedly upon equating sophisticated real-time 3d measurements of blood-flow in the brain with crude volumetric measurements of skull capacity used by those sexist scientists of yore. This is trite and annoying.Likewise, she fails to engage biological and evolutionary arguments in any meaningful sense, instead relying on the tired allegation that evolutionary psychology and biology are only sexist justifications for relegating women to lives of domestic drudgery. She perhaps hopes that her readers are not savvy enough to Wikipedia the fields. Her argument that structural differences between the brains of men and women (after criticizing imaging and anatomical studies, she grudgingly admits that these do exist) compensate for differences in physiology to produce similar behaviors in males and females is interesting and may even be true to some extent--humans male and female, after all, must accomplish many of the same tasks to survive--but is unsupported and feels like hand-waving. She does not engage with the concepts of hormonal modulation of brain activity or neurotransmitter/receptor distribution and prevalence to any great degree. She brushes off the striking possibility that biological differences may predispose men and women toward different goals irrespective of nebulous measures of aptitude or spurious notions of ""natural gender roles."" The human brain she seems to prefer is the black box too intricate to be understood on a mechanistic level, a network of abstract associations accessible only to psychologists distributing questionnaires and bubble sheets to college students participating in studies for course credit.So, while entertaining (and perhaps convincing to audiences disinclined to read it critically or who already embrace its ideological underpinnings), the book's thesis does not strike home, and Fine's claim that it is dangerous for researchers to ask these questions at all should be disturbing to any reader who values science over ideology."

If I had read this in audio, a format my brain can handle for serious subjects, I probably would have rated it much higher, and gotten through it much faster (and I'll be honest, retained more than 10% of it). So take this review with a grain of salt. (P.S. I just googled that phrase, and it evolved from something Pliny the Elder wrote in 77 A.D. Language is so weird.) I will be trying it again maybe in a couple of years by audio. Unless someone can point me in the direction of a book on the same subject that is more recent that I should read first (this was published in 2010).Aside from that issue, this book is also less of a thing on its own than it is the author debunking other scientific studies or books, things that people take as a given, or as ""proven"" by science. Cognitive bias plays a huge role not only in the behavior of test subjects, but in the minds of the scientists performing the studies. Which is enjoyable in its own way, but not quite what I was expecting. The book is very heavy on cautioning the reader about these types of studies, since gender is so hard to study, and really just instills a healthy amount of scientific skepticism. I remember it being a lot of, this isn't proven, we actually don't ""know"" as much as we think we do.I can't emphasize how much my brain did not retain any of the information I read, so this is really just a useless review. Judging by my friends' reviews on Goodreads, I just really need to give it a break, and then pick this up again some time down the road when my brain is being more amenable."

I gobbled this non-fiction up like it was a light lunch after a hard day's manual labor. Every page was packed with jaw-dropping information - horrifying methodological flaws, research which argues two diametrically opposed concepts, and outright deception, all designed to prove that men and women are not and cannot possibly be equal. Like, here's one example: Fine mentions the author of a popular book on the subject, who cites research about ""mirror neurons,"" (women have more of them, which supposedly makes them more empathetic.) The author mentions a study of therapists which indicated that the most successful therapists are those that ""mirror"" their clients words, gestures, and verbal patterns. Interestingly, (says the author), ALL of the successful therapists were women. Because they have more mirror neurons, and are more attuned to others, right?WRONG. Cordelia Fine looked up the study (thank you, Cordelia! That would be a big nuisance for the Average Reader) and as it turns out? ALL OF THE THERAPISTS IN THE STUDY WERE WOMEN. Yeah, that's right. They only recruited women for the study, so the study proves absolutely nothing about men vs. women. And if you think this sort of thing is an anomaly, wrong again - Fine's detailed work found this sort of thing occurring over and over again. Moreover, Fine is terrific at highlighting how the social context of everything men and women do contributes to these gender stereotypes, and at explaining how gender bias affects the neuroscientific research. This is an absolutely fantastic book - I have the urge to acquire copies for every teacher, every employer, every parent on the planet. It made me rethink more of my life that I would have believed possible. Seriously, even if you think you would disagree with it: READ IT. If nothing else, you will enjoy Fine's smooth and witty prose."

If you’re the type of person who enjoys nitpicking underpowered studies over methodological errors that affect validity and throwing shade at poor referencing while also being a flagrant feminist this is for you. I am not sure how this would go down for other people without a background in neuroscience because those parts were undoubtedly my favorite although I see how that part of the book could be too technical and heavy. I didn’t learn anything new science-wise but I did discover that there still are some fucking assholes willing to forgo the science completely just in order to tell you that your female brain HAS TO KNOW HOW TO EMPATHIZE AND BE NURTURING and that of course those morons have a wide audience just dying for any shard of pseudo-evidence that may point to the fact that their daughters are meant to be breeding subservient cows and that their sons will bring about the rapture. Of course this book proves yet again the only truth known to humans besides inevitable death and that is that men are trash. Besides that, I wholeheartedly enjoyed the psychology aspects of the book and if I had any doubt about the ubiquity of gender then it was all erased in the last part where she lists study after study proving how the idea of gender and how everything is gendered almost from birth and how early toddlers take on these ideas and digest them almost regardless of how unisex parents attempt to make their environments at home; the world at large is sexist. Go figure. And then there’s the ever expanding body of evidence that simply makes it clear that women have always always always been just as capable as men and that as the gender gap closes (despite the screeching and howling of men) women find their ways into board room and ORs and mines and factories and fucking haters continue to come up with more sophisticated schemes of bullshit to make it seem like we can’t but we’re doing it anyway.

129,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14821636-andrew-fish,1,"The differences between men and women have probably been a topic of debate since the dawn of time. In recent decades, however, as society has progressed from subsistence and survival to consumerism and choice the issue has gained a degree of salience. The question of whether women are actively held down in their careers or whether they passively make decisions which close off paths to advancement becomes more than a curiosity when careers become both a means to achieve a better life and a source of fulfilment in themselves. And earlier in life, the science of gender difference could make a significant difference to educational outcomes if it could be robustly investigated. The time, it seems, is right for a good scientific look at the subject.Unfortunately, this isn't it.Fine is a psychologist by training, and whilst there's definitely scope to study the issue of gender difference through psychology, she seems reluctant to do this in any depth. The opening section of the book which nominally covers this ground is quite thin on actual studies and seems instead to rely heavily on anecdote, giving the book the feel more of a polemic rather than an academic assessment. What science there is, meanwhile, is treated in an uneven manner, promoting the studies which suit the central thesis and denigrating any which don't. Frequently, Fine goes beyond the studies and draws conclusions which aren't supported by any of the evidence she has presented.So, for example, when looking at a study about the effect of priming on women's mathematical abilities, she not only accepts the results without question, she positively crows about the fact that the women did better than the men without the priming. For this to be a valid observation, both male and female participants would have to have an even spread of intellect, presumably using some kind of test as part of the selection process. The trouble with this is that you are then pre-determining the results: if the selection test were gender-neutral, the gender-neutral part of the study would be consistent with the selection process and you would end up with roughly equal results for men and women. If the theory were correct, there would then be lower results for the women in the gender-biased part. If the selection process were not gender-neutral, meanwhile, then if the theory held the women would seem equal to the men in the selection process and better in the gender-neutral study itself.From those results you could prove that priming made a difference to the test results, but not that there was any inherent difference between male and female aptitude in itself. To go further would be circular reasoning (something Fine criticises about another study later in the book).It's like the constant claim that girls are better at school - fifty years ago, the reverse was claimed. What changed in between? The education system. Clearly there is some kind of difference between the sexes there (something Fine seems pathologically averse to) but if one system of education produced stronger male results and the other stronger female all you can say is that different methods favour the sexes differently - you can't claim this makes one superior to the other.In other places, such as the behaviour of women in male-dominated careers, it seems there are no studies Fine can draw on. By definition, you'd find it hard to create a female-dominated version of the same career for comparison, but it doesn't stop the author from coming to conclusions about the effect of those environments without anything beyond anecdote and hypothesis.The most detailed analysis in favour of her argument comes toward the end of the book, when looking at the gender stereotypes to which children are exposed in their early years and how this affects their choice of toys and sense of dress. Unfortunately, here she has narrowed the argument too much: it may be demonstrable that social forces drive boys to wear blue and girls pink, but this would hardly explain the more abstract alleged differences between the sexes. When was the last time your child came home claiming they'd been excluded from the spatial reasoning group on the basis of gender?With the results which don't suit her, the author is more exacting. When looking at a study about infant response to faces and mobile phones, for example, she casts aspersions on the methodology, hypothesises about all kinds of ways the results could have been skewed (always assuming such skews would be systematically biased in the same direction) and even implies that the experimenters could have been acting out of an unconscious gender bias themselves. Apart from the unprofessionalism of casting aspersions without evidence, it seems weak to subject a study you don't like to this level of criticism when it could have been equally true of any of the studies supporting the case. Stepping outside her field, Fine is dismissive of biological studies and applies an extremely shaky attack on neurology - regarding it as an inadequately direct proxy measure of brain activity that is subject to confirmation bias. If that's true of neurology, what it does it say about psychology as a reliable indicator? This attack allows her to dismiss any conclusions from the field she doesn't like, but again she's all too quick to accept any that she does. She constantly falls for the same fallacy, that if you can debunk a very specific prediction made by someone in a particular field, you can dismiss any evidence from that field when it doesn't suit your agenda. The constant comparisons to long-dismissed theories such as brain-pan measurement are a reductio ad absurdum argument with little logical validity and the quotes which open most chapters - generally over a century old and clearly not acceptable to modern readers - come across as an attempt to prime the reader into a form of indignation which switches off their reasoning faculties for the rest of the chapter and allows them to accept Fine's arguments without criticism. I even spotted a very old psychologists' trick - starting a sentence with ""by now you will all be thinking"" - which is a blatant attempt at manipulation of the reader.Here and there we find snippets of actual information - a chance remark about spatial reasoning differing in babies of only a few months old, for example - but unless they fit the central argument, they are passed over quickly. An anecdote about a woman having been masturbated over, by contrast, is alluded to several times across a chapter. And there's little gender-balance in the topics themselves either: apart from a brief mention of female intuition right at the beginning, the book focuses almost entirely on areas where women are alleged to be deficient. The impression given is that this is a book written by someone working out their own issues rather than dispassionately looking at the field.And this is often a problem with psychologists. Freud's obsession with mother fantasies reeked of projection, Kahneman's instinct over reason view of the brain suggests a man struggling to justify his own bad decisions. To see what Fine's problems are you need only look at the language she uses, the metaphors she chooses and the examples she latches onto. The book is riddled with misandistric metaphor and there are a number of coded attacks on her husband. Take the chapter where she envisages a hypothetical job-swap with her spouse. When looking at his ability to do her job, she attacks his literacy - comparing it to a ten year-old. She then looks at her ability to do his job, but rather than admit any limitation on her own part, she sidesteps the issue and instead turns it into another backhanded attack on her husband - in this case the likelihood of his nagging her from beyond the grave. It doesn't take a degree in psychology to spot the signs of an inferiority complex.I don't pretend to know what the biological basis for behaviour is, and I accept that there are a lot of bad studies out there and bad books using the results. But for a book whose byline is ""the real science behind gender difference"" I was expecting more than just a series of attacks. And it's a shame, because the issue is both interesting and important. In my opinion, there clearly are elements of behaviour that are inherited (how else would cuckoos transmit their parasitical tendencies?) but what that inheritance mechanism is and how far it reaches into human behaviour has, as far as I can see, yet to be established. To claim it has no effect on humans would be to think as those who attacked Darwin because whilst they could accept evolution, they felt that to claim humans were a product of evolution was a step too far. One science Fine didn't look at all is anthropology, which for anyone who is genuinely looking for the true reasons for gender difference would seem the obvious place to start. I suggest for those who are after a book which informs them rather than just gives them a reason to be angry at the state of the world, that would be a better field to explore."
130,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17161968-fergus-murray,5,"Delusions of Gender, by Cordelia Fine, is an extended critique of efforts to scientifically study differences between the sexes, and the efforts of many writers to apply alleged science in their writings about such differences. The book is rich in technical detail, which might bog down some readers, but most of those details are fascinating. Fine is a lucid and entertaining writer, especially in her more acerbic moments - of which there are plenty here. She finds a lot of shoddy science and shameless misuse of would-be science that would raise the hackles of any neuroscientist or feminist, let alone someone like her who happens to be both.This is a book with an agenda, and political agendas tend not to sit comfortably with science - but to pretend that politics never seeps into science while nobody is looking would be disingenuous. In fact, Fine's agenda - to bring out the reasons to doubt science that supposedly demonstrates innate differences between sexes - is at least as much scientific as political, and I think it is legitimate. It is something to bear in mind while reading this book, though, and there are times she goes out of her way to present things in such a way as to minimise the possibility of interpretation in terms of innate differences. As far as I can see she always stops short of misrepresenting the science, though, and the whole approach needs to be seen in the context of discourse which routinely takes essential differences for granted, whether the evidence supports them or not.The book is divided into three parts. The first is 'Half-changed World', Half-Changed Minds, which largely focuses on the interplay of cultural expectations and attempts to measure sex differences scientifically. This largely consists of accounts of experiments demonstrating the effects of cultural norms on things that people might be interested in measuring, and experiments which fail to take these factors into account. For example, she looks at experiments investigating the effect of telling the subjects what 'the latest science' has to say about the sorts of tests they are about to perform, to show that girls do significantly better on mathematical tasks if they think that science says they should. Even more subtly, females rate their mathematical ability as worse after they have just been reminded of their sex by having to tick a box at the beginning to say they are females. This gives us an interesting lens for looking at gender differences in maths tests which disregard the weight of cultural expectations, and indeed at systematic tendencies for females to choose less mathematical study and career paths. Having established many profound and subtle ways that social expectations and structures shape behaviours and perfomance, the theme of the second part of the book is Neurosexism - premature efforts to explain differences in behaviour and performance with reference to the brain, rather than society. Fine's most basic point is that it is rather soon to be looking for explanations of most of these things in neuroscience, when societal explanations have not been ruled out, and the relationship between the mind and the brain is still so unclear. More than that, she shows time and again that many authors are disturbingly willing to go way beyond what neurology can tell us, while pretending that they are not. Perhaps the single worst offender here is Louann Brizendine, author of The Female Brain, a serial abuser and inventor of neuroscience to back up her ideas about the differences between males and females - but she is one of many. Fine makes the point that people have been finding 'explanations' for sex differences in the brain for well over a century, from the observation that female brains tend to be a bit lighter than male ones through to modern notions of hardwiring. At the same time, people have routinely assumed that all kinds of observed differences between the sexes are natural and inevitable, when later experience has regularly shown them to be no such thing.The final section is titled Re-Cycling Gender, and it concerns itself with the future of gender relations and the science of sex. Fine is worried about the cyclical nature of some kinds of self-fulfilling prophecy - about dodgy science being used to teach yet another generation of young men and women that there are certain natural roles that they ought to be filling, certain characteristics they should expect to have. She emphasises again how difficult it is to pick apart innate and culturally conditioned differences, and the importance of keeping an open mind about questions that science has not yet been able to settle. With a better scientific understanding of the role of society in forming the mind and the brain, and a sceptical eye on the interesting but inconclusive findings of neuroscience, we may approach true sexual equality yet. Without such circumspection, as Fine argues, we may find ourselves sliding back to ideas about the sexes which are both unhelpful and ill-founded.This is an important book, because the trend towards explaining sex differences with impressive-sounding neurological findings has great potential to set back ideas about gender roles, on the basis of evidence which is far flimsier than it might look. Because we are shaped by our ideas, this has major practical, political ramifications - it is not just good science that is at stake here. There is no doubt that some will resist Fine's approach for its politicisation of science, but I would be inclined to see it more as exploring the role of pre-existing, unexamined political bias, rather than introducing politics to the debate. Delusions of Gender is compelling, informative and perhaps most impressively, funny. I recommend this highly to anyone with any interest in neuroscience or gender.'This review first appeared at http://everything2.com/title/Delusion..."
131,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11030012-jade,4,"There have always been many (pseudo)scientific books on the shelves attempting to explain the differences between the sexes, of which the most common differences usually consist of men having a more result-orientated, mathematical approach, and women having a more relationship-orientated, emotional or empathic approach (never mind about non-binary people, queers, etc.). This is usually shown as something that’s unchangeable; something written down by genetics and made clear by the way our brains differ so much from each other. Also, some (if not most) of these books claim that that’s what also causes traditional gender roles – women are simply better suited for housework, and men better suited for business. Often, this is also where an evolutionary argument about caves, hunting, and gathering comes in.Unfortunately, the tendency to display such dated, sexist views isn’t only found in pseudoscientific writers (an example being the ever annoying book always present in every single bookstore I visit, Men Are from Mars Women Are from Venus by John Gray), but also in qualified scientists or psychologists: The Female Brain by Louann Brizendine, being a great example, or The Sexual Paradox: Extreme Men Gifted Women and the Real Gender Gap by Susan Pinker. Though I can’t deny the big influence popular ‘science’ books have on the general reading audience, as an aspiring psychologist myself, the fact that qualified psychologists spew this kind of garbage worries me intensely.Which is why I’m quite glad to have found this wonderfully well-researched book by Cordelia Fine, in which she attempts to refute many claims made by popular psychology books concerning traditional gender roles/behaviour, and differences between the sexes. Does she succeed? In my opinion, yes, and she does so with humour, solid arguments, and a critical approach. I really enjoyed the fact that she doesn’t only bring up arguments to counter interpretations and results of research used in the aforementioned popular psychology books, but she also attacks the way certain methods of research are used and interpreted (case in point: neuroimaging).A very complete, interesting, witty, and fun read. I commend Cordelia Fine for writing such a wonderfully clear answer to the dated views on the differences between the sexes, and emphasizing the importance of valid research (and the interpretation of it). I can definitely recommend this to anyone who’s interested in reading more about gender roles/behaviour."

It made me want to do a dance of joy. Also, when talking about neuroimaging experiments which supposedly prove these ""hardwired"" differences, Cordelia Fine wrote this paragraph:[...] When looking for changes in blood flow between two conditions, researchers search in thousands of tiny sections of the brain (called voxels), and many researchers are now arguing that the threshold commonly set for declaring that a difference is ""significant"" just isn't high enough. To illustrate this point, some researchers recently scanned an Atlantic salmon while showing it emotionally charged photographs. The salmon--which, by the way, ""was not alive at the time of scanning""--was ""asked to determine what emotion the individual in the photo must have been experiencing."" Using standard statistical procedures, they found significant brain activity in one small region of the dead fish's brain while it performed the empathizing task, compared with brain activity during ""rest."" The researchers conclude not that this particular region of the brain is involved in postmortem piscine empathizing, but that the kind of statistical thresholds commonly used in neuroimaging studies [...] are inadequate because they allow too many spurious results through the net.If that doesn't make you want to read at least a little more, I have no idea how to talk to you."

This author doesn't think so and after reading her book, I'm convinced.She says that gender distinctions continue to exist and that they start from our very beginnings - pink is for girls, blue is for boys. Gender comes to define us and these distinctions shape our abilities and interests. Certain skills are identified as male or female: Men are rational and brave; and Women are empathetic and nurturing. These assumed traits then impact our adult lives and the choices we make such as what fields to study in college, and what careers to pursue afterwards.Most alarming to the author is that the new fancy pants field of neuroscience observes physical differences in the brain between men and women and they are using those results to explain pre-conceived notions about the abilities of men vs. women instead of considering the impact of outside social forces. To create a causal relationship where none exists is to eliminate a possible true explanation before it is ever considered.A thought provoking book."

Fine looks at gender essentialism and at the biases of studies and media reporting, and suggests that we've been too quick to throw up our hands and say, ""but it's biological!"" If little girls have only been wearing pink for fifty years, then clearly that can't be a hard-wired preference.As a woman who preferred baby blue to pink for my childhood frilly dresses, liked to play with my brother's trucks and robots as well as my own stuffed animals (dolls are creepy and as for the toy . . . ironing board?!!! . . . I was given, the less said the better), and whose index finger is shorter than her ring finger, but who grew up to be much better at language than math (but my mom was great at math) and is more empathetic than competitive, I've always found these gender assumptions questionable, as I seem to be all over the board. Fine, writing for a popular audience, sometimes seems to skim the surface, but her work is clear, logical, and sometimes pleasantly snarky."

It always irks me if people want to use scientific publications to justify stuff like this. Not because I'd prefer them not to be true, but because I'm only too aware that making it through peer review isn't a good indicator about how well done the experiments were. Just ask Rosie Redfield and her successful push against the stupid arsenic life-stuff. Many different studies are discussed in some detail and lots of flaws in those studies are shown: lack of controls and/or statistical power, multiple testing, the general problems of fMRI, alternative explanations fitting the data as well or even better etc. Recommended for: everyone who likes to see overselling scientific claims destroyed, people who want to disarm the arguments of those who believe in inherent gender differences.

Fine expertly destroys so-called 'evidence' that gender is a product solely of differences in female and male brains, using neuroscience and clear experimental examples. As intelligent and involved as it is, nonetheless this book is accessible, easy to comprehend and - because of Fine's voice and narrative style - a swift and compelling read. I shall be recommending to everyone. "

141,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25360918-blair,2,"Are Men Systemisers and Women Empathisers?We all know that men are from Mars and women are from Venus, right? There is much in current popular literature suggesting gender differences are innate, therefore we should adapt to them. This book treats us to even more of this kind of thinking found in the older literature, which looks absurd to modern eyes. The author asks if the modern stuff is really much different. She has two main points: Neuroscience is not nearly advanced enough to reach any conclusions that link brain structure to behaviour. And it is difficult to distinguish between genetic and culturally acquired characteristics from observing society, because there are so many confounding factors and sources of bias. So what is all this recent writing really based on?Things Don’t Seem So Bad in My BubbleI appear to live in a bubble. The reports I read about sexual discrimination and harassment are shocking, and do not reflect my personal experience. I realize that my brain’s shrivelled left hemisphere renders me oblivious to any social interaction that is not blindingly obvious, but I am married to a successful female senior manager. We even talk sometimes (when she makes me). I don’t hear much about discrimination, while I do hear about a lot else. And there are plenty of women in senior positions where she works. But society is not uniform, and large parts of it are clearly very different from where I stand.Beyond Reason: Why I Would See it That WayWhy is gender stereotyping so persistent when many of us claim to have moved beyond that? She tells us,
“One can be reflective about explicitly held (rational) knowledge, and it may be reasonably consistent. However, associative knowledge seems to be fairly indiscriminate about what it takes on board. So you may not be consciously sexist, yet sexist patterns you have unconsciously picked up may assert themselves.”
Our unconscious attitudes are learned when we are young, and they are learned from the behaviour one sees, not the words our parents or schools use to tell us how they think we should be. Now in our daily lives our choices are made instinctively, and the rational mind finds a justification that is not sexist. Thus gender discrimination is perpetuated without us even knowing or wanting to do it.As a male systemiser, I have done the job expected of me. I will now get in touch with my feminine side and talk about personal experience. Yes, personal anecdotes do not add up to data, but apparently there is no worthwhile data anyway, so why not?The Geek SpeaksI spent my career writing software, so the following got my attention:
“What, for example, springs to mind when you think of a computer scientist? A man, of course, but not just any man. You’re probably thinking of the sort of man who would not be an asset at a tea party. The sort of man who leaves a trail of soft-drink cans, junk-food wrappers, and tech magazines behind him as he makes his way to the sofa to watch Star Trek for the hundredth time.”
I went to a university that did not yet have a computer science department. A few friends and myself invented our own. We failed the courses we were supposed to be taking because we spent all day playing on the computers we hacked into. Need I mention that none of us were women?The reason has nothing to do with junk-food wrappers, or that the female devotes too much of her brain to emotion processing to write code. It is more about obsession. We males may or may not be better systemisers, but we are more willing to blow an entire school year to spend all day systemising about one thing. What, women can’t afford to take risks like that? Don’t be silly, they can always get married and have babies if things don’t work out. Or they can switch into social sciences, and get an easy degree doing sloppy research that verifies pre-existing beliefs. Our author delights in presenting examples of that. Oh, that was typically insensitive of me. My oxytocin levels must be low again.The only hint of truth in her paragraph is the lack of social skills of many of us in the industry. Combine obsession with that lack of social skills, and one suspects the presence of a few autism-linked genes in the crowd. But I am sure Ms. Fine can cherry-pick a few flawed autism studies to demolish that notion.One can argue that these different attitudes are entirely socially constructed. But it is also possible that something real is being socially reinforced. There is some evidence, especially from identical twin studies, which link personal characteristics to genetics. It is hard to believe that there is no sex linkage involved. It is easy to mock jumping to evolutionary conclusions about math skills or preferring pink to blue. But the human species does have a long history with a gender devoted to hunting and warfare. Add in the fact that males are expendable, and a genetic inclination toward risk taking does seem somewhat credible. Obsession may have been selected for similar reasons. Those autism genes must be there for a reason. You know, men have to focus on their hunting, while the women multitask feeding the baby while inventing agriculture, food storage and other requirements for civilization.Oops, I have slipped back into systemising again. It must be the lack of connection between my hippocampus and cerebral cortex.Empathising Has Its RewardsThere were not many female programmers where I worked, and they did not last long. They get promoted into management. Oh, the discrimination! The gender distribution at my company was interesting. As one might expect, the programmers were generally male and the quality control people were female. Were women excluded from the more creative jobs because of their sex? Perhaps the difference is that while I would think about work when I got home, they were thinking about home while they were at work. A more demanding job gets in the way. And if that is because of social conditioning, it is hardly the fault of corporate management.The other female “ghetto” at our company was in program management. This critical senior position requires both strong technical knowledge and excellent social skills to deal with our external clients. It was mainly women who had the magic to pull it off. (I suppose that more developed inferior parietal lobe makes all the difference.) The consequences of gender stereotyping, legitimate or not, can cut both ways.I lost my job there because I did not step up into a more collaborative role. I was lucky to last as long as I did happily coding away. Industry is changing, communicating and collaborating across boundaries is becoming ever more important. My stereotypical mind sees these as female qualities, but does it matter? Any company that discriminates against women is suicidal, because it needs those skills. But then, a lot of companies are slowly committing suicide. I suspect there may be a connection here.Social Skills in the Strip ClubsApparently there is an increasing tendency to use strip clubs for conducting business. Ms. Fine documents this and concludes,
“In effect, just as their fathers might have taken clients to one of the gentlemen’s clubs of Pall Mall, so brokers today take their business associates to see lap dancers. The old gentlemen’s clubs banned women – some still do – whereas the lap-dancing establishments merely intimidate them.”
My emotional reaction (yes, I do have them) is anger and disgust. Gentlemen’s clubs, for all their faults, at least had some class. Strip clubs are for scum. Reducing men to scum to preserve their pathetic privileges is beneath contempt.I can’t help wondering if some of those men are not entirely comfortable with what is going on, but feel they have little choice. It looks like nothing has changed – the bullies are still in charge.Geeks like me tend to go to Star Trek conventions rather than strip clubs, if they go anywhere at all. (I go to a book club.) We also cannot help noticing that the more sexist the man, the more women are attracted to him. (They appeal to her associative memory rather than her reason, which should know better.) Bullies get what they want. Sexism is a social skill, and one that is well rewarded. But I suspect some of these organizations are going to bully themselves into bankruptcy because they can’t keep up with a changing world. It can’t come soon enough.But there is another explanation for this behaviour: the men have been desensitized to sexual stimulation by constant exposure to pornography. For some reason Fine chooses to completely ignore this issue. So tell me, which affects men’s attitudes toward women: a dubious book by Louann Brizendine or twenty hours a week of hard-core degrading pornography?Second ThoughtsThis conclusion is being written a several weeks after the rest of the review. What I wrote above is essentially an emotional response to the book. Now the emotion has worn off, I will treat this book as the scientific work it claims to be.The material about how women are limited by social conditioning and outright repression, while socially important, leads to only one scientific insight: we cannot judge the potential of women by their present level of achievement. That is all. But it does serve to soften up the reader for her message. It worked on me.The book may serve as a needed corrective for some of the simplistic stereotyping in the name of science out there. But is it also guilty of similar distortion in pursuit of an agenda that claims gender differences are a social construction? In other words, is this simply the other side in a culture war being fought using science as the battleground?That culture war has been raging for hundreds of years. Conservatives claim human nature is fixed, and we dare not change the ancient wisdom that keeps our impulses contained. Liberals contend that the mind is a blank slate, and humanity is perfectible with the right thinking and social intervention. I suspect those of you who like this book are really cheering that our side is beating up their side, like in a sporting event. And she is administering quite a beating. But this is an empirical question, not a matter of opinion. If you don’t understand the science, how can you possibly know if the scientific arguments here are valid?I don’t know much about neuroscience either, but I detect a number of serious warning signs pointing to a lack of objectivity. Despite the cheery tone, this book mainly consists of an unrelenting attack on any viewpoint that suggests gender differences are innate. It is hard to tell when she is criticizing scientific studies or amateur opinion, which has the effect of implying that the dumbest ideas are also the opinions of any scientists she is opposed to. This kind of polarization has no place in science. A look at the author’s publication list shows mainly commentaries rather than research, mainly aimed at a popular audience. This looks more like a campaigner rather than a scientist.Good science writing shows a passion for understanding the subject and a desire to explain it to the reader. There is none of that here. Instead, explanations are presented only as necessary for the reader to understand the words in her debunking effort. She overwhelms the reader with the sheer volume of scientific information. But volume does not add up to truth if that information is selective.I do not know to what degree gender differences are innate. Who knows, maybe our author has it mostly right. I simply cannot not trust this work to tell me that. Even when she tells me that neuroscience is not advanced enough to draw conclusions about gender, my response is that seems reasonable, but I will look elsewhere to find out. [A quick look suggests she is wrong.]This book is a great reminder that there is a lot of bad science writing out there. Unfortunately it is also a good example of that, yet another example of science corrupted by ideology."
142,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4973578-iset,5,"You've probably heard that men are just naturally better at spatial awareness and logical tasks whilst women are just naturally better at verbal and nurturing tasks. You've probably heard that men and women's brains are different. You may even have heard exasperated parents trying out gender neutral parenting exclaiming that their little girl/boy just seems to naturally gravitate towards pink dolls/blue trucks - it must be biological! Delusions of Gender debunks it all, delving into the real science behind these spurious claims.The book is divided into three sections. First, the sociological and psychological studies of gender differences. How are we to explain, for example, the fact that men seem to consistently do well in maths and women in verbal reasoning? It turns out - quite easily. The notion that men are better at certain things and women are better at other things is an entrenched stereotype. Consistently, in a scientific testing environment, when groups are primed before the test to buy into these stereotypes, they conform to cultural and societal demands of their gender - but when the groups are primed beforehand with a statement that no gender differences have ever been found, then both men and women defy the stereotypes and perform better even than the other gender at tasks that their own gender is supposedly bad at. This result bears out over countless tests, and reveals that when a categorised group is placed under 'stereotype threat', the distracting negative thinking that results significantly impacts on their performance in a given task - conversely, when the group is relaxed and not under threat, their true abilities are freed. There's more. When asked to self-report about how analytical/empathising they are, men and women will report that they fall into the stereotypes about their gender. However, when rigorous scientific is set up - for example, unwittingly recording two individuals in a room, after the fact asking one to note down their thoughts as they watch back the video, and then asking the other to guess what the first was thinking; both men and women show the same amount of ability to read people's faces and intuit their emotional state. In other words, self-reporting is unreliable as a true test of gender differences, and many tests claiming to prove a difference are unscientific, inadvertantly priming the subjects beforehand to perform according to existing social pressures.Okay, so social pressure is affecting people. But what about all that medical evidence that men and women's brains are different? It's actually very flimsy. Testosterone testing of babies in utero is not actually done by testing the baby's blood - but by testing the mother's blood, or the amniotic content. There are significant problems with several of the studies involving scanning the brains of adults - such as some studies only using female test subjects and not comparing against men in any way. Other studies are post-mortem. Several employ circular reasoning in their write ups to assert some sort of gender difference. ""But I've seen those different coloured scan images of male versus female brains on the internet!"" you may cry.
""It’s important to realise that the patches of colour you see on brain scans don’t actually show brain activity. Although it may seem as though fMRI and PET enable you to see a snapshot of the brain at work (or, as popular writers Allan and Barbara Pease claim, ‘to see your brain operating live on a television screen’), this simply isn’t the case. ‘Unfortunately, these pretty pictures hide the sausage factory’, as one neurologist put it. fMRI doesn’t measure neuronal activity directly. Instead, it uses a proxy: changes in blood oxygen levels. (PET uses a radioactive tracer isotope, which attaches itself to glucose or water molecules, to indirectly track blood flow.) Busier neurons need more oxygen and (after an initial dip) active brain regions have higher levels of oxygenated blood, because blood flow to that area increases. The oxygen is carried by the haemoglobin in red blood cells, and haemoglobin has slightly different magnetic qualities depending on how much oxygen it’s carrying. This creates a signal in the scanner (which pulses a magnetic field on and off). Neuroscientists then compare the difference in blood flow in brain regions during the task they’re interested in, with blood flow during a control task or rest state. (Ideally, the control task involves everything the experimental task entails – button pressing, word reading and so on – except for the psychological process you’re particularly interested in.) Researchers test for significant differences in blood flow in various locations of the brain regions during the two tasks, and if tests indicate that it is significant, a blob of colour is placed at the appropriate location on the picture of the brain. In other words, those coloured spots on the brain represent statistical significance at the end of several stages of complicated analysis – which means there’s plenty of scope for spurious findings of sex differences in neuroimaging research.""
Moreover, for every 1 neuroscience study claiming to find a difference between genders, there are 19 where both men and women were tested, no difference was discovered, and since the researcher's topic of interest was something other than gender differences the write up does not draw attention to the result - that no gender differences were found. The studies that do claim to find a difference also receive significantly more attention from people specifically looking for evidence to prove biological gender differences, and because the topic is so hot in our modern world.Alright, so neuroscience evidence is flimsy at best, and psychological testing of adults is unreliable unless performed with proper rigour. But what about children? Haven't there been tests of babies that show they prefer blue trucks/pink dolls? Unfortunately many of the tests claiming to prove such are also highly suspect. One study, for example, tested 3 month old male and female babies to see whether they preferred a Human face or a geometric mobile. Lo and behold, the male babies seemed to prefer the mobile, whilst female babies seemed to prefer the faces. Aha! But the face and the mobiles were presented to the babies separately, not simultaneously as is usual in such tests to truly determine if a baby prefers one thing over another - it's impossible therefore to say whether a preference was displayed. Furthermore, the researchers in the study knew what gender each baby they tested was, and there's reason to suspect they themselves may have been biasing the results by presenting a more friendly face to the female babies and moving the mobile around more with the male babies - creating the result they expected to see. Oh. Oh, indeed. More scientifically rigorous studies of babies' habits show that there is no difference in a six month old's preference between trucks and dolls - but this does kick in from around 9 months onwards. Is it nature asserting itself over nurture? Well, no. Another study tested whether babies truly do prefer a female face over a male one (i.e. testing whether we are biologically predisposed to think of women in a nurturing role). The babies seemed to prefer the female face - but all the babies in the first test group were being looked after primarily by their mothers. The test was repeated with babies who were being primarily raised by their fathers - those babies preferred male faces. Consistently, the results show environment over biology is the determining factor.The mother who had attempted gender neutral parenting only to wail; ""In the end I found her tucking the toy truck into bed and cuddling it! It must be biology!"" was asked by a shrewd researcher whether, in that household, one of the parents did most of the putting to bed - of course, it turned out the mother always put her daughter to bed. The fact of the matter is, even the most determined parents trying to employ gender neutral upbringing face an uphill struggle. Most actually bias the result, implicitly disapproving certain activities for their child despite outspokenly advocating them, and testing of children's reactions to words versus body language clearly demonstrates that they pick up on implict cues much more than verbal ones. Even with dedicated parents, the outside world is often intent on reinforcing gender roles, from multinational companies to the disapproving looks of less progressive parents. Gender is in fact the most strongly emphasised of any of the ways of categorising people, and children pick up on this from an exceptionally young age - it therefore becomes important for them to seek out clues about how to discover a person's gender and how to identify themselves, so they can fit in with a social group and be accepted - even when the parents at home are encouraging them to explore all kinds of play and activities.I'm going to conclude with the account of a couple who went the extra mile in their determination to raise their son and daughter in a truly gender neutral environment. Sandra and Daryl Bem, two psychologists;
""did all that they could to reduce the normally ubiquitous gender associations in their children’s environment: the information that lets children know what toys, behaviours, skills, personality traits, occupations, hobbies, responsibilities, clothing, hairstyles, accessories, colours, shapes, emotions and so on go with being male and female. This entailed, at its foundation, a meticulously managed commitment to equally shared parenting and household responsibilities. Trucks and dolls, needless to say, were offered with equal enthusiasm to both children; but also pink and blue clothing, and male and female playmates. Care was taken to make sure that the children saw men and women doing cross-gender jobs. By way of censorship, and the judicious use of editing, WhiteOut and marker pens, the Bems also ensured that the children’s bookshelves offered an egalitarian picture-book world... The second part of the Bems’ strategy was to, in place of the usual information about what it means to be male or female, promote the idea that the difference between males and females lies in their anatomy and reproductive functions. Your typical preschooler enjoys a detailed knowledge of gender roles, but remains a bit hazy regarding the hard, biological fact that males differ from females when it comes to the allocation of such items as penises, testicles and vaginas.'[O]ur son Jeremy, then age four, … decided to wear barrettes [hair slides] to nursery school. Several times that day, another little boy told Jeremy that he, Jeremy, must be a girl because ‘only girls wear barrettes.’ After trying to explain to this child that ‘wearing barrettes doesn’t matter’ and that ‘being a boy means having a penis and testicles,’ Jeremy finally pulled down his pants as a way of making his point more convincingly. The other child was not impressed. He simply said, ‘Everybody has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.’'Unlike their peers, Jeremy and Emily were discouraged from using socially determined trappings such as hairstyle, clothing, accessories or profession as a guide to a person’s biological sex. If the children asked whether someone was male or female, their parents ‘frequently denied certain knowledge of the person’s sex, emphasizing that without being able to see whether there was a penis or a vagina under the person’s clothes, [they] had no definitive information.’Step forward, please, all those parents who go to similar lengths to protect their children from acquiring prevailing cultural assumptions about gender. And do try to avoid being trampled in the rush. The Bems’ efforts, I think you’ll agree, seriously outclass what we normally, generously, think of as gender-neutral parenting... The intensity and scope of the Bems’ efforts offer a helpful hint as to just how gendered children’s environments are. To this day social structure, media and peers offer no shortage of information to children about masculinity and femininity.""

143,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"Delusions of Gender: The Real Science Behind Sex Differences by Cordelia Fine“Delusions of Gender” is an outstanding book that compels you to take a closer look at society and our science as it relates to gender issues. Academic psychologist and author, Dr. Cordelia Fine with a sharp sense of humor and an excellent grasp of what constitutes good science dismantles many claims of what can be considered neurosexism. This is a very provocative book as it tackles claims about male and female brains, and the gender cycle. This fascinating 371-page book is broken out into the following three parts: 1. Half-Changed World, Half-Changed Minds, 2. Neurosexism, and Recycling Gender.Positives:1. Engaging, witty, and provocative book. This is also a well-researched book that is not afraid to tackle head on popular misconceptions on gender.2. A fascinating and often misunderstood topic of sex differences.3. The science is accessible and the narrative flows nicely thanks to an infusion of humor. The book is also full of interesting anecdotes.4. Great use of counter-research to combat what Dr. Fine has concluded is poor science.5. One of the best features of this book is Dr. Fine’s relentless research against commonly held misconceptions by well-known scientists and authors. She makes a very compelling case against at best poor science or worst pseudoscience.6. Makes the very strong case on how society can impact associative memory. “Unlike explicitly held knowledge, where you can be reflective and picky about what you believe, associative memory seems to be fairly indiscriminate in what it takes on board. Most likely, it picks up and responds to cultural patterns in society, media and advertising, which may well be reinforcing implicit associations you don’t consciously endorse.” “When gender is salient in the environment, or we categories someone as male or female, gender stereotypes are automatically primed.”7. The impact of stereotypes. “Research suggests that the deadly combination of ‘knowing-and-being’ (women are bad at math and I am a woman) can lower performance expectations, as well as trigger performance anxiety and other negative emotions.”8. A look at mothers versus single women. “While parenthood served as no disadvantage at all to men, there was evidence of a substantial ‘motherhood penalty’. Mothers received only half as many callbacks as their identically qualified childless counterparts.”9. The reality of sexual harassment.10. Covers many issues regarding gender equality, including at home. “As Gloria Steinem recently reminded a journalist, “The idea of having it all never meant doing it all. Men are parents, too, and actually women will never be equal outside the home until men are equal inside the home.” Great quote.11. So are there biological roots to gender inequality? This is a recurring theme in the book.12. The reality is that there is a lot of poor science involving gender issues. “There’s something a little shocking about the discrepancy between the weakness of the scientific data on the one hand and the strength of the popular claims on the other.”13. A fascinating look at Neurosexism. “The sheer complexity of the brain makes interpreting and understanding the meaning of any sex differences we find in the brain a very difficult task.” “Neurosexism promotes damaging, limiting, potentially self-fulfilling stereotypes.”14. The file-drawer phenomenon. “This contributes to the so-called file-drawer phenomenon, whereby studies that do find sex differences get published, but those that don’t languish unpublished and unseen in a researcher’s file drawer.”15. Debunks myths with glee. “So let us, with healthy skepticism, summarize all of this as clearly as we can. Nonexistent sex differences in language lateralization, mediated by nonexistent sex differences in corpus callosum structure, are widely believed to explain nonexistent sex differences in language skills.” “The speculations of a few scientists quickly evolve into the colorful fabrications of popular neurosexism – the subspecialty within the larger discipline of neurononsense.”16. The four basic pieces of advice for anyone considering incorporating neuroscientific findings into a popular book or article about gender.17. One of the most astute observations of the books, too good not to share. “Genes don’t determine our brains (or our bodies), but they do constrain them. The developmental possibilities for an individual are neither infinitely malleable nor solely in the hands of the environment. But the insight that thinking, behavior and experiences change the brain, directly, or through changes in genetic activity, seems to strip the word ‘hardwiring’ of much useful meaning. As neurophysiologist Ruth Bleier put it over two decades ago, we should ‘view biology as potential, as capacity and not as static entity. Biology itself is socially influenced and defined; it changes and develops in interaction with and response to our minds and environment, as our behaviors do. Biology can be said to define possibilities but not determine them; it is never irrelevant but it is also not determinant.” Read that again, and again.18. A look at parenting. “It seems, then, that gender stereotypes, even if perhaps only implicitly held, affect parents’ behavior towards their babies.”19. Interesting facts that have an impact. “The Dr. Seuss books are rightly classics, adored by children and a joy of rediscovery for parents. Yet as Lamb and Brown observe, in all the forty-two books he wrote, not one has a female lead in its central story.”20. Copious amounts of notes and they are linked. A comprehensive bibliography.Negatives:1. Very little not to like about this excellent book but I would have probably started with defining the differences between key terms like sex and gender. The layperson tends to use these terms indiscriminately.2. The book does a phenomenal job of at the very least casting doubt or outright debunking commonly held misconceptions on gender issues; however, it doesn’t succeed nowhere near as well on defining the real science behind sex differences.3. Using scientific claims from centuries ago to debunk easily comes across as strawman arguments or low hanging fruits to grab on to.4. At times I feel she doesn’t necessarily apply the same amount of scrutiny to those studies that support her argument versus those that don’t. I prefer the instances where she simply states that we just don’t know.In summary, this was truly an eye opening and cognitive-dissonance inducing book. One of the great things I take from this book is to not fall prey to poor science and specifically, be alert of neurosexism. I’m not a neuroscience to know if all the conclusions that Dr. Fine makes are sound or not, but she is very persuasive and the book made me think. Witty, provocative and just fun to read, I highly recommend it!Further suggestions: “Science and Gender” by Ruth Bleier, “The Myths of Gender” and “Sexing the Body” by Gisela Kaplan, “Gene Worship” by Lesley Roger, “Sexual Science” by Cynthia Russett, and “The Social Psychology of Gender” by Laurie Rudman and Peter Glick. These books were recommended notably by the author."

It makes sense to me.There're a lot of dog-ears and underlines, but some of them are angry marks. I got very frustrated with about the middle two-fourths of it. The first fourth and the last fourth, I was much more interested in.The last fourth was what I thought the entire book was to be about---about how society and subtle clues train modern ""gender identity."" Because, dude, kids are sponges.The first one-fourth had some great lines and sentiments I agreed with, at their base. That is, perception is reality.The middle two-fourths? (Okay, I'd say, half, but it sounds wrong, since it's in the middle.) Yeah, that frustrated the ever-loving shit out of me. Because it seemed (to me, at least) she spent all that time leading up to making a point that I already knew. And I kept thinking, over an over, what she waited to say until the end of all that.And it just about killed me.Basically, I'm a fucking amateur, and I know that the way you live your life---your thought processes change the way your brain works. That is to say, nothing is hard-wired.Guess what; you spend your life obsessing over math, and the parts of your brain that deal with math are going to be larger than someone who's not obsessed with math, Einstein.So the fact that she laid it on thick, and laid on all this evidence, without just saying that until the end, just about killed me.Well, now, if she'd said it in the beginning of that section and went on, I would have had no problem. It just---it kept making me wonder if she was ever even going to point that out.And it drove me nuts.A mild frustration had nothing to do with her, but with a few of experiments they carried out. I mean, yeah, I was frustrated with the (sometimes) wild interpretations of some of them (as I was meant to be), but there were a few that hit me, personally. A few for which, all I could think, ""And then they had one more step to do."" Especially with the empathy tests. Oh, I could come up with such an awesome empathy test...There were even a couple of times that Fine really let me down. One, when she cited the behavior of rats to prove her point. And then, later, when rats didn't quite prove her point, she mentions how we really can't equate the behavior of rats to humans. It made me sad, because she had a point both times, but... Oof.Lots of good stuff, but a lot of frustration as well. And not nearly as much ""hard information"" as I was expecting. At least, not the kind I was expecting, because the kind of hard information I was looking forward to was only in the last quarter of the book. And there was not nearly as much of it as I had been hoping for. It barely went beyond what I already knew. It didn't challenge me the way I was hoping to be challenged.But enough of that. Let's end on my favorite line of the book. It has to do with the Bem children, who were raised as just about as ""gender nuetral"" as anyone could ever manage. The boy tells a classmante, "" 'being a boy means having a penis and testicles.' ""The boy who was critisizing him for wearing barrettes to nursery school comes back with, ""Everyone has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.""That right there made the whole book for me.Anyway, the point of the rating is not that I really liked it, but that I really like that it exists."
145,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,5,"I was really impressed with ‘Delusions of Gender’. It dissects and summarises research clearly, critiques stereotypes intelligently and analytically, and keeps the tone witty and readable yet more academic than journalistic. I found the synthesis of neuroscientific research on sex differences extremely helpful. Media articles that cheerfully claim sexist stereotypes are biological inevitabilities make me very angry. Fine channelled that same anger into writing an excellent rebuttal, which will be very useful to remember when the next wave of pseudo-scientific claims hit the papers.This book makes an excellent accompaniment to Living Dolls: The Return of Sexism, which focuses more on the societal implications of biological determinism-based sexism. It also brings up the important debate about applying scientific methodologies to research questions that are based on unquestioned stereotypes and assumptions. An example of this is the use of 'masculinity' as an objective index, like height and weight. As Fine states, including fMRI scans makes any research findings appear more weighty and scientific. Yet inferring major psychological differences between the sexes from disputed differences in brain structure is very problematic. The brain and the mind are not congruent. I’d also pick out for praise the latter chapters on young children learning about gender. That was not something I’d ever really thought about before, but of course kids observe how carefully adults sort people into the ‘man’ and ‘woman’ boxes. This part of the book includes amusing summaries of research investigating whether and/or why girls play more with ‘girl toys’ and boys with ‘boy toys’. I particularly liked the idea that some researchers made a My Little Pony into a desirable boy’s toy by painting it black, trimming its mane, and sharpening its teeth. Conversely, girls were ‘enchanted by… the lavender-satin-covered guns and holster, and the pink furred war helmet’. By the age of five, these children had picked up from their surrounding the sexual dimorphism of toys. As Fine points out, even clothes for newborns are gendered. She makes a strong argument for social over biological gender determinism.Apologies for eliding sex and gender in the paragraph above. Fine does not critique the gender binary or cover intersectionality issues in much depth, as these are not the focus of her book. Neither are they ever mentioned (that I’ve seen) by media articles that oversimplify and distort neuroscience to excuse sexism. Nonetheless, similar effects (regarding ‘stereotype threat’ for example) are noted to impact on women and ethnic minorities in the earlier chapters covering sociological research. There’s clearly a lot more work needed in the fields of sociology and neuroscience, but I agree with Fine that scientists have a responsibility to consider their unwitting assumptions about gender. As well as the ways in which their findings will be treated by a depressingly sexist media."
146,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie,4,"All those studies that say that women are bad at math and men are bad at relationships because their brains are hardwired that way can be very discouraging, and there are a LOT of those studies. But Cordelia Fine has looked into those studies and found flaws in them. Add into that a large number of studies that show how easy it is to jigger people’s minds into doing better or worse at tasks depending on how they are psychologically primed before hand and we can see where the author is coming from. Fine’s thesis is rather than there being any physical difference between male and female brains, the differences that we see in math scores are there because our culture expects them to be there. Even when people attempt to raise their children in a gender neutral environment, culture intervenes. On TV, in schools, in children’s books, in the clothing sold to children- everything is divided into genders, and females end up less adventuresome, more nurturing, expected to be nicer and not fight, and to focus on home and caring rather than invented and discovering. Toys for girls and boys are separated, and children who choose to play with toys for the opposite gender are disapproved of, especially boys who play with dolls or other ‘girl’ toys. Tomboys may be told to act more ladylike, but boys will get beat up by other boys. The core of her argument is that studies where test takers are primed to consider themselves members of sets other than gender yield different results than tests taken when the test takers are told things like “men traditionally do better on this test”. For instance, when a group of males and females take a test and are told before hand that people who go to certain colleges (colleges that some of the test takers go to) do better on this same test, the test takers conform to this and the males and females who belong to the colleges mentioned both do better on the test than the non-certain collegians- and the males and females in that group score the same as each other on the test under these conditions. These tests have been done numerous times by different researchers, and the results are always the same- the test takers conform to expectations set up before the test. Therefore, psychology trumps brain structure where intellectual subjects are concerned. It’s an interesting proposition, and one I think needs to be investigated more- much more. There’s a lot still to be untangled in gender studies. Intellectual abilities are jumbled in with emotional tendencies, and I definitely think they should be considered separately. She pretty much ignores the effect of hormones on emotional states except for the case of fetal testosterone. I think that while this book doesn’t settle any gender issue questions, it does cast a lot of doubt on previous studies and urges us to look at them much harder."
147,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237879-elaine-nelson,5,"I happened to run across this book at the library having forgotten that it was in my ""to-read"" list. I'm SO glad I did, and given a certain pair of somewhat ranty posts a couple of months back, only wish I'd read it sooner! I literally could not put it down - as in: ""no really, I need to go to bed/back to my desk from lunch/off the bus, I have to put the book away.""In short, social construction of gender: you're soaking in it. (And especially, your brain is soaking in it.)1) Priming & stereotype threat affect everything. Just checking gender on a form before taking a test changes womens' performance, especially on math tests. More priming (being told that the test relates to gender, watching a gender-stereotyped commercial, etc) increases the effect.2) Most of the ""science"" as it's filtered through to the popular media is a disaster of half-baked assumptions, small and/or poorly-constructed experiments, and willful misunderstanding of the actual results. (She tears apart one popular writer; it's kinda fun.)3) Worse, those lame results create a feedback loop, combined with the impossibility of gender-neutral child-rearing, that increases the problem of stereotype threat, and makes genuine social change more difficult.Le sigh. Not only is the feminist struggle not over, we may actually be hitting a really hard spot.On the plus side, I'm fired up now. Not just that, but I'm thinking more about my own personal construction of gender identity, including my history with math and science. There's a post I wrote about my life with math a while back, and there I wrote about it as a choice between writing and math - now I'm seriously looking back and wondering about the effect of gender stereotypes, and whether I might have come to computing sooner given different circumstances. I think it's worth noticing that choices exist in a constrained environment, constrained both by the external world, and by our own unexamined or incompletely-formed attitudes.As for the writing style, it's a delightful read. She's got a sharp conversational tone that pulled me in; I even read the footnotes.HIGHLY recommended, great in combination with Pink Brain Blue Brain."
148,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5324619-noor,5,"""Delusions of Gender"" has proved to be one of the most informative and interesting books I've read this year. The book consists of three parts that essentially discuss gender-stereotypes, Neurosexism, and the struggles of attempting to raise children in a gender-neutral environment.Cordelia starts by explaining how implicit and explicit beliefs are two separate things that don't always correlate. Despite ""consciously"" holding certain beliefs, there is a clash between the reflective self and our associative memory which is heavily influenced by the social environment surrounding us. When gender becomes salient and constantly primed in our daily life, it seeps into our perception of others and of ourselves, and we often do it in stereotypical ways. The book is filled with numerous experiments that support this idea. When we categorise people as male or female, we are instantly activating gender associations that affect our behaviour, values, performance etc. A perfect manifestation of this activated gender-inequality is how women are treated in a workplace dominated by men. Women experience segregation, exclusion, harassment and attack just by showing up to work basically.The second part of the book focuses on neurosexism and was the most difficult for me to digest; simply because I was unaware of just how much these popular neuroscientific claims are based on shaky empirical evidence. Gender stereotypes are legitimised by these pseudo-scientific explanations, and often become part of popular media. Neurosexism activates gender stereotypes which feeds into the public sphere + affects attitudes, identity & performance. It all leads us to become our own self-fulfilling prophecies.And the last bit of the book should be read by all parents who try to raise their children in a gender-neutral environment. It goes way beyond giving boys barbie dolls and giving girls fire trucks.All in all, this was an eye-opener for me when it comes to neuroscience and how it's used to reinforce old-fashioned stereotypes/roles through covering them with the finery of science.PS: Cordelia is quite witty. Found myself laughing out loud at times."
149,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4508080-julie-bozza,5,"A bit of a hard slog to read, especially as the few moments of humour didn't really suit me (too sarcastic). However, the important thing is that Fine makes vital headway towards an understanding of gender that I can really get behind. Gender difference is not 'hardwired' into us, and Fine deftly demolishes the pseudo-science that tells us otherwise. Fine quotes Kimmel in asserting 'gender difference is the product of gender inequality'; that is, we create and recreate gender difference while interacting with our society. The process begins at such an early age that many new parents, no matter how gender-neutral they try to be, end up assuming that gender difference is biologically or neurologically innate in their children. Fine does a good job of explaining why this happens, and how it will ultimately be worth it if we keep plugging away the gender-neutral objective. Fine also articulates how permeable the boundaries can be between our own sense of self and society's sense of who we are - or should be. I've struggled to articulate my struggles with this, but I've often felt like an asymmetrical heptagonal peg who is nevertheless forced (by otherwise well-meaning folk) to fit into the round hole that society makes available to me. Gender is certainly one aspect of this. My social sciences tutor told me I was making too much of the external forces - but now I've found Fine to back me up and explore the implications, and I feel inordinately grateful. Lastly, Fine ends with a note of hope. While she has shown how deeply woven gender difference (and hence gender inequality) is in our society, she has also shown that it is malleable. We can change this, though it will take time and effort. Let's keep trying! I would love to see what we can become when we are so much freer to be ourselves, whoever we may be."
150,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Subtitle: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference. Cordelia Fine, while an apparently well-read and quite competent scientist, makes no pretense of objectivity in this book. She's got an axe to grind with a whole school of research that aims to use modern brain science to convince us that male and female brains are intrinsically, fundamentally, and irrevocably different. Oh, and I also think the picture of her on the dust jacket is pretty hot. I just love imagining her getting all worked up about this. Wait, did I say that out loud?Anyway, Fine's point is best illustrated by an anecdote from the experience of a four year old named Jeremy, who had been raised by parents who were extraordinarily zealous gender-neutral parents. He decided one day to wear barrettes to nursery school, and gets into an argument with another boy, who says that he is a girl. Finally, Jeremy pulls down his pants and points out that he has a penis, as a way of making his point. The other boy says, “Everybody has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.”Whether you think the parents who let their boy wear barrettes to school were weird here, or the society that teaches a boy that the difference between male and female has more to do with hairstyle than genitals, depends on your opinions about gender (and society) generally. So does a lot of other (less amusing but more substantial) evidence, published in scientific journals or mainstream media, that Fine takes us on a tour of.Some of it is related to the general fallacy of all brain-scan evidence. Just because we see a difference in brain activity (using MRI or some other method), doesn't mean it's genetic or otherwise hardwired. All it shows is that it happens in the brain, and really, if we're talking about thoughts, attitudes, emotions, and so forth, where else would we expect it to happen? Also, like muscles, areas of the brain can grow larger or smaller over time as they are used more or less (whether for cultural reasons or any other), so again evidence from brain scans, while perhaps useful for other purposes, tells us nothing about whether differences in behavior are primarily biological or cultural. Seeing a brain scan, however, tells us that it has something to do with biology, and our instinctive reaction is still to divide things into biological and cultural, and if it's one it must not be the other.There is a long and well-documented history of scientific attempts to explain to us why women and men are Just Different, in ways that have nothing (directly) to do with procreation. The suspicious thing is that, while the rationales differ from decade to decade and from one century to the next, the conclusions always point in the same direction. Fine takes us on a thoroughly readable tour of this history, spiced up a bit by her, at times, barely contained rage.Make no mistake, this is not an even-handed weighing of the evidence; it is rather a very well-documented and data-driven polemic. If it were written by a man, I'd say that the confrontational and science-oriented analysis is very typical of a masculine style. Instead, I'll say it's an emotional treatment, showing a feminine inability to maintain objectivity on scientific topics. Either way, it's a hoot to read."
151,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6537005-daniel,3,"""Delusions of Gender"" is an engaging read, well-written and incisive. Cordelia Fine makes a convincing argument that gender differences in performance assessed through various metrics are to a large extent the result of social cues, reactions to internalized stereotypes, and unconscious priming. Her critique of studies of gender differences in psychological experiments is comprehensive, and her depiction of the current state of sexism is both convincing and often horrifying.Unfortunately, her fixation on discrediting both contemporary pop-psychology books selling innate gender differences and the arguments of dusty sexists from centuries past comes off a bit like clubbing baby seals (or possibly arm-wrestling five-year-olds). Her arguments against current neuroscientific techniques--especially neuroimaging using techniques like fMRI--fall particularly flat, as she relies repeatedly upon equating sophisticated real-time 3d measurements of blood-flow in the brain with crude volumetric measurements of skull capacity used by those sexist scientists of yore. This is trite and annoying.Likewise, she fails to engage biological and evolutionary arguments in any meaningful sense, instead relying on the tired allegation that evolutionary psychology and biology are only sexist justifications for relegating women to lives of domestic drudgery. She perhaps hopes that her readers are not savvy enough to Wikipedia the fields. Her argument that structural differences between the brains of men and women (after criticizing imaging and anatomical studies, she grudgingly admits that these do exist) compensate for differences in physiology to produce similar behaviors in males and females is interesting and may even be true to some extent--humans male and female, after all, must accomplish many of the same tasks to survive--but is unsupported and feels like hand-waving. She does not engage with the concepts of hormonal modulation of brain activity or neurotransmitter/receptor distribution and prevalence to any great degree. She brushes off the striking possibility that biological differences may predispose men and women toward different goals irrespective of nebulous measures of aptitude or spurious notions of ""natural gender roles."" The human brain she seems to prefer is the black box too intricate to be understood on a mechanistic level, a network of abstract associations accessible only to psychologists distributing questionnaires and bubble sheets to college students participating in studies for course credit.So, while entertaining (and perhaps convincing to audiences disinclined to read it critically or who already embrace its ideological underpinnings), the book's thesis does not strike home, and Fine's claim that it is dangerous for researchers to ask these questions at all should be disturbing to any reader who values science over ideology."

153,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley,3,"I tried to read this book near the beginning of quarantine, in hard copy, and my poor overloaded brain just couldn't handle it. If I had read this in audio, a format my brain can handle for serious subjects, I probably would have rated it much higher, and gotten through it much faster (and I'll be honest, retained more than 10% of it). So take this review with a grain of salt. (P.S. I just googled that phrase, and it evolved from something Pliny the Elder wrote in 77 A.D. Language is so weird.) I will be trying it again maybe in a couple of years by audio. Unless someone can point me in the direction of a book on the same subject that is more recent that I should read first (this was published in 2010).Aside from that issue, this book is also less of a thing on its own than it is the author debunking other scientific studies or books, things that people take as a given, or as ""proven"" by science. Cognitive bias plays a huge role not only in the behavior of test subjects, but in the minds of the scientists performing the studies. Which is enjoyable in its own way, but not quite what I was expecting. The book is very heavy on cautioning the reader about these types of studies, since gender is so hard to study, and really just instills a healthy amount of scientific skepticism. I remember it being a lot of, this isn't proven, we actually don't ""know"" as much as we think we do.I can't emphasize how much my brain did not retain any of the information I read, so this is really just a useless review. Judging by my friends' reviews on Goodreads, I just really need to give it a break, and then pick this up again some time down the road when my brain is being more amenable."

Honestly though, some male scientists... if you have to create and pursue patently absurd theories about differences in the brain to justify why you can't patiently listen to your wife or make your kids a sandwich, that's pretty undeniably pathetic.

I gobbled this non-fiction up like it was a light lunch after a hard day's manual labor. Every page was packed with jaw-dropping information - horrifying methodological flaws, research which argues two diametrically opposed concepts, and outright deception, all designed to prove that men and women are not and cannot possibly be equal. Like, here's one example: Fine mentions the author of a popular book on the subject, who cites research about ""mirror neurons,"" (women have more of them, which supposedly makes them more empathetic.) The author mentions a study of therapists which indicated that the most successful therapists are those that ""mirror"" their clients words, gestures, and verbal patterns. Interestingly, (says the author), ALL of the successful therapists were women. Because they have more mirror neurons, and are more attuned to others, right?WRONG. Cordelia Fine looked up the study (thank you, Cordelia! That would be a big nuisance for the Average Reader) and as it turns out? ALL OF THE THERAPISTS IN THE STUDY WERE WOMEN. Yeah, that's right. They only recruited women for the study, so the study proves absolutely nothing about men vs. women. And if you think this sort of thing is an anomaly, wrong again - Fine's detailed work found this sort of thing occurring over and over again. Moreover, Fine is terrific at highlighting how the social context of everything men and women do contributes to these gender stereotypes, and at explaining how gender bias affects the neuroscientific research. This is an absolutely fantastic book - I have the urge to acquire copies for every teacher, every employer, every parent on the planet. It made me rethink more of my life that I would have believed possible. Seriously, even if you think you would disagree with it: READ IT. If nothing else, you will enjoy Fine's smooth and witty prose."

If you’re the type of person who enjoys nitpicking underpowered studies over methodological errors that affect validity and throwing shade at poor referencing while also being a flagrant feminist this is for you. I am not sure how this would go down for other people without a background in neuroscience because those parts were undoubtedly my favorite although I see how that part of the book could be too technical and heavy. I didn’t learn anything new science-wise but I did discover that there still are some fucking assholes willing to forgo the science completely just in order to tell you that your female brain HAS TO KNOW HOW TO EMPATHIZE AND BE NURTURING and that of course those morons have a wide audience just dying for any shard of pseudo-evidence that may point to the fact that their daughters are meant to be breeding subservient cows and that their sons will bring about the rapture. Of course this book proves yet again the only truth known to humans besides inevitable death and that is that men are trash. Besides that, I wholeheartedly enjoyed the psychology aspects of the book and if I had any doubt about the ubiquity of gender then it was all erased in the last part where she lists study after study proving how the idea of gender and how everything is gendered almost from birth and how early toddlers take on these ideas and digest them almost regardless of how unisex parents attempt to make their environments at home; the world at large is sexist. Go figure. And then there’s the ever expanding body of evidence that simply makes it clear that women have always always always been just as capable as men and that as the gender gap closes (despite the screeching and howling of men) women find their ways into board room and ORs and mines and factories and fucking haters continue to come up with more sophisticated schemes of bullshit to make it seem like we can’t but we’re doing it anyway.

159,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14821636-andrew-fish,1,"The differences between men and women have probably been a topic of debate since the dawn of time. In recent decades, however, as society has progressed from subsistence and survival to consumerism and choice the issue has gained a degree of salience. The question of whether women are actively held down in their careers or whether they passively make decisions which close off paths to advancement becomes more than a curiosity when careers become both a means to achieve a better life and a source of fulfilment in themselves. And earlier in life, the science of gender difference could make a significant difference to educational outcomes if it could be robustly investigated. The time, it seems, is right for a good scientific look at the subject.Unfortunately, this isn't it.Fine is a psychologist by training, and whilst there's definitely scope to study the issue of gender difference through psychology, she seems reluctant to do this in any depth. The opening section of the book which nominally covers this ground is quite thin on actual studies and seems instead to rely heavily on anecdote, giving the book the feel more of a polemic rather than an academic assessment. What science there is, meanwhile, is treated in an uneven manner, promoting the studies which suit the central thesis and denigrating any which don't. Frequently, Fine goes beyond the studies and draws conclusions which aren't supported by any of the evidence she has presented.So, for example, when looking at a study about the effect of priming on women's mathematical abilities, she not only accepts the results without question, she positively crows about the fact that the women did better than the men without the priming. For this to be a valid observation, both male and female participants would have to have an even spread of intellect, presumably using some kind of test as part of the selection process. The trouble with this is that you are then pre-determining the results: if the selection test were gender-neutral, the gender-neutral part of the study would be consistent with the selection process and you would end up with roughly equal results for men and women. If the theory were correct, there would then be lower results for the women in the gender-biased part. If the selection process were not gender-neutral, meanwhile, then if the theory held the women would seem equal to the men in the selection process and better in the gender-neutral study itself.From those results you could prove that priming made a difference to the test results, but not that there was any inherent difference between male and female aptitude in itself. To go further would be circular reasoning (something Fine criticises about another study later in the book).It's like the constant claim that girls are better at school - fifty years ago, the reverse was claimed. What changed in between? The education system. Clearly there is some kind of difference between the sexes there (something Fine seems pathologically averse to) but if one system of education produced stronger male results and the other stronger female all you can say is that different methods favour the sexes differently - you can't claim this makes one superior to the other.In other places, such as the behaviour of women in male-dominated careers, it seems there are no studies Fine can draw on. By definition, you'd find it hard to create a female-dominated version of the same career for comparison, but it doesn't stop the author from coming to conclusions about the effect of those environments without anything beyond anecdote and hypothesis.The most detailed analysis in favour of her argument comes toward the end of the book, when looking at the gender stereotypes to which children are exposed in their early years and how this affects their choice of toys and sense of dress. Unfortunately, here she has narrowed the argument too much: it may be demonstrable that social forces drive boys to wear blue and girls pink, but this would hardly explain the more abstract alleged differences between the sexes. When was the last time your child came home claiming they'd been excluded from the spatial reasoning group on the basis of gender?With the results which don't suit her, the author is more exacting. When looking at a study about infant response to faces and mobile phones, for example, she casts aspersions on the methodology, hypothesises about all kinds of ways the results could have been skewed (always assuming such skews would be systematically biased in the same direction) and even implies that the experimenters could have been acting out of an unconscious gender bias themselves. Apart from the unprofessionalism of casting aspersions without evidence, it seems weak to subject a study you don't like to this level of criticism when it could have been equally true of any of the studies supporting the case. Stepping outside her field, Fine is dismissive of biological studies and applies an extremely shaky attack on neurology - regarding it as an inadequately direct proxy measure of brain activity that is subject to confirmation bias. If that's true of neurology, what it does it say about psychology as a reliable indicator? This attack allows her to dismiss any conclusions from the field she doesn't like, but again she's all too quick to accept any that she does. She constantly falls for the same fallacy, that if you can debunk a very specific prediction made by someone in a particular field, you can dismiss any evidence from that field when it doesn't suit your agenda. The constant comparisons to long-dismissed theories such as brain-pan measurement are a reductio ad absurdum argument with little logical validity and the quotes which open most chapters - generally over a century old and clearly not acceptable to modern readers - come across as an attempt to prime the reader into a form of indignation which switches off their reasoning faculties for the rest of the chapter and allows them to accept Fine's arguments without criticism. I even spotted a very old psychologists' trick - starting a sentence with ""by now you will all be thinking"" - which is a blatant attempt at manipulation of the reader.Here and there we find snippets of actual information - a chance remark about spatial reasoning differing in babies of only a few months old, for example - but unless they fit the central argument, they are passed over quickly. An anecdote about a woman having been masturbated over, by contrast, is alluded to several times across a chapter. And there's little gender-balance in the topics themselves either: apart from a brief mention of female intuition right at the beginning, the book focuses almost entirely on areas where women are alleged to be deficient. The impression given is that this is a book written by someone working out their own issues rather than dispassionately looking at the field.And this is often a problem with psychologists. Freud's obsession with mother fantasies reeked of projection, Kahneman's instinct over reason view of the brain suggests a man struggling to justify his own bad decisions. To see what Fine's problems are you need only look at the language she uses, the metaphors she chooses and the examples she latches onto. The book is riddled with misandistric metaphor and there are a number of coded attacks on her husband. Take the chapter where she envisages a hypothetical job-swap with her spouse. When looking at his ability to do her job, she attacks his literacy - comparing it to a ten year-old. She then looks at her ability to do his job, but rather than admit any limitation on her own part, she sidesteps the issue and instead turns it into another backhanded attack on her husband - in this case the likelihood of his nagging her from beyond the grave. It doesn't take a degree in psychology to spot the signs of an inferiority complex.I don't pretend to know what the biological basis for behaviour is, and I accept that there are a lot of bad studies out there and bad books using the results. But for a book whose byline is ""the real science behind gender difference"" I was expecting more than just a series of attacks. And it's a shame, because the issue is both interesting and important. In my opinion, there clearly are elements of behaviour that are inherited (how else would cuckoos transmit their parasitical tendencies?) but what that inheritance mechanism is and how far it reaches into human behaviour has, as far as I can see, yet to be established. To claim it has no effect on humans would be to think as those who attacked Darwin because whilst they could accept evolution, they felt that to claim humans were a product of evolution was a step too far. One science Fine didn't look at all is anthropology, which for anyone who is genuinely looking for the true reasons for gender difference would seem the obvious place to start. I suggest for those who are after a book which informs them rather than just gives them a reason to be angry at the state of the world, that would be a better field to explore."
160,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17161968-fergus-murray,5,"Delusions of Gender, by Cordelia Fine, is an extended critique of efforts to scientifically study differences between the sexes, and the efforts of many writers to apply alleged science in their writings about such differences. The book is rich in technical detail, which might bog down some readers, but most of those details are fascinating. Fine is a lucid and entertaining writer, especially in her more acerbic moments - of which there are plenty here. She finds a lot of shoddy science and shameless misuse of would-be science that would raise the hackles of any neuroscientist or feminist, let alone someone like her who happens to be both.This is a book with an agenda, and political agendas tend not to sit comfortably with science - but to pretend that politics never seeps into science while nobody is looking would be disingenuous. In fact, Fine's agenda - to bring out the reasons to doubt science that supposedly demonstrates innate differences between sexes - is at least as much scientific as political, and I think it is legitimate. It is something to bear in mind while reading this book, though, and there are times she goes out of her way to present things in such a way as to minimise the possibility of interpretation in terms of innate differences. As far as I can see she always stops short of misrepresenting the science, though, and the whole approach needs to be seen in the context of discourse which routinely takes essential differences for granted, whether the evidence supports them or not.The book is divided into three parts. The first is 'Half-changed World', Half-Changed Minds, which largely focuses on the interplay of cultural expectations and attempts to measure sex differences scientifically. This largely consists of accounts of experiments demonstrating the effects of cultural norms on things that people might be interested in measuring, and experiments which fail to take these factors into account. For example, she looks at experiments investigating the effect of telling the subjects what 'the latest science' has to say about the sorts of tests they are about to perform, to show that girls do significantly better on mathematical tasks if they think that science says they should. Even more subtly, females rate their mathematical ability as worse after they have just been reminded of their sex by having to tick a box at the beginning to say they are females. This gives us an interesting lens for looking at gender differences in maths tests which disregard the weight of cultural expectations, and indeed at systematic tendencies for females to choose less mathematical study and career paths. Having established many profound and subtle ways that social expectations and structures shape behaviours and perfomance, the theme of the second part of the book is Neurosexism - premature efforts to explain differences in behaviour and performance with reference to the brain, rather than society. Fine's most basic point is that it is rather soon to be looking for explanations of most of these things in neuroscience, when societal explanations have not been ruled out, and the relationship between the mind and the brain is still so unclear. More than that, she shows time and again that many authors are disturbingly willing to go way beyond what neurology can tell us, while pretending that they are not. Perhaps the single worst offender here is Louann Brizendine, author of The Female Brain, a serial abuser and inventor of neuroscience to back up her ideas about the differences between males and females - but she is one of many. Fine makes the point that people have been finding 'explanations' for sex differences in the brain for well over a century, from the observation that female brains tend to be a bit lighter than male ones through to modern notions of hardwiring. At the same time, people have routinely assumed that all kinds of observed differences between the sexes are natural and inevitable, when later experience has regularly shown them to be no such thing.The final section is titled Re-Cycling Gender, and it concerns itself with the future of gender relations and the science of sex. Fine is worried about the cyclical nature of some kinds of self-fulfilling prophecy - about dodgy science being used to teach yet another generation of young men and women that there are certain natural roles that they ought to be filling, certain characteristics they should expect to have. She emphasises again how difficult it is to pick apart innate and culturally conditioned differences, and the importance of keeping an open mind about questions that science has not yet been able to settle. With a better scientific understanding of the role of society in forming the mind and the brain, and a sceptical eye on the interesting but inconclusive findings of neuroscience, we may approach true sexual equality yet. Without such circumspection, as Fine argues, we may find ourselves sliding back to ideas about the sexes which are both unhelpful and ill-founded.This is an important book, because the trend towards explaining sex differences with impressive-sounding neurological findings has great potential to set back ideas about gender roles, on the basis of evidence which is far flimsier than it might look. Because we are shaped by our ideas, this has major practical, political ramifications - it is not just good science that is at stake here. There is no doubt that some will resist Fine's approach for its politicisation of science, but I would be inclined to see it more as exploring the role of pre-existing, unexamined political bias, rather than introducing politics to the debate. Delusions of Gender is compelling, informative and perhaps most impressively, funny. I recommend this highly to anyone with any interest in neuroscience or gender.'This review first appeared at http://everything2.com/title/Delusion..."
161,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11030012-jade,4,"There have always been many (pseudo)scientific books on the shelves attempting to explain the differences between the sexes, of which the most common differences usually consist of men having a more result-orientated, mathematical approach, and women having a more relationship-orientated, emotional or empathic approach (never mind about non-binary people, queers, etc.). This is usually shown as something that’s unchangeable; something written down by genetics and made clear by the way our brains differ so much from each other. Also, some (if not most) of these books claim that that’s what also causes traditional gender roles – women are simply better suited for housework, and men better suited for business. Often, this is also where an evolutionary argument about caves, hunting, and gathering comes in.Unfortunately, the tendency to display such dated, sexist views isn’t only found in pseudoscientific writers (an example being the ever annoying book always present in every single bookstore I visit, Men Are from Mars Women Are from Venus by John Gray), but also in qualified scientists or psychologists: The Female Brain by Louann Brizendine, being a great example, or The Sexual Paradox: Extreme Men Gifted Women and the Real Gender Gap by Susan Pinker. Though I can’t deny the big influence popular ‘science’ books have on the general reading audience, as an aspiring psychologist myself, the fact that qualified psychologists spew this kind of garbage worries me intensely.Which is why I’m quite glad to have found this wonderfully well-researched book by Cordelia Fine, in which she attempts to refute many claims made by popular psychology books concerning traditional gender roles/behaviour, and differences between the sexes. Does she succeed? In my opinion, yes, and she does so with humour, solid arguments, and a critical approach. I really enjoyed the fact that she doesn’t only bring up arguments to counter interpretations and results of research used in the aforementioned popular psychology books, but she also attacks the way certain methods of research are used and interpreted (case in point: neuroimaging).A very complete, interesting, witty, and fun read. I commend Cordelia Fine for writing such a wonderfully clear answer to the dated views on the differences between the sexes, and emphasizing the importance of valid research (and the interpretation of it). I can definitely recommend this to anyone who’s interested in reading more about gender roles/behaviour."
162,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7300053-nicole-ysabet,5,"This book was a cogent, readable rebuttal to all the pop-psychology, pseudoscientific nonsense published about how alleged differences between men and women make men thuggish morons who can't wash a dish and women lightheaded bimbos incapable of understanding math. It made me want to do a dance of joy. Also, when talking about neuroimaging experiments which supposedly prove these ""hardwired"" differences, Cordelia Fine wrote this paragraph:[...] When looking for changes in blood flow between two conditions, researchers search in thousands of tiny sections of the brain (called voxels), and many researchers are now arguing that the threshold commonly set for declaring that a difference is ""significant"" just isn't high enough. To illustrate this point, some researchers recently scanned an Atlantic salmon while showing it emotionally charged photographs. The salmon--which, by the way, ""was not alive at the time of scanning""--was ""asked to determine what emotion the individual in the photo must have been experiencing."" Using standard statistical procedures, they found significant brain activity in one small region of the dead fish's brain while it performed the empathizing task, compared with brain activity during ""rest."" The researchers conclude not that this particular region of the brain is involved in postmortem piscine empathizing, but that the kind of statistical thresholds commonly used in neuroimaging studies [...] are inadequate because they allow too many spurious results through the net.If that doesn't make you want to read at least a little more, I have no idea how to talk to you."

This author doesn't think so and after reading her book, I'm convinced.She says that gender distinctions continue to exist and that they start from our very beginnings - pink is for girls, blue is for boys. Gender comes to define us and these distinctions shape our abilities and interests. Certain skills are identified as male or female: Men are rational and brave; and Women are empathetic and nurturing. These assumed traits then impact our adult lives and the choices we make such as what fields to study in college, and what careers to pursue afterwards.Most alarming to the author is that the new fancy pants field of neuroscience observes physical differences in the brain between men and women and they are using those results to explain pre-conceived notions about the abilities of men vs. women instead of considering the impact of outside social forces. To create a causal relationship where none exists is to eliminate a possible true explanation before it is ever considered.A thought provoking book."

Fine looks at gender essentialism and at the biases of studies and media reporting, and suggests that we've been too quick to throw up our hands and say, ""but it's biological!"" If little girls have only been wearing pink for fifty years, then clearly that can't be a hard-wired preference.As a woman who preferred baby blue to pink for my childhood frilly dresses, liked to play with my brother's trucks and robots as well as my own stuffed animals (dolls are creepy and as for the toy . . . ironing board?!!! . . . I was given, the less said the better), and whose index finger is shorter than her ring finger, but who grew up to be much better at language than math (but my mom was great at math) and is more empathetic than competitive, I've always found these gender assumptions questionable, as I seem to be all over the board. Fine, writing for a popular audience, sometimes seems to skim the surface, but her work is clear, logical, and sometimes pleasantly snarky."

It always irks me if people want to use scientific publications to justify stuff like this. Not because I'd prefer them not to be true, but because I'm only too aware that making it through peer review isn't a good indicator about how well done the experiments were. Just ask Rosie Redfield and her successful push against the stupid arsenic life-stuff. Many different studies are discussed in some detail and lots of flaws in those studies are shown: lack of controls and/or statistical power, multiple testing, the general problems of fMRI, alternative explanations fitting the data as well or even better etc. Recommended for: everyone who likes to see overselling scientific claims destroyed, people who want to disarm the arguments of those who believe in inherent gender differences.

171,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25360918-blair,2,"Are Men Systemisers and Women Empathisers?We all know that men are from Mars and women are from Venus, right? There is much in current popular literature suggesting gender differences are innate, therefore we should adapt to them. This book treats us to even more of this kind of thinking found in the older literature, which looks absurd to modern eyes. The author asks if the modern stuff is really much different. She has two main points: Neuroscience is not nearly advanced enough to reach any conclusions that link brain structure to behaviour. And it is difficult to distinguish between genetic and culturally acquired characteristics from observing society, because there are so many confounding factors and sources of bias. So what is all this recent writing really based on?Things Don’t Seem So Bad in My BubbleI appear to live in a bubble. The reports I read about sexual discrimination and harassment are shocking, and do not reflect my personal experience. I realize that my brain’s shrivelled left hemisphere renders me oblivious to any social interaction that is not blindingly obvious, but I am married to a successful female senior manager. We even talk sometimes (when she makes me). I don’t hear much about discrimination, while I do hear about a lot else. And there are plenty of women in senior positions where she works. But society is not uniform, and large parts of it are clearly very different from where I stand.Beyond Reason: Why I Would See it That WayWhy is gender stereotyping so persistent when many of us claim to have moved beyond that? She tells us,
“One can be reflective about explicitly held (rational) knowledge, and it may be reasonably consistent. However, associative knowledge seems to be fairly indiscriminate about what it takes on board. So you may not be consciously sexist, yet sexist patterns you have unconsciously picked up may assert themselves.”
Our unconscious attitudes are learned when we are young, and they are learned from the behaviour one sees, not the words our parents or schools use to tell us how they think we should be. Now in our daily lives our choices are made instinctively, and the rational mind finds a justification that is not sexist. Thus gender discrimination is perpetuated without us even knowing or wanting to do it.As a male systemiser, I have done the job expected of me. I will now get in touch with my feminine side and talk about personal experience. Yes, personal anecdotes do not add up to data, but apparently there is no worthwhile data anyway, so why not?The Geek SpeaksI spent my career writing software, so the following got my attention:
“What, for example, springs to mind when you think of a computer scientist? A man, of course, but not just any man. You’re probably thinking of the sort of man who would not be an asset at a tea party. The sort of man who leaves a trail of soft-drink cans, junk-food wrappers, and tech magazines behind him as he makes his way to the sofa to watch Star Trek for the hundredth time.”
I went to a university that did not yet have a computer science department. A few friends and myself invented our own. We failed the courses we were supposed to be taking because we spent all day playing on the computers we hacked into. Need I mention that none of us were women?The reason has nothing to do with junk-food wrappers, or that the female devotes too much of her brain to emotion processing to write code. It is more about obsession. We males may or may not be better systemisers, but we are more willing to blow an entire school year to spend all day systemising about one thing. What, women can’t afford to take risks like that? Don’t be silly, they can always get married and have babies if things don’t work out. Or they can switch into social sciences, and get an easy degree doing sloppy research that verifies pre-existing beliefs. Our author delights in presenting examples of that. Oh, that was typically insensitive of me. My oxytocin levels must be low again.The only hint of truth in her paragraph is the lack of social skills of many of us in the industry. Combine obsession with that lack of social skills, and one suspects the presence of a few autism-linked genes in the crowd. But I am sure Ms. Fine can cherry-pick a few flawed autism studies to demolish that notion.One can argue that these different attitudes are entirely socially constructed. But it is also possible that something real is being socially reinforced. There is some evidence, especially from identical twin studies, which link personal characteristics to genetics. It is hard to believe that there is no sex linkage involved. It is easy to mock jumping to evolutionary conclusions about math skills or preferring pink to blue. But the human species does have a long history with a gender devoted to hunting and warfare. Add in the fact that males are expendable, and a genetic inclination toward risk taking does seem somewhat credible. Obsession may have been selected for similar reasons. Those autism genes must be there for a reason. You know, men have to focus on their hunting, while the women multitask feeding the baby while inventing agriculture, food storage and other requirements for civilization.Oops, I have slipped back into systemising again. It must be the lack of connection between my hippocampus and cerebral cortex.Empathising Has Its RewardsThere were not many female programmers where I worked, and they did not last long. They get promoted into management. Oh, the discrimination! The gender distribution at my company was interesting. As one might expect, the programmers were generally male and the quality control people were female. Were women excluded from the more creative jobs because of their sex? Perhaps the difference is that while I would think about work when I got home, they were thinking about home while they were at work. A more demanding job gets in the way. And if that is because of social conditioning, it is hardly the fault of corporate management.The other female “ghetto” at our company was in program management. This critical senior position requires both strong technical knowledge and excellent social skills to deal with our external clients. It was mainly women who had the magic to pull it off. (I suppose that more developed inferior parietal lobe makes all the difference.) The consequences of gender stereotyping, legitimate or not, can cut both ways.I lost my job there because I did not step up into a more collaborative role. I was lucky to last as long as I did happily coding away. Industry is changing, communicating and collaborating across boundaries is becoming ever more important. My stereotypical mind sees these as female qualities, but does it matter? Any company that discriminates against women is suicidal, because it needs those skills. But then, a lot of companies are slowly committing suicide. I suspect there may be a connection here.Social Skills in the Strip ClubsApparently there is an increasing tendency to use strip clubs for conducting business. Ms. Fine documents this and concludes,
“In effect, just as their fathers might have taken clients to one of the gentlemen’s clubs of Pall Mall, so brokers today take their business associates to see lap dancers. The old gentlemen’s clubs banned women – some still do – whereas the lap-dancing establishments merely intimidate them.”
My emotional reaction (yes, I do have them) is anger and disgust. Gentlemen’s clubs, for all their faults, at least had some class. Strip clubs are for scum. Reducing men to scum to preserve their pathetic privileges is beneath contempt.I can’t help wondering if some of those men are not entirely comfortable with what is going on, but feel they have little choice. It looks like nothing has changed – the bullies are still in charge.Geeks like me tend to go to Star Trek conventions rather than strip clubs, if they go anywhere at all. (I go to a book club.) We also cannot help noticing that the more sexist the man, the more women are attracted to him. (They appeal to her associative memory rather than her reason, which should know better.) Bullies get what they want. Sexism is a social skill, and one that is well rewarded. But I suspect some of these organizations are going to bully themselves into bankruptcy because they can’t keep up with a changing world. It can’t come soon enough.But there is another explanation for this behaviour: the men have been desensitized to sexual stimulation by constant exposure to pornography. For some reason Fine chooses to completely ignore this issue. So tell me, which affects men’s attitudes toward women: a dubious book by Louann Brizendine or twenty hours a week of hard-core degrading pornography?Second ThoughtsThis conclusion is being written a several weeks after the rest of the review. What I wrote above is essentially an emotional response to the book. Now the emotion has worn off, I will treat this book as the scientific work it claims to be.The material about how women are limited by social conditioning and outright repression, while socially important, leads to only one scientific insight: we cannot judge the potential of women by their present level of achievement. That is all. But it does serve to soften up the reader for her message. It worked on me.The book may serve as a needed corrective for some of the simplistic stereotyping in the name of science out there. But is it also guilty of similar distortion in pursuit of an agenda that claims gender differences are a social construction? In other words, is this simply the other side in a culture war being fought using science as the battleground?That culture war has been raging for hundreds of years. Conservatives claim human nature is fixed, and we dare not change the ancient wisdom that keeps our impulses contained. Liberals contend that the mind is a blank slate, and humanity is perfectible with the right thinking and social intervention. I suspect those of you who like this book are really cheering that our side is beating up their side, like in a sporting event. And she is administering quite a beating. But this is an empirical question, not a matter of opinion. If you don’t understand the science, how can you possibly know if the scientific arguments here are valid?I don’t know much about neuroscience either, but I detect a number of serious warning signs pointing to a lack of objectivity. Despite the cheery tone, this book mainly consists of an unrelenting attack on any viewpoint that suggests gender differences are innate. It is hard to tell when she is criticizing scientific studies or amateur opinion, which has the effect of implying that the dumbest ideas are also the opinions of any scientists she is opposed to. This kind of polarization has no place in science. A look at the author’s publication list shows mainly commentaries rather than research, mainly aimed at a popular audience. This looks more like a campaigner rather than a scientist.Good science writing shows a passion for understanding the subject and a desire to explain it to the reader. There is none of that here. Instead, explanations are presented only as necessary for the reader to understand the words in her debunking effort. She overwhelms the reader with the sheer volume of scientific information. But volume does not add up to truth if that information is selective.I do not know to what degree gender differences are innate. Who knows, maybe our author has it mostly right. I simply cannot not trust this work to tell me that. Even when she tells me that neuroscience is not advanced enough to draw conclusions about gender, my response is that seems reasonable, but I will look elsewhere to find out. [A quick look suggests she is wrong.]This book is a great reminder that there is a lot of bad science writing out there. Unfortunately it is also a good example of that, yet another example of science corrupted by ideology."
172,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4973578-iset,5,"You've probably heard that men are just naturally better at spatial awareness and logical tasks whilst women are just naturally better at verbal and nurturing tasks. You've probably heard that men and women's brains are different. You may even have heard exasperated parents trying out gender neutral parenting exclaiming that their little girl/boy just seems to naturally gravitate towards pink dolls/blue trucks - it must be biological! Delusions of Gender debunks it all, delving into the real science behind these spurious claims.The book is divided into three sections. First, the sociological and psychological studies of gender differences. How are we to explain, for example, the fact that men seem to consistently do well in maths and women in verbal reasoning? It turns out - quite easily. The notion that men are better at certain things and women are better at other things is an entrenched stereotype. Consistently, in a scientific testing environment, when groups are primed before the test to buy into these stereotypes, they conform to cultural and societal demands of their gender - but when the groups are primed beforehand with a statement that no gender differences have ever been found, then both men and women defy the stereotypes and perform better even than the other gender at tasks that their own gender is supposedly bad at. This result bears out over countless tests, and reveals that when a categorised group is placed under 'stereotype threat', the distracting negative thinking that results significantly impacts on their performance in a given task - conversely, when the group is relaxed and not under threat, their true abilities are freed. There's more. When asked to self-report about how analytical/empathising they are, men and women will report that they fall into the stereotypes about their gender. However, when rigorous scientific is set up - for example, unwittingly recording two individuals in a room, after the fact asking one to note down their thoughts as they watch back the video, and then asking the other to guess what the first was thinking; both men and women show the same amount of ability to read people's faces and intuit their emotional state. In other words, self-reporting is unreliable as a true test of gender differences, and many tests claiming to prove a difference are unscientific, inadvertantly priming the subjects beforehand to perform according to existing social pressures.Okay, so social pressure is affecting people. But what about all that medical evidence that men and women's brains are different? It's actually very flimsy. Testosterone testing of babies in utero is not actually done by testing the baby's blood - but by testing the mother's blood, or the amniotic content. There are significant problems with several of the studies involving scanning the brains of adults - such as some studies only using female test subjects and not comparing against men in any way. Other studies are post-mortem. Several employ circular reasoning in their write ups to assert some sort of gender difference. ""But I've seen those different coloured scan images of male versus female brains on the internet!"" you may cry.
""It’s important to realise that the patches of colour you see on brain scans don’t actually show brain activity. Although it may seem as though fMRI and PET enable you to see a snapshot of the brain at work (or, as popular writers Allan and Barbara Pease claim, ‘to see your brain operating live on a television screen’), this simply isn’t the case. ‘Unfortunately, these pretty pictures hide the sausage factory’, as one neurologist put it. fMRI doesn’t measure neuronal activity directly. Instead, it uses a proxy: changes in blood oxygen levels. (PET uses a radioactive tracer isotope, which attaches itself to glucose or water molecules, to indirectly track blood flow.) Busier neurons need more oxygen and (after an initial dip) active brain regions have higher levels of oxygenated blood, because blood flow to that area increases. The oxygen is carried by the haemoglobin in red blood cells, and haemoglobin has slightly different magnetic qualities depending on how much oxygen it’s carrying. This creates a signal in the scanner (which pulses a magnetic field on and off). Neuroscientists then compare the difference in blood flow in brain regions during the task they’re interested in, with blood flow during a control task or rest state. (Ideally, the control task involves everything the experimental task entails – button pressing, word reading and so on – except for the psychological process you’re particularly interested in.) Researchers test for significant differences in blood flow in various locations of the brain regions during the two tasks, and if tests indicate that it is significant, a blob of colour is placed at the appropriate location on the picture of the brain. In other words, those coloured spots on the brain represent statistical significance at the end of several stages of complicated analysis – which means there’s plenty of scope for spurious findings of sex differences in neuroimaging research.""
Moreover, for every 1 neuroscience study claiming to find a difference between genders, there are 19 where both men and women were tested, no difference was discovered, and since the researcher's topic of interest was something other than gender differences the write up does not draw attention to the result - that no gender differences were found. The studies that do claim to find a difference also receive significantly more attention from people specifically looking for evidence to prove biological gender differences, and because the topic is so hot in our modern world.Alright, so neuroscience evidence is flimsy at best, and psychological testing of adults is unreliable unless performed with proper rigour. But what about children? Haven't there been tests of babies that show they prefer blue trucks/pink dolls? Unfortunately many of the tests claiming to prove such are also highly suspect. One study, for example, tested 3 month old male and female babies to see whether they preferred a Human face or a geometric mobile. Lo and behold, the male babies seemed to prefer the mobile, whilst female babies seemed to prefer the faces. Aha! But the face and the mobiles were presented to the babies separately, not simultaneously as is usual in such tests to truly determine if a baby prefers one thing over another - it's impossible therefore to say whether a preference was displayed. Furthermore, the researchers in the study knew what gender each baby they tested was, and there's reason to suspect they themselves may have been biasing the results by presenting a more friendly face to the female babies and moving the mobile around more with the male babies - creating the result they expected to see. Oh. Oh, indeed. More scientifically rigorous studies of babies' habits show that there is no difference in a six month old's preference between trucks and dolls - but this does kick in from around 9 months onwards. Is it nature asserting itself over nurture? Well, no. Another study tested whether babies truly do prefer a female face over a male one (i.e. testing whether we are biologically predisposed to think of women in a nurturing role). The babies seemed to prefer the female face - but all the babies in the first test group were being looked after primarily by their mothers. The test was repeated with babies who were being primarily raised by their fathers - those babies preferred male faces. Consistently, the results show environment over biology is the determining factor.The mother who had attempted gender neutral parenting only to wail; ""In the end I found her tucking the toy truck into bed and cuddling it! It must be biology!"" was asked by a shrewd researcher whether, in that household, one of the parents did most of the putting to bed - of course, it turned out the mother always put her daughter to bed. The fact of the matter is, even the most determined parents trying to employ gender neutral upbringing face an uphill struggle. Most actually bias the result, implicitly disapproving certain activities for their child despite outspokenly advocating them, and testing of children's reactions to words versus body language clearly demonstrates that they pick up on implict cues much more than verbal ones. Even with dedicated parents, the outside world is often intent on reinforcing gender roles, from multinational companies to the disapproving looks of less progressive parents. Gender is in fact the most strongly emphasised of any of the ways of categorising people, and children pick up on this from an exceptionally young age - it therefore becomes important for them to seek out clues about how to discover a person's gender and how to identify themselves, so they can fit in with a social group and be accepted - even when the parents at home are encouraging them to explore all kinds of play and activities.I'm going to conclude with the account of a couple who went the extra mile in their determination to raise their son and daughter in a truly gender neutral environment. Sandra and Daryl Bem, two psychologists;
""did all that they could to reduce the normally ubiquitous gender associations in their children’s environment: the information that lets children know what toys, behaviours, skills, personality traits, occupations, hobbies, responsibilities, clothing, hairstyles, accessories, colours, shapes, emotions and so on go with being male and female. This entailed, at its foundation, a meticulously managed commitment to equally shared parenting and household responsibilities. Trucks and dolls, needless to say, were offered with equal enthusiasm to both children; but also pink and blue clothing, and male and female playmates. Care was taken to make sure that the children saw men and women doing cross-gender jobs. By way of censorship, and the judicious use of editing, WhiteOut and marker pens, the Bems also ensured that the children’s bookshelves offered an egalitarian picture-book world... The second part of the Bems’ strategy was to, in place of the usual information about what it means to be male or female, promote the idea that the difference between males and females lies in their anatomy and reproductive functions. Your typical preschooler enjoys a detailed knowledge of gender roles, but remains a bit hazy regarding the hard, biological fact that males differ from females when it comes to the allocation of such items as penises, testicles and vaginas.'[O]ur son Jeremy, then age four, … decided to wear barrettes [hair slides] to nursery school. Several times that day, another little boy told Jeremy that he, Jeremy, must be a girl because ‘only girls wear barrettes.’ After trying to explain to this child that ‘wearing barrettes doesn’t matter’ and that ‘being a boy means having a penis and testicles,’ Jeremy finally pulled down his pants as a way of making his point more convincingly. The other child was not impressed. He simply said, ‘Everybody has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.’'Unlike their peers, Jeremy and Emily were discouraged from using socially determined trappings such as hairstyle, clothing, accessories or profession as a guide to a person’s biological sex. If the children asked whether someone was male or female, their parents ‘frequently denied certain knowledge of the person’s sex, emphasizing that without being able to see whether there was a penis or a vagina under the person’s clothes, [they] had no definitive information.’Step forward, please, all those parents who go to similar lengths to protect their children from acquiring prevailing cultural assumptions about gender. And do try to avoid being trampled in the rush. The Bems’ efforts, I think you’ll agree, seriously outclass what we normally, generously, think of as gender-neutral parenting... The intensity and scope of the Bems’ efforts offer a helpful hint as to just how gendered children’s environments are. To this day social structure, media and peers offer no shortage of information to children about masculinity and femininity.""

173,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"Delusions of Gender: The Real Science Behind Sex Differences by Cordelia Fine“Delusions of Gender” is an outstanding book that compels you to take a closer look at society and our science as it relates to gender issues. Academic psychologist and author, Dr. Cordelia Fine with a sharp sense of humor and an excellent grasp of what constitutes good science dismantles many claims of what can be considered neurosexism. This is a very provocative book as it tackles claims about male and female brains, and the gender cycle. This fascinating 371-page book is broken out into the following three parts: 1. Half-Changed World, Half-Changed Minds, 2. Neurosexism, and Recycling Gender.Positives:1. Engaging, witty, and provocative book. This is also a well-researched book that is not afraid to tackle head on popular misconceptions on gender.2. A fascinating and often misunderstood topic of sex differences.3. The science is accessible and the narrative flows nicely thanks to an infusion of humor. The book is also full of interesting anecdotes.4. Great use of counter-research to combat what Dr. Fine has concluded is poor science.5. One of the best features of this book is Dr. Fine’s relentless research against commonly held misconceptions by well-known scientists and authors. She makes a very compelling case against at best poor science or worst pseudoscience.6. Makes the very strong case on how society can impact associative memory. “Unlike explicitly held knowledge, where you can be reflective and picky about what you believe, associative memory seems to be fairly indiscriminate in what it takes on board. Most likely, it picks up and responds to cultural patterns in society, media and advertising, which may well be reinforcing implicit associations you don’t consciously endorse.” “When gender is salient in the environment, or we categories someone as male or female, gender stereotypes are automatically primed.”7. The impact of stereotypes. “Research suggests that the deadly combination of ‘knowing-and-being’ (women are bad at math and I am a woman) can lower performance expectations, as well as trigger performance anxiety and other negative emotions.”8. A look at mothers versus single women. “While parenthood served as no disadvantage at all to men, there was evidence of a substantial ‘motherhood penalty’. Mothers received only half as many callbacks as their identically qualified childless counterparts.”9. The reality of sexual harassment.10. Covers many issues regarding gender equality, including at home. “As Gloria Steinem recently reminded a journalist, “The idea of having it all never meant doing it all. Men are parents, too, and actually women will never be equal outside the home until men are equal inside the home.” Great quote.11. So are there biological roots to gender inequality? This is a recurring theme in the book.12. The reality is that there is a lot of poor science involving gender issues. “There’s something a little shocking about the discrepancy between the weakness of the scientific data on the one hand and the strength of the popular claims on the other.”13. A fascinating look at Neurosexism. “The sheer complexity of the brain makes interpreting and understanding the meaning of any sex differences we find in the brain a very difficult task.” “Neurosexism promotes damaging, limiting, potentially self-fulfilling stereotypes.”14. The file-drawer phenomenon. “This contributes to the so-called file-drawer phenomenon, whereby studies that do find sex differences get published, but those that don’t languish unpublished and unseen in a researcher’s file drawer.”15. Debunks myths with glee. “So let us, with healthy skepticism, summarize all of this as clearly as we can. Nonexistent sex differences in language lateralization, mediated by nonexistent sex differences in corpus callosum structure, are widely believed to explain nonexistent sex differences in language skills.” “The speculations of a few scientists quickly evolve into the colorful fabrications of popular neurosexism – the subspecialty within the larger discipline of neurononsense.”16. The four basic pieces of advice for anyone considering incorporating neuroscientific findings into a popular book or article about gender.17. One of the most astute observations of the books, too good not to share. “Genes don’t determine our brains (or our bodies), but they do constrain them. The developmental possibilities for an individual are neither infinitely malleable nor solely in the hands of the environment. But the insight that thinking, behavior and experiences change the brain, directly, or through changes in genetic activity, seems to strip the word ‘hardwiring’ of much useful meaning. As neurophysiologist Ruth Bleier put it over two decades ago, we should ‘view biology as potential, as capacity and not as static entity. Biology itself is socially influenced and defined; it changes and develops in interaction with and response to our minds and environment, as our behaviors do. Biology can be said to define possibilities but not determine them; it is never irrelevant but it is also not determinant.” Read that again, and again.18. A look at parenting. “It seems, then, that gender stereotypes, even if perhaps only implicitly held, affect parents’ behavior towards their babies.”19. Interesting facts that have an impact. “The Dr. Seuss books are rightly classics, adored by children and a joy of rediscovery for parents. Yet as Lamb and Brown observe, in all the forty-two books he wrote, not one has a female lead in its central story.”20. Copious amounts of notes and they are linked. A comprehensive bibliography.Negatives:1. Very little not to like about this excellent book but I would have probably started with defining the differences between key terms like sex and gender. The layperson tends to use these terms indiscriminately.2. The book does a phenomenal job of at the very least casting doubt or outright debunking commonly held misconceptions on gender issues; however, it doesn’t succeed nowhere near as well on defining the real science behind sex differences.3. Using scientific claims from centuries ago to debunk easily comes across as strawman arguments or low hanging fruits to grab on to.4. At times I feel she doesn’t necessarily apply the same amount of scrutiny to those studies that support her argument versus those that don’t. I prefer the instances where she simply states that we just don’t know.In summary, this was truly an eye opening and cognitive-dissonance inducing book. One of the great things I take from this book is to not fall prey to poor science and specifically, be alert of neurosexism. I’m not a neuroscience to know if all the conclusions that Dr. Fine makes are sound or not, but she is very persuasive and the book made me think. Witty, provocative and just fun to read, I highly recommend it!Further suggestions: “Science and Gender” by Ruth Bleier, “The Myths of Gender” and “Sexing the Body” by Gisela Kaplan, “Gene Worship” by Lesley Roger, “Sexual Science” by Cynthia Russett, and “The Social Psychology of Gender” by Laurie Rudman and Peter Glick. These books were recommended notably by the author."

It makes sense to me.There're a lot of dog-ears and underlines, but some of them are angry marks. I got very frustrated with about the middle two-fourths of it. The first fourth and the last fourth, I was much more interested in.The last fourth was what I thought the entire book was to be about---about how society and subtle clues train modern ""gender identity."" Because, dude, kids are sponges.The first one-fourth had some great lines and sentiments I agreed with, at their base. That is, perception is reality.The middle two-fourths? (Okay, I'd say, half, but it sounds wrong, since it's in the middle.) Yeah, that frustrated the ever-loving shit out of me. Because it seemed (to me, at least) she spent all that time leading up to making a point that I already knew. And I kept thinking, over an over, what she waited to say until the end of all that.And it just about killed me.Basically, I'm a fucking amateur, and I know that the way you live your life---your thought processes change the way your brain works. That is to say, nothing is hard-wired.Guess what; you spend your life obsessing over math, and the parts of your brain that deal with math are going to be larger than someone who's not obsessed with math, Einstein.So the fact that she laid it on thick, and laid on all this evidence, without just saying that until the end, just about killed me.Well, now, if she'd said it in the beginning of that section and went on, I would have had no problem. It just---it kept making me wonder if she was ever even going to point that out.And it drove me nuts.A mild frustration had nothing to do with her, but with a few of experiments they carried out. I mean, yeah, I was frustrated with the (sometimes) wild interpretations of some of them (as I was meant to be), but there were a few that hit me, personally. A few for which, all I could think, ""And then they had one more step to do."" Especially with the empathy tests. Oh, I could come up with such an awesome empathy test...There were even a couple of times that Fine really let me down. One, when she cited the behavior of rats to prove her point. And then, later, when rats didn't quite prove her point, she mentions how we really can't equate the behavior of rats to humans. It made me sad, because she had a point both times, but... Oof.Lots of good stuff, but a lot of frustration as well. And not nearly as much ""hard information"" as I was expecting. At least, not the kind I was expecting, because the kind of hard information I was looking forward to was only in the last quarter of the book. And there was not nearly as much of it as I had been hoping for. It barely went beyond what I already knew. It didn't challenge me the way I was hoping to be challenged.But enough of that. Let's end on my favorite line of the book. It has to do with the Bem children, who were raised as just about as ""gender nuetral"" as anyone could ever manage. The boy tells a classmante, "" 'being a boy means having a penis and testicles.' ""The boy who was critisizing him for wearing barrettes to nursery school comes back with, ""Everyone has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.""That right there made the whole book for me.Anyway, the point of the rating is not that I really liked it, but that I really like that it exists."
175,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,5,"I was really impressed with ‘Delusions of Gender’. It dissects and summarises research clearly, critiques stereotypes intelligently and analytically, and keeps the tone witty and readable yet more academic than journalistic. I found the synthesis of neuroscientific research on sex differences extremely helpful. Media articles that cheerfully claim sexist stereotypes are biological inevitabilities make me very angry. Fine channelled that same anger into writing an excellent rebuttal, which will be very useful to remember when the next wave of pseudo-scientific claims hit the papers.This book makes an excellent accompaniment to Living Dolls: The Return of Sexism, which focuses more on the societal implications of biological determinism-based sexism. It also brings up the important debate about applying scientific methodologies to research questions that are based on unquestioned stereotypes and assumptions. An example of this is the use of 'masculinity' as an objective index, like height and weight. As Fine states, including fMRI scans makes any research findings appear more weighty and scientific. Yet inferring major psychological differences between the sexes from disputed differences in brain structure is very problematic. The brain and the mind are not congruent. I’d also pick out for praise the latter chapters on young children learning about gender. That was not something I’d ever really thought about before, but of course kids observe how carefully adults sort people into the ‘man’ and ‘woman’ boxes. This part of the book includes amusing summaries of research investigating whether and/or why girls play more with ‘girl toys’ and boys with ‘boy toys’. I particularly liked the idea that some researchers made a My Little Pony into a desirable boy’s toy by painting it black, trimming its mane, and sharpening its teeth. Conversely, girls were ‘enchanted by… the lavender-satin-covered guns and holster, and the pink furred war helmet’. By the age of five, these children had picked up from their surrounding the sexual dimorphism of toys. As Fine points out, even clothes for newborns are gendered. She makes a strong argument for social over biological gender determinism.Apologies for eliding sex and gender in the paragraph above. Fine does not critique the gender binary or cover intersectionality issues in much depth, as these are not the focus of her book. Neither are they ever mentioned (that I’ve seen) by media articles that oversimplify and distort neuroscience to excuse sexism. Nonetheless, similar effects (regarding ‘stereotype threat’ for example) are noted to impact on women and ethnic minorities in the earlier chapters covering sociological research. There’s clearly a lot more work needed in the fields of sociology and neuroscience, but I agree with Fine that scientists have a responsibility to consider their unwitting assumptions about gender. As well as the ways in which their findings will be treated by a depressingly sexist media."
176,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie,4,"All those studies that say that women are bad at math and men are bad at relationships because their brains are hardwired that way can be very discouraging, and there are a LOT of those studies. But Cordelia Fine has looked into those studies and found flaws in them. Add into that a large number of studies that show how easy it is to jigger people’s minds into doing better or worse at tasks depending on how they are psychologically primed before hand and we can see where the author is coming from. Fine’s thesis is rather than there being any physical difference between male and female brains, the differences that we see in math scores are there because our culture expects them to be there. Even when people attempt to raise their children in a gender neutral environment, culture intervenes. On TV, in schools, in children’s books, in the clothing sold to children- everything is divided into genders, and females end up less adventuresome, more nurturing, expected to be nicer and not fight, and to focus on home and caring rather than invented and discovering. Toys for girls and boys are separated, and children who choose to play with toys for the opposite gender are disapproved of, especially boys who play with dolls or other ‘girl’ toys. Tomboys may be told to act more ladylike, but boys will get beat up by other boys. The core of her argument is that studies where test takers are primed to consider themselves members of sets other than gender yield different results than tests taken when the test takers are told things like “men traditionally do better on this test”. For instance, when a group of males and females take a test and are told before hand that people who go to certain colleges (colleges that some of the test takers go to) do better on this same test, the test takers conform to this and the males and females who belong to the colleges mentioned both do better on the test than the non-certain collegians- and the males and females in that group score the same as each other on the test under these conditions. These tests have been done numerous times by different researchers, and the results are always the same- the test takers conform to expectations set up before the test. Therefore, psychology trumps brain structure where intellectual subjects are concerned. It’s an interesting proposition, and one I think needs to be investigated more- much more. There’s a lot still to be untangled in gender studies. Intellectual abilities are jumbled in with emotional tendencies, and I definitely think they should be considered separately. She pretty much ignores the effect of hormones on emotional states except for the case of fetal testosterone. I think that while this book doesn’t settle any gender issue questions, it does cast a lot of doubt on previous studies and urges us to look at them much harder."
177,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237879-elaine-nelson,5,"I happened to run across this book at the library having forgotten that it was in my ""to-read"" list. I'm SO glad I did, and given a certain pair of somewhat ranty posts a couple of months back, only wish I'd read it sooner! I literally could not put it down - as in: ""no really, I need to go to bed/back to my desk from lunch/off the bus, I have to put the book away.""In short, social construction of gender: you're soaking in it. (And especially, your brain is soaking in it.)1) Priming & stereotype threat affect everything. Just checking gender on a form before taking a test changes womens' performance, especially on math tests. More priming (being told that the test relates to gender, watching a gender-stereotyped commercial, etc) increases the effect.2) Most of the ""science"" as it's filtered through to the popular media is a disaster of half-baked assumptions, small and/or poorly-constructed experiments, and willful misunderstanding of the actual results. (She tears apart one popular writer; it's kinda fun.)3) Worse, those lame results create a feedback loop, combined with the impossibility of gender-neutral child-rearing, that increases the problem of stereotype threat, and makes genuine social change more difficult.Le sigh. Not only is the feminist struggle not over, we may actually be hitting a really hard spot.On the plus side, I'm fired up now. Not just that, but I'm thinking more about my own personal construction of gender identity, including my history with math and science. There's a post I wrote about my life with math a while back, and there I wrote about it as a choice between writing and math - now I'm seriously looking back and wondering about the effect of gender stereotypes, and whether I might have come to computing sooner given different circumstances. I think it's worth noticing that choices exist in a constrained environment, constrained both by the external world, and by our own unexamined or incompletely-formed attitudes.As for the writing style, it's a delightful read. She's got a sharp conversational tone that pulled me in; I even read the footnotes.HIGHLY recommended, great in combination with Pink Brain Blue Brain."
178,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5324619-noor,5,"""Delusions of Gender"" has proved to be one of the most informative and interesting books I've read this year. The book consists of three parts that essentially discuss gender-stereotypes, Neurosexism, and the struggles of attempting to raise children in a gender-neutral environment.Cordelia starts by explaining how implicit and explicit beliefs are two separate things that don't always correlate. Despite ""consciously"" holding certain beliefs, there is a clash between the reflective self and our associative memory which is heavily influenced by the social environment surrounding us. When gender becomes salient and constantly primed in our daily life, it seeps into our perception of others and of ourselves, and we often do it in stereotypical ways. The book is filled with numerous experiments that support this idea. When we categorise people as male or female, we are instantly activating gender associations that affect our behaviour, values, performance etc. A perfect manifestation of this activated gender-inequality is how women are treated in a workplace dominated by men. Women experience segregation, exclusion, harassment and attack just by showing up to work basically.The second part of the book focuses on neurosexism and was the most difficult for me to digest; simply because I was unaware of just how much these popular neuroscientific claims are based on shaky empirical evidence. Gender stereotypes are legitimised by these pseudo-scientific explanations, and often become part of popular media. Neurosexism activates gender stereotypes which feeds into the public sphere + affects attitudes, identity & performance. It all leads us to become our own self-fulfilling prophecies.And the last bit of the book should be read by all parents who try to raise their children in a gender-neutral environment. It goes way beyond giving boys barbie dolls and giving girls fire trucks.All in all, this was an eye-opener for me when it comes to neuroscience and how it's used to reinforce old-fashioned stereotypes/roles through covering them with the finery of science.PS: Cordelia is quite witty. Found myself laughing out loud at times."
179,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4508080-julie-bozza,5,"A bit of a hard slog to read, especially as the few moments of humour didn't really suit me (too sarcastic). However, the important thing is that Fine makes vital headway towards an understanding of gender that I can really get behind. Gender difference is not 'hardwired' into us, and Fine deftly demolishes the pseudo-science that tells us otherwise. Fine quotes Kimmel in asserting 'gender difference is the product of gender inequality'; that is, we create and recreate gender difference while interacting with our society. The process begins at such an early age that many new parents, no matter how gender-neutral they try to be, end up assuming that gender difference is biologically or neurologically innate in their children. Fine does a good job of explaining why this happens, and how it will ultimately be worth it if we keep plugging away the gender-neutral objective. Fine also articulates how permeable the boundaries can be between our own sense of self and society's sense of who we are - or should be. I've struggled to articulate my struggles with this, but I've often felt like an asymmetrical heptagonal peg who is nevertheless forced (by otherwise well-meaning folk) to fit into the round hole that society makes available to me. Gender is certainly one aspect of this. My social sciences tutor told me I was making too much of the external forces - but now I've found Fine to back me up and explore the implications, and I feel inordinately grateful. Lastly, Fine ends with a note of hope. While she has shown how deeply woven gender difference (and hence gender inequality) is in our society, she has also shown that it is malleable. We can change this, though it will take time and effort. Let's keep trying! I would love to see what we can become when we are so much freer to be ourselves, whoever we may be."
180,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Subtitle: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference. Cordelia Fine, while an apparently well-read and quite competent scientist, makes no pretense of objectivity in this book. She's got an axe to grind with a whole school of research that aims to use modern brain science to convince us that male and female brains are intrinsically, fundamentally, and irrevocably different. Oh, and I also think the picture of her on the dust jacket is pretty hot. I just love imagining her getting all worked up about this. Wait, did I say that out loud?Anyway, Fine's point is best illustrated by an anecdote from the experience of a four year old named Jeremy, who had been raised by parents who were extraordinarily zealous gender-neutral parents. He decided one day to wear barrettes to nursery school, and gets into an argument with another boy, who says that he is a girl. Finally, Jeremy pulls down his pants and points out that he has a penis, as a way of making his point. The other boy says, “Everybody has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.”Whether you think the parents who let their boy wear barrettes to school were weird here, or the society that teaches a boy that the difference between male and female has more to do with hairstyle than genitals, depends on your opinions about gender (and society) generally. So does a lot of other (less amusing but more substantial) evidence, published in scientific journals or mainstream media, that Fine takes us on a tour of.Some of it is related to the general fallacy of all brain-scan evidence. Just because we see a difference in brain activity (using MRI or some other method), doesn't mean it's genetic or otherwise hardwired. All it shows is that it happens in the brain, and really, if we're talking about thoughts, attitudes, emotions, and so forth, where else would we expect it to happen? Also, like muscles, areas of the brain can grow larger or smaller over time as they are used more or less (whether for cultural reasons or any other), so again evidence from brain scans, while perhaps useful for other purposes, tells us nothing about whether differences in behavior are primarily biological or cultural. Seeing a brain scan, however, tells us that it has something to do with biology, and our instinctive reaction is still to divide things into biological and cultural, and if it's one it must not be the other.There is a long and well-documented history of scientific attempts to explain to us why women and men are Just Different, in ways that have nothing (directly) to do with procreation. The suspicious thing is that, while the rationales differ from decade to decade and from one century to the next, the conclusions always point in the same direction. Fine takes us on a thoroughly readable tour of this history, spiced up a bit by her, at times, barely contained rage.Make no mistake, this is not an even-handed weighing of the evidence; it is rather a very well-documented and data-driven polemic. If it were written by a man, I'd say that the confrontational and science-oriented analysis is very typical of a masculine style. Instead, I'll say it's an emotional treatment, showing a feminine inability to maintain objectivity on scientific topics. Either way, it's a hoot to read."
181,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6537005-daniel,3,"""Delusions of Gender"" is an engaging read, well-written and incisive. Cordelia Fine makes a convincing argument that gender differences in performance assessed through various metrics are to a large extent the result of social cues, reactions to internalized stereotypes, and unconscious priming. Her critique of studies of gender differences in psychological experiments is comprehensive, and her depiction of the current state of sexism is both convincing and often horrifying.Unfortunately, her fixation on discrediting both contemporary pop-psychology books selling innate gender differences and the arguments of dusty sexists from centuries past comes off a bit like clubbing baby seals (or possibly arm-wrestling five-year-olds). Her arguments against current neuroscientific techniques--especially neuroimaging using techniques like fMRI--fall particularly flat, as she relies repeatedly upon equating sophisticated real-time 3d measurements of blood-flow in the brain with crude volumetric measurements of skull capacity used by those sexist scientists of yore. This is trite and annoying.Likewise, she fails to engage biological and evolutionary arguments in any meaningful sense, instead relying on the tired allegation that evolutionary psychology and biology are only sexist justifications for relegating women to lives of domestic drudgery. She perhaps hopes that her readers are not savvy enough to Wikipedia the fields. Her argument that structural differences between the brains of men and women (after criticizing imaging and anatomical studies, she grudgingly admits that these do exist) compensate for differences in physiology to produce similar behaviors in males and females is interesting and may even be true to some extent--humans male and female, after all, must accomplish many of the same tasks to survive--but is unsupported and feels like hand-waving. She does not engage with the concepts of hormonal modulation of brain activity or neurotransmitter/receptor distribution and prevalence to any great degree. She brushes off the striking possibility that biological differences may predispose men and women toward different goals irrespective of nebulous measures of aptitude or spurious notions of ""natural gender roles."" The human brain she seems to prefer is the black box too intricate to be understood on a mechanistic level, a network of abstract associations accessible only to psychologists distributing questionnaires and bubble sheets to college students participating in studies for course credit.So, while entertaining (and perhaps convincing to audiences disinclined to read it critically or who already embrace its ideological underpinnings), the book's thesis does not strike home, and Fine's claim that it is dangerous for researchers to ask these questions at all should be disturbing to any reader who values science over ideology."

If I had read this in audio, a format my brain can handle for serious subjects, I probably would have rated it much higher, and gotten through it much faster (and I'll be honest, retained more than 10% of it). So take this review with a grain of salt. (P.S. I just googled that phrase, and it evolved from something Pliny the Elder wrote in 77 A.D. Language is so weird.) I will be trying it again maybe in a couple of years by audio. Unless someone can point me in the direction of a book on the same subject that is more recent that I should read first (this was published in 2010).Aside from that issue, this book is also less of a thing on its own than it is the author debunking other scientific studies or books, things that people take as a given, or as ""proven"" by science. Cognitive bias plays a huge role not only in the behavior of test subjects, but in the minds of the scientists performing the studies. Which is enjoyable in its own way, but not quite what I was expecting. The book is very heavy on cautioning the reader about these types of studies, since gender is so hard to study, and really just instills a healthy amount of scientific skepticism. I remember it being a lot of, this isn't proven, we actually don't ""know"" as much as we think we do.I can't emphasize how much my brain did not retain any of the information I read, so this is really just a useless review. Judging by my friends' reviews on Goodreads, I just really need to give it a break, and then pick this up again some time down the road when my brain is being more amenable."

Honestly though, some male scientists... if you have to create and pursue patently absurd theories about differences in the brain to justify why you can't patiently listen to your wife or make your kids a sandwich, that's pretty undeniably pathetic.

186,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113545-nancy,5,"READ IT.Cordelia Fine's examination of the many popular books and research studies which purport to prove that the male and female brains might as well belong to different species is simply brilliant. I gobbled this non-fiction up like it was a light lunch after a hard day's manual labor. Every page was packed with jaw-dropping information - horrifying methodological flaws, research which argues two diametrically opposed concepts, and outright deception, all designed to prove that men and women are not and cannot possibly be equal. Like, here's one example: Fine mentions the author of a popular book on the subject, who cites research about ""mirror neurons,"" (women have more of them, which supposedly makes them more empathetic.) The author mentions a study of therapists which indicated that the most successful therapists are those that ""mirror"" their clients words, gestures, and verbal patterns. Interestingly, (says the author), ALL of the successful therapists were women. Because they have more mirror neurons, and are more attuned to others, right?WRONG. Cordelia Fine looked up the study (thank you, Cordelia! That would be a big nuisance for the Average Reader) and as it turns out? ALL OF THE THERAPISTS IN THE STUDY WERE WOMEN. Yeah, that's right. They only recruited women for the study, so the study proves absolutely nothing about men vs. women. And if you think this sort of thing is an anomaly, wrong again - Fine's detailed work found this sort of thing occurring over and over again. Moreover, Fine is terrific at highlighting how the social context of everything men and women do contributes to these gender stereotypes, and at explaining how gender bias affects the neuroscientific research. This is an absolutely fantastic book - I have the urge to acquire copies for every teacher, every employer, every parent on the planet. It made me rethink more of my life that I would have believed possible. Seriously, even if you think you would disagree with it: READ IT. If nothing else, you will enjoy Fine's smooth and witty prose."

If you’re the type of person who enjoys nitpicking underpowered studies over methodological errors that affect validity and throwing shade at poor referencing while also being a flagrant feminist this is for you. I am not sure how this would go down for other people without a background in neuroscience because those parts were undoubtedly my favorite although I see how that part of the book could be too technical and heavy. I didn’t learn anything new science-wise but I did discover that there still are some fucking assholes willing to forgo the science completely just in order to tell you that your female brain HAS TO KNOW HOW TO EMPATHIZE AND BE NURTURING and that of course those morons have a wide audience just dying for any shard of pseudo-evidence that may point to the fact that their daughters are meant to be breeding subservient cows and that their sons will bring about the rapture. Of course this book proves yet again the only truth known to humans besides inevitable death and that is that men are trash. Besides that, I wholeheartedly enjoyed the psychology aspects of the book and if I had any doubt about the ubiquity of gender then it was all erased in the last part where she lists study after study proving how the idea of gender and how everything is gendered almost from birth and how early toddlers take on these ideas and digest them almost regardless of how unisex parents attempt to make their environments at home; the world at large is sexist. Go figure. And then there’s the ever expanding body of evidence that simply makes it clear that women have always always always been just as capable as men and that as the gender gap closes (despite the screeching and howling of men) women find their ways into board room and ORs and mines and factories and fucking haters continue to come up with more sophisticated schemes of bullshit to make it seem like we can’t but we’re doing it anyway.

189,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14821636-andrew-fish,1,"The differences between men and women have probably been a topic of debate since the dawn of time. In recent decades, however, as society has progressed from subsistence and survival to consumerism and choice the issue has gained a degree of salience. The question of whether women are actively held down in their careers or whether they passively make decisions which close off paths to advancement becomes more than a curiosity when careers become both a means to achieve a better life and a source of fulfilment in themselves. And earlier in life, the science of gender difference could make a significant difference to educational outcomes if it could be robustly investigated. The time, it seems, is right for a good scientific look at the subject.Unfortunately, this isn't it.Fine is a psychologist by training, and whilst there's definitely scope to study the issue of gender difference through psychology, she seems reluctant to do this in any depth. The opening section of the book which nominally covers this ground is quite thin on actual studies and seems instead to rely heavily on anecdote, giving the book the feel more of a polemic rather than an academic assessment. What science there is, meanwhile, is treated in an uneven manner, promoting the studies which suit the central thesis and denigrating any which don't. Frequently, Fine goes beyond the studies and draws conclusions which aren't supported by any of the evidence she has presented.So, for example, when looking at a study about the effect of priming on women's mathematical abilities, she not only accepts the results without question, she positively crows about the fact that the women did better than the men without the priming. For this to be a valid observation, both male and female participants would have to have an even spread of intellect, presumably using some kind of test as part of the selection process. The trouble with this is that you are then pre-determining the results: if the selection test were gender-neutral, the gender-neutral part of the study would be consistent with the selection process and you would end up with roughly equal results for men and women. If the theory were correct, there would then be lower results for the women in the gender-biased part. If the selection process were not gender-neutral, meanwhile, then if the theory held the women would seem equal to the men in the selection process and better in the gender-neutral study itself.From those results you could prove that priming made a difference to the test results, but not that there was any inherent difference between male and female aptitude in itself. To go further would be circular reasoning (something Fine criticises about another study later in the book).It's like the constant claim that girls are better at school - fifty years ago, the reverse was claimed. What changed in between? The education system. Clearly there is some kind of difference between the sexes there (something Fine seems pathologically averse to) but if one system of education produced stronger male results and the other stronger female all you can say is that different methods favour the sexes differently - you can't claim this makes one superior to the other.In other places, such as the behaviour of women in male-dominated careers, it seems there are no studies Fine can draw on. By definition, you'd find it hard to create a female-dominated version of the same career for comparison, but it doesn't stop the author from coming to conclusions about the effect of those environments without anything beyond anecdote and hypothesis.The most detailed analysis in favour of her argument comes toward the end of the book, when looking at the gender stereotypes to which children are exposed in their early years and how this affects their choice of toys and sense of dress. Unfortunately, here she has narrowed the argument too much: it may be demonstrable that social forces drive boys to wear blue and girls pink, but this would hardly explain the more abstract alleged differences between the sexes. When was the last time your child came home claiming they'd been excluded from the spatial reasoning group on the basis of gender?With the results which don't suit her, the author is more exacting. When looking at a study about infant response to faces and mobile phones, for example, she casts aspersions on the methodology, hypothesises about all kinds of ways the results could have been skewed (always assuming such skews would be systematically biased in the same direction) and even implies that the experimenters could have been acting out of an unconscious gender bias themselves. Apart from the unprofessionalism of casting aspersions without evidence, it seems weak to subject a study you don't like to this level of criticism when it could have been equally true of any of the studies supporting the case. Stepping outside her field, Fine is dismissive of biological studies and applies an extremely shaky attack on neurology - regarding it as an inadequately direct proxy measure of brain activity that is subject to confirmation bias. If that's true of neurology, what it does it say about psychology as a reliable indicator? This attack allows her to dismiss any conclusions from the field she doesn't like, but again she's all too quick to accept any that she does. She constantly falls for the same fallacy, that if you can debunk a very specific prediction made by someone in a particular field, you can dismiss any evidence from that field when it doesn't suit your agenda. The constant comparisons to long-dismissed theories such as brain-pan measurement are a reductio ad absurdum argument with little logical validity and the quotes which open most chapters - generally over a century old and clearly not acceptable to modern readers - come across as an attempt to prime the reader into a form of indignation which switches off their reasoning faculties for the rest of the chapter and allows them to accept Fine's arguments without criticism. I even spotted a very old psychologists' trick - starting a sentence with ""by now you will all be thinking"" - which is a blatant attempt at manipulation of the reader.Here and there we find snippets of actual information - a chance remark about spatial reasoning differing in babies of only a few months old, for example - but unless they fit the central argument, they are passed over quickly. An anecdote about a woman having been masturbated over, by contrast, is alluded to several times across a chapter. And there's little gender-balance in the topics themselves either: apart from a brief mention of female intuition right at the beginning, the book focuses almost entirely on areas where women are alleged to be deficient. The impression given is that this is a book written by someone working out their own issues rather than dispassionately looking at the field.And this is often a problem with psychologists. Freud's obsession with mother fantasies reeked of projection, Kahneman's instinct over reason view of the brain suggests a man struggling to justify his own bad decisions. To see what Fine's problems are you need only look at the language she uses, the metaphors she chooses and the examples she latches onto. The book is riddled with misandistric metaphor and there are a number of coded attacks on her husband. Take the chapter where she envisages a hypothetical job-swap with her spouse. When looking at his ability to do her job, she attacks his literacy - comparing it to a ten year-old. She then looks at her ability to do his job, but rather than admit any limitation on her own part, she sidesteps the issue and instead turns it into another backhanded attack on her husband - in this case the likelihood of his nagging her from beyond the grave. It doesn't take a degree in psychology to spot the signs of an inferiority complex.I don't pretend to know what the biological basis for behaviour is, and I accept that there are a lot of bad studies out there and bad books using the results. But for a book whose byline is ""the real science behind gender difference"" I was expecting more than just a series of attacks. And it's a shame, because the issue is both interesting and important. In my opinion, there clearly are elements of behaviour that are inherited (how else would cuckoos transmit their parasitical tendencies?) but what that inheritance mechanism is and how far it reaches into human behaviour has, as far as I can see, yet to be established. To claim it has no effect on humans would be to think as those who attacked Darwin because whilst they could accept evolution, they felt that to claim humans were a product of evolution was a step too far. One science Fine didn't look at all is anthropology, which for anyone who is genuinely looking for the true reasons for gender difference would seem the obvious place to start. I suggest for those who are after a book which informs them rather than just gives them a reason to be angry at the state of the world, that would be a better field to explore."
190,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17161968-fergus-murray,5,"Delusions of Gender, by Cordelia Fine, is an extended critique of efforts to scientifically study differences between the sexes, and the efforts of many writers to apply alleged science in their writings about such differences. The book is rich in technical detail, which might bog down some readers, but most of those details are fascinating. Fine is a lucid and entertaining writer, especially in her more acerbic moments - of which there are plenty here. She finds a lot of shoddy science and shameless misuse of would-be science that would raise the hackles of any neuroscientist or feminist, let alone someone like her who happens to be both.This is a book with an agenda, and political agendas tend not to sit comfortably with science - but to pretend that politics never seeps into science while nobody is looking would be disingenuous. In fact, Fine's agenda - to bring out the reasons to doubt science that supposedly demonstrates innate differences between sexes - is at least as much scientific as political, and I think it is legitimate. It is something to bear in mind while reading this book, though, and there are times she goes out of her way to present things in such a way as to minimise the possibility of interpretation in terms of innate differences. As far as I can see she always stops short of misrepresenting the science, though, and the whole approach needs to be seen in the context of discourse which routinely takes essential differences for granted, whether the evidence supports them or not.The book is divided into three parts. The first is 'Half-changed World', Half-Changed Minds, which largely focuses on the interplay of cultural expectations and attempts to measure sex differences scientifically. This largely consists of accounts of experiments demonstrating the effects of cultural norms on things that people might be interested in measuring, and experiments which fail to take these factors into account. For example, she looks at experiments investigating the effect of telling the subjects what 'the latest science' has to say about the sorts of tests they are about to perform, to show that girls do significantly better on mathematical tasks if they think that science says they should. Even more subtly, females rate their mathematical ability as worse after they have just been reminded of their sex by having to tick a box at the beginning to say they are females. This gives us an interesting lens for looking at gender differences in maths tests which disregard the weight of cultural expectations, and indeed at systematic tendencies for females to choose less mathematical study and career paths. Having established many profound and subtle ways that social expectations and structures shape behaviours and perfomance, the theme of the second part of the book is Neurosexism - premature efforts to explain differences in behaviour and performance with reference to the brain, rather than society. Fine's most basic point is that it is rather soon to be looking for explanations of most of these things in neuroscience, when societal explanations have not been ruled out, and the relationship between the mind and the brain is still so unclear. More than that, she shows time and again that many authors are disturbingly willing to go way beyond what neurology can tell us, while pretending that they are not. Perhaps the single worst offender here is Louann Brizendine, author of The Female Brain, a serial abuser and inventor of neuroscience to back up her ideas about the differences between males and females - but she is one of many. Fine makes the point that people have been finding 'explanations' for sex differences in the brain for well over a century, from the observation that female brains tend to be a bit lighter than male ones through to modern notions of hardwiring. At the same time, people have routinely assumed that all kinds of observed differences between the sexes are natural and inevitable, when later experience has regularly shown them to be no such thing.The final section is titled Re-Cycling Gender, and it concerns itself with the future of gender relations and the science of sex. Fine is worried about the cyclical nature of some kinds of self-fulfilling prophecy - about dodgy science being used to teach yet another generation of young men and women that there are certain natural roles that they ought to be filling, certain characteristics they should expect to have. She emphasises again how difficult it is to pick apart innate and culturally conditioned differences, and the importance of keeping an open mind about questions that science has not yet been able to settle. With a better scientific understanding of the role of society in forming the mind and the brain, and a sceptical eye on the interesting but inconclusive findings of neuroscience, we may approach true sexual equality yet. Without such circumspection, as Fine argues, we may find ourselves sliding back to ideas about the sexes which are both unhelpful and ill-founded.This is an important book, because the trend towards explaining sex differences with impressive-sounding neurological findings has great potential to set back ideas about gender roles, on the basis of evidence which is far flimsier than it might look. Because we are shaped by our ideas, this has major practical, political ramifications - it is not just good science that is at stake here. There is no doubt that some will resist Fine's approach for its politicisation of science, but I would be inclined to see it more as exploring the role of pre-existing, unexamined political bias, rather than introducing politics to the debate. Delusions of Gender is compelling, informative and perhaps most impressively, funny. I recommend this highly to anyone with any interest in neuroscience or gender.'This review first appeared at http://everything2.com/title/Delusion..."
191,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11030012-jade,4,"There have always been many (pseudo)scientific books on the shelves attempting to explain the differences between the sexes, of which the most common differences usually consist of men having a more result-orientated, mathematical approach, and women having a more relationship-orientated, emotional or empathic approach (never mind about non-binary people, queers, etc.). This is usually shown as something that’s unchangeable; something written down by genetics and made clear by the way our brains differ so much from each other. Also, some (if not most) of these books claim that that’s what also causes traditional gender roles – women are simply better suited for housework, and men better suited for business. Often, this is also where an evolutionary argument about caves, hunting, and gathering comes in.Unfortunately, the tendency to display such dated, sexist views isn’t only found in pseudoscientific writers (an example being the ever annoying book always present in every single bookstore I visit, Men Are from Mars Women Are from Venus by John Gray), but also in qualified scientists or psychologists: The Female Brain by Louann Brizendine, being a great example, or The Sexual Paradox: Extreme Men Gifted Women and the Real Gender Gap by Susan Pinker. Though I can’t deny the big influence popular ‘science’ books have on the general reading audience, as an aspiring psychologist myself, the fact that qualified psychologists spew this kind of garbage worries me intensely.Which is why I’m quite glad to have found this wonderfully well-researched book by Cordelia Fine, in which she attempts to refute many claims made by popular psychology books concerning traditional gender roles/behaviour, and differences between the sexes. Does she succeed? In my opinion, yes, and she does so with humour, solid arguments, and a critical approach. I really enjoyed the fact that she doesn’t only bring up arguments to counter interpretations and results of research used in the aforementioned popular psychology books, but she also attacks the way certain methods of research are used and interpreted (case in point: neuroimaging).A very complete, interesting, witty, and fun read. I commend Cordelia Fine for writing such a wonderfully clear answer to the dated views on the differences between the sexes, and emphasizing the importance of valid research (and the interpretation of it). I can definitely recommend this to anyone who’s interested in reading more about gender roles/behaviour."
192,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7300053-nicole-ysabet,5,"This book was a cogent, readable rebuttal to all the pop-psychology, pseudoscientific nonsense published about how alleged differences between men and women make men thuggish morons who can't wash a dish and women lightheaded bimbos incapable of understanding math. It made me want to do a dance of joy. Also, when talking about neuroimaging experiments which supposedly prove these ""hardwired"" differences, Cordelia Fine wrote this paragraph:[...] When looking for changes in blood flow between two conditions, researchers search in thousands of tiny sections of the brain (called voxels), and many researchers are now arguing that the threshold commonly set for declaring that a difference is ""significant"" just isn't high enough. To illustrate this point, some researchers recently scanned an Atlantic salmon while showing it emotionally charged photographs. The salmon--which, by the way, ""was not alive at the time of scanning""--was ""asked to determine what emotion the individual in the photo must have been experiencing."" Using standard statistical procedures, they found significant brain activity in one small region of the dead fish's brain while it performed the empathizing task, compared with brain activity during ""rest."" The researchers conclude not that this particular region of the brain is involved in postmortem piscine empathizing, but that the kind of statistical thresholds commonly used in neuroimaging studies [...] are inadequate because they allow too many spurious results through the net.If that doesn't make you want to read at least a little more, I have no idea how to talk to you."
193,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5763962-cara-pulley,5,"We like to believe that sexism is on the decline, but is it really? This author doesn't think so and after reading her book, I'm convinced.She says that gender distinctions continue to exist and that they start from our very beginnings - pink is for girls, blue is for boys. Gender comes to define us and these distinctions shape our abilities and interests. Certain skills are identified as male or female: Men are rational and brave; and Women are empathetic and nurturing. These assumed traits then impact our adult lives and the choices we make such as what fields to study in college, and what careers to pursue afterwards.Most alarming to the author is that the new fancy pants field of neuroscience observes physical differences in the brain between men and women and they are using those results to explain pre-conceived notions about the abilities of men vs. women instead of considering the impact of outside social forces. To create a causal relationship where none exists is to eliminate a possible true explanation before it is ever considered.A thought provoking book."

Fine looks at gender essentialism and at the biases of studies and media reporting, and suggests that we've been too quick to throw up our hands and say, ""but it's biological!"" If little girls have only been wearing pink for fifty years, then clearly that can't be a hard-wired preference.As a woman who preferred baby blue to pink for my childhood frilly dresses, liked to play with my brother's trucks and robots as well as my own stuffed animals (dolls are creepy and as for the toy . . . ironing board?!!! . . . I was given, the less said the better), and whose index finger is shorter than her ring finger, but who grew up to be much better at language than math (but my mom was great at math) and is more empathetic than competitive, I've always found these gender assumptions questionable, as I seem to be all over the board. Fine, writing for a popular audience, sometimes seems to skim the surface, but her work is clear, logical, and sometimes pleasantly snarky."

It always irks me if people want to use scientific publications to justify stuff like this. Not because I'd prefer them not to be true, but because I'm only too aware that making it through peer review isn't a good indicator about how well done the experiments were. Just ask Rosie Redfield and her successful push against the stupid arsenic life-stuff. Many different studies are discussed in some detail and lots of flaws in those studies are shown: lack of controls and/or statistical power, multiple testing, the general problems of fMRI, alternative explanations fitting the data as well or even better etc. Recommended for: everyone who likes to see overselling scientific claims destroyed, people who want to disarm the arguments of those who believe in inherent gender differences.

201,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25360918-blair,2,"Are Men Systemisers and Women Empathisers?We all know that men are from Mars and women are from Venus, right? There is much in current popular literature suggesting gender differences are innate, therefore we should adapt to them. This book treats us to even more of this kind of thinking found in the older literature, which looks absurd to modern eyes. The author asks if the modern stuff is really much different. She has two main points: Neuroscience is not nearly advanced enough to reach any conclusions that link brain structure to behaviour. And it is difficult to distinguish between genetic and culturally acquired characteristics from observing society, because there are so many confounding factors and sources of bias. So what is all this recent writing really based on?Things Don’t Seem So Bad in My BubbleI appear to live in a bubble. The reports I read about sexual discrimination and harassment are shocking, and do not reflect my personal experience. I realize that my brain’s shrivelled left hemisphere renders me oblivious to any social interaction that is not blindingly obvious, but I am married to a successful female senior manager. We even talk sometimes (when she makes me). I don’t hear much about discrimination, while I do hear about a lot else. And there are plenty of women in senior positions where she works. But society is not uniform, and large parts of it are clearly very different from where I stand.Beyond Reason: Why I Would See it That WayWhy is gender stereotyping so persistent when many of us claim to have moved beyond that? She tells us,
“One can be reflective about explicitly held (rational) knowledge, and it may be reasonably consistent. However, associative knowledge seems to be fairly indiscriminate about what it takes on board. So you may not be consciously sexist, yet sexist patterns you have unconsciously picked up may assert themselves.”
Our unconscious attitudes are learned when we are young, and they are learned from the behaviour one sees, not the words our parents or schools use to tell us how they think we should be. Now in our daily lives our choices are made instinctively, and the rational mind finds a justification that is not sexist. Thus gender discrimination is perpetuated without us even knowing or wanting to do it.As a male systemiser, I have done the job expected of me. I will now get in touch with my feminine side and talk about personal experience. Yes, personal anecdotes do not add up to data, but apparently there is no worthwhile data anyway, so why not?The Geek SpeaksI spent my career writing software, so the following got my attention:
“What, for example, springs to mind when you think of a computer scientist? A man, of course, but not just any man. You’re probably thinking of the sort of man who would not be an asset at a tea party. The sort of man who leaves a trail of soft-drink cans, junk-food wrappers, and tech magazines behind him as he makes his way to the sofa to watch Star Trek for the hundredth time.”
I went to a university that did not yet have a computer science department. A few friends and myself invented our own. We failed the courses we were supposed to be taking because we spent all day playing on the computers we hacked into. Need I mention that none of us were women?The reason has nothing to do with junk-food wrappers, or that the female devotes too much of her brain to emotion processing to write code. It is more about obsession. We males may or may not be better systemisers, but we are more willing to blow an entire school year to spend all day systemising about one thing. What, women can’t afford to take risks like that? Don’t be silly, they can always get married and have babies if things don’t work out. Or they can switch into social sciences, and get an easy degree doing sloppy research that verifies pre-existing beliefs. Our author delights in presenting examples of that. Oh, that was typically insensitive of me. My oxytocin levels must be low again.The only hint of truth in her paragraph is the lack of social skills of many of us in the industry. Combine obsession with that lack of social skills, and one suspects the presence of a few autism-linked genes in the crowd. But I am sure Ms. Fine can cherry-pick a few flawed autism studies to demolish that notion.One can argue that these different attitudes are entirely socially constructed. But it is also possible that something real is being socially reinforced. There is some evidence, especially from identical twin studies, which link personal characteristics to genetics. It is hard to believe that there is no sex linkage involved. It is easy to mock jumping to evolutionary conclusions about math skills or preferring pink to blue. But the human species does have a long history with a gender devoted to hunting and warfare. Add in the fact that males are expendable, and a genetic inclination toward risk taking does seem somewhat credible. Obsession may have been selected for similar reasons. Those autism genes must be there for a reason. You know, men have to focus on their hunting, while the women multitask feeding the baby while inventing agriculture, food storage and other requirements for civilization.Oops, I have slipped back into systemising again. It must be the lack of connection between my hippocampus and cerebral cortex.Empathising Has Its RewardsThere were not many female programmers where I worked, and they did not last long. They get promoted into management. Oh, the discrimination! The gender distribution at my company was interesting. As one might expect, the programmers were generally male and the quality control people were female. Were women excluded from the more creative jobs because of their sex? Perhaps the difference is that while I would think about work when I got home, they were thinking about home while they were at work. A more demanding job gets in the way. And if that is because of social conditioning, it is hardly the fault of corporate management.The other female “ghetto” at our company was in program management. This critical senior position requires both strong technical knowledge and excellent social skills to deal with our external clients. It was mainly women who had the magic to pull it off. (I suppose that more developed inferior parietal lobe makes all the difference.) The consequences of gender stereotyping, legitimate or not, can cut both ways.I lost my job there because I did not step up into a more collaborative role. I was lucky to last as long as I did happily coding away. Industry is changing, communicating and collaborating across boundaries is becoming ever more important. My stereotypical mind sees these as female qualities, but does it matter? Any company that discriminates against women is suicidal, because it needs those skills. But then, a lot of companies are slowly committing suicide. I suspect there may be a connection here.Social Skills in the Strip ClubsApparently there is an increasing tendency to use strip clubs for conducting business. Ms. Fine documents this and concludes,
“In effect, just as their fathers might have taken clients to one of the gentlemen’s clubs of Pall Mall, so brokers today take their business associates to see lap dancers. The old gentlemen’s clubs banned women – some still do – whereas the lap-dancing establishments merely intimidate them.”
My emotional reaction (yes, I do have them) is anger and disgust. Gentlemen’s clubs, for all their faults, at least had some class. Strip clubs are for scum. Reducing men to scum to preserve their pathetic privileges is beneath contempt.I can’t help wondering if some of those men are not entirely comfortable with what is going on, but feel they have little choice. It looks like nothing has changed – the bullies are still in charge.Geeks like me tend to go to Star Trek conventions rather than strip clubs, if they go anywhere at all. (I go to a book club.) We also cannot help noticing that the more sexist the man, the more women are attracted to him. (They appeal to her associative memory rather than her reason, which should know better.) Bullies get what they want. Sexism is a social skill, and one that is well rewarded. But I suspect some of these organizations are going to bully themselves into bankruptcy because they can’t keep up with a changing world. It can’t come soon enough.But there is another explanation for this behaviour: the men have been desensitized to sexual stimulation by constant exposure to pornography. For some reason Fine chooses to completely ignore this issue. So tell me, which affects men’s attitudes toward women: a dubious book by Louann Brizendine or twenty hours a week of hard-core degrading pornography?Second ThoughtsThis conclusion is being written a several weeks after the rest of the review. What I wrote above is essentially an emotional response to the book. Now the emotion has worn off, I will treat this book as the scientific work it claims to be.The material about how women are limited by social conditioning and outright repression, while socially important, leads to only one scientific insight: we cannot judge the potential of women by their present level of achievement. That is all. But it does serve to soften up the reader for her message. It worked on me.The book may serve as a needed corrective for some of the simplistic stereotyping in the name of science out there. But is it also guilty of similar distortion in pursuit of an agenda that claims gender differences are a social construction? In other words, is this simply the other side in a culture war being fought using science as the battleground?That culture war has been raging for hundreds of years. Conservatives claim human nature is fixed, and we dare not change the ancient wisdom that keeps our impulses contained. Liberals contend that the mind is a blank slate, and humanity is perfectible with the right thinking and social intervention. I suspect those of you who like this book are really cheering that our side is beating up their side, like in a sporting event. And she is administering quite a beating. But this is an empirical question, not a matter of opinion. If you don’t understand the science, how can you possibly know if the scientific arguments here are valid?I don’t know much about neuroscience either, but I detect a number of serious warning signs pointing to a lack of objectivity. Despite the cheery tone, this book mainly consists of an unrelenting attack on any viewpoint that suggests gender differences are innate. It is hard to tell when she is criticizing scientific studies or amateur opinion, which has the effect of implying that the dumbest ideas are also the opinions of any scientists she is opposed to. This kind of polarization has no place in science. A look at the author’s publication list shows mainly commentaries rather than research, mainly aimed at a popular audience. This looks more like a campaigner rather than a scientist.Good science writing shows a passion for understanding the subject and a desire to explain it to the reader. There is none of that here. Instead, explanations are presented only as necessary for the reader to understand the words in her debunking effort. She overwhelms the reader with the sheer volume of scientific information. But volume does not add up to truth if that information is selective.I do not know to what degree gender differences are innate. Who knows, maybe our author has it mostly right. I simply cannot not trust this work to tell me that. Even when she tells me that neuroscience is not advanced enough to draw conclusions about gender, my response is that seems reasonable, but I will look elsewhere to find out. [A quick look suggests she is wrong.]This book is a great reminder that there is a lot of bad science writing out there. Unfortunately it is also a good example of that, yet another example of science corrupted by ideology."
202,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4973578-iset,5,"You've probably heard that men are just naturally better at spatial awareness and logical tasks whilst women are just naturally better at verbal and nurturing tasks. You've probably heard that men and women's brains are different. You may even have heard exasperated parents trying out gender neutral parenting exclaiming that their little girl/boy just seems to naturally gravitate towards pink dolls/blue trucks - it must be biological! Delusions of Gender debunks it all, delving into the real science behind these spurious claims.The book is divided into three sections. First, the sociological and psychological studies of gender differences. How are we to explain, for example, the fact that men seem to consistently do well in maths and women in verbal reasoning? It turns out - quite easily. The notion that men are better at certain things and women are better at other things is an entrenched stereotype. Consistently, in a scientific testing environment, when groups are primed before the test to buy into these stereotypes, they conform to cultural and societal demands of their gender - but when the groups are primed beforehand with a statement that no gender differences have ever been found, then both men and women defy the stereotypes and perform better even than the other gender at tasks that their own gender is supposedly bad at. This result bears out over countless tests, and reveals that when a categorised group is placed under 'stereotype threat', the distracting negative thinking that results significantly impacts on their performance in a given task - conversely, when the group is relaxed and not under threat, their true abilities are freed. There's more. When asked to self-report about how analytical/empathising they are, men and women will report that they fall into the stereotypes about their gender. However, when rigorous scientific is set up - for example, unwittingly recording two individuals in a room, after the fact asking one to note down their thoughts as they watch back the video, and then asking the other to guess what the first was thinking; both men and women show the same amount of ability to read people's faces and intuit their emotional state. In other words, self-reporting is unreliable as a true test of gender differences, and many tests claiming to prove a difference are unscientific, inadvertantly priming the subjects beforehand to perform according to existing social pressures.Okay, so social pressure is affecting people. But what about all that medical evidence that men and women's brains are different? It's actually very flimsy. Testosterone testing of babies in utero is not actually done by testing the baby's blood - but by testing the mother's blood, or the amniotic content. There are significant problems with several of the studies involving scanning the brains of adults - such as some studies only using female test subjects and not comparing against men in any way. Other studies are post-mortem. Several employ circular reasoning in their write ups to assert some sort of gender difference. ""But I've seen those different coloured scan images of male versus female brains on the internet!"" you may cry.
""It’s important to realise that the patches of colour you see on brain scans don’t actually show brain activity. Although it may seem as though fMRI and PET enable you to see a snapshot of the brain at work (or, as popular writers Allan and Barbara Pease claim, ‘to see your brain operating live on a television screen’), this simply isn’t the case. ‘Unfortunately, these pretty pictures hide the sausage factory’, as one neurologist put it. fMRI doesn’t measure neuronal activity directly. Instead, it uses a proxy: changes in blood oxygen levels. (PET uses a radioactive tracer isotope, which attaches itself to glucose or water molecules, to indirectly track blood flow.) Busier neurons need more oxygen and (after an initial dip) active brain regions have higher levels of oxygenated blood, because blood flow to that area increases. The oxygen is carried by the haemoglobin in red blood cells, and haemoglobin has slightly different magnetic qualities depending on how much oxygen it’s carrying. This creates a signal in the scanner (which pulses a magnetic field on and off). Neuroscientists then compare the difference in blood flow in brain regions during the task they’re interested in, with blood flow during a control task or rest state. (Ideally, the control task involves everything the experimental task entails – button pressing, word reading and so on – except for the psychological process you’re particularly interested in.) Researchers test for significant differences in blood flow in various locations of the brain regions during the two tasks, and if tests indicate that it is significant, a blob of colour is placed at the appropriate location on the picture of the brain. In other words, those coloured spots on the brain represent statistical significance at the end of several stages of complicated analysis – which means there’s plenty of scope for spurious findings of sex differences in neuroimaging research.""
Moreover, for every 1 neuroscience study claiming to find a difference between genders, there are 19 where both men and women were tested, no difference was discovered, and since the researcher's topic of interest was something other than gender differences the write up does not draw attention to the result - that no gender differences were found. The studies that do claim to find a difference also receive significantly more attention from people specifically looking for evidence to prove biological gender differences, and because the topic is so hot in our modern world.Alright, so neuroscience evidence is flimsy at best, and psychological testing of adults is unreliable unless performed with proper rigour. But what about children? Haven't there been tests of babies that show they prefer blue trucks/pink dolls? Unfortunately many of the tests claiming to prove such are also highly suspect. One study, for example, tested 3 month old male and female babies to see whether they preferred a Human face or a geometric mobile. Lo and behold, the male babies seemed to prefer the mobile, whilst female babies seemed to prefer the faces. Aha! But the face and the mobiles were presented to the babies separately, not simultaneously as is usual in such tests to truly determine if a baby prefers one thing over another - it's impossible therefore to say whether a preference was displayed. Furthermore, the researchers in the study knew what gender each baby they tested was, and there's reason to suspect they themselves may have been biasing the results by presenting a more friendly face to the female babies and moving the mobile around more with the male babies - creating the result they expected to see. Oh. Oh, indeed. More scientifically rigorous studies of babies' habits show that there is no difference in a six month old's preference between trucks and dolls - but this does kick in from around 9 months onwards. Is it nature asserting itself over nurture? Well, no. Another study tested whether babies truly do prefer a female face over a male one (i.e. testing whether we are biologically predisposed to think of women in a nurturing role). The babies seemed to prefer the female face - but all the babies in the first test group were being looked after primarily by their mothers. The test was repeated with babies who were being primarily raised by their fathers - those babies preferred male faces. Consistently, the results show environment over biology is the determining factor.The mother who had attempted gender neutral parenting only to wail; ""In the end I found her tucking the toy truck into bed and cuddling it! It must be biology!"" was asked by a shrewd researcher whether, in that household, one of the parents did most of the putting to bed - of course, it turned out the mother always put her daughter to bed. The fact of the matter is, even the most determined parents trying to employ gender neutral upbringing face an uphill struggle. Most actually bias the result, implicitly disapproving certain activities for their child despite outspokenly advocating them, and testing of children's reactions to words versus body language clearly demonstrates that they pick up on implict cues much more than verbal ones. Even with dedicated parents, the outside world is often intent on reinforcing gender roles, from multinational companies to the disapproving looks of less progressive parents. Gender is in fact the most strongly emphasised of any of the ways of categorising people, and children pick up on this from an exceptionally young age - it therefore becomes important for them to seek out clues about how to discover a person's gender and how to identify themselves, so they can fit in with a social group and be accepted - even when the parents at home are encouraging them to explore all kinds of play and activities.I'm going to conclude with the account of a couple who went the extra mile in their determination to raise their son and daughter in a truly gender neutral environment. Sandra and Daryl Bem, two psychologists;
""did all that they could to reduce the normally ubiquitous gender associations in their children’s environment: the information that lets children know what toys, behaviours, skills, personality traits, occupations, hobbies, responsibilities, clothing, hairstyles, accessories, colours, shapes, emotions and so on go with being male and female. This entailed, at its foundation, a meticulously managed commitment to equally shared parenting and household responsibilities. Trucks and dolls, needless to say, were offered with equal enthusiasm to both children; but also pink and blue clothing, and male and female playmates. Care was taken to make sure that the children saw men and women doing cross-gender jobs. By way of censorship, and the judicious use of editing, WhiteOut and marker pens, the Bems also ensured that the children’s bookshelves offered an egalitarian picture-book world... The second part of the Bems’ strategy was to, in place of the usual information about what it means to be male or female, promote the idea that the difference between males and females lies in their anatomy and reproductive functions. Your typical preschooler enjoys a detailed knowledge of gender roles, but remains a bit hazy regarding the hard, biological fact that males differ from females when it comes to the allocation of such items as penises, testicles and vaginas.'[O]ur son Jeremy, then age four, … decided to wear barrettes [hair slides] to nursery school. Several times that day, another little boy told Jeremy that he, Jeremy, must be a girl because ‘only girls wear barrettes.’ After trying to explain to this child that ‘wearing barrettes doesn’t matter’ and that ‘being a boy means having a penis and testicles,’ Jeremy finally pulled down his pants as a way of making his point more convincingly. The other child was not impressed. He simply said, ‘Everybody has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.’'Unlike their peers, Jeremy and Emily were discouraged from using socially determined trappings such as hairstyle, clothing, accessories or profession as a guide to a person’s biological sex. If the children asked whether someone was male or female, their parents ‘frequently denied certain knowledge of the person’s sex, emphasizing that without being able to see whether there was a penis or a vagina under the person’s clothes, [they] had no definitive information.’Step forward, please, all those parents who go to similar lengths to protect their children from acquiring prevailing cultural assumptions about gender. And do try to avoid being trampled in the rush. The Bems’ efforts, I think you’ll agree, seriously outclass what we normally, generously, think of as gender-neutral parenting... The intensity and scope of the Bems’ efforts offer a helpful hint as to just how gendered children’s environments are. To this day social structure, media and peers offer no shortage of information to children about masculinity and femininity.""

203,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"Delusions of Gender: The Real Science Behind Sex Differences by Cordelia Fine“Delusions of Gender” is an outstanding book that compels you to take a closer look at society and our science as it relates to gender issues. Academic psychologist and author, Dr. Cordelia Fine with a sharp sense of humor and an excellent grasp of what constitutes good science dismantles many claims of what can be considered neurosexism. This is a very provocative book as it tackles claims about male and female brains, and the gender cycle. This fascinating 371-page book is broken out into the following three parts: 1. Half-Changed World, Half-Changed Minds, 2. Neurosexism, and Recycling Gender.Positives:1. Engaging, witty, and provocative book. This is also a well-researched book that is not afraid to tackle head on popular misconceptions on gender.2. A fascinating and often misunderstood topic of sex differences.3. The science is accessible and the narrative flows nicely thanks to an infusion of humor. The book is also full of interesting anecdotes.4. Great use of counter-research to combat what Dr. Fine has concluded is poor science.5. One of the best features of this book is Dr. Fine’s relentless research against commonly held misconceptions by well-known scientists and authors. She makes a very compelling case against at best poor science or worst pseudoscience.6. Makes the very strong case on how society can impact associative memory. “Unlike explicitly held knowledge, where you can be reflective and picky about what you believe, associative memory seems to be fairly indiscriminate in what it takes on board. Most likely, it picks up and responds to cultural patterns in society, media and advertising, which may well be reinforcing implicit associations you don’t consciously endorse.” “When gender is salient in the environment, or we categories someone as male or female, gender stereotypes are automatically primed.”7. The impact of stereotypes. “Research suggests that the deadly combination of ‘knowing-and-being’ (women are bad at math and I am a woman) can lower performance expectations, as well as trigger performance anxiety and other negative emotions.”8. A look at mothers versus single women. “While parenthood served as no disadvantage at all to men, there was evidence of a substantial ‘motherhood penalty’. Mothers received only half as many callbacks as their identically qualified childless counterparts.”9. The reality of sexual harassment.10. Covers many issues regarding gender equality, including at home. “As Gloria Steinem recently reminded a journalist, “The idea of having it all never meant doing it all. Men are parents, too, and actually women will never be equal outside the home until men are equal inside the home.” Great quote.11. So are there biological roots to gender inequality? This is a recurring theme in the book.12. The reality is that there is a lot of poor science involving gender issues. “There’s something a little shocking about the discrepancy between the weakness of the scientific data on the one hand and the strength of the popular claims on the other.”13. A fascinating look at Neurosexism. “The sheer complexity of the brain makes interpreting and understanding the meaning of any sex differences we find in the brain a very difficult task.” “Neurosexism promotes damaging, limiting, potentially self-fulfilling stereotypes.”14. The file-drawer phenomenon. “This contributes to the so-called file-drawer phenomenon, whereby studies that do find sex differences get published, but those that don’t languish unpublished and unseen in a researcher’s file drawer.”15. Debunks myths with glee. “So let us, with healthy skepticism, summarize all of this as clearly as we can. Nonexistent sex differences in language lateralization, mediated by nonexistent sex differences in corpus callosum structure, are widely believed to explain nonexistent sex differences in language skills.” “The speculations of a few scientists quickly evolve into the colorful fabrications of popular neurosexism – the subspecialty within the larger discipline of neurononsense.”16. The four basic pieces of advice for anyone considering incorporating neuroscientific findings into a popular book or article about gender.17. One of the most astute observations of the books, too good not to share. “Genes don’t determine our brains (or our bodies), but they do constrain them. The developmental possibilities for an individual are neither infinitely malleable nor solely in the hands of the environment. But the insight that thinking, behavior and experiences change the brain, directly, or through changes in genetic activity, seems to strip the word ‘hardwiring’ of much useful meaning. As neurophysiologist Ruth Bleier put it over two decades ago, we should ‘view biology as potential, as capacity and not as static entity. Biology itself is socially influenced and defined; it changes and develops in interaction with and response to our minds and environment, as our behaviors do. Biology can be said to define possibilities but not determine them; it is never irrelevant but it is also not determinant.” Read that again, and again.18. A look at parenting. “It seems, then, that gender stereotypes, even if perhaps only implicitly held, affect parents’ behavior towards their babies.”19. Interesting facts that have an impact. “The Dr. Seuss books are rightly classics, adored by children and a joy of rediscovery for parents. Yet as Lamb and Brown observe, in all the forty-two books he wrote, not one has a female lead in its central story.”20. Copious amounts of notes and they are linked. A comprehensive bibliography.Negatives:1. Very little not to like about this excellent book but I would have probably started with defining the differences between key terms like sex and gender. The layperson tends to use these terms indiscriminately.2. The book does a phenomenal job of at the very least casting doubt or outright debunking commonly held misconceptions on gender issues; however, it doesn’t succeed nowhere near as well on defining the real science behind sex differences.3. Using scientific claims from centuries ago to debunk easily comes across as strawman arguments or low hanging fruits to grab on to.4. At times I feel she doesn’t necessarily apply the same amount of scrutiny to those studies that support her argument versus those that don’t. I prefer the instances where she simply states that we just don’t know.In summary, this was truly an eye opening and cognitive-dissonance inducing book. One of the great things I take from this book is to not fall prey to poor science and specifically, be alert of neurosexism. I’m not a neuroscience to know if all the conclusions that Dr. Fine makes are sound or not, but she is very persuasive and the book made me think. Witty, provocative and just fun to read, I highly recommend it!Further suggestions: “Science and Gender” by Ruth Bleier, “The Myths of Gender” and “Sexing the Body” by Gisela Kaplan, “Gene Worship” by Lesley Roger, “Sexual Science” by Cynthia Russett, and “The Social Psychology of Gender” by Laurie Rudman and Peter Glick. These books were recommended notably by the author."
204,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1917722-chy,4,"Okay, look. I'm rounding up from about a 3.3---yes, rounding up from that. It makes sense to me.There're a lot of dog-ears and underlines, but some of them are angry marks. I got very frustrated with about the middle two-fourths of it. The first fourth and the last fourth, I was much more interested in.The last fourth was what I thought the entire book was to be about---about how society and subtle clues train modern ""gender identity."" Because, dude, kids are sponges.The first one-fourth had some great lines and sentiments I agreed with, at their base. That is, perception is reality.The middle two-fourths? (Okay, I'd say, half, but it sounds wrong, since it's in the middle.) Yeah, that frustrated the ever-loving shit out of me. Because it seemed (to me, at least) she spent all that time leading up to making a point that I already knew. And I kept thinking, over an over, what she waited to say until the end of all that.And it just about killed me.Basically, I'm a fucking amateur, and I know that the way you live your life---your thought processes change the way your brain works. That is to say, nothing is hard-wired.Guess what; you spend your life obsessing over math, and the parts of your brain that deal with math are going to be larger than someone who's not obsessed with math, Einstein.So the fact that she laid it on thick, and laid on all this evidence, without just saying that until the end, just about killed me.Well, now, if she'd said it in the beginning of that section and went on, I would have had no problem. It just---it kept making me wonder if she was ever even going to point that out.And it drove me nuts.A mild frustration had nothing to do with her, but with a few of experiments they carried out. I mean, yeah, I was frustrated with the (sometimes) wild interpretations of some of them (as I was meant to be), but there were a few that hit me, personally. A few for which, all I could think, ""And then they had one more step to do."" Especially with the empathy tests. Oh, I could come up with such an awesome empathy test...There were even a couple of times that Fine really let me down. One, when she cited the behavior of rats to prove her point. And then, later, when rats didn't quite prove her point, she mentions how we really can't equate the behavior of rats to humans. It made me sad, because she had a point both times, but... Oof.Lots of good stuff, but a lot of frustration as well. And not nearly as much ""hard information"" as I was expecting. At least, not the kind I was expecting, because the kind of hard information I was looking forward to was only in the last quarter of the book. And there was not nearly as much of it as I had been hoping for. It barely went beyond what I already knew. It didn't challenge me the way I was hoping to be challenged.But enough of that. Let's end on my favorite line of the book. It has to do with the Bem children, who were raised as just about as ""gender nuetral"" as anyone could ever manage. The boy tells a classmante, "" 'being a boy means having a penis and testicles.' ""The boy who was critisizing him for wearing barrettes to nursery school comes back with, ""Everyone has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.""That right there made the whole book for me.Anyway, the point of the rating is not that I really liked it, but that I really like that it exists."
205,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,5,"I was really impressed with ‘Delusions of Gender’. It dissects and summarises research clearly, critiques stereotypes intelligently and analytically, and keeps the tone witty and readable yet more academic than journalistic. I found the synthesis of neuroscientific research on sex differences extremely helpful. Media articles that cheerfully claim sexist stereotypes are biological inevitabilities make me very angry. Fine channelled that same anger into writing an excellent rebuttal, which will be very useful to remember when the next wave of pseudo-scientific claims hit the papers.This book makes an excellent accompaniment to Living Dolls: The Return of Sexism, which focuses more on the societal implications of biological determinism-based sexism. It also brings up the important debate about applying scientific methodologies to research questions that are based on unquestioned stereotypes and assumptions. An example of this is the use of 'masculinity' as an objective index, like height and weight. As Fine states, including fMRI scans makes any research findings appear more weighty and scientific. Yet inferring major psychological differences between the sexes from disputed differences in brain structure is very problematic. The brain and the mind are not congruent. I’d also pick out for praise the latter chapters on young children learning about gender. That was not something I’d ever really thought about before, but of course kids observe how carefully adults sort people into the ‘man’ and ‘woman’ boxes. This part of the book includes amusing summaries of research investigating whether and/or why girls play more with ‘girl toys’ and boys with ‘boy toys’. I particularly liked the idea that some researchers made a My Little Pony into a desirable boy’s toy by painting it black, trimming its mane, and sharpening its teeth. Conversely, girls were ‘enchanted by… the lavender-satin-covered guns and holster, and the pink furred war helmet’. By the age of five, these children had picked up from their surrounding the sexual dimorphism of toys. As Fine points out, even clothes for newborns are gendered. She makes a strong argument for social over biological gender determinism.Apologies for eliding sex and gender in the paragraph above. Fine does not critique the gender binary or cover intersectionality issues in much depth, as these are not the focus of her book. Neither are they ever mentioned (that I’ve seen) by media articles that oversimplify and distort neuroscience to excuse sexism. Nonetheless, similar effects (regarding ‘stereotype threat’ for example) are noted to impact on women and ethnic minorities in the earlier chapters covering sociological research. There’s clearly a lot more work needed in the fields of sociology and neuroscience, but I agree with Fine that scientists have a responsibility to consider their unwitting assumptions about gender. As well as the ways in which their findings will be treated by a depressingly sexist media."
206,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie,4,"All those studies that say that women are bad at math and men are bad at relationships because their brains are hardwired that way can be very discouraging, and there are a LOT of those studies. But Cordelia Fine has looked into those studies and found flaws in them. Add into that a large number of studies that show how easy it is to jigger people’s minds into doing better or worse at tasks depending on how they are psychologically primed before hand and we can see where the author is coming from. Fine’s thesis is rather than there being any physical difference between male and female brains, the differences that we see in math scores are there because our culture expects them to be there. Even when people attempt to raise their children in a gender neutral environment, culture intervenes. On TV, in schools, in children’s books, in the clothing sold to children- everything is divided into genders, and females end up less adventuresome, more nurturing, expected to be nicer and not fight, and to focus on home and caring rather than invented and discovering. Toys for girls and boys are separated, and children who choose to play with toys for the opposite gender are disapproved of, especially boys who play with dolls or other ‘girl’ toys. Tomboys may be told to act more ladylike, but boys will get beat up by other boys. The core of her argument is that studies where test takers are primed to consider themselves members of sets other than gender yield different results than tests taken when the test takers are told things like “men traditionally do better on this test”. For instance, when a group of males and females take a test and are told before hand that people who go to certain colleges (colleges that some of the test takers go to) do better on this same test, the test takers conform to this and the males and females who belong to the colleges mentioned both do better on the test than the non-certain collegians- and the males and females in that group score the same as each other on the test under these conditions. These tests have been done numerous times by different researchers, and the results are always the same- the test takers conform to expectations set up before the test. Therefore, psychology trumps brain structure where intellectual subjects are concerned. It’s an interesting proposition, and one I think needs to be investigated more- much more. There’s a lot still to be untangled in gender studies. Intellectual abilities are jumbled in with emotional tendencies, and I definitely think they should be considered separately. She pretty much ignores the effect of hormones on emotional states except for the case of fetal testosterone. I think that while this book doesn’t settle any gender issue questions, it does cast a lot of doubt on previous studies and urges us to look at them much harder."
207,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237879-elaine-nelson,5,"I happened to run across this book at the library having forgotten that it was in my ""to-read"" list. I'm SO glad I did, and given a certain pair of somewhat ranty posts a couple of months back, only wish I'd read it sooner! I literally could not put it down - as in: ""no really, I need to go to bed/back to my desk from lunch/off the bus, I have to put the book away.""In short, social construction of gender: you're soaking in it. (And especially, your brain is soaking in it.)1) Priming & stereotype threat affect everything. Just checking gender on a form before taking a test changes womens' performance, especially on math tests. More priming (being told that the test relates to gender, watching a gender-stereotyped commercial, etc) increases the effect.2) Most of the ""science"" as it's filtered through to the popular media is a disaster of half-baked assumptions, small and/or poorly-constructed experiments, and willful misunderstanding of the actual results. (She tears apart one popular writer; it's kinda fun.)3) Worse, those lame results create a feedback loop, combined with the impossibility of gender-neutral child-rearing, that increases the problem of stereotype threat, and makes genuine social change more difficult.Le sigh. Not only is the feminist struggle not over, we may actually be hitting a really hard spot.On the plus side, I'm fired up now. Not just that, but I'm thinking more about my own personal construction of gender identity, including my history with math and science. There's a post I wrote about my life with math a while back, and there I wrote about it as a choice between writing and math - now I'm seriously looking back and wondering about the effect of gender stereotypes, and whether I might have come to computing sooner given different circumstances. I think it's worth noticing that choices exist in a constrained environment, constrained both by the external world, and by our own unexamined or incompletely-formed attitudes.As for the writing style, it's a delightful read. She's got a sharp conversational tone that pulled me in; I even read the footnotes.HIGHLY recommended, great in combination with Pink Brain Blue Brain."
208,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5324619-noor,5,"""Delusions of Gender"" has proved to be one of the most informative and interesting books I've read this year. The book consists of three parts that essentially discuss gender-stereotypes, Neurosexism, and the struggles of attempting to raise children in a gender-neutral environment.Cordelia starts by explaining how implicit and explicit beliefs are two separate things that don't always correlate. Despite ""consciously"" holding certain beliefs, there is a clash between the reflective self and our associative memory which is heavily influenced by the social environment surrounding us. When gender becomes salient and constantly primed in our daily life, it seeps into our perception of others and of ourselves, and we often do it in stereotypical ways. The book is filled with numerous experiments that support this idea. When we categorise people as male or female, we are instantly activating gender associations that affect our behaviour, values, performance etc. A perfect manifestation of this activated gender-inequality is how women are treated in a workplace dominated by men. Women experience segregation, exclusion, harassment and attack just by showing up to work basically.The second part of the book focuses on neurosexism and was the most difficult for me to digest; simply because I was unaware of just how much these popular neuroscientific claims are based on shaky empirical evidence. Gender stereotypes are legitimised by these pseudo-scientific explanations, and often become part of popular media. Neurosexism activates gender stereotypes which feeds into the public sphere + affects attitudes, identity & performance. It all leads us to become our own self-fulfilling prophecies.And the last bit of the book should be read by all parents who try to raise their children in a gender-neutral environment. It goes way beyond giving boys barbie dolls and giving girls fire trucks.All in all, this was an eye-opener for me when it comes to neuroscience and how it's used to reinforce old-fashioned stereotypes/roles through covering them with the finery of science.PS: Cordelia is quite witty. Found myself laughing out loud at times."
209,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4508080-julie-bozza,5,"A bit of a hard slog to read, especially as the few moments of humour didn't really suit me (too sarcastic). However, the important thing is that Fine makes vital headway towards an understanding of gender that I can really get behind. Gender difference is not 'hardwired' into us, and Fine deftly demolishes the pseudo-science that tells us otherwise. Fine quotes Kimmel in asserting 'gender difference is the product of gender inequality'; that is, we create and recreate gender difference while interacting with our society. The process begins at such an early age that many new parents, no matter how gender-neutral they try to be, end up assuming that gender difference is biologically or neurologically innate in their children. Fine does a good job of explaining why this happens, and how it will ultimately be worth it if we keep plugging away the gender-neutral objective. Fine also articulates how permeable the boundaries can be between our own sense of self and society's sense of who we are - or should be. I've struggled to articulate my struggles with this, but I've often felt like an asymmetrical heptagonal peg who is nevertheless forced (by otherwise well-meaning folk) to fit into the round hole that society makes available to me. Gender is certainly one aspect of this. My social sciences tutor told me I was making too much of the external forces - but now I've found Fine to back me up and explore the implications, and I feel inordinately grateful. Lastly, Fine ends with a note of hope. While she has shown how deeply woven gender difference (and hence gender inequality) is in our society, she has also shown that it is malleable. We can change this, though it will take time and effort. Let's keep trying! I would love to see what we can become when we are so much freer to be ourselves, whoever we may be."
210,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Subtitle: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference. Cordelia Fine, while an apparently well-read and quite competent scientist, makes no pretense of objectivity in this book. She's got an axe to grind with a whole school of research that aims to use modern brain science to convince us that male and female brains are intrinsically, fundamentally, and irrevocably different. Oh, and I also think the picture of her on the dust jacket is pretty hot. I just love imagining her getting all worked up about this. Wait, did I say that out loud?Anyway, Fine's point is best illustrated by an anecdote from the experience of a four year old named Jeremy, who had been raised by parents who were extraordinarily zealous gender-neutral parents. He decided one day to wear barrettes to nursery school, and gets into an argument with another boy, who says that he is a girl. Finally, Jeremy pulls down his pants and points out that he has a penis, as a way of making his point. The other boy says, “Everybody has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.”Whether you think the parents who let their boy wear barrettes to school were weird here, or the society that teaches a boy that the difference between male and female has more to do with hairstyle than genitals, depends on your opinions about gender (and society) generally. So does a lot of other (less amusing but more substantial) evidence, published in scientific journals or mainstream media, that Fine takes us on a tour of.Some of it is related to the general fallacy of all brain-scan evidence. Just because we see a difference in brain activity (using MRI or some other method), doesn't mean it's genetic or otherwise hardwired. All it shows is that it happens in the brain, and really, if we're talking about thoughts, attitudes, emotions, and so forth, where else would we expect it to happen? Also, like muscles, areas of the brain can grow larger or smaller over time as they are used more or less (whether for cultural reasons or any other), so again evidence from brain scans, while perhaps useful for other purposes, tells us nothing about whether differences in behavior are primarily biological or cultural. Seeing a brain scan, however, tells us that it has something to do with biology, and our instinctive reaction is still to divide things into biological and cultural, and if it's one it must not be the other.There is a long and well-documented history of scientific attempts to explain to us why women and men are Just Different, in ways that have nothing (directly) to do with procreation. The suspicious thing is that, while the rationales differ from decade to decade and from one century to the next, the conclusions always point in the same direction. Fine takes us on a thoroughly readable tour of this history, spiced up a bit by her, at times, barely contained rage.Make no mistake, this is not an even-handed weighing of the evidence; it is rather a very well-documented and data-driven polemic. If it were written by a man, I'd say that the confrontational and science-oriented analysis is very typical of a masculine style. Instead, I'll say it's an emotional treatment, showing a feminine inability to maintain objectivity on scientific topics. Either way, it's a hoot to read."
211,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6537005-daniel,3,"""Delusions of Gender"" is an engaging read, well-written and incisive. Cordelia Fine makes a convincing argument that gender differences in performance assessed through various metrics are to a large extent the result of social cues, reactions to internalized stereotypes, and unconscious priming. Her critique of studies of gender differences in psychological experiments is comprehensive, and her depiction of the current state of sexism is both convincing and often horrifying.Unfortunately, her fixation on discrediting both contemporary pop-psychology books selling innate gender differences and the arguments of dusty sexists from centuries past comes off a bit like clubbing baby seals (or possibly arm-wrestling five-year-olds). Her arguments against current neuroscientific techniques--especially neuroimaging using techniques like fMRI--fall particularly flat, as she relies repeatedly upon equating sophisticated real-time 3d measurements of blood-flow in the brain with crude volumetric measurements of skull capacity used by those sexist scientists of yore. This is trite and annoying.Likewise, she fails to engage biological and evolutionary arguments in any meaningful sense, instead relying on the tired allegation that evolutionary psychology and biology are only sexist justifications for relegating women to lives of domestic drudgery. She perhaps hopes that her readers are not savvy enough to Wikipedia the fields. Her argument that structural differences between the brains of men and women (after criticizing imaging and anatomical studies, she grudgingly admits that these do exist) compensate for differences in physiology to produce similar behaviors in males and females is interesting and may even be true to some extent--humans male and female, after all, must accomplish many of the same tasks to survive--but is unsupported and feels like hand-waving. She does not engage with the concepts of hormonal modulation of brain activity or neurotransmitter/receptor distribution and prevalence to any great degree. She brushes off the striking possibility that biological differences may predispose men and women toward different goals irrespective of nebulous measures of aptitude or spurious notions of ""natural gender roles."" The human brain she seems to prefer is the black box too intricate to be understood on a mechanistic level, a network of abstract associations accessible only to psychologists distributing questionnaires and bubble sheets to college students participating in studies for course credit.So, while entertaining (and perhaps convincing to audiences disinclined to read it critically or who already embrace its ideological underpinnings), the book's thesis does not strike home, and Fine's claim that it is dangerous for researchers to ask these questions at all should be disturbing to any reader who values science over ideology."

213,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley,3,"I tried to read this book near the beginning of quarantine, in hard copy, and my poor overloaded brain just couldn't handle it. If I had read this in audio, a format my brain can handle for serious subjects, I probably would have rated it much higher, and gotten through it much faster (and I'll be honest, retained more than 10% of it). So take this review with a grain of salt. (P.S. I just googled that phrase, and it evolved from something Pliny the Elder wrote in 77 A.D. Language is so weird.) I will be trying it again maybe in a couple of years by audio. Unless someone can point me in the direction of a book on the same subject that is more recent that I should read first (this was published in 2010).Aside from that issue, this book is also less of a thing on its own than it is the author debunking other scientific studies or books, things that people take as a given, or as ""proven"" by science. Cognitive bias plays a huge role not only in the behavior of test subjects, but in the minds of the scientists performing the studies. Which is enjoyable in its own way, but not quite what I was expecting. The book is very heavy on cautioning the reader about these types of studies, since gender is so hard to study, and really just instills a healthy amount of scientific skepticism. I remember it being a lot of, this isn't proven, we actually don't ""know"" as much as we think we do.I can't emphasize how much my brain did not retain any of the information I read, so this is really just a useless review. Judging by my friends' reviews on Goodreads, I just really need to give it a break, and then pick this up again some time down the road when my brain is being more amenable."

Honestly though, some male scientists... if you have to create and pursue patently absurd theories about differences in the brain to justify why you can't patiently listen to your wife or make your kids a sandwich, that's pretty undeniably pathetic.

I gobbled this non-fiction up like it was a light lunch after a hard day's manual labor. Every page was packed with jaw-dropping information - horrifying methodological flaws, research which argues two diametrically opposed concepts, and outright deception, all designed to prove that men and women are not and cannot possibly be equal. Like, here's one example: Fine mentions the author of a popular book on the subject, who cites research about ""mirror neurons,"" (women have more of them, which supposedly makes them more empathetic.) The author mentions a study of therapists which indicated that the most successful therapists are those that ""mirror"" their clients words, gestures, and verbal patterns. Interestingly, (says the author), ALL of the successful therapists were women. Because they have more mirror neurons, and are more attuned to others, right?WRONG. Cordelia Fine looked up the study (thank you, Cordelia! That would be a big nuisance for the Average Reader) and as it turns out? ALL OF THE THERAPISTS IN THE STUDY WERE WOMEN. Yeah, that's right. They only recruited women for the study, so the study proves absolutely nothing about men vs. women. And if you think this sort of thing is an anomaly, wrong again - Fine's detailed work found this sort of thing occurring over and over again. Moreover, Fine is terrific at highlighting how the social context of everything men and women do contributes to these gender stereotypes, and at explaining how gender bias affects the neuroscientific research. This is an absolutely fantastic book - I have the urge to acquire copies for every teacher, every employer, every parent on the planet. It made me rethink more of my life that I would have believed possible. Seriously, even if you think you would disagree with it: READ IT. If nothing else, you will enjoy Fine's smooth and witty prose."

If you’re the type of person who enjoys nitpicking underpowered studies over methodological errors that affect validity and throwing shade at poor referencing while also being a flagrant feminist this is for you. I am not sure how this would go down for other people without a background in neuroscience because those parts were undoubtedly my favorite although I see how that part of the book could be too technical and heavy. I didn’t learn anything new science-wise but I did discover that there still are some fucking assholes willing to forgo the science completely just in order to tell you that your female brain HAS TO KNOW HOW TO EMPATHIZE AND BE NURTURING and that of course those morons have a wide audience just dying for any shard of pseudo-evidence that may point to the fact that their daughters are meant to be breeding subservient cows and that their sons will bring about the rapture. Of course this book proves yet again the only truth known to humans besides inevitable death and that is that men are trash. Besides that, I wholeheartedly enjoyed the psychology aspects of the book and if I had any doubt about the ubiquity of gender then it was all erased in the last part where she lists study after study proving how the idea of gender and how everything is gendered almost from birth and how early toddlers take on these ideas and digest them almost regardless of how unisex parents attempt to make their environments at home; the world at large is sexist. Go figure. And then there’s the ever expanding body of evidence that simply makes it clear that women have always always always been just as capable as men and that as the gender gap closes (despite the screeching and howling of men) women find their ways into board room and ORs and mines and factories and fucking haters continue to come up with more sophisticated schemes of bullshit to make it seem like we can’t but we’re doing it anyway.

219,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14821636-andrew-fish,1,"The differences between men and women have probably been a topic of debate since the dawn of time. In recent decades, however, as society has progressed from subsistence and survival to consumerism and choice the issue has gained a degree of salience. The question of whether women are actively held down in their careers or whether they passively make decisions which close off paths to advancement becomes more than a curiosity when careers become both a means to achieve a better life and a source of fulfilment in themselves. And earlier in life, the science of gender difference could make a significant difference to educational outcomes if it could be robustly investigated. The time, it seems, is right for a good scientific look at the subject.Unfortunately, this isn't it.Fine is a psychologist by training, and whilst there's definitely scope to study the issue of gender difference through psychology, she seems reluctant to do this in any depth. The opening section of the book which nominally covers this ground is quite thin on actual studies and seems instead to rely heavily on anecdote, giving the book the feel more of a polemic rather than an academic assessment. What science there is, meanwhile, is treated in an uneven manner, promoting the studies which suit the central thesis and denigrating any which don't. Frequently, Fine goes beyond the studies and draws conclusions which aren't supported by any of the evidence she has presented.So, for example, when looking at a study about the effect of priming on women's mathematical abilities, she not only accepts the results without question, she positively crows about the fact that the women did better than the men without the priming. For this to be a valid observation, both male and female participants would have to have an even spread of intellect, presumably using some kind of test as part of the selection process. The trouble with this is that you are then pre-determining the results: if the selection test were gender-neutral, the gender-neutral part of the study would be consistent with the selection process and you would end up with roughly equal results for men and women. If the theory were correct, there would then be lower results for the women in the gender-biased part. If the selection process were not gender-neutral, meanwhile, then if the theory held the women would seem equal to the men in the selection process and better in the gender-neutral study itself.From those results you could prove that priming made a difference to the test results, but not that there was any inherent difference between male and female aptitude in itself. To go further would be circular reasoning (something Fine criticises about another study later in the book).It's like the constant claim that girls are better at school - fifty years ago, the reverse was claimed. What changed in between? The education system. Clearly there is some kind of difference between the sexes there (something Fine seems pathologically averse to) but if one system of education produced stronger male results and the other stronger female all you can say is that different methods favour the sexes differently - you can't claim this makes one superior to the other.In other places, such as the behaviour of women in male-dominated careers, it seems there are no studies Fine can draw on. By definition, you'd find it hard to create a female-dominated version of the same career for comparison, but it doesn't stop the author from coming to conclusions about the effect of those environments without anything beyond anecdote and hypothesis.The most detailed analysis in favour of her argument comes toward the end of the book, when looking at the gender stereotypes to which children are exposed in their early years and how this affects their choice of toys and sense of dress. Unfortunately, here she has narrowed the argument too much: it may be demonstrable that social forces drive boys to wear blue and girls pink, but this would hardly explain the more abstract alleged differences between the sexes. When was the last time your child came home claiming they'd been excluded from the spatial reasoning group on the basis of gender?With the results which don't suit her, the author is more exacting. When looking at a study about infant response to faces and mobile phones, for example, she casts aspersions on the methodology, hypothesises about all kinds of ways the results could have been skewed (always assuming such skews would be systematically biased in the same direction) and even implies that the experimenters could have been acting out of an unconscious gender bias themselves. Apart from the unprofessionalism of casting aspersions without evidence, it seems weak to subject a study you don't like to this level of criticism when it could have been equally true of any of the studies supporting the case. Stepping outside her field, Fine is dismissive of biological studies and applies an extremely shaky attack on neurology - regarding it as an inadequately direct proxy measure of brain activity that is subject to confirmation bias. If that's true of neurology, what it does it say about psychology as a reliable indicator? This attack allows her to dismiss any conclusions from the field she doesn't like, but again she's all too quick to accept any that she does. She constantly falls for the same fallacy, that if you can debunk a very specific prediction made by someone in a particular field, you can dismiss any evidence from that field when it doesn't suit your agenda. The constant comparisons to long-dismissed theories such as brain-pan measurement are a reductio ad absurdum argument with little logical validity and the quotes which open most chapters - generally over a century old and clearly not acceptable to modern readers - come across as an attempt to prime the reader into a form of indignation which switches off their reasoning faculties for the rest of the chapter and allows them to accept Fine's arguments without criticism. I even spotted a very old psychologists' trick - starting a sentence with ""by now you will all be thinking"" - which is a blatant attempt at manipulation of the reader.Here and there we find snippets of actual information - a chance remark about spatial reasoning differing in babies of only a few months old, for example - but unless they fit the central argument, they are passed over quickly. An anecdote about a woman having been masturbated over, by contrast, is alluded to several times across a chapter. And there's little gender-balance in the topics themselves either: apart from a brief mention of female intuition right at the beginning, the book focuses almost entirely on areas where women are alleged to be deficient. The impression given is that this is a book written by someone working out their own issues rather than dispassionately looking at the field.And this is often a problem with psychologists. Freud's obsession with mother fantasies reeked of projection, Kahneman's instinct over reason view of the brain suggests a man struggling to justify his own bad decisions. To see what Fine's problems are you need only look at the language she uses, the metaphors she chooses and the examples she latches onto. The book is riddled with misandistric metaphor and there are a number of coded attacks on her husband. Take the chapter where she envisages a hypothetical job-swap with her spouse. When looking at his ability to do her job, she attacks his literacy - comparing it to a ten year-old. She then looks at her ability to do his job, but rather than admit any limitation on her own part, she sidesteps the issue and instead turns it into another backhanded attack on her husband - in this case the likelihood of his nagging her from beyond the grave. It doesn't take a degree in psychology to spot the signs of an inferiority complex.I don't pretend to know what the biological basis for behaviour is, and I accept that there are a lot of bad studies out there and bad books using the results. But for a book whose byline is ""the real science behind gender difference"" I was expecting more than just a series of attacks. And it's a shame, because the issue is both interesting and important. In my opinion, there clearly are elements of behaviour that are inherited (how else would cuckoos transmit their parasitical tendencies?) but what that inheritance mechanism is and how far it reaches into human behaviour has, as far as I can see, yet to be established. To claim it has no effect on humans would be to think as those who attacked Darwin because whilst they could accept evolution, they felt that to claim humans were a product of evolution was a step too far. One science Fine didn't look at all is anthropology, which for anyone who is genuinely looking for the true reasons for gender difference would seem the obvious place to start. I suggest for those who are after a book which informs them rather than just gives them a reason to be angry at the state of the world, that would be a better field to explore."
220,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17161968-fergus-murray,5,"Delusions of Gender, by Cordelia Fine, is an extended critique of efforts to scientifically study differences between the sexes, and the efforts of many writers to apply alleged science in their writings about such differences. The book is rich in technical detail, which might bog down some readers, but most of those details are fascinating. Fine is a lucid and entertaining writer, especially in her more acerbic moments - of which there are plenty here. She finds a lot of shoddy science and shameless misuse of would-be science that would raise the hackles of any neuroscientist or feminist, let alone someone like her who happens to be both.This is a book with an agenda, and political agendas tend not to sit comfortably with science - but to pretend that politics never seeps into science while nobody is looking would be disingenuous. In fact, Fine's agenda - to bring out the reasons to doubt science that supposedly demonstrates innate differences between sexes - is at least as much scientific as political, and I think it is legitimate. It is something to bear in mind while reading this book, though, and there are times she goes out of her way to present things in such a way as to minimise the possibility of interpretation in terms of innate differences. As far as I can see she always stops short of misrepresenting the science, though, and the whole approach needs to be seen in the context of discourse which routinely takes essential differences for granted, whether the evidence supports them or not.The book is divided into three parts. The first is 'Half-changed World', Half-Changed Minds, which largely focuses on the interplay of cultural expectations and attempts to measure sex differences scientifically. This largely consists of accounts of experiments demonstrating the effects of cultural norms on things that people might be interested in measuring, and experiments which fail to take these factors into account. For example, she looks at experiments investigating the effect of telling the subjects what 'the latest science' has to say about the sorts of tests they are about to perform, to show that girls do significantly better on mathematical tasks if they think that science says they should. Even more subtly, females rate their mathematical ability as worse after they have just been reminded of their sex by having to tick a box at the beginning to say they are females. This gives us an interesting lens for looking at gender differences in maths tests which disregard the weight of cultural expectations, and indeed at systematic tendencies for females to choose less mathematical study and career paths. Having established many profound and subtle ways that social expectations and structures shape behaviours and perfomance, the theme of the second part of the book is Neurosexism - premature efforts to explain differences in behaviour and performance with reference to the brain, rather than society. Fine's most basic point is that it is rather soon to be looking for explanations of most of these things in neuroscience, when societal explanations have not been ruled out, and the relationship between the mind and the brain is still so unclear. More than that, she shows time and again that many authors are disturbingly willing to go way beyond what neurology can tell us, while pretending that they are not. Perhaps the single worst offender here is Louann Brizendine, author of The Female Brain, a serial abuser and inventor of neuroscience to back up her ideas about the differences between males and females - but she is one of many. Fine makes the point that people have been finding 'explanations' for sex differences in the brain for well over a century, from the observation that female brains tend to be a bit lighter than male ones through to modern notions of hardwiring. At the same time, people have routinely assumed that all kinds of observed differences between the sexes are natural and inevitable, when later experience has regularly shown them to be no such thing.The final section is titled Re-Cycling Gender, and it concerns itself with the future of gender relations and the science of sex. Fine is worried about the cyclical nature of some kinds of self-fulfilling prophecy - about dodgy science being used to teach yet another generation of young men and women that there are certain natural roles that they ought to be filling, certain characteristics they should expect to have. She emphasises again how difficult it is to pick apart innate and culturally conditioned differences, and the importance of keeping an open mind about questions that science has not yet been able to settle. With a better scientific understanding of the role of society in forming the mind and the brain, and a sceptical eye on the interesting but inconclusive findings of neuroscience, we may approach true sexual equality yet. Without such circumspection, as Fine argues, we may find ourselves sliding back to ideas about the sexes which are both unhelpful and ill-founded.This is an important book, because the trend towards explaining sex differences with impressive-sounding neurological findings has great potential to set back ideas about gender roles, on the basis of evidence which is far flimsier than it might look. Because we are shaped by our ideas, this has major practical, political ramifications - it is not just good science that is at stake here. There is no doubt that some will resist Fine's approach for its politicisation of science, but I would be inclined to see it more as exploring the role of pre-existing, unexamined political bias, rather than introducing politics to the debate. Delusions of Gender is compelling, informative and perhaps most impressively, funny. I recommend this highly to anyone with any interest in neuroscience or gender.'This review first appeared at http://everything2.com/title/Delusion..."
221,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11030012-jade,4,"There have always been many (pseudo)scientific books on the shelves attempting to explain the differences between the sexes, of which the most common differences usually consist of men having a more result-orientated, mathematical approach, and women having a more relationship-orientated, emotional or empathic approach (never mind about non-binary people, queers, etc.). This is usually shown as something that’s unchangeable; something written down by genetics and made clear by the way our brains differ so much from each other. Also, some (if not most) of these books claim that that’s what also causes traditional gender roles – women are simply better suited for housework, and men better suited for business. Often, this is also where an evolutionary argument about caves, hunting, and gathering comes in.Unfortunately, the tendency to display such dated, sexist views isn’t only found in pseudoscientific writers (an example being the ever annoying book always present in every single bookstore I visit, Men Are from Mars Women Are from Venus by John Gray), but also in qualified scientists or psychologists: The Female Brain by Louann Brizendine, being a great example, or The Sexual Paradox: Extreme Men Gifted Women and the Real Gender Gap by Susan Pinker. Though I can’t deny the big influence popular ‘science’ books have on the general reading audience, as an aspiring psychologist myself, the fact that qualified psychologists spew this kind of garbage worries me intensely.Which is why I’m quite glad to have found this wonderfully well-researched book by Cordelia Fine, in which she attempts to refute many claims made by popular psychology books concerning traditional gender roles/behaviour, and differences between the sexes. Does she succeed? In my opinion, yes, and she does so with humour, solid arguments, and a critical approach. I really enjoyed the fact that she doesn’t only bring up arguments to counter interpretations and results of research used in the aforementioned popular psychology books, but she also attacks the way certain methods of research are used and interpreted (case in point: neuroimaging).A very complete, interesting, witty, and fun read. I commend Cordelia Fine for writing such a wonderfully clear answer to the dated views on the differences between the sexes, and emphasizing the importance of valid research (and the interpretation of it). I can definitely recommend this to anyone who’s interested in reading more about gender roles/behaviour."

It made me want to do a dance of joy. Also, when talking about neuroimaging experiments which supposedly prove these ""hardwired"" differences, Cordelia Fine wrote this paragraph:[...] When looking for changes in blood flow between two conditions, researchers search in thousands of tiny sections of the brain (called voxels), and many researchers are now arguing that the threshold commonly set for declaring that a difference is ""significant"" just isn't high enough. To illustrate this point, some researchers recently scanned an Atlantic salmon while showing it emotionally charged photographs. The salmon--which, by the way, ""was not alive at the time of scanning""--was ""asked to determine what emotion the individual in the photo must have been experiencing."" Using standard statistical procedures, they found significant brain activity in one small region of the dead fish's brain while it performed the empathizing task, compared with brain activity during ""rest."" The researchers conclude not that this particular region of the brain is involved in postmortem piscine empathizing, but that the kind of statistical thresholds commonly used in neuroimaging studies [...] are inadequate because they allow too many spurious results through the net.If that doesn't make you want to read at least a little more, I have no idea how to talk to you."

This author doesn't think so and after reading her book, I'm convinced.She says that gender distinctions continue to exist and that they start from our very beginnings - pink is for girls, blue is for boys. Gender comes to define us and these distinctions shape our abilities and interests. Certain skills are identified as male or female: Men are rational and brave; and Women are empathetic and nurturing. These assumed traits then impact our adult lives and the choices we make such as what fields to study in college, and what careers to pursue afterwards.Most alarming to the author is that the new fancy pants field of neuroscience observes physical differences in the brain between men and women and they are using those results to explain pre-conceived notions about the abilities of men vs. women instead of considering the impact of outside social forces. To create a causal relationship where none exists is to eliminate a possible true explanation before it is ever considered.A thought provoking book."

Fine looks at gender essentialism and at the biases of studies and media reporting, and suggests that we've been too quick to throw up our hands and say, ""but it's biological!"" If little girls have only been wearing pink for fifty years, then clearly that can't be a hard-wired preference.As a woman who preferred baby blue to pink for my childhood frilly dresses, liked to play with my brother's trucks and robots as well as my own stuffed animals (dolls are creepy and as for the toy . . . ironing board?!!! . . . I was given, the less said the better), and whose index finger is shorter than her ring finger, but who grew up to be much better at language than math (but my mom was great at math) and is more empathetic than competitive, I've always found these gender assumptions questionable, as I seem to be all over the board. Fine, writing for a popular audience, sometimes seems to skim the surface, but her work is clear, logical, and sometimes pleasantly snarky."

It always irks me if people want to use scientific publications to justify stuff like this. Not because I'd prefer them not to be true, but because I'm only too aware that making it through peer review isn't a good indicator about how well done the experiments were. Just ask Rosie Redfield and her successful push against the stupid arsenic life-stuff. Many different studies are discussed in some detail and lots of flaws in those studies are shown: lack of controls and/or statistical power, multiple testing, the general problems of fMRI, alternative explanations fitting the data as well or even better etc. Recommended for: everyone who likes to see overselling scientific claims destroyed, people who want to disarm the arguments of those who believe in inherent gender differences.

231,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25360918-blair,2,"Are Men Systemisers and Women Empathisers?We all know that men are from Mars and women are from Venus, right? There is much in current popular literature suggesting gender differences are innate, therefore we should adapt to them. This book treats us to even more of this kind of thinking found in the older literature, which looks absurd to modern eyes. The author asks if the modern stuff is really much different. She has two main points: Neuroscience is not nearly advanced enough to reach any conclusions that link brain structure to behaviour. And it is difficult to distinguish between genetic and culturally acquired characteristics from observing society, because there are so many confounding factors and sources of bias. So what is all this recent writing really based on?Things Don’t Seem So Bad in My BubbleI appear to live in a bubble. The reports I read about sexual discrimination and harassment are shocking, and do not reflect my personal experience. I realize that my brain’s shrivelled left hemisphere renders me oblivious to any social interaction that is not blindingly obvious, but I am married to a successful female senior manager. We even talk sometimes (when she makes me). I don’t hear much about discrimination, while I do hear about a lot else. And there are plenty of women in senior positions where she works. But society is not uniform, and large parts of it are clearly very different from where I stand.Beyond Reason: Why I Would See it That WayWhy is gender stereotyping so persistent when many of us claim to have moved beyond that? She tells us,
“One can be reflective about explicitly held (rational) knowledge, and it may be reasonably consistent. However, associative knowledge seems to be fairly indiscriminate about what it takes on board. So you may not be consciously sexist, yet sexist patterns you have unconsciously picked up may assert themselves.”
Our unconscious attitudes are learned when we are young, and they are learned from the behaviour one sees, not the words our parents or schools use to tell us how they think we should be. Now in our daily lives our choices are made instinctively, and the rational mind finds a justification that is not sexist. Thus gender discrimination is perpetuated without us even knowing or wanting to do it.As a male systemiser, I have done the job expected of me. I will now get in touch with my feminine side and talk about personal experience. Yes, personal anecdotes do not add up to data, but apparently there is no worthwhile data anyway, so why not?The Geek SpeaksI spent my career writing software, so the following got my attention:
“What, for example, springs to mind when you think of a computer scientist? A man, of course, but not just any man. You’re probably thinking of the sort of man who would not be an asset at a tea party. The sort of man who leaves a trail of soft-drink cans, junk-food wrappers, and tech magazines behind him as he makes his way to the sofa to watch Star Trek for the hundredth time.”
I went to a university that did not yet have a computer science department. A few friends and myself invented our own. We failed the courses we were supposed to be taking because we spent all day playing on the computers we hacked into. Need I mention that none of us were women?The reason has nothing to do with junk-food wrappers, or that the female devotes too much of her brain to emotion processing to write code. It is more about obsession. We males may or may not be better systemisers, but we are more willing to blow an entire school year to spend all day systemising about one thing. What, women can’t afford to take risks like that? Don’t be silly, they can always get married and have babies if things don’t work out. Or they can switch into social sciences, and get an easy degree doing sloppy research that verifies pre-existing beliefs. Our author delights in presenting examples of that. Oh, that was typically insensitive of me. My oxytocin levels must be low again.The only hint of truth in her paragraph is the lack of social skills of many of us in the industry. Combine obsession with that lack of social skills, and one suspects the presence of a few autism-linked genes in the crowd. But I am sure Ms. Fine can cherry-pick a few flawed autism studies to demolish that notion.One can argue that these different attitudes are entirely socially constructed. But it is also possible that something real is being socially reinforced. There is some evidence, especially from identical twin studies, which link personal characteristics to genetics. It is hard to believe that there is no sex linkage involved. It is easy to mock jumping to evolutionary conclusions about math skills or preferring pink to blue. But the human species does have a long history with a gender devoted to hunting and warfare. Add in the fact that males are expendable, and a genetic inclination toward risk taking does seem somewhat credible. Obsession may have been selected for similar reasons. Those autism genes must be there for a reason. You know, men have to focus on their hunting, while the women multitask feeding the baby while inventing agriculture, food storage and other requirements for civilization.Oops, I have slipped back into systemising again. It must be the lack of connection between my hippocampus and cerebral cortex.Empathising Has Its RewardsThere were not many female programmers where I worked, and they did not last long. They get promoted into management. Oh, the discrimination! The gender distribution at my company was interesting. As one might expect, the programmers were generally male and the quality control people were female. Were women excluded from the more creative jobs because of their sex? Perhaps the difference is that while I would think about work when I got home, they were thinking about home while they were at work. A more demanding job gets in the way. And if that is because of social conditioning, it is hardly the fault of corporate management.The other female “ghetto” at our company was in program management. This critical senior position requires both strong technical knowledge and excellent social skills to deal with our external clients. It was mainly women who had the magic to pull it off. (I suppose that more developed inferior parietal lobe makes all the difference.) The consequences of gender stereotyping, legitimate or not, can cut both ways.I lost my job there because I did not step up into a more collaborative role. I was lucky to last as long as I did happily coding away. Industry is changing, communicating and collaborating across boundaries is becoming ever more important. My stereotypical mind sees these as female qualities, but does it matter? Any company that discriminates against women is suicidal, because it needs those skills. But then, a lot of companies are slowly committing suicide. I suspect there may be a connection here.Social Skills in the Strip ClubsApparently there is an increasing tendency to use strip clubs for conducting business. Ms. Fine documents this and concludes,
“In effect, just as their fathers might have taken clients to one of the gentlemen’s clubs of Pall Mall, so brokers today take their business associates to see lap dancers. The old gentlemen’s clubs banned women – some still do – whereas the lap-dancing establishments merely intimidate them.”
My emotional reaction (yes, I do have them) is anger and disgust. Gentlemen’s clubs, for all their faults, at least had some class. Strip clubs are for scum. Reducing men to scum to preserve their pathetic privileges is beneath contempt.I can’t help wondering if some of those men are not entirely comfortable with what is going on, but feel they have little choice. It looks like nothing has changed – the bullies are still in charge.Geeks like me tend to go to Star Trek conventions rather than strip clubs, if they go anywhere at all. (I go to a book club.) We also cannot help noticing that the more sexist the man, the more women are attracted to him. (They appeal to her associative memory rather than her reason, which should know better.) Bullies get what they want. Sexism is a social skill, and one that is well rewarded. But I suspect some of these organizations are going to bully themselves into bankruptcy because they can’t keep up with a changing world. It can’t come soon enough.But there is another explanation for this behaviour: the men have been desensitized to sexual stimulation by constant exposure to pornography. For some reason Fine chooses to completely ignore this issue. So tell me, which affects men’s attitudes toward women: a dubious book by Louann Brizendine or twenty hours a week of hard-core degrading pornography?Second ThoughtsThis conclusion is being written a several weeks after the rest of the review. What I wrote above is essentially an emotional response to the book. Now the emotion has worn off, I will treat this book as the scientific work it claims to be.The material about how women are limited by social conditioning and outright repression, while socially important, leads to only one scientific insight: we cannot judge the potential of women by their present level of achievement. That is all. But it does serve to soften up the reader for her message. It worked on me.The book may serve as a needed corrective for some of the simplistic stereotyping in the name of science out there. But is it also guilty of similar distortion in pursuit of an agenda that claims gender differences are a social construction? In other words, is this simply the other side in a culture war being fought using science as the battleground?That culture war has been raging for hundreds of years. Conservatives claim human nature is fixed, and we dare not change the ancient wisdom that keeps our impulses contained. Liberals contend that the mind is a blank slate, and humanity is perfectible with the right thinking and social intervention. I suspect those of you who like this book are really cheering that our side is beating up their side, like in a sporting event. And she is administering quite a beating. But this is an empirical question, not a matter of opinion. If you don’t understand the science, how can you possibly know if the scientific arguments here are valid?I don’t know much about neuroscience either, but I detect a number of serious warning signs pointing to a lack of objectivity. Despite the cheery tone, this book mainly consists of an unrelenting attack on any viewpoint that suggests gender differences are innate. It is hard to tell when she is criticizing scientific studies or amateur opinion, which has the effect of implying that the dumbest ideas are also the opinions of any scientists she is opposed to. This kind of polarization has no place in science. A look at the author’s publication list shows mainly commentaries rather than research, mainly aimed at a popular audience. This looks more like a campaigner rather than a scientist.Good science writing shows a passion for understanding the subject and a desire to explain it to the reader. There is none of that here. Instead, explanations are presented only as necessary for the reader to understand the words in her debunking effort. She overwhelms the reader with the sheer volume of scientific information. But volume does not add up to truth if that information is selective.I do not know to what degree gender differences are innate. Who knows, maybe our author has it mostly right. I simply cannot not trust this work to tell me that. Even when she tells me that neuroscience is not advanced enough to draw conclusions about gender, my response is that seems reasonable, but I will look elsewhere to find out. [A quick look suggests she is wrong.]This book is a great reminder that there is a lot of bad science writing out there. Unfortunately it is also a good example of that, yet another example of science corrupted by ideology."
232,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4973578-iset,5,"You've probably heard that men are just naturally better at spatial awareness and logical tasks whilst women are just naturally better at verbal and nurturing tasks. You've probably heard that men and women's brains are different. You may even have heard exasperated parents trying out gender neutral parenting exclaiming that their little girl/boy just seems to naturally gravitate towards pink dolls/blue trucks - it must be biological! Delusions of Gender debunks it all, delving into the real science behind these spurious claims.The book is divided into three sections. First, the sociological and psychological studies of gender differences. How are we to explain, for example, the fact that men seem to consistently do well in maths and women in verbal reasoning? It turns out - quite easily. The notion that men are better at certain things and women are better at other things is an entrenched stereotype. Consistently, in a scientific testing environment, when groups are primed before the test to buy into these stereotypes, they conform to cultural and societal demands of their gender - but when the groups are primed beforehand with a statement that no gender differences have ever been found, then both men and women defy the stereotypes and perform better even than the other gender at tasks that their own gender is supposedly bad at. This result bears out over countless tests, and reveals that when a categorised group is placed under 'stereotype threat', the distracting negative thinking that results significantly impacts on their performance in a given task - conversely, when the group is relaxed and not under threat, their true abilities are freed. There's more. When asked to self-report about how analytical/empathising they are, men and women will report that they fall into the stereotypes about their gender. However, when rigorous scientific is set up - for example, unwittingly recording two individuals in a room, after the fact asking one to note down their thoughts as they watch back the video, and then asking the other to guess what the first was thinking; both men and women show the same amount of ability to read people's faces and intuit their emotional state. In other words, self-reporting is unreliable as a true test of gender differences, and many tests claiming to prove a difference are unscientific, inadvertantly priming the subjects beforehand to perform according to existing social pressures.Okay, so social pressure is affecting people. But what about all that medical evidence that men and women's brains are different? It's actually very flimsy. Testosterone testing of babies in utero is not actually done by testing the baby's blood - but by testing the mother's blood, or the amniotic content. There are significant problems with several of the studies involving scanning the brains of adults - such as some studies only using female test subjects and not comparing against men in any way. Other studies are post-mortem. Several employ circular reasoning in their write ups to assert some sort of gender difference. ""But I've seen those different coloured scan images of male versus female brains on the internet!"" you may cry.
""It’s important to realise that the patches of colour you see on brain scans don’t actually show brain activity. Although it may seem as though fMRI and PET enable you to see a snapshot of the brain at work (or, as popular writers Allan and Barbara Pease claim, ‘to see your brain operating live on a television screen’), this simply isn’t the case. ‘Unfortunately, these pretty pictures hide the sausage factory’, as one neurologist put it. fMRI doesn’t measure neuronal activity directly. Instead, it uses a proxy: changes in blood oxygen levels. (PET uses a radioactive tracer isotope, which attaches itself to glucose or water molecules, to indirectly track blood flow.) Busier neurons need more oxygen and (after an initial dip) active brain regions have higher levels of oxygenated blood, because blood flow to that area increases. The oxygen is carried by the haemoglobin in red blood cells, and haemoglobin has slightly different magnetic qualities depending on how much oxygen it’s carrying. This creates a signal in the scanner (which pulses a magnetic field on and off). Neuroscientists then compare the difference in blood flow in brain regions during the task they’re interested in, with blood flow during a control task or rest state. (Ideally, the control task involves everything the experimental task entails – button pressing, word reading and so on – except for the psychological process you’re particularly interested in.) Researchers test for significant differences in blood flow in various locations of the brain regions during the two tasks, and if tests indicate that it is significant, a blob of colour is placed at the appropriate location on the picture of the brain. In other words, those coloured spots on the brain represent statistical significance at the end of several stages of complicated analysis – which means there’s plenty of scope for spurious findings of sex differences in neuroimaging research.""
Moreover, for every 1 neuroscience study claiming to find a difference between genders, there are 19 where both men and women were tested, no difference was discovered, and since the researcher's topic of interest was something other than gender differences the write up does not draw attention to the result - that no gender differences were found. The studies that do claim to find a difference also receive significantly more attention from people specifically looking for evidence to prove biological gender differences, and because the topic is so hot in our modern world.Alright, so neuroscience evidence is flimsy at best, and psychological testing of adults is unreliable unless performed with proper rigour. But what about children? Haven't there been tests of babies that show they prefer blue trucks/pink dolls? Unfortunately many of the tests claiming to prove such are also highly suspect. One study, for example, tested 3 month old male and female babies to see whether they preferred a Human face or a geometric mobile. Lo and behold, the male babies seemed to prefer the mobile, whilst female babies seemed to prefer the faces. Aha! But the face and the mobiles were presented to the babies separately, not simultaneously as is usual in such tests to truly determine if a baby prefers one thing over another - it's impossible therefore to say whether a preference was displayed. Furthermore, the researchers in the study knew what gender each baby they tested was, and there's reason to suspect they themselves may have been biasing the results by presenting a more friendly face to the female babies and moving the mobile around more with the male babies - creating the result they expected to see. Oh. Oh, indeed. More scientifically rigorous studies of babies' habits show that there is no difference in a six month old's preference between trucks and dolls - but this does kick in from around 9 months onwards. Is it nature asserting itself over nurture? Well, no. Another study tested whether babies truly do prefer a female face over a male one (i.e. testing whether we are biologically predisposed to think of women in a nurturing role). The babies seemed to prefer the female face - but all the babies in the first test group were being looked after primarily by their mothers. The test was repeated with babies who were being primarily raised by their fathers - those babies preferred male faces. Consistently, the results show environment over biology is the determining factor.The mother who had attempted gender neutral parenting only to wail; ""In the end I found her tucking the toy truck into bed and cuddling it! It must be biology!"" was asked by a shrewd researcher whether, in that household, one of the parents did most of the putting to bed - of course, it turned out the mother always put her daughter to bed. The fact of the matter is, even the most determined parents trying to employ gender neutral upbringing face an uphill struggle. Most actually bias the result, implicitly disapproving certain activities for their child despite outspokenly advocating them, and testing of children's reactions to words versus body language clearly demonstrates that they pick up on implict cues much more than verbal ones. Even with dedicated parents, the outside world is often intent on reinforcing gender roles, from multinational companies to the disapproving looks of less progressive parents. Gender is in fact the most strongly emphasised of any of the ways of categorising people, and children pick up on this from an exceptionally young age - it therefore becomes important for them to seek out clues about how to discover a person's gender and how to identify themselves, so they can fit in with a social group and be accepted - even when the parents at home are encouraging them to explore all kinds of play and activities.I'm going to conclude with the account of a couple who went the extra mile in their determination to raise their son and daughter in a truly gender neutral environment. Sandra and Daryl Bem, two psychologists;
""did all that they could to reduce the normally ubiquitous gender associations in their children’s environment: the information that lets children know what toys, behaviours, skills, personality traits, occupations, hobbies, responsibilities, clothing, hairstyles, accessories, colours, shapes, emotions and so on go with being male and female. This entailed, at its foundation, a meticulously managed commitment to equally shared parenting and household responsibilities. Trucks and dolls, needless to say, were offered with equal enthusiasm to both children; but also pink and blue clothing, and male and female playmates. Care was taken to make sure that the children saw men and women doing cross-gender jobs. By way of censorship, and the judicious use of editing, WhiteOut and marker pens, the Bems also ensured that the children’s bookshelves offered an egalitarian picture-book world... The second part of the Bems’ strategy was to, in place of the usual information about what it means to be male or female, promote the idea that the difference between males and females lies in their anatomy and reproductive functions. Your typical preschooler enjoys a detailed knowledge of gender roles, but remains a bit hazy regarding the hard, biological fact that males differ from females when it comes to the allocation of such items as penises, testicles and vaginas.'[O]ur son Jeremy, then age four, … decided to wear barrettes [hair slides] to nursery school. Several times that day, another little boy told Jeremy that he, Jeremy, must be a girl because ‘only girls wear barrettes.’ After trying to explain to this child that ‘wearing barrettes doesn’t matter’ and that ‘being a boy means having a penis and testicles,’ Jeremy finally pulled down his pants as a way of making his point more convincingly. The other child was not impressed. He simply said, ‘Everybody has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.’'Unlike their peers, Jeremy and Emily were discouraged from using socially determined trappings such as hairstyle, clothing, accessories or profession as a guide to a person’s biological sex. If the children asked whether someone was male or female, their parents ‘frequently denied certain knowledge of the person’s sex, emphasizing that without being able to see whether there was a penis or a vagina under the person’s clothes, [they] had no definitive information.’Step forward, please, all those parents who go to similar lengths to protect their children from acquiring prevailing cultural assumptions about gender. And do try to avoid being trampled in the rush. The Bems’ efforts, I think you’ll agree, seriously outclass what we normally, generously, think of as gender-neutral parenting... The intensity and scope of the Bems’ efforts offer a helpful hint as to just how gendered children’s environments are. To this day social structure, media and peers offer no shortage of information to children about masculinity and femininity.""

233,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"Delusions of Gender: The Real Science Behind Sex Differences by Cordelia Fine“Delusions of Gender” is an outstanding book that compels you to take a closer look at society and our science as it relates to gender issues. Academic psychologist and author, Dr. Cordelia Fine with a sharp sense of humor and an excellent grasp of what constitutes good science dismantles many claims of what can be considered neurosexism. This is a very provocative book as it tackles claims about male and female brains, and the gender cycle. This fascinating 371-page book is broken out into the following three parts: 1. Half-Changed World, Half-Changed Minds, 2. Neurosexism, and Recycling Gender.Positives:1. Engaging, witty, and provocative book. This is also a well-researched book that is not afraid to tackle head on popular misconceptions on gender.2. A fascinating and often misunderstood topic of sex differences.3. The science is accessible and the narrative flows nicely thanks to an infusion of humor. The book is also full of interesting anecdotes.4. Great use of counter-research to combat what Dr. Fine has concluded is poor science.5. One of the best features of this book is Dr. Fine’s relentless research against commonly held misconceptions by well-known scientists and authors. She makes a very compelling case against at best poor science or worst pseudoscience.6. Makes the very strong case on how society can impact associative memory. “Unlike explicitly held knowledge, where you can be reflective and picky about what you believe, associative memory seems to be fairly indiscriminate in what it takes on board. Most likely, it picks up and responds to cultural patterns in society, media and advertising, which may well be reinforcing implicit associations you don’t consciously endorse.” “When gender is salient in the environment, or we categories someone as male or female, gender stereotypes are automatically primed.”7. The impact of stereotypes. “Research suggests that the deadly combination of ‘knowing-and-being’ (women are bad at math and I am a woman) can lower performance expectations, as well as trigger performance anxiety and other negative emotions.”8. A look at mothers versus single women. “While parenthood served as no disadvantage at all to men, there was evidence of a substantial ‘motherhood penalty’. Mothers received only half as many callbacks as their identically qualified childless counterparts.”9. The reality of sexual harassment.10. Covers many issues regarding gender equality, including at home. “As Gloria Steinem recently reminded a journalist, “The idea of having it all never meant doing it all. Men are parents, too, and actually women will never be equal outside the home until men are equal inside the home.” Great quote.11. So are there biological roots to gender inequality? This is a recurring theme in the book.12. The reality is that there is a lot of poor science involving gender issues. “There’s something a little shocking about the discrepancy between the weakness of the scientific data on the one hand and the strength of the popular claims on the other.”13. A fascinating look at Neurosexism. “The sheer complexity of the brain makes interpreting and understanding the meaning of any sex differences we find in the brain a very difficult task.” “Neurosexism promotes damaging, limiting, potentially self-fulfilling stereotypes.”14. The file-drawer phenomenon. “This contributes to the so-called file-drawer phenomenon, whereby studies that do find sex differences get published, but those that don’t languish unpublished and unseen in a researcher’s file drawer.”15. Debunks myths with glee. “So let us, with healthy skepticism, summarize all of this as clearly as we can. Nonexistent sex differences in language lateralization, mediated by nonexistent sex differences in corpus callosum structure, are widely believed to explain nonexistent sex differences in language skills.” “The speculations of a few scientists quickly evolve into the colorful fabrications of popular neurosexism – the subspecialty within the larger discipline of neurononsense.”16. The four basic pieces of advice for anyone considering incorporating neuroscientific findings into a popular book or article about gender.17. One of the most astute observations of the books, too good not to share. “Genes don’t determine our brains (or our bodies), but they do constrain them. The developmental possibilities for an individual are neither infinitely malleable nor solely in the hands of the environment. But the insight that thinking, behavior and experiences change the brain, directly, or through changes in genetic activity, seems to strip the word ‘hardwiring’ of much useful meaning. As neurophysiologist Ruth Bleier put it over two decades ago, we should ‘view biology as potential, as capacity and not as static entity. Biology itself is socially influenced and defined; it changes and develops in interaction with and response to our minds and environment, as our behaviors do. Biology can be said to define possibilities but not determine them; it is never irrelevant but it is also not determinant.” Read that again, and again.18. A look at parenting. “It seems, then, that gender stereotypes, even if perhaps only implicitly held, affect parents’ behavior towards their babies.”19. Interesting facts that have an impact. “The Dr. Seuss books are rightly classics, adored by children and a joy of rediscovery for parents. Yet as Lamb and Brown observe, in all the forty-two books he wrote, not one has a female lead in its central story.”20. Copious amounts of notes and they are linked. A comprehensive bibliography.Negatives:1. Very little not to like about this excellent book but I would have probably started with defining the differences between key terms like sex and gender. The layperson tends to use these terms indiscriminately.2. The book does a phenomenal job of at the very least casting doubt or outright debunking commonly held misconceptions on gender issues; however, it doesn’t succeed nowhere near as well on defining the real science behind sex differences.3. Using scientific claims from centuries ago to debunk easily comes across as strawman arguments or low hanging fruits to grab on to.4. At times I feel she doesn’t necessarily apply the same amount of scrutiny to those studies that support her argument versus those that don’t. I prefer the instances where she simply states that we just don’t know.In summary, this was truly an eye opening and cognitive-dissonance inducing book. One of the great things I take from this book is to not fall prey to poor science and specifically, be alert of neurosexism. I’m not a neuroscience to know if all the conclusions that Dr. Fine makes are sound or not, but she is very persuasive and the book made me think. Witty, provocative and just fun to read, I highly recommend it!Further suggestions: “Science and Gender” by Ruth Bleier, “The Myths of Gender” and “Sexing the Body” by Gisela Kaplan, “Gene Worship” by Lesley Roger, “Sexual Science” by Cynthia Russett, and “The Social Psychology of Gender” by Laurie Rudman and Peter Glick. These books were recommended notably by the author."

It makes sense to me.There're a lot of dog-ears and underlines, but some of them are angry marks. I got very frustrated with about the middle two-fourths of it. The first fourth and the last fourth, I was much more interested in.The last fourth was what I thought the entire book was to be about---about how society and subtle clues train modern ""gender identity."" Because, dude, kids are sponges.The first one-fourth had some great lines and sentiments I agreed with, at their base. That is, perception is reality.The middle two-fourths? (Okay, I'd say, half, but it sounds wrong, since it's in the middle.) Yeah, that frustrated the ever-loving shit out of me. Because it seemed (to me, at least) she spent all that time leading up to making a point that I already knew. And I kept thinking, over an over, what she waited to say until the end of all that.And it just about killed me.Basically, I'm a fucking amateur, and I know that the way you live your life---your thought processes change the way your brain works. That is to say, nothing is hard-wired.Guess what; you spend your life obsessing over math, and the parts of your brain that deal with math are going to be larger than someone who's not obsessed with math, Einstein.So the fact that she laid it on thick, and laid on all this evidence, without just saying that until the end, just about killed me.Well, now, if she'd said it in the beginning of that section and went on, I would have had no problem. It just---it kept making me wonder if she was ever even going to point that out.And it drove me nuts.A mild frustration had nothing to do with her, but with a few of experiments they carried out. I mean, yeah, I was frustrated with the (sometimes) wild interpretations of some of them (as I was meant to be), but there were a few that hit me, personally. A few for which, all I could think, ""And then they had one more step to do."" Especially with the empathy tests. Oh, I could come up with such an awesome empathy test...There were even a couple of times that Fine really let me down. One, when she cited the behavior of rats to prove her point. And then, later, when rats didn't quite prove her point, she mentions how we really can't equate the behavior of rats to humans. It made me sad, because she had a point both times, but... Oof.Lots of good stuff, but a lot of frustration as well. And not nearly as much ""hard information"" as I was expecting. At least, not the kind I was expecting, because the kind of hard information I was looking forward to was only in the last quarter of the book. And there was not nearly as much of it as I had been hoping for. It barely went beyond what I already knew. It didn't challenge me the way I was hoping to be challenged.But enough of that. Let's end on my favorite line of the book. It has to do with the Bem children, who were raised as just about as ""gender nuetral"" as anyone could ever manage. The boy tells a classmante, "" 'being a boy means having a penis and testicles.' ""The boy who was critisizing him for wearing barrettes to nursery school comes back with, ""Everyone has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.""That right there made the whole book for me.Anyway, the point of the rating is not that I really liked it, but that I really like that it exists."
235,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,5,"I was really impressed with ‘Delusions of Gender’. It dissects and summarises research clearly, critiques stereotypes intelligently and analytically, and keeps the tone witty and readable yet more academic than journalistic. I found the synthesis of neuroscientific research on sex differences extremely helpful. Media articles that cheerfully claim sexist stereotypes are biological inevitabilities make me very angry. Fine channelled that same anger into writing an excellent rebuttal, which will be very useful to remember when the next wave of pseudo-scientific claims hit the papers.This book makes an excellent accompaniment to Living Dolls: The Return of Sexism, which focuses more on the societal implications of biological determinism-based sexism. It also brings up the important debate about applying scientific methodologies to research questions that are based on unquestioned stereotypes and assumptions. An example of this is the use of 'masculinity' as an objective index, like height and weight. As Fine states, including fMRI scans makes any research findings appear more weighty and scientific. Yet inferring major psychological differences between the sexes from disputed differences in brain structure is very problematic. The brain and the mind are not congruent. I’d also pick out for praise the latter chapters on young children learning about gender. That was not something I’d ever really thought about before, but of course kids observe how carefully adults sort people into the ‘man’ and ‘woman’ boxes. This part of the book includes amusing summaries of research investigating whether and/or why girls play more with ‘girl toys’ and boys with ‘boy toys’. I particularly liked the idea that some researchers made a My Little Pony into a desirable boy’s toy by painting it black, trimming its mane, and sharpening its teeth. Conversely, girls were ‘enchanted by… the lavender-satin-covered guns and holster, and the pink furred war helmet’. By the age of five, these children had picked up from their surrounding the sexual dimorphism of toys. As Fine points out, even clothes for newborns are gendered. She makes a strong argument for social over biological gender determinism.Apologies for eliding sex and gender in the paragraph above. Fine does not critique the gender binary or cover intersectionality issues in much depth, as these are not the focus of her book. Neither are they ever mentioned (that I’ve seen) by media articles that oversimplify and distort neuroscience to excuse sexism. Nonetheless, similar effects (regarding ‘stereotype threat’ for example) are noted to impact on women and ethnic minorities in the earlier chapters covering sociological research. There’s clearly a lot more work needed in the fields of sociology and neuroscience, but I agree with Fine that scientists have a responsibility to consider their unwitting assumptions about gender. As well as the ways in which their findings will be treated by a depressingly sexist media."
236,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie,4,"All those studies that say that women are bad at math and men are bad at relationships because their brains are hardwired that way can be very discouraging, and there are a LOT of those studies. But Cordelia Fine has looked into those studies and found flaws in them. Add into that a large number of studies that show how easy it is to jigger people’s minds into doing better or worse at tasks depending on how they are psychologically primed before hand and we can see where the author is coming from. Fine’s thesis is rather than there being any physical difference between male and female brains, the differences that we see in math scores are there because our culture expects them to be there. Even when people attempt to raise their children in a gender neutral environment, culture intervenes. On TV, in schools, in children’s books, in the clothing sold to children- everything is divided into genders, and females end up less adventuresome, more nurturing, expected to be nicer and not fight, and to focus on home and caring rather than invented and discovering. Toys for girls and boys are separated, and children who choose to play with toys for the opposite gender are disapproved of, especially boys who play with dolls or other ‘girl’ toys. Tomboys may be told to act more ladylike, but boys will get beat up by other boys. The core of her argument is that studies where test takers are primed to consider themselves members of sets other than gender yield different results than tests taken when the test takers are told things like “men traditionally do better on this test”. For instance, when a group of males and females take a test and are told before hand that people who go to certain colleges (colleges that some of the test takers go to) do better on this same test, the test takers conform to this and the males and females who belong to the colleges mentioned both do better on the test than the non-certain collegians- and the males and females in that group score the same as each other on the test under these conditions. These tests have been done numerous times by different researchers, and the results are always the same- the test takers conform to expectations set up before the test. Therefore, psychology trumps brain structure where intellectual subjects are concerned. It’s an interesting proposition, and one I think needs to be investigated more- much more. There’s a lot still to be untangled in gender studies. Intellectual abilities are jumbled in with emotional tendencies, and I definitely think they should be considered separately. She pretty much ignores the effect of hormones on emotional states except for the case of fetal testosterone. I think that while this book doesn’t settle any gender issue questions, it does cast a lot of doubt on previous studies and urges us to look at them much harder."
237,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237879-elaine-nelson,5,"I happened to run across this book at the library having forgotten that it was in my ""to-read"" list. I'm SO glad I did, and given a certain pair of somewhat ranty posts a couple of months back, only wish I'd read it sooner! I literally could not put it down - as in: ""no really, I need to go to bed/back to my desk from lunch/off the bus, I have to put the book away.""In short, social construction of gender: you're soaking in it. (And especially, your brain is soaking in it.)1) Priming & stereotype threat affect everything. Just checking gender on a form before taking a test changes womens' performance, especially on math tests. More priming (being told that the test relates to gender, watching a gender-stereotyped commercial, etc) increases the effect.2) Most of the ""science"" as it's filtered through to the popular media is a disaster of half-baked assumptions, small and/or poorly-constructed experiments, and willful misunderstanding of the actual results. (She tears apart one popular writer; it's kinda fun.)3) Worse, those lame results create a feedback loop, combined with the impossibility of gender-neutral child-rearing, that increases the problem of stereotype threat, and makes genuine social change more difficult.Le sigh. Not only is the feminist struggle not over, we may actually be hitting a really hard spot.On the plus side, I'm fired up now. Not just that, but I'm thinking more about my own personal construction of gender identity, including my history with math and science. There's a post I wrote about my life with math a while back, and there I wrote about it as a choice between writing and math - now I'm seriously looking back and wondering about the effect of gender stereotypes, and whether I might have come to computing sooner given different circumstances. I think it's worth noticing that choices exist in a constrained environment, constrained both by the external world, and by our own unexamined or incompletely-formed attitudes.As for the writing style, it's a delightful read. She's got a sharp conversational tone that pulled me in; I even read the footnotes.HIGHLY recommended, great in combination with Pink Brain Blue Brain."
238,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5324619-noor,5,"""Delusions of Gender"" has proved to be one of the most informative and interesting books I've read this year. The book consists of three parts that essentially discuss gender-stereotypes, Neurosexism, and the struggles of attempting to raise children in a gender-neutral environment.Cordelia starts by explaining how implicit and explicit beliefs are two separate things that don't always correlate. Despite ""consciously"" holding certain beliefs, there is a clash between the reflective self and our associative memory which is heavily influenced by the social environment surrounding us. When gender becomes salient and constantly primed in our daily life, it seeps into our perception of others and of ourselves, and we often do it in stereotypical ways. The book is filled with numerous experiments that support this idea. When we categorise people as male or female, we are instantly activating gender associations that affect our behaviour, values, performance etc. A perfect manifestation of this activated gender-inequality is how women are treated in a workplace dominated by men. Women experience segregation, exclusion, harassment and attack just by showing up to work basically.The second part of the book focuses on neurosexism and was the most difficult for me to digest; simply because I was unaware of just how much these popular neuroscientific claims are based on shaky empirical evidence. Gender stereotypes are legitimised by these pseudo-scientific explanations, and often become part of popular media. Neurosexism activates gender stereotypes which feeds into the public sphere + affects attitudes, identity & performance. It all leads us to become our own self-fulfilling prophecies.And the last bit of the book should be read by all parents who try to raise their children in a gender-neutral environment. It goes way beyond giving boys barbie dolls and giving girls fire trucks.All in all, this was an eye-opener for me when it comes to neuroscience and how it's used to reinforce old-fashioned stereotypes/roles through covering them with the finery of science.PS: Cordelia is quite witty. Found myself laughing out loud at times."
239,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4508080-julie-bozza,5,"A bit of a hard slog to read, especially as the few moments of humour didn't really suit me (too sarcastic). However, the important thing is that Fine makes vital headway towards an understanding of gender that I can really get behind. Gender difference is not 'hardwired' into us, and Fine deftly demolishes the pseudo-science that tells us otherwise. Fine quotes Kimmel in asserting 'gender difference is the product of gender inequality'; that is, we create and recreate gender difference while interacting with our society. The process begins at such an early age that many new parents, no matter how gender-neutral they try to be, end up assuming that gender difference is biologically or neurologically innate in their children. Fine does a good job of explaining why this happens, and how it will ultimately be worth it if we keep plugging away the gender-neutral objective. Fine also articulates how permeable the boundaries can be between our own sense of self and society's sense of who we are - or should be. I've struggled to articulate my struggles with this, but I've often felt like an asymmetrical heptagonal peg who is nevertheless forced (by otherwise well-meaning folk) to fit into the round hole that society makes available to me. Gender is certainly one aspect of this. My social sciences tutor told me I was making too much of the external forces - but now I've found Fine to back me up and explore the implications, and I feel inordinately grateful. Lastly, Fine ends with a note of hope. While she has shown how deeply woven gender difference (and hence gender inequality) is in our society, she has also shown that it is malleable. We can change this, though it will take time and effort. Let's keep trying! I would love to see what we can become when we are so much freer to be ourselves, whoever we may be."
240,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Subtitle: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference. Cordelia Fine, while an apparently well-read and quite competent scientist, makes no pretense of objectivity in this book. She's got an axe to grind with a whole school of research that aims to use modern brain science to convince us that male and female brains are intrinsically, fundamentally, and irrevocably different. Oh, and I also think the picture of her on the dust jacket is pretty hot. I just love imagining her getting all worked up about this. Wait, did I say that out loud?Anyway, Fine's point is best illustrated by an anecdote from the experience of a four year old named Jeremy, who had been raised by parents who were extraordinarily zealous gender-neutral parents. He decided one day to wear barrettes to nursery school, and gets into an argument with another boy, who says that he is a girl. Finally, Jeremy pulls down his pants and points out that he has a penis, as a way of making his point. The other boy says, “Everybody has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.”Whether you think the parents who let their boy wear barrettes to school were weird here, or the society that teaches a boy that the difference between male and female has more to do with hairstyle than genitals, depends on your opinions about gender (and society) generally. So does a lot of other (less amusing but more substantial) evidence, published in scientific journals or mainstream media, that Fine takes us on a tour of.Some of it is related to the general fallacy of all brain-scan evidence. Just because we see a difference in brain activity (using MRI or some other method), doesn't mean it's genetic or otherwise hardwired. All it shows is that it happens in the brain, and really, if we're talking about thoughts, attitudes, emotions, and so forth, where else would we expect it to happen? Also, like muscles, areas of the brain can grow larger or smaller over time as they are used more or less (whether for cultural reasons or any other), so again evidence from brain scans, while perhaps useful for other purposes, tells us nothing about whether differences in behavior are primarily biological or cultural. Seeing a brain scan, however, tells us that it has something to do with biology, and our instinctive reaction is still to divide things into biological and cultural, and if it's one it must not be the other.There is a long and well-documented history of scientific attempts to explain to us why women and men are Just Different, in ways that have nothing (directly) to do with procreation. The suspicious thing is that, while the rationales differ from decade to decade and from one century to the next, the conclusions always point in the same direction. Fine takes us on a thoroughly readable tour of this history, spiced up a bit by her, at times, barely contained rage.Make no mistake, this is not an even-handed weighing of the evidence; it is rather a very well-documented and data-driven polemic. If it were written by a man, I'd say that the confrontational and science-oriented analysis is very typical of a masculine style. Instead, I'll say it's an emotional treatment, showing a feminine inability to maintain objectivity on scientific topics. Either way, it's a hoot to read."
241,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6537005-daniel,3,"""Delusions of Gender"" is an engaging read, well-written and incisive. Cordelia Fine makes a convincing argument that gender differences in performance assessed through various metrics are to a large extent the result of social cues, reactions to internalized stereotypes, and unconscious priming. Her critique of studies of gender differences in psychological experiments is comprehensive, and her depiction of the current state of sexism is both convincing and often horrifying.Unfortunately, her fixation on discrediting both contemporary pop-psychology books selling innate gender differences and the arguments of dusty sexists from centuries past comes off a bit like clubbing baby seals (or possibly arm-wrestling five-year-olds). Her arguments against current neuroscientific techniques--especially neuroimaging using techniques like fMRI--fall particularly flat, as she relies repeatedly upon equating sophisticated real-time 3d measurements of blood-flow in the brain with crude volumetric measurements of skull capacity used by those sexist scientists of yore. This is trite and annoying.Likewise, she fails to engage biological and evolutionary arguments in any meaningful sense, instead relying on the tired allegation that evolutionary psychology and biology are only sexist justifications for relegating women to lives of domestic drudgery. She perhaps hopes that her readers are not savvy enough to Wikipedia the fields. Her argument that structural differences between the brains of men and women (after criticizing imaging and anatomical studies, she grudgingly admits that these do exist) compensate for differences in physiology to produce similar behaviors in males and females is interesting and may even be true to some extent--humans male and female, after all, must accomplish many of the same tasks to survive--but is unsupported and feels like hand-waving. She does not engage with the concepts of hormonal modulation of brain activity or neurotransmitter/receptor distribution and prevalence to any great degree. She brushes off the striking possibility that biological differences may predispose men and women toward different goals irrespective of nebulous measures of aptitude or spurious notions of ""natural gender roles."" The human brain she seems to prefer is the black box too intricate to be understood on a mechanistic level, a network of abstract associations accessible only to psychologists distributing questionnaires and bubble sheets to college students participating in studies for course credit.So, while entertaining (and perhaps convincing to audiences disinclined to read it critically or who already embrace its ideological underpinnings), the book's thesis does not strike home, and Fine's claim that it is dangerous for researchers to ask these questions at all should be disturbing to any reader who values science over ideology."

243,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley,3,"I tried to read this book near the beginning of quarantine, in hard copy, and my poor overloaded brain just couldn't handle it. If I had read this in audio, a format my brain can handle for serious subjects, I probably would have rated it much higher, and gotten through it much faster (and I'll be honest, retained more than 10% of it). So take this review with a grain of salt. (P.S. I just googled that phrase, and it evolved from something Pliny the Elder wrote in 77 A.D. Language is so weird.) I will be trying it again maybe in a couple of years by audio. Unless someone can point me in the direction of a book on the same subject that is more recent that I should read first (this was published in 2010).Aside from that issue, this book is also less of a thing on its own than it is the author debunking other scientific studies or books, things that people take as a given, or as ""proven"" by science. Cognitive bias plays a huge role not only in the behavior of test subjects, but in the minds of the scientists performing the studies. Which is enjoyable in its own way, but not quite what I was expecting. The book is very heavy on cautioning the reader about these types of studies, since gender is so hard to study, and really just instills a healthy amount of scientific skepticism. I remember it being a lot of, this isn't proven, we actually don't ""know"" as much as we think we do.I can't emphasize how much my brain did not retain any of the information I read, so this is really just a useless review. Judging by my friends' reviews on Goodreads, I just really need to give it a break, and then pick this up again some time down the road when my brain is being more amenable."

I gobbled this non-fiction up like it was a light lunch after a hard day's manual labor. Every page was packed with jaw-dropping information - horrifying methodological flaws, research which argues two diametrically opposed concepts, and outright deception, all designed to prove that men and women are not and cannot possibly be equal. Like, here's one example: Fine mentions the author of a popular book on the subject, who cites research about ""mirror neurons,"" (women have more of them, which supposedly makes them more empathetic.) The author mentions a study of therapists which indicated that the most successful therapists are those that ""mirror"" their clients words, gestures, and verbal patterns. Interestingly, (says the author), ALL of the successful therapists were women. Because they have more mirror neurons, and are more attuned to others, right?WRONG. Cordelia Fine looked up the study (thank you, Cordelia! That would be a big nuisance for the Average Reader) and as it turns out? ALL OF THE THERAPISTS IN THE STUDY WERE WOMEN. Yeah, that's right. They only recruited women for the study, so the study proves absolutely nothing about men vs. women. And if you think this sort of thing is an anomaly, wrong again - Fine's detailed work found this sort of thing occurring over and over again. Moreover, Fine is terrific at highlighting how the social context of everything men and women do contributes to these gender stereotypes, and at explaining how gender bias affects the neuroscientific research. This is an absolutely fantastic book - I have the urge to acquire copies for every teacher, every employer, every parent on the planet. It made me rethink more of my life that I would have believed possible. Seriously, even if you think you would disagree with it: READ IT. If nothing else, you will enjoy Fine's smooth and witty prose."

If you’re the type of person who enjoys nitpicking underpowered studies over methodological errors that affect validity and throwing shade at poor referencing while also being a flagrant feminist this is for you. I am not sure how this would go down for other people without a background in neuroscience because those parts were undoubtedly my favorite although I see how that part of the book could be too technical and heavy. I didn’t learn anything new science-wise but I did discover that there still are some fucking assholes willing to forgo the science completely just in order to tell you that your female brain HAS TO KNOW HOW TO EMPATHIZE AND BE NURTURING and that of course those morons have a wide audience just dying for any shard of pseudo-evidence that may point to the fact that their daughters are meant to be breeding subservient cows and that their sons will bring about the rapture. Of course this book proves yet again the only truth known to humans besides inevitable death and that is that men are trash. Besides that, I wholeheartedly enjoyed the psychology aspects of the book and if I had any doubt about the ubiquity of gender then it was all erased in the last part where she lists study after study proving how the idea of gender and how everything is gendered almost from birth and how early toddlers take on these ideas and digest them almost regardless of how unisex parents attempt to make their environments at home; the world at large is sexist. Go figure. And then there’s the ever expanding body of evidence that simply makes it clear that women have always always always been just as capable as men and that as the gender gap closes (despite the screeching and howling of men) women find their ways into board room and ORs and mines and factories and fucking haters continue to come up with more sophisticated schemes of bullshit to make it seem like we can’t but we’re doing it anyway.

249,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14821636-andrew-fish,1,"The differences between men and women have probably been a topic of debate since the dawn of time. In recent decades, however, as society has progressed from subsistence and survival to consumerism and choice the issue has gained a degree of salience. The question of whether women are actively held down in their careers or whether they passively make decisions which close off paths to advancement becomes more than a curiosity when careers become both a means to achieve a better life and a source of fulfilment in themselves. And earlier in life, the science of gender difference could make a significant difference to educational outcomes if it could be robustly investigated. The time, it seems, is right for a good scientific look at the subject.Unfortunately, this isn't it.Fine is a psychologist by training, and whilst there's definitely scope to study the issue of gender difference through psychology, she seems reluctant to do this in any depth. The opening section of the book which nominally covers this ground is quite thin on actual studies and seems instead to rely heavily on anecdote, giving the book the feel more of a polemic rather than an academic assessment. What science there is, meanwhile, is treated in an uneven manner, promoting the studies which suit the central thesis and denigrating any which don't. Frequently, Fine goes beyond the studies and draws conclusions which aren't supported by any of the evidence she has presented.So, for example, when looking at a study about the effect of priming on women's mathematical abilities, she not only accepts the results without question, she positively crows about the fact that the women did better than the men without the priming. For this to be a valid observation, both male and female participants would have to have an even spread of intellect, presumably using some kind of test as part of the selection process. The trouble with this is that you are then pre-determining the results: if the selection test were gender-neutral, the gender-neutral part of the study would be consistent with the selection process and you would end up with roughly equal results for men and women. If the theory were correct, there would then be lower results for the women in the gender-biased part. If the selection process were not gender-neutral, meanwhile, then if the theory held the women would seem equal to the men in the selection process and better in the gender-neutral study itself.From those results you could prove that priming made a difference to the test results, but not that there was any inherent difference between male and female aptitude in itself. To go further would be circular reasoning (something Fine criticises about another study later in the book).It's like the constant claim that girls are better at school - fifty years ago, the reverse was claimed. What changed in between? The education system. Clearly there is some kind of difference between the sexes there (something Fine seems pathologically averse to) but if one system of education produced stronger male results and the other stronger female all you can say is that different methods favour the sexes differently - you can't claim this makes one superior to the other.In other places, such as the behaviour of women in male-dominated careers, it seems there are no studies Fine can draw on. By definition, you'd find it hard to create a female-dominated version of the same career for comparison, but it doesn't stop the author from coming to conclusions about the effect of those environments without anything beyond anecdote and hypothesis.The most detailed analysis in favour of her argument comes toward the end of the book, when looking at the gender stereotypes to which children are exposed in their early years and how this affects their choice of toys and sense of dress. Unfortunately, here she has narrowed the argument too much: it may be demonstrable that social forces drive boys to wear blue and girls pink, but this would hardly explain the more abstract alleged differences between the sexes. When was the last time your child came home claiming they'd been excluded from the spatial reasoning group on the basis of gender?With the results which don't suit her, the author is more exacting. When looking at a study about infant response to faces and mobile phones, for example, she casts aspersions on the methodology, hypothesises about all kinds of ways the results could have been skewed (always assuming such skews would be systematically biased in the same direction) and even implies that the experimenters could have been acting out of an unconscious gender bias themselves. Apart from the unprofessionalism of casting aspersions without evidence, it seems weak to subject a study you don't like to this level of criticism when it could have been equally true of any of the studies supporting the case. Stepping outside her field, Fine is dismissive of biological studies and applies an extremely shaky attack on neurology - regarding it as an inadequately direct proxy measure of brain activity that is subject to confirmation bias. If that's true of neurology, what it does it say about psychology as a reliable indicator? This attack allows her to dismiss any conclusions from the field she doesn't like, but again she's all too quick to accept any that she does. She constantly falls for the same fallacy, that if you can debunk a very specific prediction made by someone in a particular field, you can dismiss any evidence from that field when it doesn't suit your agenda. The constant comparisons to long-dismissed theories such as brain-pan measurement are a reductio ad absurdum argument with little logical validity and the quotes which open most chapters - generally over a century old and clearly not acceptable to modern readers - come across as an attempt to prime the reader into a form of indignation which switches off their reasoning faculties for the rest of the chapter and allows them to accept Fine's arguments without criticism. I even spotted a very old psychologists' trick - starting a sentence with ""by now you will all be thinking"" - which is a blatant attempt at manipulation of the reader.Here and there we find snippets of actual information - a chance remark about spatial reasoning differing in babies of only a few months old, for example - but unless they fit the central argument, they are passed over quickly. An anecdote about a woman having been masturbated over, by contrast, is alluded to several times across a chapter. And there's little gender-balance in the topics themselves either: apart from a brief mention of female intuition right at the beginning, the book focuses almost entirely on areas where women are alleged to be deficient. The impression given is that this is a book written by someone working out their own issues rather than dispassionately looking at the field.And this is often a problem with psychologists. Freud's obsession with mother fantasies reeked of projection, Kahneman's instinct over reason view of the brain suggests a man struggling to justify his own bad decisions. To see what Fine's problems are you need only look at the language she uses, the metaphors she chooses and the examples she latches onto. The book is riddled with misandistric metaphor and there are a number of coded attacks on her husband. Take the chapter where she envisages a hypothetical job-swap with her spouse. When looking at his ability to do her job, she attacks his literacy - comparing it to a ten year-old. She then looks at her ability to do his job, but rather than admit any limitation on her own part, she sidesteps the issue and instead turns it into another backhanded attack on her husband - in this case the likelihood of his nagging her from beyond the grave. It doesn't take a degree in psychology to spot the signs of an inferiority complex.I don't pretend to know what the biological basis for behaviour is, and I accept that there are a lot of bad studies out there and bad books using the results. But for a book whose byline is ""the real science behind gender difference"" I was expecting more than just a series of attacks. And it's a shame, because the issue is both interesting and important. In my opinion, there clearly are elements of behaviour that are inherited (how else would cuckoos transmit their parasitical tendencies?) but what that inheritance mechanism is and how far it reaches into human behaviour has, as far as I can see, yet to be established. To claim it has no effect on humans would be to think as those who attacked Darwin because whilst they could accept evolution, they felt that to claim humans were a product of evolution was a step too far. One science Fine didn't look at all is anthropology, which for anyone who is genuinely looking for the true reasons for gender difference would seem the obvious place to start. I suggest for those who are after a book which informs them rather than just gives them a reason to be angry at the state of the world, that would be a better field to explore."
250,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17161968-fergus-murray,5,"Delusions of Gender, by Cordelia Fine, is an extended critique of efforts to scientifically study differences between the sexes, and the efforts of many writers to apply alleged science in their writings about such differences. The book is rich in technical detail, which might bog down some readers, but most of those details are fascinating. Fine is a lucid and entertaining writer, especially in her more acerbic moments - of which there are plenty here. She finds a lot of shoddy science and shameless misuse of would-be science that would raise the hackles of any neuroscientist or feminist, let alone someone like her who happens to be both.This is a book with an agenda, and political agendas tend not to sit comfortably with science - but to pretend that politics never seeps into science while nobody is looking would be disingenuous. In fact, Fine's agenda - to bring out the reasons to doubt science that supposedly demonstrates innate differences between sexes - is at least as much scientific as political, and I think it is legitimate. It is something to bear in mind while reading this book, though, and there are times she goes out of her way to present things in such a way as to minimise the possibility of interpretation in terms of innate differences. As far as I can see she always stops short of misrepresenting the science, though, and the whole approach needs to be seen in the context of discourse which routinely takes essential differences for granted, whether the evidence supports them or not.The book is divided into three parts. The first is 'Half-changed World', Half-Changed Minds, which largely focuses on the interplay of cultural expectations and attempts to measure sex differences scientifically. This largely consists of accounts of experiments demonstrating the effects of cultural norms on things that people might be interested in measuring, and experiments which fail to take these factors into account. For example, she looks at experiments investigating the effect of telling the subjects what 'the latest science' has to say about the sorts of tests they are about to perform, to show that girls do significantly better on mathematical tasks if they think that science says they should. Even more subtly, females rate their mathematical ability as worse after they have just been reminded of their sex by having to tick a box at the beginning to say they are females. This gives us an interesting lens for looking at gender differences in maths tests which disregard the weight of cultural expectations, and indeed at systematic tendencies for females to choose less mathematical study and career paths. Having established many profound and subtle ways that social expectations and structures shape behaviours and perfomance, the theme of the second part of the book is Neurosexism - premature efforts to explain differences in behaviour and performance with reference to the brain, rather than society. Fine's most basic point is that it is rather soon to be looking for explanations of most of these things in neuroscience, when societal explanations have not been ruled out, and the relationship between the mind and the brain is still so unclear. More than that, she shows time and again that many authors are disturbingly willing to go way beyond what neurology can tell us, while pretending that they are not. Perhaps the single worst offender here is Louann Brizendine, author of The Female Brain, a serial abuser and inventor of neuroscience to back up her ideas about the differences between males and females - but she is one of many. Fine makes the point that people have been finding 'explanations' for sex differences in the brain for well over a century, from the observation that female brains tend to be a bit lighter than male ones through to modern notions of hardwiring. At the same time, people have routinely assumed that all kinds of observed differences between the sexes are natural and inevitable, when later experience has regularly shown them to be no such thing.The final section is titled Re-Cycling Gender, and it concerns itself with the future of gender relations and the science of sex. Fine is worried about the cyclical nature of some kinds of self-fulfilling prophecy - about dodgy science being used to teach yet another generation of young men and women that there are certain natural roles that they ought to be filling, certain characteristics they should expect to have. She emphasises again how difficult it is to pick apart innate and culturally conditioned differences, and the importance of keeping an open mind about questions that science has not yet been able to settle. With a better scientific understanding of the role of society in forming the mind and the brain, and a sceptical eye on the interesting but inconclusive findings of neuroscience, we may approach true sexual equality yet. Without such circumspection, as Fine argues, we may find ourselves sliding back to ideas about the sexes which are both unhelpful and ill-founded.This is an important book, because the trend towards explaining sex differences with impressive-sounding neurological findings has great potential to set back ideas about gender roles, on the basis of evidence which is far flimsier than it might look. Because we are shaped by our ideas, this has major practical, political ramifications - it is not just good science that is at stake here. There is no doubt that some will resist Fine's approach for its politicisation of science, but I would be inclined to see it more as exploring the role of pre-existing, unexamined political bias, rather than introducing politics to the debate. Delusions of Gender is compelling, informative and perhaps most impressively, funny. I recommend this highly to anyone with any interest in neuroscience or gender.'This review first appeared at http://everything2.com/title/Delusion..."
251,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11030012-jade,4,"There have always been many (pseudo)scientific books on the shelves attempting to explain the differences between the sexes, of which the most common differences usually consist of men having a more result-orientated, mathematical approach, and women having a more relationship-orientated, emotional or empathic approach (never mind about non-binary people, queers, etc.). This is usually shown as something that’s unchangeable; something written down by genetics and made clear by the way our brains differ so much from each other. Also, some (if not most) of these books claim that that’s what also causes traditional gender roles – women are simply better suited for housework, and men better suited for business. Often, this is also where an evolutionary argument about caves, hunting, and gathering comes in.Unfortunately, the tendency to display such dated, sexist views isn’t only found in pseudoscientific writers (an example being the ever annoying book always present in every single bookstore I visit, Men Are from Mars Women Are from Venus by John Gray), but also in qualified scientists or psychologists: The Female Brain by Louann Brizendine, being a great example, or The Sexual Paradox: Extreme Men Gifted Women and the Real Gender Gap by Susan Pinker. Though I can’t deny the big influence popular ‘science’ books have on the general reading audience, as an aspiring psychologist myself, the fact that qualified psychologists spew this kind of garbage worries me intensely.Which is why I’m quite glad to have found this wonderfully well-researched book by Cordelia Fine, in which she attempts to refute many claims made by popular psychology books concerning traditional gender roles/behaviour, and differences between the sexes. Does she succeed? In my opinion, yes, and she does so with humour, solid arguments, and a critical approach. I really enjoyed the fact that she doesn’t only bring up arguments to counter interpretations and results of research used in the aforementioned popular psychology books, but she also attacks the way certain methods of research are used and interpreted (case in point: neuroimaging).A very complete, interesting, witty, and fun read. I commend Cordelia Fine for writing such a wonderfully clear answer to the dated views on the differences between the sexes, and emphasizing the importance of valid research (and the interpretation of it). I can definitely recommend this to anyone who’s interested in reading more about gender roles/behaviour."
252,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7300053-nicole-ysabet,5,"This book was a cogent, readable rebuttal to all the pop-psychology, pseudoscientific nonsense published about how alleged differences between men and women make men thuggish morons who can't wash a dish and women lightheaded bimbos incapable of understanding math. It made me want to do a dance of joy. Also, when talking about neuroimaging experiments which supposedly prove these ""hardwired"" differences, Cordelia Fine wrote this paragraph:[...] When looking for changes in blood flow between two conditions, researchers search in thousands of tiny sections of the brain (called voxels), and many researchers are now arguing that the threshold commonly set for declaring that a difference is ""significant"" just isn't high enough. To illustrate this point, some researchers recently scanned an Atlantic salmon while showing it emotionally charged photographs. The salmon--which, by the way, ""was not alive at the time of scanning""--was ""asked to determine what emotion the individual in the photo must have been experiencing."" Using standard statistical procedures, they found significant brain activity in one small region of the dead fish's brain while it performed the empathizing task, compared with brain activity during ""rest."" The researchers conclude not that this particular region of the brain is involved in postmortem piscine empathizing, but that the kind of statistical thresholds commonly used in neuroimaging studies [...] are inadequate because they allow too many spurious results through the net.If that doesn't make you want to read at least a little more, I have no idea how to talk to you."

This author doesn't think so and after reading her book, I'm convinced.She says that gender distinctions continue to exist and that they start from our very beginnings - pink is for girls, blue is for boys. Gender comes to define us and these distinctions shape our abilities and interests. Certain skills are identified as male or female: Men are rational and brave; and Women are empathetic and nurturing. These assumed traits then impact our adult lives and the choices we make such as what fields to study in college, and what careers to pursue afterwards.Most alarming to the author is that the new fancy pants field of neuroscience observes physical differences in the brain between men and women and they are using those results to explain pre-conceived notions about the abilities of men vs. women instead of considering the impact of outside social forces. To create a causal relationship where none exists is to eliminate a possible true explanation before it is ever considered.A thought provoking book."

Fine looks at gender essentialism and at the biases of studies and media reporting, and suggests that we've been too quick to throw up our hands and say, ""but it's biological!"" If little girls have only been wearing pink for fifty years, then clearly that can't be a hard-wired preference.As a woman who preferred baby blue to pink for my childhood frilly dresses, liked to play with my brother's trucks and robots as well as my own stuffed animals (dolls are creepy and as for the toy . . . ironing board?!!! . . . I was given, the less said the better), and whose index finger is shorter than her ring finger, but who grew up to be much better at language than math (but my mom was great at math) and is more empathetic than competitive, I've always found these gender assumptions questionable, as I seem to be all over the board. Fine, writing for a popular audience, sometimes seems to skim the surface, but her work is clear, logical, and sometimes pleasantly snarky."

It always irks me if people want to use scientific publications to justify stuff like this. Not because I'd prefer them not to be true, but because I'm only too aware that making it through peer review isn't a good indicator about how well done the experiments were. Just ask Rosie Redfield and her successful push against the stupid arsenic life-stuff. Many different studies are discussed in some detail and lots of flaws in those studies are shown: lack of controls and/or statistical power, multiple testing, the general problems of fMRI, alternative explanations fitting the data as well or even better etc. Recommended for: everyone who likes to see overselling scientific claims destroyed, people who want to disarm the arguments of those who believe in inherent gender differences.

261,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25360918-blair,2,"Are Men Systemisers and Women Empathisers?We all know that men are from Mars and women are from Venus, right? There is much in current popular literature suggesting gender differences are innate, therefore we should adapt to them. This book treats us to even more of this kind of thinking found in the older literature, which looks absurd to modern eyes. The author asks if the modern stuff is really much different. She has two main points: Neuroscience is not nearly advanced enough to reach any conclusions that link brain structure to behaviour. And it is difficult to distinguish between genetic and culturally acquired characteristics from observing society, because there are so many confounding factors and sources of bias. So what is all this recent writing really based on?Things Don’t Seem So Bad in My BubbleI appear to live in a bubble. The reports I read about sexual discrimination and harassment are shocking, and do not reflect my personal experience. I realize that my brain’s shrivelled left hemisphere renders me oblivious to any social interaction that is not blindingly obvious, but I am married to a successful female senior manager. We even talk sometimes (when she makes me). I don’t hear much about discrimination, while I do hear about a lot else. And there are plenty of women in senior positions where she works. But society is not uniform, and large parts of it are clearly very different from where I stand.Beyond Reason: Why I Would See it That WayWhy is gender stereotyping so persistent when many of us claim to have moved beyond that? She tells us,
“One can be reflective about explicitly held (rational) knowledge, and it may be reasonably consistent. However, associative knowledge seems to be fairly indiscriminate about what it takes on board. So you may not be consciously sexist, yet sexist patterns you have unconsciously picked up may assert themselves.”
Our unconscious attitudes are learned when we are young, and they are learned from the behaviour one sees, not the words our parents or schools use to tell us how they think we should be. Now in our daily lives our choices are made instinctively, and the rational mind finds a justification that is not sexist. Thus gender discrimination is perpetuated without us even knowing or wanting to do it.As a male systemiser, I have done the job expected of me. I will now get in touch with my feminine side and talk about personal experience. Yes, personal anecdotes do not add up to data, but apparently there is no worthwhile data anyway, so why not?The Geek SpeaksI spent my career writing software, so the following got my attention:
“What, for example, springs to mind when you think of a computer scientist? A man, of course, but not just any man. You’re probably thinking of the sort of man who would not be an asset at a tea party. The sort of man who leaves a trail of soft-drink cans, junk-food wrappers, and tech magazines behind him as he makes his way to the sofa to watch Star Trek for the hundredth time.”
I went to a university that did not yet have a computer science department. A few friends and myself invented our own. We failed the courses we were supposed to be taking because we spent all day playing on the computers we hacked into. Need I mention that none of us were women?The reason has nothing to do with junk-food wrappers, or that the female devotes too much of her brain to emotion processing to write code. It is more about obsession. We males may or may not be better systemisers, but we are more willing to blow an entire school year to spend all day systemising about one thing. What, women can’t afford to take risks like that? Don’t be silly, they can always get married and have babies if things don’t work out. Or they can switch into social sciences, and get an easy degree doing sloppy research that verifies pre-existing beliefs. Our author delights in presenting examples of that. Oh, that was typically insensitive of me. My oxytocin levels must be low again.The only hint of truth in her paragraph is the lack of social skills of many of us in the industry. Combine obsession with that lack of social skills, and one suspects the presence of a few autism-linked genes in the crowd. But I am sure Ms. Fine can cherry-pick a few flawed autism studies to demolish that notion.One can argue that these different attitudes are entirely socially constructed. But it is also possible that something real is being socially reinforced. There is some evidence, especially from identical twin studies, which link personal characteristics to genetics. It is hard to believe that there is no sex linkage involved. It is easy to mock jumping to evolutionary conclusions about math skills or preferring pink to blue. But the human species does have a long history with a gender devoted to hunting and warfare. Add in the fact that males are expendable, and a genetic inclination toward risk taking does seem somewhat credible. Obsession may have been selected for similar reasons. Those autism genes must be there for a reason. You know, men have to focus on their hunting, while the women multitask feeding the baby while inventing agriculture, food storage and other requirements for civilization.Oops, I have slipped back into systemising again. It must be the lack of connection between my hippocampus and cerebral cortex.Empathising Has Its RewardsThere were not many female programmers where I worked, and they did not last long. They get promoted into management. Oh, the discrimination! The gender distribution at my company was interesting. As one might expect, the programmers were generally male and the quality control people were female. Were women excluded from the more creative jobs because of their sex? Perhaps the difference is that while I would think about work when I got home, they were thinking about home while they were at work. A more demanding job gets in the way. And if that is because of social conditioning, it is hardly the fault of corporate management.The other female “ghetto” at our company was in program management. This critical senior position requires both strong technical knowledge and excellent social skills to deal with our external clients. It was mainly women who had the magic to pull it off. (I suppose that more developed inferior parietal lobe makes all the difference.) The consequences of gender stereotyping, legitimate or not, can cut both ways.I lost my job there because I did not step up into a more collaborative role. I was lucky to last as long as I did happily coding away. Industry is changing, communicating and collaborating across boundaries is becoming ever more important. My stereotypical mind sees these as female qualities, but does it matter? Any company that discriminates against women is suicidal, because it needs those skills. But then, a lot of companies are slowly committing suicide. I suspect there may be a connection here.Social Skills in the Strip ClubsApparently there is an increasing tendency to use strip clubs for conducting business. Ms. Fine documents this and concludes,
“In effect, just as their fathers might have taken clients to one of the gentlemen’s clubs of Pall Mall, so brokers today take their business associates to see lap dancers. The old gentlemen’s clubs banned women – some still do – whereas the lap-dancing establishments merely intimidate them.”
My emotional reaction (yes, I do have them) is anger and disgust. Gentlemen’s clubs, for all their faults, at least had some class. Strip clubs are for scum. Reducing men to scum to preserve their pathetic privileges is beneath contempt.I can’t help wondering if some of those men are not entirely comfortable with what is going on, but feel they have little choice. It looks like nothing has changed – the bullies are still in charge.Geeks like me tend to go to Star Trek conventions rather than strip clubs, if they go anywhere at all. (I go to a book club.) We also cannot help noticing that the more sexist the man, the more women are attracted to him. (They appeal to her associative memory rather than her reason, which should know better.) Bullies get what they want. Sexism is a social skill, and one that is well rewarded. But I suspect some of these organizations are going to bully themselves into bankruptcy because they can’t keep up with a changing world. It can’t come soon enough.But there is another explanation for this behaviour: the men have been desensitized to sexual stimulation by constant exposure to pornography. For some reason Fine chooses to completely ignore this issue. So tell me, which affects men’s attitudes toward women: a dubious book by Louann Brizendine or twenty hours a week of hard-core degrading pornography?Second ThoughtsThis conclusion is being written a several weeks after the rest of the review. What I wrote above is essentially an emotional response to the book. Now the emotion has worn off, I will treat this book as the scientific work it claims to be.The material about how women are limited by social conditioning and outright repression, while socially important, leads to only one scientific insight: we cannot judge the potential of women by their present level of achievement. That is all. But it does serve to soften up the reader for her message. It worked on me.The book may serve as a needed corrective for some of the simplistic stereotyping in the name of science out there. But is it also guilty of similar distortion in pursuit of an agenda that claims gender differences are a social construction? In other words, is this simply the other side in a culture war being fought using science as the battleground?That culture war has been raging for hundreds of years. Conservatives claim human nature is fixed, and we dare not change the ancient wisdom that keeps our impulses contained. Liberals contend that the mind is a blank slate, and humanity is perfectible with the right thinking and social intervention. I suspect those of you who like this book are really cheering that our side is beating up their side, like in a sporting event. And she is administering quite a beating. But this is an empirical question, not a matter of opinion. If you don’t understand the science, how can you possibly know if the scientific arguments here are valid?I don’t know much about neuroscience either, but I detect a number of serious warning signs pointing to a lack of objectivity. Despite the cheery tone, this book mainly consists of an unrelenting attack on any viewpoint that suggests gender differences are innate. It is hard to tell when she is criticizing scientific studies or amateur opinion, which has the effect of implying that the dumbest ideas are also the opinions of any scientists she is opposed to. This kind of polarization has no place in science. A look at the author’s publication list shows mainly commentaries rather than research, mainly aimed at a popular audience. This looks more like a campaigner rather than a scientist.Good science writing shows a passion for understanding the subject and a desire to explain it to the reader. There is none of that here. Instead, explanations are presented only as necessary for the reader to understand the words in her debunking effort. She overwhelms the reader with the sheer volume of scientific information. But volume does not add up to truth if that information is selective.I do not know to what degree gender differences are innate. Who knows, maybe our author has it mostly right. I simply cannot not trust this work to tell me that. Even when she tells me that neuroscience is not advanced enough to draw conclusions about gender, my response is that seems reasonable, but I will look elsewhere to find out. [A quick look suggests she is wrong.]This book is a great reminder that there is a lot of bad science writing out there. Unfortunately it is also a good example of that, yet another example of science corrupted by ideology."
262,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4973578-iset,5,"You've probably heard that men are just naturally better at spatial awareness and logical tasks whilst women are just naturally better at verbal and nurturing tasks. You've probably heard that men and women's brains are different. You may even have heard exasperated parents trying out gender neutral parenting exclaiming that their little girl/boy just seems to naturally gravitate towards pink dolls/blue trucks - it must be biological! Delusions of Gender debunks it all, delving into the real science behind these spurious claims.The book is divided into three sections. First, the sociological and psychological studies of gender differences. How are we to explain, for example, the fact that men seem to consistently do well in maths and women in verbal reasoning? It turns out - quite easily. The notion that men are better at certain things and women are better at other things is an entrenched stereotype. Consistently, in a scientific testing environment, when groups are primed before the test to buy into these stereotypes, they conform to cultural and societal demands of their gender - but when the groups are primed beforehand with a statement that no gender differences have ever been found, then both men and women defy the stereotypes and perform better even than the other gender at tasks that their own gender is supposedly bad at. This result bears out over countless tests, and reveals that when a categorised group is placed under 'stereotype threat', the distracting negative thinking that results significantly impacts on their performance in a given task - conversely, when the group is relaxed and not under threat, their true abilities are freed. There's more. When asked to self-report about how analytical/empathising they are, men and women will report that they fall into the stereotypes about their gender. However, when rigorous scientific is set up - for example, unwittingly recording two individuals in a room, after the fact asking one to note down their thoughts as they watch back the video, and then asking the other to guess what the first was thinking; both men and women show the same amount of ability to read people's faces and intuit their emotional state. In other words, self-reporting is unreliable as a true test of gender differences, and many tests claiming to prove a difference are unscientific, inadvertantly priming the subjects beforehand to perform according to existing social pressures.Okay, so social pressure is affecting people. But what about all that medical evidence that men and women's brains are different? It's actually very flimsy. Testosterone testing of babies in utero is not actually done by testing the baby's blood - but by testing the mother's blood, or the amniotic content. There are significant problems with several of the studies involving scanning the brains of adults - such as some studies only using female test subjects and not comparing against men in any way. Other studies are post-mortem. Several employ circular reasoning in their write ups to assert some sort of gender difference. ""But I've seen those different coloured scan images of male versus female brains on the internet!"" you may cry.
""It’s important to realise that the patches of colour you see on brain scans don’t actually show brain activity. Although it may seem as though fMRI and PET enable you to see a snapshot of the brain at work (or, as popular writers Allan and Barbara Pease claim, ‘to see your brain operating live on a television screen’), this simply isn’t the case. ‘Unfortunately, these pretty pictures hide the sausage factory’, as one neurologist put it. fMRI doesn’t measure neuronal activity directly. Instead, it uses a proxy: changes in blood oxygen levels. (PET uses a radioactive tracer isotope, which attaches itself to glucose or water molecules, to indirectly track blood flow.) Busier neurons need more oxygen and (after an initial dip) active brain regions have higher levels of oxygenated blood, because blood flow to that area increases. The oxygen is carried by the haemoglobin in red blood cells, and haemoglobin has slightly different magnetic qualities depending on how much oxygen it’s carrying. This creates a signal in the scanner (which pulses a magnetic field on and off). Neuroscientists then compare the difference in blood flow in brain regions during the task they’re interested in, with blood flow during a control task or rest state. (Ideally, the control task involves everything the experimental task entails – button pressing, word reading and so on – except for the psychological process you’re particularly interested in.) Researchers test for significant differences in blood flow in various locations of the brain regions during the two tasks, and if tests indicate that it is significant, a blob of colour is placed at the appropriate location on the picture of the brain. In other words, those coloured spots on the brain represent statistical significance at the end of several stages of complicated analysis – which means there’s plenty of scope for spurious findings of sex differences in neuroimaging research.""
Moreover, for every 1 neuroscience study claiming to find a difference between genders, there are 19 where both men and women were tested, no difference was discovered, and since the researcher's topic of interest was something other than gender differences the write up does not draw attention to the result - that no gender differences were found. The studies that do claim to find a difference also receive significantly more attention from people specifically looking for evidence to prove biological gender differences, and because the topic is so hot in our modern world.Alright, so neuroscience evidence is flimsy at best, and psychological testing of adults is unreliable unless performed with proper rigour. But what about children? Haven't there been tests of babies that show they prefer blue trucks/pink dolls? Unfortunately many of the tests claiming to prove such are also highly suspect. One study, for example, tested 3 month old male and female babies to see whether they preferred a Human face or a geometric mobile. Lo and behold, the male babies seemed to prefer the mobile, whilst female babies seemed to prefer the faces. Aha! But the face and the mobiles were presented to the babies separately, not simultaneously as is usual in such tests to truly determine if a baby prefers one thing over another - it's impossible therefore to say whether a preference was displayed. Furthermore, the researchers in the study knew what gender each baby they tested was, and there's reason to suspect they themselves may have been biasing the results by presenting a more friendly face to the female babies and moving the mobile around more with the male babies - creating the result they expected to see. Oh. Oh, indeed. More scientifically rigorous studies of babies' habits show that there is no difference in a six month old's preference between trucks and dolls - but this does kick in from around 9 months onwards. Is it nature asserting itself over nurture? Well, no. Another study tested whether babies truly do prefer a female face over a male one (i.e. testing whether we are biologically predisposed to think of women in a nurturing role). The babies seemed to prefer the female face - but all the babies in the first test group were being looked after primarily by their mothers. The test was repeated with babies who were being primarily raised by their fathers - those babies preferred male faces. Consistently, the results show environment over biology is the determining factor.The mother who had attempted gender neutral parenting only to wail; ""In the end I found her tucking the toy truck into bed and cuddling it! It must be biology!"" was asked by a shrewd researcher whether, in that household, one of the parents did most of the putting to bed - of course, it turned out the mother always put her daughter to bed. The fact of the matter is, even the most determined parents trying to employ gender neutral upbringing face an uphill struggle. Most actually bias the result, implicitly disapproving certain activities for their child despite outspokenly advocating them, and testing of children's reactions to words versus body language clearly demonstrates that they pick up on implict cues much more than verbal ones. Even with dedicated parents, the outside world is often intent on reinforcing gender roles, from multinational companies to the disapproving looks of less progressive parents. Gender is in fact the most strongly emphasised of any of the ways of categorising people, and children pick up on this from an exceptionally young age - it therefore becomes important for them to seek out clues about how to discover a person's gender and how to identify themselves, so they can fit in with a social group and be accepted - even when the parents at home are encouraging them to explore all kinds of play and activities.I'm going to conclude with the account of a couple who went the extra mile in their determination to raise their son and daughter in a truly gender neutral environment. Sandra and Daryl Bem, two psychologists;
""did all that they could to reduce the normally ubiquitous gender associations in their children’s environment: the information that lets children know what toys, behaviours, skills, personality traits, occupations, hobbies, responsibilities, clothing, hairstyles, accessories, colours, shapes, emotions and so on go with being male and female. This entailed, at its foundation, a meticulously managed commitment to equally shared parenting and household responsibilities. Trucks and dolls, needless to say, were offered with equal enthusiasm to both children; but also pink and blue clothing, and male and female playmates. Care was taken to make sure that the children saw men and women doing cross-gender jobs. By way of censorship, and the judicious use of editing, WhiteOut and marker pens, the Bems also ensured that the children’s bookshelves offered an egalitarian picture-book world... The second part of the Bems’ strategy was to, in place of the usual information about what it means to be male or female, promote the idea that the difference between males and females lies in their anatomy and reproductive functions. Your typical preschooler enjoys a detailed knowledge of gender roles, but remains a bit hazy regarding the hard, biological fact that males differ from females when it comes to the allocation of such items as penises, testicles and vaginas.'[O]ur son Jeremy, then age four, … decided to wear barrettes [hair slides] to nursery school. Several times that day, another little boy told Jeremy that he, Jeremy, must be a girl because ‘only girls wear barrettes.’ After trying to explain to this child that ‘wearing barrettes doesn’t matter’ and that ‘being a boy means having a penis and testicles,’ Jeremy finally pulled down his pants as a way of making his point more convincingly. The other child was not impressed. He simply said, ‘Everybody has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.’'Unlike their peers, Jeremy and Emily were discouraged from using socially determined trappings such as hairstyle, clothing, accessories or profession as a guide to a person’s biological sex. If the children asked whether someone was male or female, their parents ‘frequently denied certain knowledge of the person’s sex, emphasizing that without being able to see whether there was a penis or a vagina under the person’s clothes, [they] had no definitive information.’Step forward, please, all those parents who go to similar lengths to protect their children from acquiring prevailing cultural assumptions about gender. And do try to avoid being trampled in the rush. The Bems’ efforts, I think you’ll agree, seriously outclass what we normally, generously, think of as gender-neutral parenting... The intensity and scope of the Bems’ efforts offer a helpful hint as to just how gendered children’s environments are. To this day social structure, media and peers offer no shortage of information to children about masculinity and femininity.""

263,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"Delusions of Gender: The Real Science Behind Sex Differences by Cordelia Fine“Delusions of Gender” is an outstanding book that compels you to take a closer look at society and our science as it relates to gender issues. Academic psychologist and author, Dr. Cordelia Fine with a sharp sense of humor and an excellent grasp of what constitutes good science dismantles many claims of what can be considered neurosexism. This is a very provocative book as it tackles claims about male and female brains, and the gender cycle. This fascinating 371-page book is broken out into the following three parts: 1. Half-Changed World, Half-Changed Minds, 2. Neurosexism, and Recycling Gender.Positives:1. Engaging, witty, and provocative book. This is also a well-researched book that is not afraid to tackle head on popular misconceptions on gender.2. A fascinating and often misunderstood topic of sex differences.3. The science is accessible and the narrative flows nicely thanks to an infusion of humor. The book is also full of interesting anecdotes.4. Great use of counter-research to combat what Dr. Fine has concluded is poor science.5. One of the best features of this book is Dr. Fine’s relentless research against commonly held misconceptions by well-known scientists and authors. She makes a very compelling case against at best poor science or worst pseudoscience.6. Makes the very strong case on how society can impact associative memory. “Unlike explicitly held knowledge, where you can be reflective and picky about what you believe, associative memory seems to be fairly indiscriminate in what it takes on board. Most likely, it picks up and responds to cultural patterns in society, media and advertising, which may well be reinforcing implicit associations you don’t consciously endorse.” “When gender is salient in the environment, or we categories someone as male or female, gender stereotypes are automatically primed.”7. The impact of stereotypes. “Research suggests that the deadly combination of ‘knowing-and-being’ (women are bad at math and I am a woman) can lower performance expectations, as well as trigger performance anxiety and other negative emotions.”8. A look at mothers versus single women. “While parenthood served as no disadvantage at all to men, there was evidence of a substantial ‘motherhood penalty’. Mothers received only half as many callbacks as their identically qualified childless counterparts.”9. The reality of sexual harassment.10. Covers many issues regarding gender equality, including at home. “As Gloria Steinem recently reminded a journalist, “The idea of having it all never meant doing it all. Men are parents, too, and actually women will never be equal outside the home until men are equal inside the home.” Great quote.11. So are there biological roots to gender inequality? This is a recurring theme in the book.12. The reality is that there is a lot of poor science involving gender issues. “There’s something a little shocking about the discrepancy between the weakness of the scientific data on the one hand and the strength of the popular claims on the other.”13. A fascinating look at Neurosexism. “The sheer complexity of the brain makes interpreting and understanding the meaning of any sex differences we find in the brain a very difficult task.” “Neurosexism promotes damaging, limiting, potentially self-fulfilling stereotypes.”14. The file-drawer phenomenon. “This contributes to the so-called file-drawer phenomenon, whereby studies that do find sex differences get published, but those that don’t languish unpublished and unseen in a researcher’s file drawer.”15. Debunks myths with glee. “So let us, with healthy skepticism, summarize all of this as clearly as we can. Nonexistent sex differences in language lateralization, mediated by nonexistent sex differences in corpus callosum structure, are widely believed to explain nonexistent sex differences in language skills.” “The speculations of a few scientists quickly evolve into the colorful fabrications of popular neurosexism – the subspecialty within the larger discipline of neurononsense.”16. The four basic pieces of advice for anyone considering incorporating neuroscientific findings into a popular book or article about gender.17. One of the most astute observations of the books, too good not to share. “Genes don’t determine our brains (or our bodies), but they do constrain them. The developmental possibilities for an individual are neither infinitely malleable nor solely in the hands of the environment. But the insight that thinking, behavior and experiences change the brain, directly, or through changes in genetic activity, seems to strip the word ‘hardwiring’ of much useful meaning. As neurophysiologist Ruth Bleier put it over two decades ago, we should ‘view biology as potential, as capacity and not as static entity. Biology itself is socially influenced and defined; it changes and develops in interaction with and response to our minds and environment, as our behaviors do. Biology can be said to define possibilities but not determine them; it is never irrelevant but it is also not determinant.” Read that again, and again.18. A look at parenting. “It seems, then, that gender stereotypes, even if perhaps only implicitly held, affect parents’ behavior towards their babies.”19. Interesting facts that have an impact. “The Dr. Seuss books are rightly classics, adored by children and a joy of rediscovery for parents. Yet as Lamb and Brown observe, in all the forty-two books he wrote, not one has a female lead in its central story.”20. Copious amounts of notes and they are linked. A comprehensive bibliography.Negatives:1. Very little not to like about this excellent book but I would have probably started with defining the differences between key terms like sex and gender. The layperson tends to use these terms indiscriminately.2. The book does a phenomenal job of at the very least casting doubt or outright debunking commonly held misconceptions on gender issues; however, it doesn’t succeed nowhere near as well on defining the real science behind sex differences.3. Using scientific claims from centuries ago to debunk easily comes across as strawman arguments or low hanging fruits to grab on to.4. At times I feel she doesn’t necessarily apply the same amount of scrutiny to those studies that support her argument versus those that don’t. I prefer the instances where she simply states that we just don’t know.In summary, this was truly an eye opening and cognitive-dissonance inducing book. One of the great things I take from this book is to not fall prey to poor science and specifically, be alert of neurosexism. I’m not a neuroscience to know if all the conclusions that Dr. Fine makes are sound or not, but she is very persuasive and the book made me think. Witty, provocative and just fun to read, I highly recommend it!Further suggestions: “Science and Gender” by Ruth Bleier, “The Myths of Gender” and “Sexing the Body” by Gisela Kaplan, “Gene Worship” by Lesley Roger, “Sexual Science” by Cynthia Russett, and “The Social Psychology of Gender” by Laurie Rudman and Peter Glick. These books were recommended notably by the author."

It makes sense to me.There're a lot of dog-ears and underlines, but some of them are angry marks. I got very frustrated with about the middle two-fourths of it. The first fourth and the last fourth, I was much more interested in.The last fourth was what I thought the entire book was to be about---about how society and subtle clues train modern ""gender identity."" Because, dude, kids are sponges.The first one-fourth had some great lines and sentiments I agreed with, at their base. That is, perception is reality.The middle two-fourths? (Okay, I'd say, half, but it sounds wrong, since it's in the middle.) Yeah, that frustrated the ever-loving shit out of me. Because it seemed (to me, at least) she spent all that time leading up to making a point that I already knew. And I kept thinking, over an over, what she waited to say until the end of all that.And it just about killed me.Basically, I'm a fucking amateur, and I know that the way you live your life---your thought processes change the way your brain works. That is to say, nothing is hard-wired.Guess what; you spend your life obsessing over math, and the parts of your brain that deal with math are going to be larger than someone who's not obsessed with math, Einstein.So the fact that she laid it on thick, and laid on all this evidence, without just saying that until the end, just about killed me.Well, now, if she'd said it in the beginning of that section and went on, I would have had no problem. It just---it kept making me wonder if she was ever even going to point that out.And it drove me nuts.A mild frustration had nothing to do with her, but with a few of experiments they carried out. I mean, yeah, I was frustrated with the (sometimes) wild interpretations of some of them (as I was meant to be), but there were a few that hit me, personally. A few for which, all I could think, ""And then they had one more step to do."" Especially with the empathy tests. Oh, I could come up with such an awesome empathy test...There were even a couple of times that Fine really let me down. One, when she cited the behavior of rats to prove her point. And then, later, when rats didn't quite prove her point, she mentions how we really can't equate the behavior of rats to humans. It made me sad, because she had a point both times, but... Oof.Lots of good stuff, but a lot of frustration as well. And not nearly as much ""hard information"" as I was expecting. At least, not the kind I was expecting, because the kind of hard information I was looking forward to was only in the last quarter of the book. And there was not nearly as much of it as I had been hoping for. It barely went beyond what I already knew. It didn't challenge me the way I was hoping to be challenged.But enough of that. Let's end on my favorite line of the book. It has to do with the Bem children, who were raised as just about as ""gender nuetral"" as anyone could ever manage. The boy tells a classmante, "" 'being a boy means having a penis and testicles.' ""The boy who was critisizing him for wearing barrettes to nursery school comes back with, ""Everyone has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.""That right there made the whole book for me.Anyway, the point of the rating is not that I really liked it, but that I really like that it exists."
265,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,5,"I was really impressed with ‘Delusions of Gender’. It dissects and summarises research clearly, critiques stereotypes intelligently and analytically, and keeps the tone witty and readable yet more academic than journalistic. I found the synthesis of neuroscientific research on sex differences extremely helpful. Media articles that cheerfully claim sexist stereotypes are biological inevitabilities make me very angry. Fine channelled that same anger into writing an excellent rebuttal, which will be very useful to remember when the next wave of pseudo-scientific claims hit the papers.This book makes an excellent accompaniment to Living Dolls: The Return of Sexism, which focuses more on the societal implications of biological determinism-based sexism. It also brings up the important debate about applying scientific methodologies to research questions that are based on unquestioned stereotypes and assumptions. An example of this is the use of 'masculinity' as an objective index, like height and weight. As Fine states, including fMRI scans makes any research findings appear more weighty and scientific. Yet inferring major psychological differences between the sexes from disputed differences in brain structure is very problematic. The brain and the mind are not congruent. I’d also pick out for praise the latter chapters on young children learning about gender. That was not something I’d ever really thought about before, but of course kids observe how carefully adults sort people into the ‘man’ and ‘woman’ boxes. This part of the book includes amusing summaries of research investigating whether and/or why girls play more with ‘girl toys’ and boys with ‘boy toys’. I particularly liked the idea that some researchers made a My Little Pony into a desirable boy’s toy by painting it black, trimming its mane, and sharpening its teeth. Conversely, girls were ‘enchanted by… the lavender-satin-covered guns and holster, and the pink furred war helmet’. By the age of five, these children had picked up from their surrounding the sexual dimorphism of toys. As Fine points out, even clothes for newborns are gendered. She makes a strong argument for social over biological gender determinism.Apologies for eliding sex and gender in the paragraph above. Fine does not critique the gender binary or cover intersectionality issues in much depth, as these are not the focus of her book. Neither are they ever mentioned (that I’ve seen) by media articles that oversimplify and distort neuroscience to excuse sexism. Nonetheless, similar effects (regarding ‘stereotype threat’ for example) are noted to impact on women and ethnic minorities in the earlier chapters covering sociological research. There’s clearly a lot more work needed in the fields of sociology and neuroscience, but I agree with Fine that scientists have a responsibility to consider their unwitting assumptions about gender. As well as the ways in which their findings will be treated by a depressingly sexist media."
266,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie,4,"All those studies that say that women are bad at math and men are bad at relationships because their brains are hardwired that way can be very discouraging, and there are a LOT of those studies. But Cordelia Fine has looked into those studies and found flaws in them. Add into that a large number of studies that show how easy it is to jigger people’s minds into doing better or worse at tasks depending on how they are psychologically primed before hand and we can see where the author is coming from. Fine’s thesis is rather than there being any physical difference between male and female brains, the differences that we see in math scores are there because our culture expects them to be there. Even when people attempt to raise their children in a gender neutral environment, culture intervenes. On TV, in schools, in children’s books, in the clothing sold to children- everything is divided into genders, and females end up less adventuresome, more nurturing, expected to be nicer and not fight, and to focus on home and caring rather than invented and discovering. Toys for girls and boys are separated, and children who choose to play with toys for the opposite gender are disapproved of, especially boys who play with dolls or other ‘girl’ toys. Tomboys may be told to act more ladylike, but boys will get beat up by other boys. The core of her argument is that studies where test takers are primed to consider themselves members of sets other than gender yield different results than tests taken when the test takers are told things like “men traditionally do better on this test”. For instance, when a group of males and females take a test and are told before hand that people who go to certain colleges (colleges that some of the test takers go to) do better on this same test, the test takers conform to this and the males and females who belong to the colleges mentioned both do better on the test than the non-certain collegians- and the males and females in that group score the same as each other on the test under these conditions. These tests have been done numerous times by different researchers, and the results are always the same- the test takers conform to expectations set up before the test. Therefore, psychology trumps brain structure where intellectual subjects are concerned. It’s an interesting proposition, and one I think needs to be investigated more- much more. There’s a lot still to be untangled in gender studies. Intellectual abilities are jumbled in with emotional tendencies, and I definitely think they should be considered separately. She pretty much ignores the effect of hormones on emotional states except for the case of fetal testosterone. I think that while this book doesn’t settle any gender issue questions, it does cast a lot of doubt on previous studies and urges us to look at them much harder."
267,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237879-elaine-nelson,5,"I happened to run across this book at the library having forgotten that it was in my ""to-read"" list. I'm SO glad I did, and given a certain pair of somewhat ranty posts a couple of months back, only wish I'd read it sooner! I literally could not put it down - as in: ""no really, I need to go to bed/back to my desk from lunch/off the bus, I have to put the book away.""In short, social construction of gender: you're soaking in it. (And especially, your brain is soaking in it.)1) Priming & stereotype threat affect everything. Just checking gender on a form before taking a test changes womens' performance, especially on math tests. More priming (being told that the test relates to gender, watching a gender-stereotyped commercial, etc) increases the effect.2) Most of the ""science"" as it's filtered through to the popular media is a disaster of half-baked assumptions, small and/or poorly-constructed experiments, and willful misunderstanding of the actual results. (She tears apart one popular writer; it's kinda fun.)3) Worse, those lame results create a feedback loop, combined with the impossibility of gender-neutral child-rearing, that increases the problem of stereotype threat, and makes genuine social change more difficult.Le sigh. Not only is the feminist struggle not over, we may actually be hitting a really hard spot.On the plus side, I'm fired up now. Not just that, but I'm thinking more about my own personal construction of gender identity, including my history with math and science. There's a post I wrote about my life with math a while back, and there I wrote about it as a choice between writing and math - now I'm seriously looking back and wondering about the effect of gender stereotypes, and whether I might have come to computing sooner given different circumstances. I think it's worth noticing that choices exist in a constrained environment, constrained both by the external world, and by our own unexamined or incompletely-formed attitudes.As for the writing style, it's a delightful read. She's got a sharp conversational tone that pulled me in; I even read the footnotes.HIGHLY recommended, great in combination with Pink Brain Blue Brain."
268,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5324619-noor,5,"""Delusions of Gender"" has proved to be one of the most informative and interesting books I've read this year. The book consists of three parts that essentially discuss gender-stereotypes, Neurosexism, and the struggles of attempting to raise children in a gender-neutral environment.Cordelia starts by explaining how implicit and explicit beliefs are two separate things that don't always correlate. Despite ""consciously"" holding certain beliefs, there is a clash between the reflective self and our associative memory which is heavily influenced by the social environment surrounding us. When gender becomes salient and constantly primed in our daily life, it seeps into our perception of others and of ourselves, and we often do it in stereotypical ways. The book is filled with numerous experiments that support this idea. When we categorise people as male or female, we are instantly activating gender associations that affect our behaviour, values, performance etc. A perfect manifestation of this activated gender-inequality is how women are treated in a workplace dominated by men. Women experience segregation, exclusion, harassment and attack just by showing up to work basically.The second part of the book focuses on neurosexism and was the most difficult for me to digest; simply because I was unaware of just how much these popular neuroscientific claims are based on shaky empirical evidence. Gender stereotypes are legitimised by these pseudo-scientific explanations, and often become part of popular media. Neurosexism activates gender stereotypes which feeds into the public sphere + affects attitudes, identity & performance. It all leads us to become our own self-fulfilling prophecies.And the last bit of the book should be read by all parents who try to raise their children in a gender-neutral environment. It goes way beyond giving boys barbie dolls and giving girls fire trucks.All in all, this was an eye-opener for me when it comes to neuroscience and how it's used to reinforce old-fashioned stereotypes/roles through covering them with the finery of science.PS: Cordelia is quite witty. Found myself laughing out loud at times."
269,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4508080-julie-bozza,5,"A bit of a hard slog to read, especially as the few moments of humour didn't really suit me (too sarcastic). However, the important thing is that Fine makes vital headway towards an understanding of gender that I can really get behind. Gender difference is not 'hardwired' into us, and Fine deftly demolishes the pseudo-science that tells us otherwise. Fine quotes Kimmel in asserting 'gender difference is the product of gender inequality'; that is, we create and recreate gender difference while interacting with our society. The process begins at such an early age that many new parents, no matter how gender-neutral they try to be, end up assuming that gender difference is biologically or neurologically innate in their children. Fine does a good job of explaining why this happens, and how it will ultimately be worth it if we keep plugging away the gender-neutral objective. Fine also articulates how permeable the boundaries can be between our own sense of self and society's sense of who we are - or should be. I've struggled to articulate my struggles with this, but I've often felt like an asymmetrical heptagonal peg who is nevertheless forced (by otherwise well-meaning folk) to fit into the round hole that society makes available to me. Gender is certainly one aspect of this. My social sciences tutor told me I was making too much of the external forces - but now I've found Fine to back me up and explore the implications, and I feel inordinately grateful. Lastly, Fine ends with a note of hope. While she has shown how deeply woven gender difference (and hence gender inequality) is in our society, she has also shown that it is malleable. We can change this, though it will take time and effort. Let's keep trying! I would love to see what we can become when we are so much freer to be ourselves, whoever we may be."
270,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Subtitle: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference. Cordelia Fine, while an apparently well-read and quite competent scientist, makes no pretense of objectivity in this book. She's got an axe to grind with a whole school of research that aims to use modern brain science to convince us that male and female brains are intrinsically, fundamentally, and irrevocably different. Oh, and I also think the picture of her on the dust jacket is pretty hot. I just love imagining her getting all worked up about this. Wait, did I say that out loud?Anyway, Fine's point is best illustrated by an anecdote from the experience of a four year old named Jeremy, who had been raised by parents who were extraordinarily zealous gender-neutral parents. He decided one day to wear barrettes to nursery school, and gets into an argument with another boy, who says that he is a girl. Finally, Jeremy pulls down his pants and points out that he has a penis, as a way of making his point. The other boy says, “Everybody has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.”Whether you think the parents who let their boy wear barrettes to school were weird here, or the society that teaches a boy that the difference between male and female has more to do with hairstyle than genitals, depends on your opinions about gender (and society) generally. So does a lot of other (less amusing but more substantial) evidence, published in scientific journals or mainstream media, that Fine takes us on a tour of.Some of it is related to the general fallacy of all brain-scan evidence. Just because we see a difference in brain activity (using MRI or some other method), doesn't mean it's genetic or otherwise hardwired. All it shows is that it happens in the brain, and really, if we're talking about thoughts, attitudes, emotions, and so forth, where else would we expect it to happen? Also, like muscles, areas of the brain can grow larger or smaller over time as they are used more or less (whether for cultural reasons or any other), so again evidence from brain scans, while perhaps useful for other purposes, tells us nothing about whether differences in behavior are primarily biological or cultural. Seeing a brain scan, however, tells us that it has something to do with biology, and our instinctive reaction is still to divide things into biological and cultural, and if it's one it must not be the other.There is a long and well-documented history of scientific attempts to explain to us why women and men are Just Different, in ways that have nothing (directly) to do with procreation. The suspicious thing is that, while the rationales differ from decade to decade and from one century to the next, the conclusions always point in the same direction. Fine takes us on a thoroughly readable tour of this history, spiced up a bit by her, at times, barely contained rage.Make no mistake, this is not an even-handed weighing of the evidence; it is rather a very well-documented and data-driven polemic. If it were written by a man, I'd say that the confrontational and science-oriented analysis is very typical of a masculine style. Instead, I'll say it's an emotional treatment, showing a feminine inability to maintain objectivity on scientific topics. Either way, it's a hoot to read."
271,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6537005-daniel,3,"""Delusions of Gender"" is an engaging read, well-written and incisive. Cordelia Fine makes a convincing argument that gender differences in performance assessed through various metrics are to a large extent the result of social cues, reactions to internalized stereotypes, and unconscious priming. Her critique of studies of gender differences in psychological experiments is comprehensive, and her depiction of the current state of sexism is both convincing and often horrifying.Unfortunately, her fixation on discrediting both contemporary pop-psychology books selling innate gender differences and the arguments of dusty sexists from centuries past comes off a bit like clubbing baby seals (or possibly arm-wrestling five-year-olds). Her arguments against current neuroscientific techniques--especially neuroimaging using techniques like fMRI--fall particularly flat, as she relies repeatedly upon equating sophisticated real-time 3d measurements of blood-flow in the brain with crude volumetric measurements of skull capacity used by those sexist scientists of yore. This is trite and annoying.Likewise, she fails to engage biological and evolutionary arguments in any meaningful sense, instead relying on the tired allegation that evolutionary psychology and biology are only sexist justifications for relegating women to lives of domestic drudgery. She perhaps hopes that her readers are not savvy enough to Wikipedia the fields. Her argument that structural differences between the brains of men and women (after criticizing imaging and anatomical studies, she grudgingly admits that these do exist) compensate for differences in physiology to produce similar behaviors in males and females is interesting and may even be true to some extent--humans male and female, after all, must accomplish many of the same tasks to survive--but is unsupported and feels like hand-waving. She does not engage with the concepts of hormonal modulation of brain activity or neurotransmitter/receptor distribution and prevalence to any great degree. She brushes off the striking possibility that biological differences may predispose men and women toward different goals irrespective of nebulous measures of aptitude or spurious notions of ""natural gender roles."" The human brain she seems to prefer is the black box too intricate to be understood on a mechanistic level, a network of abstract associations accessible only to psychologists distributing questionnaires and bubble sheets to college students participating in studies for course credit.So, while entertaining (and perhaps convincing to audiences disinclined to read it critically or who already embrace its ideological underpinnings), the book's thesis does not strike home, and Fine's claim that it is dangerous for researchers to ask these questions at all should be disturbing to any reader who values science over ideology."

273,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley,3,"I tried to read this book near the beginning of quarantine, in hard copy, and my poor overloaded brain just couldn't handle it. If I had read this in audio, a format my brain can handle for serious subjects, I probably would have rated it much higher, and gotten through it much faster (and I'll be honest, retained more than 10% of it). So take this review with a grain of salt. (P.S. I just googled that phrase, and it evolved from something Pliny the Elder wrote in 77 A.D. Language is so weird.) I will be trying it again maybe in a couple of years by audio. Unless someone can point me in the direction of a book on the same subject that is more recent that I should read first (this was published in 2010).Aside from that issue, this book is also less of a thing on its own than it is the author debunking other scientific studies or books, things that people take as a given, or as ""proven"" by science. Cognitive bias plays a huge role not only in the behavior of test subjects, but in the minds of the scientists performing the studies. Which is enjoyable in its own way, but not quite what I was expecting. The book is very heavy on cautioning the reader about these types of studies, since gender is so hard to study, and really just instills a healthy amount of scientific skepticism. I remember it being a lot of, this isn't proven, we actually don't ""know"" as much as we think we do.I can't emphasize how much my brain did not retain any of the information I read, so this is really just a useless review. Judging by my friends' reviews on Goodreads, I just really need to give it a break, and then pick this up again some time down the road when my brain is being more amenable."

Honestly though, some male scientists... if you have to create and pursue patently absurd theories about differences in the brain to justify why you can't patiently listen to your wife or make your kids a sandwich, that's pretty undeniably pathetic.

276,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113545-nancy,5,"READ IT.Cordelia Fine's examination of the many popular books and research studies which purport to prove that the male and female brains might as well belong to different species is simply brilliant. I gobbled this non-fiction up like it was a light lunch after a hard day's manual labor. Every page was packed with jaw-dropping information - horrifying methodological flaws, research which argues two diametrically opposed concepts, and outright deception, all designed to prove that men and women are not and cannot possibly be equal. Like, here's one example: Fine mentions the author of a popular book on the subject, who cites research about ""mirror neurons,"" (women have more of them, which supposedly makes them more empathetic.) The author mentions a study of therapists which indicated that the most successful therapists are those that ""mirror"" their clients words, gestures, and verbal patterns. Interestingly, (says the author), ALL of the successful therapists were women. Because they have more mirror neurons, and are more attuned to others, right?WRONG. Cordelia Fine looked up the study (thank you, Cordelia! That would be a big nuisance for the Average Reader) and as it turns out? ALL OF THE THERAPISTS IN THE STUDY WERE WOMEN. Yeah, that's right. They only recruited women for the study, so the study proves absolutely nothing about men vs. women. And if you think this sort of thing is an anomaly, wrong again - Fine's detailed work found this sort of thing occurring over and over again. Moreover, Fine is terrific at highlighting how the social context of everything men and women do contributes to these gender stereotypes, and at explaining how gender bias affects the neuroscientific research. This is an absolutely fantastic book - I have the urge to acquire copies for every teacher, every employer, every parent on the planet. It made me rethink more of my life that I would have believed possible. Seriously, even if you think you would disagree with it: READ IT. If nothing else, you will enjoy Fine's smooth and witty prose."

If you’re the type of person who enjoys nitpicking underpowered studies over methodological errors that affect validity and throwing shade at poor referencing while also being a flagrant feminist this is for you. I am not sure how this would go down for other people without a background in neuroscience because those parts were undoubtedly my favorite although I see how that part of the book could be too technical and heavy. I didn’t learn anything new science-wise but I did discover that there still are some fucking assholes willing to forgo the science completely just in order to tell you that your female brain HAS TO KNOW HOW TO EMPATHIZE AND BE NURTURING and that of course those morons have a wide audience just dying for any shard of pseudo-evidence that may point to the fact that their daughters are meant to be breeding subservient cows and that their sons will bring about the rapture. Of course this book proves yet again the only truth known to humans besides inevitable death and that is that men are trash. Besides that, I wholeheartedly enjoyed the psychology aspects of the book and if I had any doubt about the ubiquity of gender then it was all erased in the last part where she lists study after study proving how the idea of gender and how everything is gendered almost from birth and how early toddlers take on these ideas and digest them almost regardless of how unisex parents attempt to make their environments at home; the world at large is sexist. Go figure. And then there’s the ever expanding body of evidence that simply makes it clear that women have always always always been just as capable as men and that as the gender gap closes (despite the screeching and howling of men) women find their ways into board room and ORs and mines and factories and fucking haters continue to come up with more sophisticated schemes of bullshit to make it seem like we can’t but we’re doing it anyway.

279,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14821636-andrew-fish,1,"The differences between men and women have probably been a topic of debate since the dawn of time. In recent decades, however, as society has progressed from subsistence and survival to consumerism and choice the issue has gained a degree of salience. The question of whether women are actively held down in their careers or whether they passively make decisions which close off paths to advancement becomes more than a curiosity when careers become both a means to achieve a better life and a source of fulfilment in themselves. And earlier in life, the science of gender difference could make a significant difference to educational outcomes if it could be robustly investigated. The time, it seems, is right for a good scientific look at the subject.Unfortunately, this isn't it.Fine is a psychologist by training, and whilst there's definitely scope to study the issue of gender difference through psychology, she seems reluctant to do this in any depth. The opening section of the book which nominally covers this ground is quite thin on actual studies and seems instead to rely heavily on anecdote, giving the book the feel more of a polemic rather than an academic assessment. What science there is, meanwhile, is treated in an uneven manner, promoting the studies which suit the central thesis and denigrating any which don't. Frequently, Fine goes beyond the studies and draws conclusions which aren't supported by any of the evidence she has presented.So, for example, when looking at a study about the effect of priming on women's mathematical abilities, she not only accepts the results without question, she positively crows about the fact that the women did better than the men without the priming. For this to be a valid observation, both male and female participants would have to have an even spread of intellect, presumably using some kind of test as part of the selection process. The trouble with this is that you are then pre-determining the results: if the selection test were gender-neutral, the gender-neutral part of the study would be consistent with the selection process and you would end up with roughly equal results for men and women. If the theory were correct, there would then be lower results for the women in the gender-biased part. If the selection process were not gender-neutral, meanwhile, then if the theory held the women would seem equal to the men in the selection process and better in the gender-neutral study itself.From those results you could prove that priming made a difference to the test results, but not that there was any inherent difference between male and female aptitude in itself. To go further would be circular reasoning (something Fine criticises about another study later in the book).It's like the constant claim that girls are better at school - fifty years ago, the reverse was claimed. What changed in between? The education system. Clearly there is some kind of difference between the sexes there (something Fine seems pathologically averse to) but if one system of education produced stronger male results and the other stronger female all you can say is that different methods favour the sexes differently - you can't claim this makes one superior to the other.In other places, such as the behaviour of women in male-dominated careers, it seems there are no studies Fine can draw on. By definition, you'd find it hard to create a female-dominated version of the same career for comparison, but it doesn't stop the author from coming to conclusions about the effect of those environments without anything beyond anecdote and hypothesis.The most detailed analysis in favour of her argument comes toward the end of the book, when looking at the gender stereotypes to which children are exposed in their early years and how this affects their choice of toys and sense of dress. Unfortunately, here she has narrowed the argument too much: it may be demonstrable that social forces drive boys to wear blue and girls pink, but this would hardly explain the more abstract alleged differences between the sexes. When was the last time your child came home claiming they'd been excluded from the spatial reasoning group on the basis of gender?With the results which don't suit her, the author is more exacting. When looking at a study about infant response to faces and mobile phones, for example, she casts aspersions on the methodology, hypothesises about all kinds of ways the results could have been skewed (always assuming such skews would be systematically biased in the same direction) and even implies that the experimenters could have been acting out of an unconscious gender bias themselves. Apart from the unprofessionalism of casting aspersions without evidence, it seems weak to subject a study you don't like to this level of criticism when it could have been equally true of any of the studies supporting the case. Stepping outside her field, Fine is dismissive of biological studies and applies an extremely shaky attack on neurology - regarding it as an inadequately direct proxy measure of brain activity that is subject to confirmation bias. If that's true of neurology, what it does it say about psychology as a reliable indicator? This attack allows her to dismiss any conclusions from the field she doesn't like, but again she's all too quick to accept any that she does. She constantly falls for the same fallacy, that if you can debunk a very specific prediction made by someone in a particular field, you can dismiss any evidence from that field when it doesn't suit your agenda. The constant comparisons to long-dismissed theories such as brain-pan measurement are a reductio ad absurdum argument with little logical validity and the quotes which open most chapters - generally over a century old and clearly not acceptable to modern readers - come across as an attempt to prime the reader into a form of indignation which switches off their reasoning faculties for the rest of the chapter and allows them to accept Fine's arguments without criticism. I even spotted a very old psychologists' trick - starting a sentence with ""by now you will all be thinking"" - which is a blatant attempt at manipulation of the reader.Here and there we find snippets of actual information - a chance remark about spatial reasoning differing in babies of only a few months old, for example - but unless they fit the central argument, they are passed over quickly. An anecdote about a woman having been masturbated over, by contrast, is alluded to several times across a chapter. And there's little gender-balance in the topics themselves either: apart from a brief mention of female intuition right at the beginning, the book focuses almost entirely on areas where women are alleged to be deficient. The impression given is that this is a book written by someone working out their own issues rather than dispassionately looking at the field.And this is often a problem with psychologists. Freud's obsession with mother fantasies reeked of projection, Kahneman's instinct over reason view of the brain suggests a man struggling to justify his own bad decisions. To see what Fine's problems are you need only look at the language she uses, the metaphors she chooses and the examples she latches onto. The book is riddled with misandistric metaphor and there are a number of coded attacks on her husband. Take the chapter where she envisages a hypothetical job-swap with her spouse. When looking at his ability to do her job, she attacks his literacy - comparing it to a ten year-old. She then looks at her ability to do his job, but rather than admit any limitation on her own part, she sidesteps the issue and instead turns it into another backhanded attack on her husband - in this case the likelihood of his nagging her from beyond the grave. It doesn't take a degree in psychology to spot the signs of an inferiority complex.I don't pretend to know what the biological basis for behaviour is, and I accept that there are a lot of bad studies out there and bad books using the results. But for a book whose byline is ""the real science behind gender difference"" I was expecting more than just a series of attacks. And it's a shame, because the issue is both interesting and important. In my opinion, there clearly are elements of behaviour that are inherited (how else would cuckoos transmit their parasitical tendencies?) but what that inheritance mechanism is and how far it reaches into human behaviour has, as far as I can see, yet to be established. To claim it has no effect on humans would be to think as those who attacked Darwin because whilst they could accept evolution, they felt that to claim humans were a product of evolution was a step too far. One science Fine didn't look at all is anthropology, which for anyone who is genuinely looking for the true reasons for gender difference would seem the obvious place to start. I suggest for those who are after a book which informs them rather than just gives them a reason to be angry at the state of the world, that would be a better field to explore."
280,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17161968-fergus-murray,5,"Delusions of Gender, by Cordelia Fine, is an extended critique of efforts to scientifically study differences between the sexes, and the efforts of many writers to apply alleged science in their writings about such differences. The book is rich in technical detail, which might bog down some readers, but most of those details are fascinating. Fine is a lucid and entertaining writer, especially in her more acerbic moments - of which there are plenty here. She finds a lot of shoddy science and shameless misuse of would-be science that would raise the hackles of any neuroscientist or feminist, let alone someone like her who happens to be both.This is a book with an agenda, and political agendas tend not to sit comfortably with science - but to pretend that politics never seeps into science while nobody is looking would be disingenuous. In fact, Fine's agenda - to bring out the reasons to doubt science that supposedly demonstrates innate differences between sexes - is at least as much scientific as political, and I think it is legitimate. It is something to bear in mind while reading this book, though, and there are times she goes out of her way to present things in such a way as to minimise the possibility of interpretation in terms of innate differences. As far as I can see she always stops short of misrepresenting the science, though, and the whole approach needs to be seen in the context of discourse which routinely takes essential differences for granted, whether the evidence supports them or not.The book is divided into three parts. The first is 'Half-changed World', Half-Changed Minds, which largely focuses on the interplay of cultural expectations and attempts to measure sex differences scientifically. This largely consists of accounts of experiments demonstrating the effects of cultural norms on things that people might be interested in measuring, and experiments which fail to take these factors into account. For example, she looks at experiments investigating the effect of telling the subjects what 'the latest science' has to say about the sorts of tests they are about to perform, to show that girls do significantly better on mathematical tasks if they think that science says they should. Even more subtly, females rate their mathematical ability as worse after they have just been reminded of their sex by having to tick a box at the beginning to say they are females. This gives us an interesting lens for looking at gender differences in maths tests which disregard the weight of cultural expectations, and indeed at systematic tendencies for females to choose less mathematical study and career paths. Having established many profound and subtle ways that social expectations and structures shape behaviours and perfomance, the theme of the second part of the book is Neurosexism - premature efforts to explain differences in behaviour and performance with reference to the brain, rather than society. Fine's most basic point is that it is rather soon to be looking for explanations of most of these things in neuroscience, when societal explanations have not been ruled out, and the relationship between the mind and the brain is still so unclear. More than that, she shows time and again that many authors are disturbingly willing to go way beyond what neurology can tell us, while pretending that they are not. Perhaps the single worst offender here is Louann Brizendine, author of The Female Brain, a serial abuser and inventor of neuroscience to back up her ideas about the differences between males and females - but she is one of many. Fine makes the point that people have been finding 'explanations' for sex differences in the brain for well over a century, from the observation that female brains tend to be a bit lighter than male ones through to modern notions of hardwiring. At the same time, people have routinely assumed that all kinds of observed differences between the sexes are natural and inevitable, when later experience has regularly shown them to be no such thing.The final section is titled Re-Cycling Gender, and it concerns itself with the future of gender relations and the science of sex. Fine is worried about the cyclical nature of some kinds of self-fulfilling prophecy - about dodgy science being used to teach yet another generation of young men and women that there are certain natural roles that they ought to be filling, certain characteristics they should expect to have. She emphasises again how difficult it is to pick apart innate and culturally conditioned differences, and the importance of keeping an open mind about questions that science has not yet been able to settle. With a better scientific understanding of the role of society in forming the mind and the brain, and a sceptical eye on the interesting but inconclusive findings of neuroscience, we may approach true sexual equality yet. Without such circumspection, as Fine argues, we may find ourselves sliding back to ideas about the sexes which are both unhelpful and ill-founded.This is an important book, because the trend towards explaining sex differences with impressive-sounding neurological findings has great potential to set back ideas about gender roles, on the basis of evidence which is far flimsier than it might look. Because we are shaped by our ideas, this has major practical, political ramifications - it is not just good science that is at stake here. There is no doubt that some will resist Fine's approach for its politicisation of science, but I would be inclined to see it more as exploring the role of pre-existing, unexamined political bias, rather than introducing politics to the debate. Delusions of Gender is compelling, informative and perhaps most impressively, funny. I recommend this highly to anyone with any interest in neuroscience or gender.'This review first appeared at http://everything2.com/title/Delusion..."
281,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11030012-jade,4,"There have always been many (pseudo)scientific books on the shelves attempting to explain the differences between the sexes, of which the most common differences usually consist of men having a more result-orientated, mathematical approach, and women having a more relationship-orientated, emotional or empathic approach (never mind about non-binary people, queers, etc.). This is usually shown as something that’s unchangeable; something written down by genetics and made clear by the way our brains differ so much from each other. Also, some (if not most) of these books claim that that’s what also causes traditional gender roles – women are simply better suited for housework, and men better suited for business. Often, this is also where an evolutionary argument about caves, hunting, and gathering comes in.Unfortunately, the tendency to display such dated, sexist views isn’t only found in pseudoscientific writers (an example being the ever annoying book always present in every single bookstore I visit, Men Are from Mars Women Are from Venus by John Gray), but also in qualified scientists or psychologists: The Female Brain by Louann Brizendine, being a great example, or The Sexual Paradox: Extreme Men Gifted Women and the Real Gender Gap by Susan Pinker. Though I can’t deny the big influence popular ‘science’ books have on the general reading audience, as an aspiring psychologist myself, the fact that qualified psychologists spew this kind of garbage worries me intensely.Which is why I’m quite glad to have found this wonderfully well-researched book by Cordelia Fine, in which she attempts to refute many claims made by popular psychology books concerning traditional gender roles/behaviour, and differences between the sexes. Does she succeed? In my opinion, yes, and she does so with humour, solid arguments, and a critical approach. I really enjoyed the fact that she doesn’t only bring up arguments to counter interpretations and results of research used in the aforementioned popular psychology books, but she also attacks the way certain methods of research are used and interpreted (case in point: neuroimaging).A very complete, interesting, witty, and fun read. I commend Cordelia Fine for writing such a wonderfully clear answer to the dated views on the differences between the sexes, and emphasizing the importance of valid research (and the interpretation of it). I can definitely recommend this to anyone who’s interested in reading more about gender roles/behaviour."
282,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7300053-nicole-ysabet,5,"This book was a cogent, readable rebuttal to all the pop-psychology, pseudoscientific nonsense published about how alleged differences between men and women make men thuggish morons who can't wash a dish and women lightheaded bimbos incapable of understanding math. It made me want to do a dance of joy. Also, when talking about neuroimaging experiments which supposedly prove these ""hardwired"" differences, Cordelia Fine wrote this paragraph:[...] When looking for changes in blood flow between two conditions, researchers search in thousands of tiny sections of the brain (called voxels), and many researchers are now arguing that the threshold commonly set for declaring that a difference is ""significant"" just isn't high enough. To illustrate this point, some researchers recently scanned an Atlantic salmon while showing it emotionally charged photographs. The salmon--which, by the way, ""was not alive at the time of scanning""--was ""asked to determine what emotion the individual in the photo must have been experiencing."" Using standard statistical procedures, they found significant brain activity in one small region of the dead fish's brain while it performed the empathizing task, compared with brain activity during ""rest."" The researchers conclude not that this particular region of the brain is involved in postmortem piscine empathizing, but that the kind of statistical thresholds commonly used in neuroimaging studies [...] are inadequate because they allow too many spurious results through the net.If that doesn't make you want to read at least a little more, I have no idea how to talk to you."
283,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5763962-cara-pulley,5,"We like to believe that sexism is on the decline, but is it really? This author doesn't think so and after reading her book, I'm convinced.She says that gender distinctions continue to exist and that they start from our very beginnings - pink is for girls, blue is for boys. Gender comes to define us and these distinctions shape our abilities and interests. Certain skills are identified as male or female: Men are rational and brave; and Women are empathetic and nurturing. These assumed traits then impact our adult lives and the choices we make such as what fields to study in college, and what careers to pursue afterwards.Most alarming to the author is that the new fancy pants field of neuroscience observes physical differences in the brain between men and women and they are using those results to explain pre-conceived notions about the abilities of men vs. women instead of considering the impact of outside social forces. To create a causal relationship where none exists is to eliminate a possible true explanation before it is ever considered.A thought provoking book."

Fine looks at gender essentialism and at the biases of studies and media reporting, and suggests that we've been too quick to throw up our hands and say, ""but it's biological!"" If little girls have only been wearing pink for fifty years, then clearly that can't be a hard-wired preference.As a woman who preferred baby blue to pink for my childhood frilly dresses, liked to play with my brother's trucks and robots as well as my own stuffed animals (dolls are creepy and as for the toy . . . ironing board?!!! . . . I was given, the less said the better), and whose index finger is shorter than her ring finger, but who grew up to be much better at language than math (but my mom was great at math) and is more empathetic than competitive, I've always found these gender assumptions questionable, as I seem to be all over the board. Fine, writing for a popular audience, sometimes seems to skim the surface, but her work is clear, logical, and sometimes pleasantly snarky."
285,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5925863-bastian-greshake-tzovaras,5,"A great book debunking many of the scientific claims often made on gender differences, especially from the neuroscience/psych-crowd. It always irks me if people want to use scientific publications to justify stuff like this. Not because I'd prefer them not to be true, but because I'm only too aware that making it through peer review isn't a good indicator about how well done the experiments were. Just ask Rosie Redfield and her successful push against the stupid arsenic life-stuff. Many different studies are discussed in some detail and lots of flaws in those studies are shown: lack of controls and/or statistical power, multiple testing, the general problems of fMRI, alternative explanations fitting the data as well or even better etc. Recommended for: everyone who likes to see overselling scientific claims destroyed, people who want to disarm the arguments of those who believe in inherent gender differences.

291,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25360918-blair,2,"Are Men Systemisers and Women Empathisers?We all know that men are from Mars and women are from Venus, right? There is much in current popular literature suggesting gender differences are innate, therefore we should adapt to them. This book treats us to even more of this kind of thinking found in the older literature, which looks absurd to modern eyes. The author asks if the modern stuff is really much different. She has two main points: Neuroscience is not nearly advanced enough to reach any conclusions that link brain structure to behaviour. And it is difficult to distinguish between genetic and culturally acquired characteristics from observing society, because there are so many confounding factors and sources of bias. So what is all this recent writing really based on?Things Don’t Seem So Bad in My BubbleI appear to live in a bubble. The reports I read about sexual discrimination and harassment are shocking, and do not reflect my personal experience. I realize that my brain’s shrivelled left hemisphere renders me oblivious to any social interaction that is not blindingly obvious, but I am married to a successful female senior manager. We even talk sometimes (when she makes me). I don’t hear much about discrimination, while I do hear about a lot else. And there are plenty of women in senior positions where she works. But society is not uniform, and large parts of it are clearly very different from where I stand.Beyond Reason: Why I Would See it That WayWhy is gender stereotyping so persistent when many of us claim to have moved beyond that? She tells us,
“One can be reflective about explicitly held (rational) knowledge, and it may be reasonably consistent. However, associative knowledge seems to be fairly indiscriminate about what it takes on board. So you may not be consciously sexist, yet sexist patterns you have unconsciously picked up may assert themselves.”
Our unconscious attitudes are learned when we are young, and they are learned from the behaviour one sees, not the words our parents or schools use to tell us how they think we should be. Now in our daily lives our choices are made instinctively, and the rational mind finds a justification that is not sexist. Thus gender discrimination is perpetuated without us even knowing or wanting to do it.As a male systemiser, I have done the job expected of me. I will now get in touch with my feminine side and talk about personal experience. Yes, personal anecdotes do not add up to data, but apparently there is no worthwhile data anyway, so why not?The Geek SpeaksI spent my career writing software, so the following got my attention:
“What, for example, springs to mind when you think of a computer scientist? A man, of course, but not just any man. You’re probably thinking of the sort of man who would not be an asset at a tea party. The sort of man who leaves a trail of soft-drink cans, junk-food wrappers, and tech magazines behind him as he makes his way to the sofa to watch Star Trek for the hundredth time.”
I went to a university that did not yet have a computer science department. A few friends and myself invented our own. We failed the courses we were supposed to be taking because we spent all day playing on the computers we hacked into. Need I mention that none of us were women?The reason has nothing to do with junk-food wrappers, or that the female devotes too much of her brain to emotion processing to write code. It is more about obsession. We males may or may not be better systemisers, but we are more willing to blow an entire school year to spend all day systemising about one thing. What, women can’t afford to take risks like that? Don’t be silly, they can always get married and have babies if things don’t work out. Or they can switch into social sciences, and get an easy degree doing sloppy research that verifies pre-existing beliefs. Our author delights in presenting examples of that. Oh, that was typically insensitive of me. My oxytocin levels must be low again.The only hint of truth in her paragraph is the lack of social skills of many of us in the industry. Combine obsession with that lack of social skills, and one suspects the presence of a few autism-linked genes in the crowd. But I am sure Ms. Fine can cherry-pick a few flawed autism studies to demolish that notion.One can argue that these different attitudes are entirely socially constructed. But it is also possible that something real is being socially reinforced. There is some evidence, especially from identical twin studies, which link personal characteristics to genetics. It is hard to believe that there is no sex linkage involved. It is easy to mock jumping to evolutionary conclusions about math skills or preferring pink to blue. But the human species does have a long history with a gender devoted to hunting and warfare. Add in the fact that males are expendable, and a genetic inclination toward risk taking does seem somewhat credible. Obsession may have been selected for similar reasons. Those autism genes must be there for a reason. You know, men have to focus on their hunting, while the women multitask feeding the baby while inventing agriculture, food storage and other requirements for civilization.Oops, I have slipped back into systemising again. It must be the lack of connection between my hippocampus and cerebral cortex.Empathising Has Its RewardsThere were not many female programmers where I worked, and they did not last long. They get promoted into management. Oh, the discrimination! The gender distribution at my company was interesting. As one might expect, the programmers were generally male and the quality control people were female. Were women excluded from the more creative jobs because of their sex? Perhaps the difference is that while I would think about work when I got home, they were thinking about home while they were at work. A more demanding job gets in the way. And if that is because of social conditioning, it is hardly the fault of corporate management.The other female “ghetto” at our company was in program management. This critical senior position requires both strong technical knowledge and excellent social skills to deal with our external clients. It was mainly women who had the magic to pull it off. (I suppose that more developed inferior parietal lobe makes all the difference.) The consequences of gender stereotyping, legitimate or not, can cut both ways.I lost my job there because I did not step up into a more collaborative role. I was lucky to last as long as I did happily coding away. Industry is changing, communicating and collaborating across boundaries is becoming ever more important. My stereotypical mind sees these as female qualities, but does it matter? Any company that discriminates against women is suicidal, because it needs those skills. But then, a lot of companies are slowly committing suicide. I suspect there may be a connection here.Social Skills in the Strip ClubsApparently there is an increasing tendency to use strip clubs for conducting business. Ms. Fine documents this and concludes,
“In effect, just as their fathers might have taken clients to one of the gentlemen’s clubs of Pall Mall, so brokers today take their business associates to see lap dancers. The old gentlemen’s clubs banned women – some still do – whereas the lap-dancing establishments merely intimidate them.”
My emotional reaction (yes, I do have them) is anger and disgust. Gentlemen’s clubs, for all their faults, at least had some class. Strip clubs are for scum. Reducing men to scum to preserve their pathetic privileges is beneath contempt.I can’t help wondering if some of those men are not entirely comfortable with what is going on, but feel they have little choice. It looks like nothing has changed – the bullies are still in charge.Geeks like me tend to go to Star Trek conventions rather than strip clubs, if they go anywhere at all. (I go to a book club.) We also cannot help noticing that the more sexist the man, the more women are attracted to him. (They appeal to her associative memory rather than her reason, which should know better.) Bullies get what they want. Sexism is a social skill, and one that is well rewarded. But I suspect some of these organizations are going to bully themselves into bankruptcy because they can’t keep up with a changing world. It can’t come soon enough.But there is another explanation for this behaviour: the men have been desensitized to sexual stimulation by constant exposure to pornography. For some reason Fine chooses to completely ignore this issue. So tell me, which affects men’s attitudes toward women: a dubious book by Louann Brizendine or twenty hours a week of hard-core degrading pornography?Second ThoughtsThis conclusion is being written a several weeks after the rest of the review. What I wrote above is essentially an emotional response to the book. Now the emotion has worn off, I will treat this book as the scientific work it claims to be.The material about how women are limited by social conditioning and outright repression, while socially important, leads to only one scientific insight: we cannot judge the potential of women by their present level of achievement. That is all. But it does serve to soften up the reader for her message. It worked on me.The book may serve as a needed corrective for some of the simplistic stereotyping in the name of science out there. But is it also guilty of similar distortion in pursuit of an agenda that claims gender differences are a social construction? In other words, is this simply the other side in a culture war being fought using science as the battleground?That culture war has been raging for hundreds of years. Conservatives claim human nature is fixed, and we dare not change the ancient wisdom that keeps our impulses contained. Liberals contend that the mind is a blank slate, and humanity is perfectible with the right thinking and social intervention. I suspect those of you who like this book are really cheering that our side is beating up their side, like in a sporting event. And she is administering quite a beating. But this is an empirical question, not a matter of opinion. If you don’t understand the science, how can you possibly know if the scientific arguments here are valid?I don’t know much about neuroscience either, but I detect a number of serious warning signs pointing to a lack of objectivity. Despite the cheery tone, this book mainly consists of an unrelenting attack on any viewpoint that suggests gender differences are innate. It is hard to tell when she is criticizing scientific studies or amateur opinion, which has the effect of implying that the dumbest ideas are also the opinions of any scientists she is opposed to. This kind of polarization has no place in science. A look at the author’s publication list shows mainly commentaries rather than research, mainly aimed at a popular audience. This looks more like a campaigner rather than a scientist.Good science writing shows a passion for understanding the subject and a desire to explain it to the reader. There is none of that here. Instead, explanations are presented only as necessary for the reader to understand the words in her debunking effort. She overwhelms the reader with the sheer volume of scientific information. But volume does not add up to truth if that information is selective.I do not know to what degree gender differences are innate. Who knows, maybe our author has it mostly right. I simply cannot not trust this work to tell me that. Even when she tells me that neuroscience is not advanced enough to draw conclusions about gender, my response is that seems reasonable, but I will look elsewhere to find out. [A quick look suggests she is wrong.]This book is a great reminder that there is a lot of bad science writing out there. Unfortunately it is also a good example of that, yet another example of science corrupted by ideology."
292,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4973578-iset,5,"You've probably heard that men are just naturally better at spatial awareness and logical tasks whilst women are just naturally better at verbal and nurturing tasks. You've probably heard that men and women's brains are different. You may even have heard exasperated parents trying out gender neutral parenting exclaiming that their little girl/boy just seems to naturally gravitate towards pink dolls/blue trucks - it must be biological! Delusions of Gender debunks it all, delving into the real science behind these spurious claims.The book is divided into three sections. First, the sociological and psychological studies of gender differences. How are we to explain, for example, the fact that men seem to consistently do well in maths and women in verbal reasoning? It turns out - quite easily. The notion that men are better at certain things and women are better at other things is an entrenched stereotype. Consistently, in a scientific testing environment, when groups are primed before the test to buy into these stereotypes, they conform to cultural and societal demands of their gender - but when the groups are primed beforehand with a statement that no gender differences have ever been found, then both men and women defy the stereotypes and perform better even than the other gender at tasks that their own gender is supposedly bad at. This result bears out over countless tests, and reveals that when a categorised group is placed under 'stereotype threat', the distracting negative thinking that results significantly impacts on their performance in a given task - conversely, when the group is relaxed and not under threat, their true abilities are freed. There's more. When asked to self-report about how analytical/empathising they are, men and women will report that they fall into the stereotypes about their gender. However, when rigorous scientific is set up - for example, unwittingly recording two individuals in a room, after the fact asking one to note down their thoughts as they watch back the video, and then asking the other to guess what the first was thinking; both men and women show the same amount of ability to read people's faces and intuit their emotional state. In other words, self-reporting is unreliable as a true test of gender differences, and many tests claiming to prove a difference are unscientific, inadvertantly priming the subjects beforehand to perform according to existing social pressures.Okay, so social pressure is affecting people. But what about all that medical evidence that men and women's brains are different? It's actually very flimsy. Testosterone testing of babies in utero is not actually done by testing the baby's blood - but by testing the mother's blood, or the amniotic content. There are significant problems with several of the studies involving scanning the brains of adults - such as some studies only using female test subjects and not comparing against men in any way. Other studies are post-mortem. Several employ circular reasoning in their write ups to assert some sort of gender difference. ""But I've seen those different coloured scan images of male versus female brains on the internet!"" you may cry.
""It’s important to realise that the patches of colour you see on brain scans don’t actually show brain activity. Although it may seem as though fMRI and PET enable you to see a snapshot of the brain at work (or, as popular writers Allan and Barbara Pease claim, ‘to see your brain operating live on a television screen’), this simply isn’t the case. ‘Unfortunately, these pretty pictures hide the sausage factory’, as one neurologist put it. fMRI doesn’t measure neuronal activity directly. Instead, it uses a proxy: changes in blood oxygen levels. (PET uses a radioactive tracer isotope, which attaches itself to glucose or water molecules, to indirectly track blood flow.) Busier neurons need more oxygen and (after an initial dip) active brain regions have higher levels of oxygenated blood, because blood flow to that area increases. The oxygen is carried by the haemoglobin in red blood cells, and haemoglobin has slightly different magnetic qualities depending on how much oxygen it’s carrying. This creates a signal in the scanner (which pulses a magnetic field on and off). Neuroscientists then compare the difference in blood flow in brain regions during the task they’re interested in, with blood flow during a control task or rest state. (Ideally, the control task involves everything the experimental task entails – button pressing, word reading and so on – except for the psychological process you’re particularly interested in.) Researchers test for significant differences in blood flow in various locations of the brain regions during the two tasks, and if tests indicate that it is significant, a blob of colour is placed at the appropriate location on the picture of the brain. In other words, those coloured spots on the brain represent statistical significance at the end of several stages of complicated analysis – which means there’s plenty of scope for spurious findings of sex differences in neuroimaging research.""
Moreover, for every 1 neuroscience study claiming to find a difference between genders, there are 19 where both men and women were tested, no difference was discovered, and since the researcher's topic of interest was something other than gender differences the write up does not draw attention to the result - that no gender differences were found. The studies that do claim to find a difference also receive significantly more attention from people specifically looking for evidence to prove biological gender differences, and because the topic is so hot in our modern world.Alright, so neuroscience evidence is flimsy at best, and psychological testing of adults is unreliable unless performed with proper rigour. But what about children? Haven't there been tests of babies that show they prefer blue trucks/pink dolls? Unfortunately many of the tests claiming to prove such are also highly suspect. One study, for example, tested 3 month old male and female babies to see whether they preferred a Human face or a geometric mobile. Lo and behold, the male babies seemed to prefer the mobile, whilst female babies seemed to prefer the faces. Aha! But the face and the mobiles were presented to the babies separately, not simultaneously as is usual in such tests to truly determine if a baby prefers one thing over another - it's impossible therefore to say whether a preference was displayed. Furthermore, the researchers in the study knew what gender each baby they tested was, and there's reason to suspect they themselves may have been biasing the results by presenting a more friendly face to the female babies and moving the mobile around more with the male babies - creating the result they expected to see. Oh. Oh, indeed. More scientifically rigorous studies of babies' habits show that there is no difference in a six month old's preference between trucks and dolls - but this does kick in from around 9 months onwards. Is it nature asserting itself over nurture? Well, no. Another study tested whether babies truly do prefer a female face over a male one (i.e. testing whether we are biologically predisposed to think of women in a nurturing role). The babies seemed to prefer the female face - but all the babies in the first test group were being looked after primarily by their mothers. The test was repeated with babies who were being primarily raised by their fathers - those babies preferred male faces. Consistently, the results show environment over biology is the determining factor.The mother who had attempted gender neutral parenting only to wail; ""In the end I found her tucking the toy truck into bed and cuddling it! It must be biology!"" was asked by a shrewd researcher whether, in that household, one of the parents did most of the putting to bed - of course, it turned out the mother always put her daughter to bed. The fact of the matter is, even the most determined parents trying to employ gender neutral upbringing face an uphill struggle. Most actually bias the result, implicitly disapproving certain activities for their child despite outspokenly advocating them, and testing of children's reactions to words versus body language clearly demonstrates that they pick up on implict cues much more than verbal ones. Even with dedicated parents, the outside world is often intent on reinforcing gender roles, from multinational companies to the disapproving looks of less progressive parents. Gender is in fact the most strongly emphasised of any of the ways of categorising people, and children pick up on this from an exceptionally young age - it therefore becomes important for them to seek out clues about how to discover a person's gender and how to identify themselves, so they can fit in with a social group and be accepted - even when the parents at home are encouraging them to explore all kinds of play and activities.I'm going to conclude with the account of a couple who went the extra mile in their determination to raise their son and daughter in a truly gender neutral environment. Sandra and Daryl Bem, two psychologists;
""did all that they could to reduce the normally ubiquitous gender associations in their children’s environment: the information that lets children know what toys, behaviours, skills, personality traits, occupations, hobbies, responsibilities, clothing, hairstyles, accessories, colours, shapes, emotions and so on go with being male and female. This entailed, at its foundation, a meticulously managed commitment to equally shared parenting and household responsibilities. Trucks and dolls, needless to say, were offered with equal enthusiasm to both children; but also pink and blue clothing, and male and female playmates. Care was taken to make sure that the children saw men and women doing cross-gender jobs. By way of censorship, and the judicious use of editing, WhiteOut and marker pens, the Bems also ensured that the children’s bookshelves offered an egalitarian picture-book world... The second part of the Bems’ strategy was to, in place of the usual information about what it means to be male or female, promote the idea that the difference between males and females lies in their anatomy and reproductive functions. Your typical preschooler enjoys a detailed knowledge of gender roles, but remains a bit hazy regarding the hard, biological fact that males differ from females when it comes to the allocation of such items as penises, testicles and vaginas.'[O]ur son Jeremy, then age four, … decided to wear barrettes [hair slides] to nursery school. Several times that day, another little boy told Jeremy that he, Jeremy, must be a girl because ‘only girls wear barrettes.’ After trying to explain to this child that ‘wearing barrettes doesn’t matter’ and that ‘being a boy means having a penis and testicles,’ Jeremy finally pulled down his pants as a way of making his point more convincingly. The other child was not impressed. He simply said, ‘Everybody has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.’'Unlike their peers, Jeremy and Emily were discouraged from using socially determined trappings such as hairstyle, clothing, accessories or profession as a guide to a person’s biological sex. If the children asked whether someone was male or female, their parents ‘frequently denied certain knowledge of the person’s sex, emphasizing that without being able to see whether there was a penis or a vagina under the person’s clothes, [they] had no definitive information.’Step forward, please, all those parents who go to similar lengths to protect their children from acquiring prevailing cultural assumptions about gender. And do try to avoid being trampled in the rush. The Bems’ efforts, I think you’ll agree, seriously outclass what we normally, generously, think of as gender-neutral parenting... The intensity and scope of the Bems’ efforts offer a helpful hint as to just how gendered children’s environments are. To this day social structure, media and peers offer no shortage of information to children about masculinity and femininity.""

293,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"Delusions of Gender: The Real Science Behind Sex Differences by Cordelia Fine“Delusions of Gender” is an outstanding book that compels you to take a closer look at society and our science as it relates to gender issues. Academic psychologist and author, Dr. Cordelia Fine with a sharp sense of humor and an excellent grasp of what constitutes good science dismantles many claims of what can be considered neurosexism. This is a very provocative book as it tackles claims about male and female brains, and the gender cycle. This fascinating 371-page book is broken out into the following three parts: 1. Half-Changed World, Half-Changed Minds, 2. Neurosexism, and Recycling Gender.Positives:1. Engaging, witty, and provocative book. This is also a well-researched book that is not afraid to tackle head on popular misconceptions on gender.2. A fascinating and often misunderstood topic of sex differences.3. The science is accessible and the narrative flows nicely thanks to an infusion of humor. The book is also full of interesting anecdotes.4. Great use of counter-research to combat what Dr. Fine has concluded is poor science.5. One of the best features of this book is Dr. Fine’s relentless research against commonly held misconceptions by well-known scientists and authors. She makes a very compelling case against at best poor science or worst pseudoscience.6. Makes the very strong case on how society can impact associative memory. “Unlike explicitly held knowledge, where you can be reflective and picky about what you believe, associative memory seems to be fairly indiscriminate in what it takes on board. Most likely, it picks up and responds to cultural patterns in society, media and advertising, which may well be reinforcing implicit associations you don’t consciously endorse.” “When gender is salient in the environment, or we categories someone as male or female, gender stereotypes are automatically primed.”7. The impact of stereotypes. “Research suggests that the deadly combination of ‘knowing-and-being’ (women are bad at math and I am a woman) can lower performance expectations, as well as trigger performance anxiety and other negative emotions.”8. A look at mothers versus single women. “While parenthood served as no disadvantage at all to men, there was evidence of a substantial ‘motherhood penalty’. Mothers received only half as many callbacks as their identically qualified childless counterparts.”9. The reality of sexual harassment.10. Covers many issues regarding gender equality, including at home. “As Gloria Steinem recently reminded a journalist, “The idea of having it all never meant doing it all. Men are parents, too, and actually women will never be equal outside the home until men are equal inside the home.” Great quote.11. So are there biological roots to gender inequality? This is a recurring theme in the book.12. The reality is that there is a lot of poor science involving gender issues. “There’s something a little shocking about the discrepancy between the weakness of the scientific data on the one hand and the strength of the popular claims on the other.”13. A fascinating look at Neurosexism. “The sheer complexity of the brain makes interpreting and understanding the meaning of any sex differences we find in the brain a very difficult task.” “Neurosexism promotes damaging, limiting, potentially self-fulfilling stereotypes.”14. The file-drawer phenomenon. “This contributes to the so-called file-drawer phenomenon, whereby studies that do find sex differences get published, but those that don’t languish unpublished and unseen in a researcher’s file drawer.”15. Debunks myths with glee. “So let us, with healthy skepticism, summarize all of this as clearly as we can. Nonexistent sex differences in language lateralization, mediated by nonexistent sex differences in corpus callosum structure, are widely believed to explain nonexistent sex differences in language skills.” “The speculations of a few scientists quickly evolve into the colorful fabrications of popular neurosexism – the subspecialty within the larger discipline of neurononsense.”16. The four basic pieces of advice for anyone considering incorporating neuroscientific findings into a popular book or article about gender.17. One of the most astute observations of the books, too good not to share. “Genes don’t determine our brains (or our bodies), but they do constrain them. The developmental possibilities for an individual are neither infinitely malleable nor solely in the hands of the environment. But the insight that thinking, behavior and experiences change the brain, directly, or through changes in genetic activity, seems to strip the word ‘hardwiring’ of much useful meaning. As neurophysiologist Ruth Bleier put it over two decades ago, we should ‘view biology as potential, as capacity and not as static entity. Biology itself is socially influenced and defined; it changes and develops in interaction with and response to our minds and environment, as our behaviors do. Biology can be said to define possibilities but not determine them; it is never irrelevant but it is also not determinant.” Read that again, and again.18. A look at parenting. “It seems, then, that gender stereotypes, even if perhaps only implicitly held, affect parents’ behavior towards their babies.”19. Interesting facts that have an impact. “The Dr. Seuss books are rightly classics, adored by children and a joy of rediscovery for parents. Yet as Lamb and Brown observe, in all the forty-two books he wrote, not one has a female lead in its central story.”20. Copious amounts of notes and they are linked. A comprehensive bibliography.Negatives:1. Very little not to like about this excellent book but I would have probably started with defining the differences between key terms like sex and gender. The layperson tends to use these terms indiscriminately.2. The book does a phenomenal job of at the very least casting doubt or outright debunking commonly held misconceptions on gender issues; however, it doesn’t succeed nowhere near as well on defining the real science behind sex differences.3. Using scientific claims from centuries ago to debunk easily comes across as strawman arguments or low hanging fruits to grab on to.4. At times I feel she doesn’t necessarily apply the same amount of scrutiny to those studies that support her argument versus those that don’t. I prefer the instances where she simply states that we just don’t know.In summary, this was truly an eye opening and cognitive-dissonance inducing book. One of the great things I take from this book is to not fall prey to poor science and specifically, be alert of neurosexism. I’m not a neuroscience to know if all the conclusions that Dr. Fine makes are sound or not, but she is very persuasive and the book made me think. Witty, provocative and just fun to read, I highly recommend it!Further suggestions: “Science and Gender” by Ruth Bleier, “The Myths of Gender” and “Sexing the Body” by Gisela Kaplan, “Gene Worship” by Lesley Roger, “Sexual Science” by Cynthia Russett, and “The Social Psychology of Gender” by Laurie Rudman and Peter Glick. These books were recommended notably by the author."

It makes sense to me.There're a lot of dog-ears and underlines, but some of them are angry marks. I got very frustrated with about the middle two-fourths of it. The first fourth and the last fourth, I was much more interested in.The last fourth was what I thought the entire book was to be about---about how society and subtle clues train modern ""gender identity."" Because, dude, kids are sponges.The first one-fourth had some great lines and sentiments I agreed with, at their base. That is, perception is reality.The middle two-fourths? (Okay, I'd say, half, but it sounds wrong, since it's in the middle.) Yeah, that frustrated the ever-loving shit out of me. Because it seemed (to me, at least) she spent all that time leading up to making a point that I already knew. And I kept thinking, over an over, what she waited to say until the end of all that.And it just about killed me.Basically, I'm a fucking amateur, and I know that the way you live your life---your thought processes change the way your brain works. That is to say, nothing is hard-wired.Guess what; you spend your life obsessing over math, and the parts of your brain that deal with math are going to be larger than someone who's not obsessed with math, Einstein.So the fact that she laid it on thick, and laid on all this evidence, without just saying that until the end, just about killed me.Well, now, if she'd said it in the beginning of that section and went on, I would have had no problem. It just---it kept making me wonder if she was ever even going to point that out.And it drove me nuts.A mild frustration had nothing to do with her, but with a few of experiments they carried out. I mean, yeah, I was frustrated with the (sometimes) wild interpretations of some of them (as I was meant to be), but there were a few that hit me, personally. A few for which, all I could think, ""And then they had one more step to do."" Especially with the empathy tests. Oh, I could come up with such an awesome empathy test...There were even a couple of times that Fine really let me down. One, when she cited the behavior of rats to prove her point. And then, later, when rats didn't quite prove her point, she mentions how we really can't equate the behavior of rats to humans. It made me sad, because she had a point both times, but... Oof.Lots of good stuff, but a lot of frustration as well. And not nearly as much ""hard information"" as I was expecting. At least, not the kind I was expecting, because the kind of hard information I was looking forward to was only in the last quarter of the book. And there was not nearly as much of it as I had been hoping for. It barely went beyond what I already knew. It didn't challenge me the way I was hoping to be challenged.But enough of that. Let's end on my favorite line of the book. It has to do with the Bem children, who were raised as just about as ""gender nuetral"" as anyone could ever manage. The boy tells a classmante, "" 'being a boy means having a penis and testicles.' ""The boy who was critisizing him for wearing barrettes to nursery school comes back with, ""Everyone has a penis; only girls wear barrettes.""That right there made the whole book for me.Anyway, the point of the rating is not that I really liked it, but that I really like that it exists."
295,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,5,"I was really impressed with ‘Delusions of Gender’. It dissects and summarises research clearly, critiques stereotypes intelligently and analytically, and keeps the tone witty and readable yet more academic than journalistic. I found the synthesis of neuroscientific research on sex differences extremely helpful. Media articles that cheerfully claim sexist stereotypes are biological inevitabilities make me very angry. Fine channelled that same anger into writing an excellent rebuttal, which will be very useful to remember when the next wave of pseudo-scientific claims hit the papers.This book makes an excellent accompaniment to Living Dolls: The Return of Sexism, which focuses more on the societal implications of biological determinism-based sexism. It also brings up the important debate about applying scientific methodologies to research questions that are based on unquestioned stereotypes and assumptions. An example of this is the use of 'masculinity' as an objective index, like height and weight. As Fine states, including fMRI scans makes any research findings appear more weighty and scientific. Yet inferring major psychological differences between the sexes from disputed differences in brain structure is very problematic. The brain and the mind are not congruent. I’d also pick out for praise the latter chapters on young children learning about gender. That was not something I’d ever really thought about before, but of course kids observe how carefully adults sort people into the ‘man’ and ‘woman’ boxes. This part of the book includes amusing summaries of research investigating whether and/or why girls play more with ‘girl toys’ and boys with ‘boy toys’. I particularly liked the idea that some researchers made a My Little Pony into a desirable boy’s toy by painting it black, trimming its mane, and sharpening its teeth. Conversely, girls were ‘enchanted by… the lavender-satin-covered guns and holster, and the pink furred war helmet’. By the age of five, these children had picked up from their surrounding the sexual dimorphism of toys. As Fine points out, even clothes for newborns are gendered. She makes a strong argument for social over biological gender determinism.Apologies for eliding sex and gender in the paragraph above. Fine does not critique the gender binary or cover intersectionality issues in much depth, as these are not the focus of her book. Neither are they ever mentioned (that I’ve seen) by media articles that oversimplify and distort neuroscience to excuse sexism. Nonetheless, similar effects (regarding ‘stereotype threat’ for example) are noted to impact on women and ethnic minorities in the earlier chapters covering sociological research. There’s clearly a lot more work needed in the fields of sociology and neuroscience, but I agree with Fine that scientists have a responsibility to consider their unwitting assumptions about gender. As well as the ways in which their findings will be treated by a depressingly sexist media."
296,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie,4,"All those studies that say that women are bad at math and men are bad at relationships because their brains are hardwired that way can be very discouraging, and there are a LOT of those studies. But Cordelia Fine has looked into those studies and found flaws in them. Add into that a large number of studies that show how easy it is to jigger people’s minds into doing better or worse at tasks depending on how they are psychologically primed before hand and we can see where the author is coming from. Fine’s thesis is rather than there being any physical difference between male and female brains, the differences that we see in math scores are there because our culture expects them to be there. Even when people attempt to raise their children in a gender neutral environment, culture intervenes. On TV, in schools, in children’s books, in the clothing sold to children- everything is divided into genders, and females end up less adventuresome, more nurturing, expected to be nicer and not fight, and to focus on home and caring rather than invented and discovering. Toys for girls and boys are separated, and children who choose to play with toys for the opposite gender are disapproved of, especially boys who play with dolls or other ‘girl’ toys. Tomboys may be told to act more ladylike, but boys will get beat up by other boys. The core of her argument is that studies where test takers are primed to consider themselves members of sets other than gender yield different results than tests taken when the test takers are told things like “men traditionally do better on this test”. For instance, when a group of males and females take a test and are told before hand that people who go to certain colleges (colleges that some of the test takers go to) do better on this same test, the test takers conform to this and the males and females who belong to the colleges mentioned both do better on the test than the non-certain collegians- and the males and females in that group score the same as each other on the test under these conditions. These tests have been done numerous times by different researchers, and the results are always the same- the test takers conform to expectations set up before the test. Therefore, psychology trumps brain structure where intellectual subjects are concerned. It’s an interesting proposition, and one I think needs to be investigated more- much more. There’s a lot still to be untangled in gender studies. Intellectual abilities are jumbled in with emotional tendencies, and I definitely think they should be considered separately. She pretty much ignores the effect of hormones on emotional states except for the case of fetal testosterone. I think that while this book doesn’t settle any gender issue questions, it does cast a lot of doubt on previous studies and urges us to look at them much harder."
297,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237879-elaine-nelson,5,"I happened to run across this book at the library having forgotten that it was in my ""to-read"" list. I'm SO glad I did, and given a certain pair of somewhat ranty posts a couple of months back, only wish I'd read it sooner! I literally could not put it down - as in: ""no really, I need to go to bed/back to my desk from lunch/off the bus, I have to put the book away.""In short, social construction of gender: you're soaking in it. (And especially, your brain is soaking in it.)1) Priming & stereotype threat affect everything. Just checking gender on a form before taking a test changes womens' performance, especially on math tests. More priming (being told that the test relates to gender, watching a gender-stereotyped commercial, etc) increases the effect.2) Most of the ""science"" as it's filtered through to the popular media is a disaster of half-baked assumptions, small and/or poorly-constructed experiments, and willful misunderstanding of the actual results. (She tears apart one popular writer; it's kinda fun.)3) Worse, those lame results create a feedback loop, combined with the impossibility of gender-neutral child-rearing, that increases the problem of stereotype threat, and makes genuine social change more difficult.Le sigh. Not only is the feminist struggle not over, we may actually be hitting a really hard spot.On the plus side, I'm fired up now. Not just that, but I'm thinking more about my own personal construction of gender identity, including my history with math and science. There's a post I wrote about my life with math a while back, and there I wrote about it as a choice between writing and math - now I'm seriously looking back and wondering about the effect of gender stereotypes, and whether I might have come to computing sooner given different circumstances. I think it's worth noticing that choices exist in a constrained environment, constrained both by the external world, and by our own unexamined or incompletely-formed attitudes.As for the writing style, it's a delightful read. She's got a sharp conversational tone that pulled me in; I even read the footnotes.HIGHLY recommended, great in combination with Pink Brain Blue Brain."
298,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5324619-noor,5,"""Delusions of Gender"" has proved to be one of the most informative and interesting books I've read this year. The book consists of three parts that essentially discuss gender-stereotypes, Neurosexism, and the struggles of attempting to raise children in a gender-neutral environment.Cordelia starts by explaining how implicit and explicit beliefs are two separate things that don't always correlate. Despite ""consciously"" holding certain beliefs, there is a clash between the reflective self and our associative memory which is heavily influenced by the social environment surrounding us. When gender becomes salient and constantly primed in our daily life, it seeps into our perception of others and of ourselves, and we often do it in stereotypical ways. The book is filled with numerous experiments that support this idea. When we categorise people as male or female, we are instantly activating gender associations that affect our behaviour, values, performance etc. A perfect manifestation of this activated gender-inequality is how women are treated in a workplace dominated by men. Women experience segregation, exclusion, harassment and attack just by showing up to work basically.The second part of the book focuses on neurosexism and was the most difficult for me to digest; simply because I was unaware of just how much these popular neuroscientific claims are based on shaky empirical evidence. Gender stereotypes are legitimised by these pseudo-scientific explanations, and often become part of popular media. Neurosexism activates gender stereotypes which feeds into the public sphere + affects attitudes, identity & performance. It all leads us to become our own self-fulfilling prophecies.And the last bit of the book should be read by all parents who try to raise their children in a gender-neutral environment. It goes way beyond giving boys barbie dolls and giving girls fire trucks.All in all, this was an eye-opener for me when it comes to neuroscience and how it's used to reinforce old-fashioned stereotypes/roles through covering them with the finery of science.PS: Cordelia is quite witty. Found myself laughing out loud at times."
299,0393068382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4508080-julie-bozza,5,"A bit of a hard slog to read, especially as the few moments of humour didn't really suit me (too sarcastic). However, the important thing is that Fine makes vital headway towards an understanding of gender that I can really get behind. Gender difference is not 'hardwired' into us, and Fine deftly demolishes the pseudo-science that tells us otherwise. Fine quotes Kimmel in asserting 'gender difference is the product of gender inequality'; that is, we create and recreate gender difference while interacting with our society. The process begins at such an early age that many new parents, no matter how gender-neutral they try to be, end up assuming that gender difference is biologically or neurologically innate in their children. Fine does a good job of explaining why this happens, and how it will ultimately be worth it if we keep plugging away the gender-neutral objective. Fine also articulates how permeable the boundaries can be between our own sense of self and society's sense of who we are - or should be. I've struggled to articulate my struggles with this, but I've often felt like an asymmetrical heptagonal peg who is nevertheless forced (by otherwise well-meaning folk) to fit into the round hole that society makes available to me. Gender is certainly one aspect of this. My social sciences tutor told me I was making too much of the external forces - but now I've found Fine to back me up and explore the implications, and I feel inordinately grateful. Lastly, Fine ends with a note of hope. While she has shown how deeply woven gender difference (and hence gender inequality) is in our society, she has also shown that it is malleable. We can change this, though it will take time and effort. Let's keep trying! I would love to see what we can become when we are so much freer to be ourselves, whoever we may be."
