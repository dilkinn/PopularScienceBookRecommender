0,0716711869,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14734538-roberto-rigolin-f-lopes,5,"We are in 1982, Mandelbrot got a computer and is showing us the geometry nature has been using. Have a good look through that window. Euclid’s geometry works for human made stuff (before 3D printers) but fails with clouds, trees, your hair (in that reflection) and so on. Nature is ingenious using a blend of chance, scale and repetition creating regular irregularities here called fractals. Being a maverik, Mandelbrot introduced the fractal dimension assuming that “to see is to believe”. Lucky us. There are plenty of puzzling plots in this book. Some even defined as nondifferentiable monsters, say a snowflake (Koch’s monster). What a show! But Madelbrot’s erudition and eccentricity makes this book a fractal itself. Often diverging and sharing bits of history and biographical notes. But always discussing typical anomalies within our aberrant universe."
1,0716711869,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858149-jack,5,"More a reference than a read, Mandelbrot was the first mathematician and naturalist to embrace fractals, second citizen equations that turned out to be elegant expressions of much of the patterns, sequences, arrangements we can see in molecules, simple life forms, organ systems, complex life forms, environments, ecosystems.... Some of it is user friendly, some needs to be skimmed by those who don't care about the math, but Mandelbrot is supportive of both kinds of readers."
2,0716711869,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1798996-valerie,0,"I have to admit that this book has been sitting on my shelves half-read and gathering dust. Mandelbrot's a fairly good speaker (from what I've seen of him on documentaries), but a trying and tedious writer.If you're looking for pretty pictures of fractals, there are some. If you're looking for the formula for the Mandelbrot set, it's here. If you want to understand the theory behind fractals, this is not the best introduction."
3,0716711869,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5685608-john-jr,4,"I believe this is where I first encountered such oddities of geometry and math, some of which were once thought to be monsters, as Cantor dust, Sierpinski triangles, Koch snowflakes, Peano curves, and the like. More important, it's where I first found explicated the idea of fractional dimensionality, from which I believe Mandelbrot derived the term ""fractal."" (The concept itself comes from a German mathematician named Hausdorff, but Mandelbrot generalized it). A solid understanding of the book is likely to be beyond anyone who lacks some training in higher mathematics, but the intrepid reader can still learn much. And nowadays, the Internet is at hand to assist, which wasn't the case when I read this in the 80s, not very long after its publication."
4,0716711869,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36960458-a-merlocks,5,"I have to admit it: I simply love this book. However, this book is quite out of the ordinary. If you are a linear reader, this book is definitely not for you. The book is about fractals, but the book is fractal. Its structure, the way topics are introduced and developed, everything in it resembles a fractal. But the book is useful, very useful: it has thousands of ideas. Most of them still unexplored. It asks many, many questions and let you find the answers. If you are a researcher, you will find plenty of inspiration in this book. If you are a non-linear, casual fractal lover you will enjoy this book. If you are a classical, linear reader you will stop reading not even one-fifth-way through."
5,0716711869,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4938865-jenniferruth,4,"Mandlebrot does a good job of writing for both mathematicians and those who simply have a passing interest. He makes it easy to skip over the in-depth mathematical sections whilst still providing solid explanations of the concepts being discussed. I will admit that some of it was way over my head and there were sections that could be quite dry. However, it was thrilling to gain a greater understanding of fractals like the Menger sponge, Koch snowflakes and Cantor Dust along with how they can be applied to things like star distribution in the galaxy or modeling ecosystems. Definitely worth reading."
6,0716711869,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11073574-elio-nakouzi,4,"A modern classic. The style of writing lurks between the literary and the scientific, very much like the topic itself."

10,0716711869,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51732576-tomos-walter,5,"I admit, I bought this on a whim while at university because I'd suddenly got into mathematics of fractals and their beauty (mainly due to a heavy dose psychedelic trip that opened my eyes up to the mathematics in nature all around us.. Fibonacci is literally everywhere - in petals, sunflower seeds, branches etc. Fractals are the shape they take.. clouds, coastlines, trees etc..)I understood about 10% of the mathematics, but this book deserves high praise because this is THE man himself who discovered the absolute simplicity of a formula Zn+1 = Zn2 + CThat produces the infinitely zoomable fractals we all know and love and that explains more about geometry that the numbers that make up natures patterns perfectly. Until Benoit B Mandelbrot.. we didn't know how to describe any shape that wasn't connected by two dots! Also, with this review I get to write my only fractal joke.. Q. What does the B in Benoit B Mandelbrot stand for ?A. Benoit B MandelbrotIts worth having on your shelf to look smart and in the know about all things fractal. There are plenty of stunning colour glossy prints in it, the text is readable, the mathematics is beyond me.Thankfully, its a great mix of all these things, so it will appeal to all levels."
11,0716711869,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70691206-pa-lay,5,"The fractal geometry of nature is about fractals and how it will never end. Each chapter is all different but related to fractals. It talks about things that will help you in your life if you are an engineer,mathematician, etc. This book gives you so much knowledge if you want to be a mathematician.Fractals are a genomic figure each part if it is that same as the hole.The thing I like about this book is that it teaches you so many things. You'r know more things in the book than others.It's teaching you about different things in nature and in other things like models for clothes, mountains, etc. The things I didn't like about was that I didn't understand some of the words because they were so complex to say. The words were to small in the book for me to read.I would recommend this book to a person who loves to read about math.If they like to learn about knew things I would recommended this book to them.I would give this to a person who is 10 or older. "
12,0716711869,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35178336-jan,4,"This is an absolute classic!Mandelbrot claims that patterns of Nature are so irregular that, compared with Euclid, Nature exhibits not simply a higher degree but an altogether different level of complexity. This is why he developed fractal geometry to describe the ""formless"" irregular and fragmented patterns around us. He called this family of shapes fractals.Mandelbrot provides a mathematical definition of fractal (p.15), but believes that one would do better without a definition (p.361). A common misunderstanding is that the notion of fractal is wedded to self-similarity. This is emphatically not the case (p.166). There are non-self-similar fractals. It all depends on how they are generated."
13,0716711869,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97401872-nikita-makretsov,5,"Amazing book, only getting better over time, even good read for non-mathematicians, like me. Fascinating process - the birth of new math allowing to model nature shapes - trees, clouds, rocks, mountains etc (including monstrous curves and snowflakes), direct from a father of computer graphics."

15,0716711869,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,4,"This beautiful book is about Mandelbrot's love of science, mathematics and all forms of knowing. He is humorous at times, dense, and waxing on about fractals and changes that are self similar. It is through the figure of a difference that something is known. Fractals are unique in that they are that difference regardless of scale, that is, as Mandelbrot said of Leibniz, that Leibniz first recognized a straight line as being a curve whose arbitrary measure was universally applicable by itself by any other arbitrary measure.Fractals are thus, a balance of form and measure and thus perfectly applicable to describing self similiarities that occur throughout various scales. By necessity these fractals are thus found in areas of maximal distribution where it be biological, informational, materially, socially or otherwise. Each bit of aggregate from each context can be traced through out some of the other contexts so that a distribution of their differences can be expressed mathematically as a formalization of unithood -- difference -- itself. Fractals can thus be understood as the limit of scaleless models of difference. Mandelbrot goes over a variety of contexts in which we can understand their expressedly different dimensions, as structured rules through time, or a static interface that modifies itself as scale is adjusted.At times, Mandelbrot can become overwhelming as he notices as particular ""cut"" in an equation, be it a variable or an expressed tendency, and in vocalizing it, circulates around that textual point to arrange chapters, whorls on whorls, in which sections and sections of sections let us know when one thing was described and another thing began.And so, as this is a book about the fractal geometry of nature, Mandelbrot shows us his love by talking admiringly of other mathematicians, many not celebrated, or fully acknowledged in their time. These technicians and their stories become the backdrop of those who developed this metric enough to let us see, and explore these subtle differences and their odd refinements. Indeed, it is really to those quiet, anonymous men, who established the halls of science that Mandelbrot writes this book to, for he would have liked for them to experience the joy he feels at being able to explore these monsters, while many of them did not, due to the contemporaneous level of mathematical understanding not yet understanding how to recognize (and thus, explore) the fractal nature of geometry in all its glories."
16,0716711869,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5944462-john-schneider,5,"""The Fractal Geometry of Nature"" is a book to be skimmed by many but read closely by few because its excellences are so uneven. On the one hand Mandelbrot creates truly wonderful images that allow most people to see how nature can be described by fractals. On the other hand he freely engages in formulas that any non-mathematician reads but fails to grasp. In all honesty I probably understood all of his images, 4/5 of his prose, and perhaps a 1/4 of his formulae. Still, I am far richer intellectually for reading his work and you will be too - but you might just want to look at the pictures."
17,0716711869,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1182259-ron-moreland,4,This book may just provide a hunger in a student to learn more about what fractals are in math. It is something I have studied for quite sometime and I hope to incorporate in my future math classes as a teacher. The images and mathematical properties of fractals are fascinating! Even if someone doesn't understand the mathematics behind fractals they can use technology to create some interesting fractals. 
18,0716711869,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2337219-chuck-weiss,5,"The complexity of nature as explained by the genius behind the study of fractals. I can never look at a fern leaf the same way again. The illustrations alone in this gem of a book are worth its purchase price. Gaussian curves, the Julia Set, all explained - albeit a little technical for me in many chapters."

It covers almost everything from a strictly geometrical point of view. Linear readers beware, you may get really annoyed by this book."
