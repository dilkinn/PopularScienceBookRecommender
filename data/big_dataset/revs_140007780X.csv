0,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,5,"Some of the best fun I have had in recent years of reading came in the two hours it took me to read this (including frantic back-tracks and hop-skips) fantastic book. Time is the hero of this collection and comes veiled in every twisted garb we can conceive, or rather, that Einstein can dream up. Einstein in his mad canter towards discovering the most revolutionary idea in science tumbles right down an imaginary wonderland in this book.What comes out of the recesses of Einstein's brooding on the nature of time and its relation to our lives is a montage of dreams that stretch our imagination to its limits. Time goes backwards, becomes personal, loops in on itself, slows down and speeds up according to your speeds and even stops altogether in his various dreams. But in the process we also see our own natures reflected in these bizarre behaviors that Einstein (or rather Lightman) subjects our protagonist to.While each of the 'worlds' are immensely entertaining and thought-provoking, the real crux of the book comes out in the interludes, which are the only times we meet the dreamer - Einstein. The book is an exploration of the twists and turns of the creative process, of the blind alleys and the arcane notions, the tomfoolery and the circus contortions that the creative imagination has to be twisted to before a coherent idea emerges.Of the dreams, numbering around thirty, some are particularly imaginative while others are variations on earlier themes. At first I was disappointed to encounter these variations and slight modifications, until I realized that Einstein, the dreamer/thinker, has to revisit ideas and try these mutations before he can proceed with them or discard them. Some of the ideas had to be short, some elaborate, some gripping, some boring and some outlandishly silly. But through it all, the constant feeling, almost magical, of being part of this evolution of thought and of peering into the wildest musings (even if imagined) that led to the conception of time as we know today makes the book a treasure to be revisited and indulged in at every opportunity.Did I mention that I read the book three times today?"
1,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani,4,"Einstein's Dreams, Alan Lightman Einstein's Dreams is a 1992 novel by Alan Lightman that was an international bestseller and has been translated into thirty languages. The novel fictionalizes Albert Einstein as a young scientist who is troubled by dreams as he works on his theory of relativity in 1905. The book consists of 30 chapters, each exploring one dream about time that Einstein had during this period. The framework of the book consists of a prelude, three interludes, and an epilogue. Einstein's friend, Michele Besso, appears in these sections. Each dream involves a conception of time. Some scenarios may involve exaggerations of true phenomena related to relativity, and some may be entirely fantastical. The book demonstrates the relationship each human being has to time, and thus spiritually affirms Einstein's theory of relativity.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز هجدهم ماه فوریه سال 1998 میلادیعنوان: روی‍اه‍ای‌ ان‍ی‍ش‍ت‍ن‌ (اینشتین)؛ نوشته: آلن لایتس؛ مترجم: مهتاب مظلومان؛ مشخصات نشر: تهران، نشر چشمه؛ 1376، در 112 صما تنها یک چهره از زمان را می‏بینیم، ولی شاید به نوعی زمان‏های مختلفی، در دنیای واقعی ما جریان داشته باشد، و این می‏تواند برهانی باشد، برای بسیاری از شگفتی‏های اطراف ما، که نمی‏توانیم برای آن‌ها، توضیحی منطقی داشته باشیم. «آلن لایتمن»، «اینیشتین» را، در روزهایی تصور می‏کند، که هنوز به فرضیه‌ ی زمان، دست نیافته است، و هر کدام از فرضیه ‏هایی را، که اینیشتین می‏توانست تصور کند، حدس زده، و داستانی راجع ‌به آن نوشته است، در داستان‏ها، ساکنان شهر کوچکی در سوئیس را، فرض می‏کند، که آن زمان در دنیای‌شان جریان دارد، و به این ترتیب چهره‏ های مختلف زمان را، معرفی می‏کند. در یکی از این دنیاها، زمان همانند یک دایره است، که پس از یک دور، تکرار می‏شود، و این دور، تا بی‏نهایت ادامه دارد. پذیرش این فرضیه، می‏تواند رخدادهایی را، که گاه می‏اندیشیم: پیشترها برای ما تکرار شده، توجیه میکند. در دنیای دیگری، برعکس دنیای پیشین، زمان همانند: یک رودخانه جریان دارد، و رو به جلو در حرکت است. حالا اگر، کسی به‌ خاطر اشتباهی، و یا رخدادی، از جریان جدا شود، و به وسیله‌ ی یک جریان انحرافی، به زمان پیشتر برگردد، می‏تواند آینده را تغییر دهد. هر رخداد کوچکی، که این شخص باعث آن شود، می‏تواند سیر تاریخ را، دیگر (دگرگون) کند. این فرضیه، رفتار آدم‏های عجیبی را، که از انسان‏های دیگر، به‌ شدت می‏گریزند، و سعی می‏کنند: باعث کوچکترین اتفاقی، در زندگی دیگران نشوند، توجیه می‏کند؛ آدم‏هایی که ما به آن‌ها، بیش‌ از حد مصلحت‏ اندیش می‏گوییم. در دنیای دیگر، دو زمان وجود دارد، یکی مکانیکی، و دیگری جسمانی. در زمان مکانیکی، همه‌ چیز یک تعریف مادی دارد، و آدم‏هایی که در آن زمان زندگی می‏کنند، در یک دنیای کاملاً برنامه ‏ریزی‌ شده، قرار دارند. ولی برعکس، آن‌هایی که در زمان جسمانی زندگی می‏کنند، به تعریف مادی مسائل کاری ندارند، و هیچ برنامه ‏ریزی ویژه ای نیز ندارند، که به اصطلاح، به آن‌ها آدم‏های بی‏خیال می‏گویند. زمان مکانیکی هیچ انعطافی ندارد، و انسان در واقع، در دام آن گرفتار است. در دنیای دیگری، هرچه از مرکز زمین دورتر شویم، زمان دیرتر می‏گذرد، و تأثیر کمتری روی آدم‏ها می‏گذارد. بنابراین مردم سعی می‏کنند، در ارتفاعات زندگی کنند، و خانه‏ هاشان را روی پایه‏ های بلند می‏سازند، تا دیرتر پیر شوند، و بیشتر زندگی کنند. در یک دنیای دیگر: جای گذشته و آینده عوض می‏شود. اول نتیجه‌ ی کار اتفاق می‏افتد، سپس آن رخداد روی می‏دهد. در این دنیا که هیچ چیز، قابل پیش بینی نیست، می‏توان واقعی‏تر زندگی کرد، زیرا هیچ کاری، نه به خاطر دلایلی در بگذشته، و نه برای نتایجش در آینده است که انجام می‏شود، بلکه صرفاً به‌ خاطر خود آن کار است، که انجامش می‏دهیم. در دنیایی دیگر، گذشت زمان، عامل نظم است، و هر چیز نامرتبی، به‌ مرور زمان مرتب خواهد شد، و نیازی به سعی: برای ترمیم و مرتب کردن مسائل، نیست. در دنیای دیگری: زمان به‌ صورت دوایر متحدالمرکزی، به ‌سوی خارج گسترده است، و در مرکز بی‏حرکت است. در مرکز می‏توان لحظه های ابدی ساخت. گروهی بر این عقیده اند که بهتر است به مرکز زمان نزدیک نشد، حیات منشأ غم است، و بهتر است زودتر تمام شود، گروهی عکس این فکر می‏کنند، و ترجیح می‏دهند: از خوشبختی ابدی، لذت ببرند. در دنیای دیگری: زمان وجود ندارد، در آنجا تنها تصویرها وجود دارند، در یک دنیای دیگر: خاطره وجود ندارد، و همین ‏طور صحبت از دنیاهای دیگر، با زمان‏های دیگر است، دنیایی که زمان در آن برعکس می‏گذرد، دنیایی که در آن فقط یک روز زندگی می‏کنند، دنیایی که در آن، زمان، حسی همچو بویایی یا چشایی است. دنیایی که در آن زندگی پایانی ندارد. دنیایی که در آن زمان کمیت ندارد، و تنها کیفیت دارد. دنیایی که در آن برای زمان، روی بُعد زمان، می‏توان مختصاتی قائل شد. دنیایی که زمان در آن، یک حادثه‌ ی محلی است، و در نتیجه هر شهر، تنهاست. دنیایی که گذشته در آن وجود ندارد. و در نهایت اینیشتین با بررسی تمام این زمان‏ها، در دنیاهای مختلف، به نظریه‌ ی زمان خود دست می‏یابد. البته با وجود حجم کم کتاب، نمی‏توان آن را سریع خواند، زیرا برای درک هر کدام از این دنیاها به زمان نیاز هست. ا. شربیانی"
2,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1199525-cecily,5,"Poetic twists on the paradoxes of time.The quotidian becomes extraordinary and unsettling.Time travel needn't involve machines or blue boxes (sorry, Apatt!): Lightman makes it leap off the page and into your mind, leaving you questioning the very root of reality. Now that I am reading Borges, I assume Lightman was influenced by him (and maybe others), in particular, the short story, Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius FORMATThere are about 30 very short chapters (typically, three pages of well-spaced text). Each uses an artist's palette to conjure ordinary scenes of human interaction in a small Swiss Germanic town. Everyman, everyday, anytown - except that the unique way time operates in each place creates a uniquely alien culture.It's full of dilemmas and paradoxes, and the book itself is a paradox: it's so little and light, but it contains SO much of weight. (There, Apatt, I've squeezed in a TARDIS.)""Each time is true, but the truths are not the same.""WHO IS THIS FOR?It's for anyone who likes to play with ideas and appreciates beautiful writing. I know real physicists who have enjoyed this, but you certainly don't need any esoteric knowledge to be transported by it. POETIC PROSEI appreciated the lyricism as I read it, but mainly noted down the ideas. * There are many series of single-sentence, seemingly unrelated, vignettes, especially on page 58-60: ""Footprints in snow on a winter island. A boat on the water at night, its lights dim in the distance... A locked cabinet of pills. A leaf on the ground in autumn, red and gold and brown, delicate... A mother on her bed, weeping, the smell of basil in the air... Sunlight, in long angles through the window in late afternoon... A worn book lying on a table beside a dim lamp.""* Sunrise: ""Ten minutes past six by the invisible clock on the wall. Minute by minute, new objects gain form.""* ""Hypothetically, time might be smooth or rough, prickly or silky, hard or soft. But in this world, the texture of time happens to be sticky.""* ""In a world where time is a sense... a sequence of episodes may be quick or may be slow, dim or intense, salty or sweet, causal or without cause, orderly or random."" Here, ""the time-deaf are unable to speak what they know. For speech needs a sequence of words, spoken in time.""* ""Where time stands still... Raindrops hang motionless in the air. Pendulums... float mid-swing. Dogs raise the muzzles in silent howls... The aromas of dates, mangoes, coriander, cumin are suspended in space.""* Time can be measured by things other than clocks: ""by the changes in heavenly bodies... by heartbeats... the duration of loneliness.""HOW TO BE HAPPYThis is a book of hypotheses, not solutions. It isn't theological or prescriptive, but its exposition of adaptation and happiness spoke to me. In most of the worlds, some people have coping strategies that bring happiness, or at least contentment, whereas others are mired in misery. In many cases, that means going to great, even ridiculous, lengths to gain just a little bit more time. In those respects, these worlds are like our own. In some of the worlds, predestination or inevitability breeds recklessness, ""free to do as he pleases, free in a world without freedom.""In another, it's suggested that ""a world where time is absolute is a world of consolation"" because time is predictable. I'm not sure about that one; people are still unpredictable. Lightman is also very upbeat about a world where people have no memories: every night is the first night, and people live in the present - but they could just as easily be reckless, not being able to learn from experience.Should we live for the moment, the past, or the future (echoes of A Christmas Carol?)? Would you ""rather have an eternity of contentment, even if that eternity were fixed and frozen, like a butterfly, mounted in a case""? There is no single answer, but I believe we are responsible creating the framework for our own happiness. We may need help (especially if saddled with depression or grim circumstances), but ultimately, peace can only come from within. How one achieves that is trickier - rather like the solution for travelling safely through a black hole that starts, ""First, build a time machine..."" (or maybe the way to build a time machine is to first find the black hole?). WEIRD WAYS TIME COULD WORK - Spoilerish?Some examples of worlds described in the book. For each, the implications of understanding and ignorance of the nature of time is different, and almost all could be the basis for a whole novel:* ""Suppose time is a circle, bending back on itself. The world repeats itself, precisely, endlessly.""* ""Time is like a flow of water, occasionally displaced by a bit of debris, a passing breeze.... People caught in the branching tributaries find themselves suddenly carried to the past.""* A stop/start world where time is ""seemingly continuous from a distance but disjointed close up.""* ""Time has three dimensions, like space... an object may participate in three perpendicular futures.""* ""Time is like the light between two mirrors... a world of countless copies.""* ""There is mechanical time and there is body time."" One is ""rigid and metallic"", the other ""squirms and wriggles like a bluefish in a bay... Where the two times meet, desperation. Where the two times go their separate ways, contentment.""* ""Time flows more slowly the farther from the centre of the earth."" Or the converse: ""The centre of time"" from which ""time travels outward in concentric circles"", getting faster as one is further away. Where time is a local phenomenon, passing at a different rate, each town has to become a self-sufficient island, and no traveller can ever return home, being ""cut off in time, as well as space"".* ""Time is visible in all places. A vast scaffold of time, stretching across the universe."" And ""Time is a visible dimension... one may choose his motion along the axis of time."" Which way would you go?* ""Consider a world in which cause and effect are erratic... each act is an island in time."" Scientists are helpless, but artists love it.* ""A world without a future... Time is a line that terminates at the present, both in reality and in the mind.""* What about a world where everyone knows it will end in a month? Lightman sees it ""a world of equality"", but I think that's optimistic. Or where people are like mayflies and live for only a day each. * What about a world where people live forever? Does infinite time and infinite possibility send you to a frenzy of business, experiencing everything you can imagine, or does it take the pressure off, so you sit around, doing nothing just yet?* ""The passage of time brings increasing order."" In spring, people create mess and chaos.* ""Imagine a world in which there is no time. Only images."" I can't really get my head round that one, but it's the most beautiful one.* ""Time is not a quantity but a quality... Time exists, but it cannot be measured... Events are triggered by other events, not by time.""* ""Time flows not evenly, but fitfully and... as a consequence, people receive fitful glimpses of the future."" (Shades of Flashforward.) Here, ""Those who have seen the future do not need to take risks, and those who have not yet seen the future wait for their vision without taking risks.""* ""Time passes more slowly for people in motion."" The converse would have possibilities too.* There's a backward-flowing time, but Kurt Vonnegut, Martin Amis (and others) have done that in Slaughterhouse Five and Time's Arrow respectively.Perhaps we should try to ignore time. One world has only just discovered objective measurement of it. The clock ""was magical... unbearable... outside natural law"" but it could not be ignored, so they worshipped it. ""They have been trapped by their own inventiveness and audacity. And they must pay with their lives."" TINY FLAWThe alternative time chapters are interspersed with occasional ones describing Einstein as a young patent clerk, working on this theories of time. I found these an unnecessary and unwelcome distraction.HOW TO READ ITYou could easily sit and read this book in one short session, but although you would imbibe the beauty and the tangling of time, I wanted to digest and ponder a few worlds at a... time. I might choose differently on a reread, though.TO MY FRIENDS - yes, you!This is another wonderful book that I discovered purely because of the enticing reviews of several friends on GR. Thank you. To my other friends, I redirect the favour by recommending this book to you.UPDATE re CalvinoA few months after loving this, I read and loved Calvino's Invisible Cities. I now realise how heavily influenced Lightman was: in content, structure, style… every way. Whether you class it as homage or borderline plagiarism is debatable, but it does not detract from my enjoyment of this at the time, and I think Lightman’s book is probably the more accessible of the two, even though it is primarily about physics/time, rather than geography."
3,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5498525-fionnuala,0,"How do you check the time? If you spend a lot of time on your computer, you may simply swivel your eyes to the top right-hand corner of the screen. Or perhaps you wear a wrist watch so all you have to do is move your head slightly to check the time. Maybe you rely on your phone and then you have to make more of an effort, you have to put your hand in your pocket, pull out the phone and switch it on. No? You carry your phone in your hand at all times? Then checking the time has never been easier. In the spring of 1905, the people of Berne had to make a bigger effort to check the time. Those were the days when mobile phones didn’t exist and clocks were less reliable. You’ve forgotten that, haven’t you? That clocks used to run at different speeds, that your clock might lose several minutes a day while your neighbour's was always fast, or vice-versa. And if you forgot to wind your clock, or mislaid the key, you lost track of the time completely, unless, of course, there was a friendly German clock-winder in the vicinity, but that’s another story which I won't waste time on right now. Back to the people of Berne and the efforts they made to check the time. Berne has a famous clock tower dating back to the thirteenth century, the Zytgloggeturm (take your time).Every afternoon, the townspeople of Berne convene at the west end of Kramgasse. There, at four minutes to three, the Zytgloggeturm pays tribute to time. High on the turret of the tower clowns dance, roosters crow, bears play fife and drum, their mechanical movements and sounds synchronised exactly by the turning of gears, which, in turn, are inspired by the perfection of time. At three o’clock precisely, a massive bell chimes three times, people verify their watches and then return to their offices on Speichergasse, their shops on Marktgasse, their farms beyond the bridges of the Aare.The bears mentioned in that quote don’t all appear every day. No, every bear has six days off so the townspeople always know which day of the week it is from the attributes of the bear which appears just before the clock strikes the hour; the Sunday bear is white, for example. So the clock also served as a calendar and its giant face showed the position of the sun, the phases of the moon, the date and the seasons. Anyone living and working within sight of that clock had their very own giant app full of time related information available at the merest swivel of the eye. And there you were thinking those must have been such primitive times.Far from it. This book opens at six o’clock in the morning in an office on Speichergasse where a young man, who would later become the most famous man of his century, perhaps of all time, has just spent many hours putting the finishing touches to his new Theory of Time. He has been working on the theory for months, and his dreams as well as his waking life have been preoccupied with examining all the possible variations of time that may exist and the relative consequences for the world and those who live in it. The rest of the book recounts Alan Lightman’s version of those dreams: the people of Berne living their lives, working and sleeping but not necessarily in the world of time as we know it, so that a husband might be rich and successful in one time world, poor in another, a wife might be faithful when time runs rapidly on, unfaithful when it slows down. Lightman’s language is simple, his ideas are accessible and by the time you finish this book, you will be convinced that you yourself actually lived in Berne in the spring of 1905, perhaps on Speichergasse, or maybe on Marktgasse or preferably along the leafy, sunny banks of the river Aare.And now you are four minutes older than you were before you started reading this review.And if you want to be another four minutes older but not necessarily unhappy about it, have a listen to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDpT4..."
4,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2990642-rowena,5,"I had an awful Physics teacher at University, but one thing he was good at was getting the class to understand Einstein's Theory of Relativity, which has always fascinated me.This book was brilliant. Imagine a world where time is a circle.Or a world where cause and effect are erratic. Or a world where time is not continuous. These are a few of the worlds Einstein dreams up while he's working on his Theory. Time is definitely a central theme in this book and few will be able to look at time (or life) in the same way after reading this book. I was impressed by how creatively Lightman used the different concepts of time in his little vignettes. This book has compelled me to look for fiction written by scientists. A very unique,intelligent and philosophical read."
5,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9889835-matthias,2,"Time has always fascinated me. Well, I say always, but that's not true. In fact, I'm almost never fascinated by time. Only very occasionally, in short bouts, whenever I happen to think about it. If I'd have to add up all the time during which I was fascinated by time, I don't think it would add up to much more than a week, if that. And yet, during my fascination with time, it feels like an endless, enduring fascination that I always carry around with me, and that I've been subconsciously pondering on ever since I was capable of doing such a grave thing as pondering. Given this wonderment with time, I was ready to love this book, a book that would make me think about time and forget about time all at once. Sadly, it was not to be.With every page I turned, time, much like the words I was wading through, became a sticky jello. Everything started moving slowly. My thoughts, the story, the people under yet another arcade in yet another Graschengasse or some other German sounding street that looks like any other German street that apparently always needs to have arcades. And I'm not talking about the cool arcades with games and pool tables and candy, but the old architectural thing with which there's only one thing to do: stand under it and do absolutely nothing of interest. The only thing that happens in this book is time. It happens in different ways, as it happens, but while time is a great host for happenings, it doesn't make for a very great entertainer itself. As my slow thoughts slowly built up to slow frustration I finished another three page chapter, which should actually be called a vignette, because stuff actually happens in chapters. These vignettes are intellectual and poetic masterpieces that are boring beyond the imagination, which is the least boring way to be boring, so I'll give them that. No, time did not disappear. It did not become a concept that in turn became a gateway to leaps and bounds of the imagination. Time became the annoying tick-tack-tocking of the clock while you're trying to sleep. Every tick signifying another segment of time irrevocably wasted on lying awake without good reason, trying to read this book. I'm being harsh. I'm maybe even being a bit evil. Definitely rude. So let me have a little pause right here and calm down. So I just took a little pause, not that you noticed because you just kept reading, but I assure you I did. You can't begin to imagine how much time passed between that dot and that ""So."". The stuff I did. The laundry. The dishes. A walk in the drizzle. Thinking about Fionnuala's sublime review that shows what a greater mind than mine can give in terms of interpretation of this book. Her review also comes with a great soundtrack. So yes, it was a good pause, I even had a cookie. The American kind, with little bits of chocolate, that fall apart in big crumbles that you can find on your clothes later on for a little treat after the treat. And you? What did you do with that pause? Absolutely nothing! You just rushed to the end of this paragraph, perhaps just to end up feeling hungry for a cookie, perhaps even willing to settle for a crumble.Maybe I should point out that those German sounding streets aren't German, but Swiss. Imagine that, a book about time set in Switzerland! It's also about Einstein. What's his nationality, I ask? Who knows, I sure don't, that's why I asked? The guy lived absolutely everywhere, relatively speaking. Time for another pause. Wikipedia just told me he's a Württemberger, whatever the hell that means. Guy is so old he was born in a country that doesn't even exist anymore. Makes you wonder if he's even real, right? But he was! And I guess that means that he is. And he dreamed dreams. And who decided to commit these dreams to paper? Alan Lightman. His name? Not a coincidence, I would think. Unless everything is a coincidence, because every incident links with another incident somehow, every effect knows a cause that's also an effect and you get these long strings of effects and causes and they get all entangled like your headphones do and one of these strings, perhaps through some inextricable knots, must connect Lightman's name to Einstein's dreams. The result, namely this book, is as frustrating as the spaghettis coming out of your pocket whenever you want to listen to some tunes during a walk in the drizzle. Should you read this book? Only if you want to make up your own mind. Read Fionnuala's review to get another side of the story, a more beautiful one, before making up that cluttered mind of yours. Unless you're Fionnuala. Scratch that, even if you're Fionnuala, because you deserve a little treat of your own making after all this rambling.My two cents? Maybe just read the first line and the last line of every vignette. They usually get the point across and it will save you the trouble of reading about how a couple is standing under an arcade or how a butcher is passing an arcade or how that Aarhe (aargh indeed) is twinkling under the sun or the moon or, wait for it, twinkling in time. You didn't wait for it, did you? Okay, that's the end of this review for you, young reader! What I'm trying to say is that some ideas on how time could work are interesting enough, which are described in the beginning of each vignette. Then flick two pages while thinking for yourself what it could mean, and then read the last couple of sentences to (sometimes) get a nice paradox on the way we deal with our past, or how time can make us alone, or how an absolute lack of freedom provides its own form of freedom. I think a lot more could have been done with both time, this author's time and my time. Nothing can be done without time, ergo everything should be done WITH it. Lightman didn't do enough and failed to live up to his promising name. Of course, that's just my opinion. As you very well know by now, it's all relative. "
6,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford,4,"The Value of TimeTime is the skeleton in the intellectual closet, the elephant in the scientific room, and the rogue gene of rationality. Time presents a series of paradoxes which Lightman presents as if they were dreams to be analysed - not to be resolved but merely to be appreciated. Perhaps that’s the limit of human capability, that is, merely to appreciate time as something unknowable. If so, then the purpose of time may well be to keep human beings humble, an unexpected consequence of eating from the tree of knowledge.Time, of course, is an essential concept not just for the conduct of everyday life and the purported rationality of scientific thought, but also as a foundation for ethics, and for one’s fundamental feeling about the world and our place in it. So how we think about time, however unconsciously, matters. We wouldn’t be able to communicate without time since words come in a sequence. Yet single-celled animals appear to communicate and have no detectable sense of time. Time has been considered as a threat or a consolation; as objective or entirely subjective; as universal or merely local; as a fact of existence or a fantasy created by human beings to make our lives bearable; as something which gives or destroys meaning. But no matter what view one takes on time, its paradoxes prevail. Lightman catalogues them in his witty vignettes of life in Berne. If time is circular, there can be no choice, no free will. If time-travel is possible, choice and free will could destroy the world. If there are dimensions in time as there are in space, then there could be an infinity of simultaneous worlds. If time is reversible, the relation between cause and effect is merely conventional, etc., etc. It seems that no matter where one turns philosophically, someone has already opened a door to understanding and someone else has closed the same door with a decisive bang.Without time, there would be no regrets, no sense of loss. But there probably wouldn’t be anything like love either, certainly not anticipation or longing. Commitments and contracts would be meaningless. History, indeed memory of any kind except for the most unconsciously instinctive (including the false or distorted kind), could not exist. Greed would be eliminated; so would ambition. Neither progress nor deterioration would be noticeable. But entropy would be stopped in its tracks; so everything would be much tidier. Age would be a mythical fantasy. Ethics as a consideration of the consequences of one’s actions would be senseless. On the other hand, an ethical ideal of equality might well be a consequence of the absence of time. Does time even exist in a galactic black hole?So Lightman is pretty comprehensive. But I think there is at least one theory of time, or Einsteinian dream, which he may have neglected: Time as metric of value. That time is a metric, a scale on which we measure and evaluate, is something fairly certain. Such a metric is neither subjective nor objective but inter-subjective and communal, quite a bit like language really. So it is something real but created by human beings for an evolutionary purpose, namely to be able to rank things - events, structures, traditions, words, and people - according to their importance. And, of course, this implies arguing about their importance. An agreement on something as the basis for disagreement, one might say.How ironically fitting, therefore, that the nature of the thing agreed as a metric should be the subject of such intense disagreement and confusion. I am 72 years of age. I can prove it by both memory and birth certificate. But memory is uncertain, and documents can be forged. In any case, the literal meaning of my assertion is that I have experienced 72 Springtimes - a mere convention. Scientifically it means that the replicating tails of my bodily cells are running out of steam. Culturally, it means that I am either a carrier of wisdom or over the hill depending on whom you ask. Psychologically, that I am probably more filled with memories and suppressed memories than is good for me. All these are evaluations, judgments that require the metric of time. As with all metrics of value, there is nothing beyond, under, or inside the metric of time. It stands on its own. It is its own substance. We place ourselves and everything else on that metric. The metric is not part of us or of anything else. Confusing the substance of the metric with something either ‘out there’ in the cosmos, or ‘in here’ in one’s mind, is a mistake. Just as Zeno created his paradoxes of movement in space by confusing the metric with the world to which it is applied, so we create similar paradoxes with time. The apparent contradictions of quantum mechanics is just one example. There are, of course, not one metric of time but any number of them depending on our perspective on the world - just as Einstein showed. These metrics are not simply contraries, they may even be contradictories - uniformly increasing as others decline. Comparing them implies a difference in purpose which completely explains the difference in scales. Many of these purposes are strange: to prove that God exists... or that he doesn’t exist; to prove that the universe expanded rapidly... or that it didn’t. As if time itself doesn’t change with the intentions associated with it. Time is its own metric and nothing else, just like every other measure of value.This theory of time as a metric of value may involve its own paradoxes. But it does have one signal advantage: by allowing purpose to determine what time is, the theory incorporates all of Lightman’s common-sense and philosophical conjectures, including Einstein’s, and allows each its place. None are incorrect, although some may be better than others depending on intention. Responses on a postcard, please."
7,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon-darth-anyan,5," One cannot walk down an avenue, converse with a friend, enter a building, browse beneath the sandstone arches of an old arcade without meeting an instrument of time. Time is visible in all places. Clock towers, wristwatches, church bells divide years into months, months into days, days into hours, hours into seconds, each increment of time marching after the other in perfect succession. And beyond any particular clock, a vast scaffold of time, stretching across the universe, lays down the law of time equally for all. In this world, a second is a second is a second. Time paces forward with exquisite regularity, at precisely the same velocity in every corner of space. Time is an infinite ruler. Time is absolute. Or is it? A mechanical engineer like me is concerned with questions like ""Why"" and ""How"" things work. A theoretical physicist like Lightman goes one step further and asks ""WHAT IF ...?"" And with this step he crosses the border between science and poetry, pushing the limits of our understanding, of our imagination far beyond the Newtonian, rigid, limited understanding of the natural world. Lightman does even more in his tribute to Einstein, in this glorious attempt to translate the theory of relativity into the everyday passions, concerns and aspirations of the people he meets on the streets of the city of Bern, finding beauty and freedom in the so-called cold equations of modern physics. On this late afternoon, in these few moments while the sun is nestled in a snowy hollow of the Alps, a person could sit beside the lake and contemplate the texture of time. Hypothetically, time might be smooth or rough, prickly or silky, hard or soft. But in this world, the texture of time happens to be sticky. Portions of towns become stuck in some moment of history and do not get out. So, too, individual people become stuck in some point of their lives and do not get free. WHAT IF time can speed up or slow down, stop like a stalled engine or skip seconds ahead like a child playing hopscotch? What if time moves backward instead of forward, or becomes transparent to the eye of the beholder, allowing glimpses of the future, or becoming opaque and limiting the experience to the present moment only? What if time moves faster as you go up in altitude, like the opposite of gravity? What if time moves in random waves like the clouds above the alps or along predestined paths like a tramway? How will this fickleness of time alter the lives of the people living in one of these alternate, parallel universes? Coming back to that world of stalled time: The tragedy of this world is that no one is happy, whether stuck in a time of pain or of joy. The tragedy of this world is that every one is alone. For a life in the past cannot be shared with the present. Each person who gets stuck in time gets stuck alone. Lightman translates all these possibilities into the waking dreams of a genius physicist, weaving into the novel biographical notes and the sights, the history of Bern- the city where Einstein developed his theory of relativity. Wouldn't you rather read a book about the misadventures of time travellers than study differential equations? I wish my physics teacher had given me this novel as homework instead of that formula that covered half the blackboard in the classroom. Depending on the speed, a person in a fast house could gain several minutes on his neighbors in a single day. This obsession with speed carries through the night, when valuable time could be lost, or gained, while asleep. At night, the streets are ablaze with lights, so that passing houses might avoid collisions, which are always fatal. At night people dream of speed, of youth, of opportunity. Who can refute Lightman's arguments that time moves differently for different people? To some, it is a snail, a Sunday afternoon spent alone when the phone never rings and the night refuses to come. To others, there are not enough seconds in a day to do all the things they want to do, to meet all the people they love and to read all the books that deserve to be read... What if time stretches unbroken into infinity and people live forever?  ""Strangely, the population of each city splits in two: the Latters and the Nows.""  The Laters are masters of procrastination: why do anything today, when you will have an infinite number of tommorows to start a job, a project, a life...  ""The Nows are constantly reading new books, studying new trades, new languages. In order to taste the infinities of life, they begin early and never go slowly. And who can question their logic? The Nows are easily spotted. They are the owners of cafes, the college professor, the doctors and nurses, the politicians, the people who rock their legs constantly whenever they sit down. They move through a succession of lives, eager to miss nothing. And to some precious few, time is alive with possibilities and wonder, and they dream for us a new universe, a universe dancing to the secret music of celestial spheres: In the middle of a room with books on tables, a young man stands and plays his violin. He makes gentle melody. And as he plays, he looks out to the street below, notices a couple close together, looks at them with deep brown eyes, and looks away. He stands so still. His music is the only movement, his music fills the room. >><<>><<>><<>><<Some readers might find the style of presentation familiar. I was struck by the similarities with Italo Calvino, especially with  ""Invisible Cities""  and  ""Cosmicomiche"" . When I reviewed the latter, I described it as what happens when you let a poet loose in a room full of physics manuals. Alan Lightman approaches the subject from the opposite side, a perfect mirror image of Calvino : a scientist who has the sensibility and the way with metaphor of a poet. Together, they arrive at a serendipitous midpoint where science becomes fun and adventurous, where numbers become living people breathing, running, loving, dreaming. Quick or slow, time stops for nobody, and in the final pages of his unique novel, Lightman echoes the wisdom of the ancients and invites us to seize the day and enjoy being alive: In a world where time is a sense, like sight or like taste, a sequence of episodes may be quick or may be slow, dim or intense, salty or sweet, causal or without cause, orderly or random, depending on the prior history of the viewer. Philosophers sit in cafes on Amthausgasse and argue whether time really exists outside human perception. Who can say if an event happens fast or slow, casually or without cause, in the past or the future? Who can say if events happen at all? The philosophers sit with half-opened eyes and compare their aestethics of time. also, Indeed, each man and each woman desires a bird. Because this flock of nightingales is time. Time flutters and fidgets and hops with these birds. Trap one of these nightingales beneath a bell jar and time stops. The moment is frozen for all people and trees and soil caught within. In truth, these birds are rarely caught. The children, who alone have the speed to catch birds, have no desire to stop time. For the children, time moves too slowly already. They rush from moment to moment, anxious for birthdays and new years, barely able to wait for the rest of their lives. The elderly desperately wish to halt time, but are much too slow and fatigued to entrap any bird. For the elderly, time darts by much too quickly. They yearn to capture a single minute at the breakfast table drinking tea, or a moment when a grandchild is stuck getting out of her costume, or an afternoon when the winter sun reflects off the snow and floods the music room with light. But they are too slow. They must watch time jump and fly beyond reach.Highly Recommended!"

Scientific gamers spend their lives investigating new strategies, tactics, opening variations. Most gamers work on established games - chess, whist, electromagnetism - but every now and then someone invents a new game. The Institut für Spielforschung on Hochschulstrasse in Bern is in the middle of hosting an international games conference. Gamers have come from a dozen countries to present the results of their latest researches. In the main auditorium, Professor Lasker is reading a paper entitled ""Some Remarks on the Queen's Gambit Declined"". Further down the hall, the Symposium on Squeezes and Endplays is being attended by some of the world's foremost card theorists.In a small room down in the basement, a junior patent clerk and amateur games enthusiast is explaining the game he has recently invented. Only a dozen people have turned up. When he has finished, there are some hostile questions: one person goes as far as asking whether the rules even make sense. During the interval, he asks the patent clerk if they could try a practice session. The clerk takes out a board and sets up the pieces.They play four moves, and the clerk suddenly announces checkmate. ""I don't understand!"" says the skeptic ironically. But, a moment later, he finds to his surprise that he does. The clerk's game is more interesting than he had first realized.___________________________________In this world, a scientific theory is a painting. There is a long tradition of scientific art, which has created a rich and fertile vocabulary of visual metaphors.Scientific artists belong to many different competing schools. Some of the more accessible pictures look like religious icons, filled with angels and gold leaf. Even laymen who understand nothing about science can look at them and feel momentarily comforted and uplifted. More knowledgeable people, who see them displayed in churches and museums, like to show off their learning and explain to their less well-informed friends what each halo and wing is meant to signify. This information is also imparted by school teachers to their students, who need to remember it in order to pass their yearly tests. Other works of scientific art are less obvious in meaning. They consist of abstract forms, smudges of color, objects apparently flung together without any purpose or unifying theme. Most modern compositions belong to this family. Opinion is divided as to their worth. Some people say that they embody the very essence of science, others that they are a simple fraud.The Kunstmuseum has a display of these avante-garde pieces. A young couple are standing in front of one of the less prominent canvases, which contains a few colored shapes arranged in a symmetrical pattern. The boy finds nothing to hold his attention, but the girl stops and looks at it carefully from several different angles.""I have never seen anything like it before,"" she murmurs, and takes her glasses out of her handbag.""So what's special about it?"" asks her lover. He is disappointed that she is now going to wear her glasses; he thinks they make her less desirable. She does not answer, but continues to study the painting.___________________________________In this world, a scientific theory is a series of dreams..."

Perhaps it floweth upside down. You never know. In such a world things happen with precise but inverted logic. Authors discover the books they will write by reading the reviews of their unwritten books on Goodreads. They are very grateful for the reviews which merely recapitulate the plot, this is very valuable information. They don’t mind too much if one review is a parody of their book – it’s also useful, they can get an idea of the required style from that. But wait, there’s something they have to do first. They take themselves off to a large bookshop, and there they see piles of their as yet unwritten novel in the window. Great! Next day they get an email from their agent saying the book has been accepted by the publisher. And only then can they start to write it, consulting the notes from all the Goodreads reviews as they do. Of course there could also be a world where the letters s and t don’t exist. (Why would they not exist? To save time! Sorry, ime. Sorry, orry.) In that world this novel is called Einein’ Dream. And the longest river in America is the Miiippi."
10,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4453289-a,1,"I didn't quite get this book. I am sure it simply went over my head. I'm no stranger to physics and what-not so I figured this would be a good read. My review below is evidence of my frustration with this book.I don't understand how people not only rated this book so highly, but also claim to have had some kind of enlightening experience from having read it. I thought this book was incredibly kitchy. Each chapter is a vignette of a world with some perturbation in the way time itself works, and by the end of each chapter I feel the author trying to push some point about how all of these vignettes are actually describing some aspect of time in reality. That we should all stop and smell the roses, etc. I will give it to the author that yes, sometimes we need to see the absurd to recognize the flaws in our thought patterns (such as working on mechanical time rather than body time, or that we should live in the moment and not dread the future or dwell on the past). I get it. This is evident in the first few stories and seems to be repeated throughout.I feel like the author (professor of both physics and writing at MIT) is someone who has never been criticized because everyone has always been too polite to do so. In this book, I think Dr. Lightman abuses both science and art. Unless I am just too dense to ""get it."" The scenarios make no sense... if everyone stops working because the world is ending, then who exactly are they ordering bread from in such a more pleasant way? If the butcher forgets where he lives daily, and even that he has a family, then why would he go back to the butcher shop every morning? The aspects of time that are being stretched aren't even consistent with physics. Why would people have to pay more for a house that moves fast if they would never notice any benefit from it? being that they too are moving fast and therefore time would ravage the house at the same rate as if they were both sitting still. And similarly for the lovers near the center of time where ""a kiss could last a thousand years""? It would only last a second to those two lovers... they wouldn't notice any difference in time, only outside viewers would. Relativity man, c'mon... this is Einstein 101 stuff...Again I've found nothing profound in this book. Since my opinion goes against pretty much all the other reviews I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that I'm missing some really important points here. I seriously doubt the distinguished and best-selling professor of physics and writing from MIT would produce something that sounds like a collection of failed short stories that a high school aged kid would write unless there was a reason to do so.Please, someone, point me to what I am missing here. I yearn for the kind of experience the other reviews mention, especially with this book. I obviously need to be educated here."
11,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45406-lucke1984,5,"Exquisite, Everyone should read this book, everyone should give this book away, it should be thrown from rooftops and forced upon youngsters. I will not venture to commingle a necessarily clunky and didactic summary with the poetic prose that is as much about the feeling stirred from reading each individual word than anything a summary could attempt. Suffice it to say that this book is excellent, beautiful and amazing, if a book is universally capable of changing your life... if only for a moment... this is such a book."
12,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick,3,"Bern is a good setting for a book about the potential malleability of time, since it's one of those places that seems to exist in a chronology all its own. I've spent a lot of time there recently, for reasons connected to a big motorsports event earlier in the summer, and the locals were not very happy about being disturbed. Not for them the excitement of global attention or gawking tourists; they prefer to be left to their own devices, pottering around their pristine medieval town, looped by the shockingly turquoise Aare, and exchanging comments about outsiders in their incomprehensible dialect. (Even the words for ‘the’ are different from those in Zurich.) Along the shopping arcades of Kramgasse, people had put up signs telling the event organisers and visitors to ‘Go home!’.Before Kramgasse was a shopping arcade, it was a residential thoroughfare, and one of its residents was a certain A. Einstein. It was while he lived here that he worked out the revolutionary idea that time is not a universal thing at all, but is, in fact, entire relative to your speed and acceleration. Alan Lightman's book is not about that (though Einstein's life here is glimpsed in a few intermissive vignettes); it is, instead, about the paths not taken. By physics, that is.Each short chapter is a snapshot of (usually) Bern, but in a world where time works differently. In one, time is experienced independently for each person; in another, time travel is a fact of life; in another, it moves backwards. Lightman's technique is formulaic (some sensory impressions of the town, some brief images of people, finally a wistful reflection on time's effects on personal relationships) but thought-provoking; the short chapters blur together with hypnotic effect. Some I found quite moving, while others seemed vaguely unconvincing even according to their own internal logic. But the book is short enough not to outstay its welcome (even among the Bernese)."
13,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84023-j-g-keely,2,"There are few things more disappointing than seeing an author take an idea that should fascinate and surprise us, and reducing it until it is little more than a dull blip. In the process of trying to render them accessible to his audience, he stripped from them anything that might be really challenging or thought-provoking. In the end, his writing simply lacked the subtlety and power required.The work is structured like that of other authors seeking aphoristic profundity, like Borges, Calvino, where each little story presents a different view of the world, a fantastical idea that twists our reality and how we see it, and while all these different views of the world might seem incompatible and impossible, we come to realize that each one represents a real way of looking at the world and that, when we take them all together, they present a grand view of all the strange and contradictory ways that we do look at our world, from person to person and moment to moment.It was a style taken from the metaphysical poet, like Petrarch, who created a poetic cycle where the combined meaning of all the poems, when taken together, was much larger than the mere summation of its parts. But unlike those writers, Lightman's stories lack profundity, they are just too small and safe to be truly affecting.The first and most obvious problem is the voice and tone of the stories, which is always the same throughout. There are no changes in pacing or emotional quality, and so they all start melting together into an undifferentiated mass. We get many of the same techniques you'd expect from a first year creative writing class, where every scene is set with the same list of everyday things (a street, a building, the sound of a cart, a brief description of the weather), and then we're given some little slice of life from the characters with no emotional arc or resolution, and then the camera drifts away again, leaving us with some some vague, pseudo-spiritual narration.The whole thing was oddly saccharine--the theories of Einstein by way of greeting card--even the sad moments were rather precious in their sadness. It all becomes so formulaic, so quickly that it felt less like Lightman intended to blow my mind than to lull me to sleep with this plodding chant.Each story takes some idea of how time might behave differently and tries to present it to us, but Lightman never pushes the envelope, never presents us with anything truly weird or puzzling. It reminded me of LeGuin's critique of literary writers 'slumming it' in genres like fantasy, sci fi, and horror, because it seems interesting--but not really understanding the genre they're writing in (and never getting called on it, because Lit critiques don't know anything about genre, either).So, they end up taking ideas that other writers and thinkers have been exploring for decades and presenting them to us as if they are still new. He does this with the idea of 'eternal return', which Nietzsche was writing about a century ago, and which appeared in Egyptian and Buddhist thought thousands of years ago.Needless to say, a lot of people have said a lot of things about this idea over the centuries, from philosophers and theologians to sci fi and fantasy authors, and so it's simply not enough to plop it down before your audience and say 'isn't that cool?', while completely ignoring the depth and complexity surrounding it. It makes this book feel less like hearing the thoughts of a guy with a physics degree (which Lightman has), and more like sitting in a dorm room while a guy packs another bowl and says 'Whoa dudes, what if time was, like, a circle?'The profound part isn't just asking the question, but digging deeper into what that question says about our world, and ourselves. Lightman does try to do this in some of his shorts, but just seems to lack the necessary imagination to provide us with a truly unusual take on things.When he presents the idea of the ‘butterfly effect’, he gives us some accidental time travelers who hide in corners because they are so afraid that they might kick up a bit of dust which will make someone late, which will mean some great man will never be born--and yet, isn’t it just as likely that their minor effect would instead prevent some terrible murderer from having been born? Hell, if a nostalgic misanthrope were sent back in time, he might try to change everything he could, because it ‘couldn’t be worse than what we have now’.The simplistic presentation means that we as readers are missing out on an entire side of the issue. If the travelers were instead afraid of changing things because then they would return to a future they don’t recognize, where things familiar to them would be replaced by inexplicable events, in effect turning them into madmen convinced the world is not as it should be, that would have been more interesting, because it presents the idea with a more complete and universal experience.Likewise, in another story depicting a reality that has a known end of the world, he shows everyone as just being happy and accepting it, wrapping it up with all the emotional depth of a Coke commercial. He takes pains to give us all these strange sci fi scenarios, and yet every character in them is somehow more bland and milquetoast than any real person--and when writing a piece of speculative fantasy, you don't want it to come off as less weird than life. To really bring a setting home to readers, you have to be able to deliver it through the odd little reactions of your characters: how does it change their lives, and how they think?That’s how an author like Chekhov delivers the strangeness of our own little world to us, through these queer characters and their queer little thoughts--that somehow strike us as just right when we read them, even though we’d never thought of them that way before, ourselves. Lightman seems to be doing the opposite: taking a world that should be fascinating and interesting, that should tell us something about ourselves, make us question our own biases and assumptions, yet somehow making it all bland and flat and generic.He also seems to have trouble keeping track of his own ideas as they unfold--for instance, he depicts for us a world where instead of time moving along from moment to moment, it exists all together as a multitude of moments, like pictures in a photo album--and yet, one of the images he gives us is ‘the first time seeing the ocean’. If all of these moments coexist outside of the context of temporal progression, how can there be a ‘first time’? How does that make sense within the confines of this setting?Similarly, when he depicts a world where time runs backwards, an old woman grows younger and gradually knows less and less, until becoming a child, he talks about her reverting to her college age and ‘seeing her husband for the first time’--but in this world, as time runs backwards, shouldn’t she be seeing him for the last time?--to me that seems a much more poignant moment when imagining a world like this. To have these stories get lost in a muddle of points of view, switching between the reader’s and the character’s, is an utter shame, because it completely misses out on what makes the setting strange in the first place.Of course, some people might suggest that it’s not meant to be entirely rational, because each story is supposed to be a dream from the mind of Einstein. So, these little contradictions and short-falls would then represent the arbitrary nature of dreams. But if these are dreams, they aren’t the kind you bother to share the next morning, because they aren’t particularly fantastical or disturbing or odd, in fact they’re pretty quotidian. It ends up feeling more like the dreams your cubicle mate bores your with than the dreams of one of the greatest and most imaginative thinkers of the 20th Century.Lightman’s little stories just aren’t that profound, he’s not pushing hard enough, not tearing the veil and forcing us to acknowledge some strange and incompatible view we had not considered before--and though he doesn’t have the contemptuous ‘wake up sheeple!’ tone of something like 
Zeitgeist
 or 
Ishmael
, nonetheless he has more in common with these than with a mind-bending author like Kafka.It's certainly fascinating that modern physicists are now reconsidering ancient ideas like eternal recurrence in light of recent theories like quantum physics, but you don't get any of that from these ‘Philosophy Lite’ stories. In some ways it reminds me of the debacle surrounding the film What the Bleep Do We Know!?, where a bunch of prominent physicists were brought in and interviewed about the nature of reality, and then the filmmakers edited those interviews down, presenting these responses completely out of context, and used them to support their own nonsense theories about psychic powers--much to the chagrin of all the scientists involved.And the real pity there is that, if the filmmakers had actually listened to what the scientists were saying, they would have discovered that modern science is producing findings far more remarkable and strange than ESP. And that’s the problem with Lightman, too: he’s just not giving us the really unusual stuff, because he’s watering it down too much, making it bland and palatable when it should be shocking and beggar belief. It’s really a disservice to Einstein, a man whose unusual (but true) ideas deserve to be understood by the lay person, because of the ways in which they have fundamentally changed our conception of the world around us.Better to read something like Hawking's A Brief History of Time, or Sagan's The Demon-Haunted World, or some of Richard Feynman's works--or just go back and watch some episodes of Cosmos. Any chapter from one of those will give you more than the entirety of this book."
14,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,4,"This was for me a refreshing and delightful read on alternative conceptions of time, borne out of playful thought experiments set among the residents of the city of Berne Switzerland in 1908. These permutations are alternated with interludes from the daily life of Einstein, who was then using his free time as a patent office worker to develop his Special Theory of Relativity, which demands of us to conceive of time as just another dimension in the space-time continuum. Most will have heard of his thought experiments such as illustrating conflicting perceptions of time by observers on a train or at a station as it travels by near the speed of light. The vignettes in this short book are extreme extensions of this approach which draw in the human context and reactions to the various logical and often absurd possibilities.For example, how might society adapt to knowledge that people living at higher altitudes, which has less gravitational pull from the earth, live longer. Lightman imagines a fad of the wealthy putting dwellings on stilts or on mountains. Given that those in motion experience a slowing of time, might a similar cultural focus on longer life lead to a society where they set their homes and businesses in constant motion on train tracks? The silliness of such scenarios motivated by gaining seconds out of a lifetime doesn’t hinder the pleasure of such fantasies. Other conceptions strike closer to everyday experience, such a personalities who value events of the past, present, or future to an excessive degree. It is easy to see how different emphases can vary with a person’s stage in life or age. And we all know people who live totally by schedules of clock time and others who drift along impervious to such restrictions, and some who mark time on a slower than others of a more hyperkinetic mentality. What if temporal reality was actually linked to individual perspectives? A fast paced person would seem to be one who time travels on ahead of fellow time turtles. And if each day we awoke with no past or with no future, could on imagine adapting, finding a way to truly live in a present with only a past or future.  These poetic essays and philosophical fantasies have their closest precedents in the work of Borges an Calvino. Once you’ve walked these strange mental pathways, it will be hard to see your life in time the same again. "
15,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/634541-chaz,4,"What a fun, fast (relatively..pun intended) and thought-provoking read! Lightman presents easily over 20+ depictions of Einstein’s theory of relativity. Each little vignette unveils a different world of how to perceive time. If time were crystal ball, Lightman looks at this crystal ball from above, below, upside down, inside out, backwards, forward etc. Although some of the stories weren’t incredibly captivating — most were and I would suggest this book to any artist visual/musical/literary or philosopher. It challenges the thoughts of freewill versus fate again and again. Let’s see — I’ll try to sum up a few chapters in one line. A world in which time has stopped at a fixed point, raindrops hang from the sky that sort of thing and as you travel away from this fixed point in time, time speeds up. In another place time is infinite, each choice a person makes in his life or series of choices splits into separate worlds each world splitting and again from another like a branch that continues to grow. A world every person lives one day, and the personality is developed whether they were born at 12 AM or 12 PM. In yet another world, one second in time colors one’s personality indefinitely… I.e. tramatic or fortunate event and how life is woven around this second in time. A world exists in which every hour is lived by a different person — so let’s take the next hour *at this moment* and each hour that every individual in the world is experiencing now— so this one hours no longer just one hour but rather centuries. I finished this book with a sharpened perception of time and relativity. One of my wishes would have been to have a brief epilogue going through each story with a scientific interpretation. Thanks Monica for the suggestion — good call, this one was right up my alley."
16,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,4,"I don't remember this book well enough to write a full review. But over a decade after reading it, one of the ideas presented in it has stayed with me. That idea was that there are people who function according to the rhythms of their bodies, and those who function according to the rhythms of the clock. The book suggested that a person can be one or the other, but not both. At the time I read it, I was in the process of shifting away from my clock-based life, and things have never quite been the same since."
17,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/541416-teresa,4,"Lightman -- interesting that his surname evokes Einstein -- has written a seemingly innocuous but profound little book. As I went through my daily chores today, any words rising to the surface of my consciousness as I thought of the review I would be writing later (which is now; though that 'now' exists no longer) sounded like cliches, easy to speak of Time in that way, as everything we say, think and do is full of references to Time and can be done only in Time.Lightman's dream about the world (every 'world' is a version of Einstein's Berne) in which everyone is immortal immediately reminded me of the movie Zardoz. I saw it when I was in college in the early 80s and it made an immediate impact on the way I've thought about death since I was 10 years old. I had trouble sleeping last night, my jaw tensing, and didn't feel like trying to put myself to sleep by writing this review in my head, so I turned the light back on for the third (or was it the fourth?) time to again pick up my next read; and the very next sentence was about Time:In History Beyond Trauma ... two psychoanalysts who have done extensive work in the field, address this curious alteration of time among those who have been traumatized. ""'Once upon a time,'"" they write, ""becomes Once upon not time.'"" Trauma memory has no narration. Stories always take place in time. They have a sequence, and they are always behind us. ...(from Siri Hustvedt's The Shaking Woman, or A History of My Nerves)As I was gathering up the household garbage a little while ago (as I revise this, not such ""a little while ago"") for tomorrow's pick-up and thinking of this book and how Time is essential to any writing, I remembered once hearing that there can be no such thing as a true Zen Buddhist novel, which brought to mind Lightman's story of a world in which Time is composed only of images. The 'story' becomes a mere list and, though it's a pretty list, it would've quickly turned boring if it had gone on much longer. And though it may no longer have been a story, the list couldn't have been written without Time."
18,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2160536-marvin,5,"This 179 page book took me four days to read. Not because it was difficult. In fact, the prose was exquisite and effortless in its beauty. It was because I wanted to read and cherish all of the novel's short vignettes rather than rush through. The book is a series of dreams, close to 30 in all, that Albert Einstein is dreaming as he struggles with his theory of relativity. Alan Lightman, a physicist himself, describes aspects of the theory and time itself through these descriptive ""stories"". This is not a book that has what I would call a plot. Einstein himself is presented in various interludes and is a minor character. Time is the major protagonist. This novel is an unique experience with parts of it being rapturous. It is both an intellectual and a aesthetic delight bordering on the spiritual. Go into this with an open mind and you should be amazed. "

This is a very unusual book, not really about Einstein at all, but perhaps he had some of these ""dreams"".

In a world with only one day left, we are finally all equal.Chapter ""10 May 1905"" - stuck in the past... The tragedy of this [""stuck in the past""] world is that no one is happy whether stuck in a time of pain or of joy. The tragedy of this world is that everyone is alone. For a life in the past cannot be shared with the present. Each person who gets stuck in time gets stuck alone."
20,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16077597-matt,4,"Today I had some time on my hands to provide you with the thoughts I have on this book.Developing a scientific theory surly takes time. I won't happen over night. I always wondered what goes around in the minds of great minds when they are ""in the zone"", totally immersed in their respective thoughts. What are their dreams at night after a full day of theorizing? This book gives an answer, albeit a fictional one.Author Alan Lightman (what an aptly name for a physicist) provides a dream diary of Albert Einstein. He, Einstein, had these fictional dreams shortly before he published the special theory of relativity (or is it theory of special relativity?) in 1905. At that time he worked as a patent clerk in Berne, Switzerland.All of the 30 dreams deal with the subject of time in one form or another. Before reading I had my doubts if I could comprehend this book at all. I have very little knowledge of physics in general and especially of Einstein's theories. Fortunately, it turned out that I don't have to to like this book. Every dream is set in Berne (or nearby), and depicts things and people we perceive in reality. The physical/theoretical world is transfered to a familiar place and becomes somewhat tangible to us. Surly in this macrocosm the things that are described will certainly never take place. But that's Okay - they are dreams after all. Every dream starts with a different premise: For example, what would it be like if time would repeat endlessly? Or, how would it be if time would run differently in different places? Or, what if we had no idea on the concept of ""future"", living only in the present moment? Those are three variations on time in Einstein's dreams. In the book are still a whole lot more.Time out!I just recall the Pirahã tribe from the Amazon region in Brazil. They actually have no future. What I mean is, there are no words in their language to describe future events — and they are quite happy with that, and why not? In the Pirahã language there are also no words for the past and no numbers. Difficult for us to imagine, but apparently still possible. All of this from the book 
Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes
, a recommended read for linguists.End of time-out. Back to Einstein and his dreams.After reading I briefly skimmed the articles on relativity theory on Wikipedia. Some of the issues discussed there, in particular the different forms of time dilation, are obviously also in the dreams. (One thing I don't get are the houses on mountains and why putting them there should be an advantage. Shouldn't it be the other way around?) Whether Einstein developed his theories from his dreams, or vice versa, the author doesn't say. So we don't know what is cause and what is effect. But at least, from one of the dreams, we learn that the order of cause and effect might become reversed. I'm sure physicists have a lot of fun with Einstein's dreams. But I enjoyed it too.Although relatively young, this book is a timeless classic full of time.

Their ideas, the coherence of phrases, the flowing writing, the logic, the meaning behind the allegories have no match in literature. And when the book is mostly philosophical but based on a physics component, is even more outstanding.And this book is all that. It is not sci-fi or scientific, as the title may mislead and it has no plot whatsoever. It is a book about you, me, us and humanity’s most fearful enemy: Time.Is time really flowing only onward? Nobody knows for sure even today. What if time could alter its structure: going backwards, having three dimensions, being a quality instead of a quantity, standing still, moving on fast-forward, being multiple at the same time or even being a nightingale?
“[…]each man and each woman desires a bird. Because this flock of nightingales is time. Time flutters and fidgets and hops with these birds. Trap one of these nightingales beneath a bell jar and time stops. The moment is frozen for all people and trees and soil caught within. In truth, these birds are rarely caught. The children, who alone have the speed to catch birds, have no desire to stop time. For the children, time moves too slowly already. They rush from moment to moment, anxious for birthdays and new years, barely able to wait for the rest of their lives. The elderly desperately wish to halt time, but are much too slow and fatigued to entrap any bird. For the elderly, time darts by much too quickly. They yearn to capture a single minute at the breakfast table drinking tea, or a moment when a grandchild is stuck getting out of her costume, or an afternoon when the winter sun reflects off snow and floods the music room with light. But they are too slow. They must watch time jump and fly beyond reach.”
All these shapes of time and many more are described here. The nameless characters are mostly the same in each of the 30 mini stories, having their lives lived according to that specific time shape. Or is it the other way around: by how they choose to live gives time shape? 
“Who would fare better in this world of fitful time? Those who have seen the future and live only one life? Or those who have not seen the future and wait to live life? Or those who deny the future and live two lives?”

“Why such a fixation on speed? Because in this world time passes more slowly for people in motion. Thus everyone travels at high velocity, to gain time.”
It is a wonderful, wonderful book. As Liu Cixin said in his postscript of The Three-Body Problem :
”I’ve always felt that the greatest and most beautiful stories in the history of humanity were not sung by wandering bards or written by playwrights and novelists, but told by science. The stories of science are far more magnificent, grand, involved, profound, thrilling, strange, terrifying, mysterious, and even emotional, compared to the stories told by literature. Only, these wonderful stories are locked in cold equations that most do not know how to read.”
You’ll find yourself within these pages and it you’ll be perceiving time very differently from now on…"
22,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely,3,"I bought this book at its regular price (P599=$14) in 1993. I tried reading it right away but after a few pages, I lost interest. Then last Good Friday, when I was dusting my tbr books, I saw this and it looked like a quick read so I put it on top of my stacks of books and yesterday I finished it in a couple of hours. It is about various scenarios (or Einstein's or Lightman's dreams) where time is different from what we have and know it now. There are 13 of those and most of them are fascinating and some are just variations. There is one where time comes in circles, so what I am doing now, typing a GR review will again happen soon. There is one with time not a continuous thing so the people and everything pause like when you click that button in your TV remote. ""In this world..."" often precedes that part of the narration when Lightman defines what the concept of time is in a particular dream. When you read this and you are confused what is happening, just look at that phrase or a similar one and you know what that particular dream is all about. Albert Einstein (1879-1955) and his friend  Michele Besso (1873-1955) appear in the story. Einstein called Besso ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas and when Besso died, part of Einstein's eulogy was this: ""Now Besso has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That means nothing. People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einstein died 34 days after Besso. Einstein was 76 years old.Aside from being amazed how a different concept of time would change this world of us, the lyrical prose of Lightman is also nice to read. Short snappy sentences that picture Switzerland during the start of the 20th century. It also helped me in understanding the Theory of Relativity. I still cannot describe the theory in my own words but I guess if I friend ask what's it is all about, I'd say, things, space and time relative to each other. For example, if you find yourself walking under the hot sun to buy yourself food for lunch and you are sweating you find the 5-minute walk feels like 1 hour but if you just finished talking to your crush for 1 hour you thought that it was so quick like it took you only 5 minutes. That is because time is ""relative"" to what you feel.Anyway, at least now I have an idea when people say ""The Theory of Relativity."" Just don't ask me to explain E=mc2. Hah."
23,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12933866-edward,4,"Einstein's Dreams is a very light, slight novel. The tone and structure are almost exactly those of Calvino's Invisible Cities, and the spirit is pure Borges. Each story is a variation on the theme of time, and each world is so lightly sketched as to represent nothing more than a passing thought; one cannot dwell too much on the implications of each of these thought-experiments. Instead the novel (like Calvino's) leads us to recognise the Venice of our own experience, refracted in these many worlds."
24,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11481458-guillermo,4,"I don't smoke anymore, but man, If I did, this book would be perfect. There's not alot of narrative, its just a series of fictional dreams that Einstein would've had as he was hammering out his theory of time in the early 20th century. There are brief narrative interludes that describe the times Besso and the ever so aloof Einstein share some time together, but most of the book consists of thought experiments on the nature of time. The nameless human characters that are cast in these vignettes are the real stars of this book. We really take for granted that time moves in the way it does, because there are other possible permutations that are explored. For instance, a world where time travels backwards, endelssly repeating onto itself, another where no future exists, and its inhabitatants cling to the present, terrified at what the next moment may bring (I sadly related to this one alot). Another where as you move closer to the center, time slows down closer and closer to a standstill...it's a beautiful, short book. ""And so, at the place where time stands still, one sees parents clutching their children, in a frozen embrace that will never let go. The beautiful young daughter...will never unlearn what her parents have taught her, will never think thoughts that her parents don't know, will never know evil, will never tell her parents that she does not love them, will never stop touching her parents as she does now... And in the place where time stands still, one sees lovers kissing in the shadows of buildings, in a frozen embrace that will never let go. The loved one will never take his arms from where they are now, will never give back the bracelet of memories, will never journey far from his lover, will never place himself in danger in self-sacrifice, will never fail to show his love, will never become jealous, will never fall in love with someone else, will never lose the passion of this instant in time.""

(Paul Auster could read this one and take example). Each story is a perfectly written dystopy on time. What a marvelous book. i had goosebumps while reading it. i had tears in my eyes also.I read it on the Bucharest - Hamburg 2h20min flight while I actually travelled back in time 1h. There are two „times“ in the history of most humans, times which are akribically paid attention at and noted down : time of birth (me - 8:20) and time of death (me - TBA).Loved it. thanks Adriana once again forbeing my literature mentor.Congrats also to Sorin Paliga for a good translation.

27,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4384303-brad-lyerla,5,"This book is a wonder. Lightman envisions and re-envisions many different ways in which time might work. He conveys his visions through poem-like word pictures of ordinary life in very extra-ordinary time domains. The effect is enchanting and up-lifting. Perhaps, because of its enchantments, the book was a slow read for me. Not because I didn't enjoy it. On the contrary, I loved it. But it evoked so many day dreams that I made very slow progress toward the conclusion, which was just fine."
28,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5204784-vonia,5,"Nothing short of amazing. Alan Lightman really shows his expertise in the fields of physics and the philosophy of science, but also psychology abd the social sciences. He writes like a poet. More specifically, his descriptions read like poetry. It evokes emotions and paints such palpable images. A man's seemingly ordinary contemplation as he waits for a customer to arrive easily becomes twenty pages of un-putdownable picturesque prose from Lightman. He uses his writing to evoke emotions and present an event/feeling/situation without ever actually mentioning that event/feeling/situation. This is something all good writers do, a higher level of the most necessary ""show rather than tell"". But Alan Lightman does it with a rarely found elegance.Furthermore, he has an incredible insight into the human psyche; but more importantly the ability to convert those insights into readable words; vignettes that force readers to think; that possess philosophical questions from angled not previously considered. Add to this his scholarship in astronomy, astrophysics, humanities, philosophy of science, and physics (he is currently Professor of the Practice of the Humanities at Massachusetts Institute of Technology), and you have this prolific writer with a very unique talent of bridging the gap between the hard and soft sciences. No wonder his books are a success. ""Einstein's Dreams"" consists of various scenarios, many of which are not fantastical at all. They are, on the surface, theoretical. However, further research shows that they might very well be based on reality- depending on your belief and understanding of quantum physics, philosophy, and relativity. Many of the scenarios are similar, many are the same stated differently. I have marked my favorites; the most fascinating; the ones that made me think the most, whether it be a good or bad possibility. The book actually begins with Einstein preparing to turn in his theory of time at the patent office where he works in 1905. Each of these scenarios are actually written with dates; each is a dream Einstein has. There are five chapters in which Lightman writes a little anecdote or vignette featuring Einstein, the prologue, three interludes, and an epilogue. The interludes are accompanied by an illustration; however minimal (three total), I have always been partial to illustrations in adult novels. They are fun stories, illustrating how overworked Einstein was, how his friend wonders why he ever got married in the first place, seeing how little attention he pays to her, married to his research. In the epilogue, he completes his theory of time. >>>> Prologue Time is like a flow of water, occasionally displaced; people that are sent back in time hide in the shadows, afraid to be responsible for changing history; such individuals from the future can be found in every village and every town, they are left alone and pitied. **** At every point of decision, the world splits into three worlds, each with the same people but with different dates for those people; in time there are an infinity of worlds. Some make light of this isn't, arguing that all possible decisions will a car, so how could one be responsible for his actions? **** In this world, there are two times. Mechanical and Body. The first is unyielding, predetermined, the latter makes up its mind as it goes along. One decides how to live their lives according to this. The former is always watching the dial; they look at their watched to tell them when it is time to eat, when to have sex; the body is a machine, a thing to be ordered, not obeyed. The latter laughs at the notion, for they know that time is inconsistent, rushing forward when they are with loved ones, but slowing down when they are taking their child to the emergency room. Thus, they listen to their moods and desires. **** Everyone lives in the mountains here because at some time in the past scientist discovered that time flows more slowly the further from the center of the Earth. Life is run high above and everyone most avoid venturing down. No sitting. Height is status. Time is absolute here. A world in which time is absolute is a world of consolation. For a while the movements of individuals are unpredictable, the movement of time is predictable.Cause and effect are erratic. The two can be mixed, or unrelated. It is a world of sincerity, as everything only has one meaning, for the present. Living in the moment. In this world, time does pass, but little happens. As little happens from year to year, little happens from month to month, day today. If time and the passage of events are the same, then time barely moves at all. If time and events are not the same, then it is only people who barely move. If a person holds no ambitions in this world, he suffers unknowingly. If a person hold ambitions, he suffers knowingly, but very slowly. >>>> Interlude **** The date for the end of the world is known as fact. Everything shuts down beginning a year before the date This results in a liberation and bliss, for if the end is inevitable, why not celebrate and love? In the last second, everyone is together in harmony. Different towns are stuck in different periods of time. The tragedy of this world is that everyone is alone, for a life in the past cannot be shared with the present. Each person who gets stuck in time gets stuck alone. The passage of time equates to increasing order. People have fun with abandon, knowing that time will restore order. Lipsticks and brushes and letters may be tough and the purses with the satisfaction that they will sort themselves out automatically. Gardens may never be tended, desks become neat by the end of the day. **** Time stands still. As a traveler approaches this place from any direction, he moves more and more slowly. Who would make this program is to the center of time? Parents with children, and lovers. Pure happiness occurs as children are forever young and love lasts forever. Sadly, as one returns to the outer world, children grow rapidly, forget the centuries long embrace from their parents, and lovers return to find their friends long gone. Would you rather have an eternity of contentment, even if that eternity were fixed and frozen? **** No time. Only images. I want to copy this entire chapter, which was beautifully written. Pages 57 to 60. A short excerpt: ""A young boy sitting in an empty auditorium, his heart racing as if he were on stage. Footprints in snow on a winter island. A leaf on the ground in Autumn, red and gold and brown, delicate. A stall of peppers on Marktgasse, the yellow and green and red. A woman lying on her couch with wet hair, holding the hand of a man she will never see again. A train with red cars, on a great bridge, with graceful arches, the river underneath, tiny dots that are houses in the distance. blue Shadows of trees in a full moon. Roses cut and adrift on the river beneath the bridge, with a chateau rising. Red hair of a lover, wild, mysterious, promising. The purple petals of an iris, held by a young woman. The first kiss. Planets caught in space, oceans, silent. A yellow brush."" There are no memories. When it is time to return to the families at the end of the day, each person consults his address book to learn where he lives. With time, each person's Book of Life thickens until it cannot be read in its entirety. The elderly might read the early pages, to know themselves when they were young, or they may read the end to know themselves in later years. Others have decided not to read at all. They have decided that it matters if you are a good or bad, richer or poorer, educated or uneducated, for no one will remember. They look you in the eye. Time flows unevenly; individuals receive occasional glimpses of the future. Few risks are taken. Those who have seen the future do not need to take risks, and those who have not yet seem to be sure to wait for their vision without taking risks. All is in motion. Time is slower for those in motion. Time is money. Thus, like the scenario in which height equates to status, the faster and more one moves, the better. Unfortunately, seeing others equals seeing the other gain time. So no more looking at others? >>>> Interlude Time moves backward. A couple waits for the infatuation honeymoon period while they deal with divorce. At a funeral, one gladly waits for the good times. **** Everyone only lives one day. One will only ever see one season. By the end of the day, one is already alone. Parents have died by noon, friends have moved. Life is divided, unknown with no witnesses. Time is a sense, dependent on the prior history of the seer. Does time really exist outside perception? Who can say if an event happens with or without cause, in the past or the future, or happened at all? ****Immortality. There are The Laters and The Nows. With all the time in the world, would you procrastinate or would you as a result feel you need to do even more? Some commit suicide. I found it nice that They were given this option at all. True immortality, in my opinion, would come with the cost of the inability to die. And I would choose mortality over immortality. I believe we cannot truly appreciate the light without the darkness to understand the difference. Time is a quality, not quantity. It cannot be measured. There are no clocks, calendars, definite appointments. Events occur in accordance and in relation to other events. One will see a woman waiting at an intersection for who knows how long for her lover. The is no future. It is not possible to imagine the future. Each kiss is the last kiss, each laugh the last laugh. One cannot imagine consequences. Some are paralyzed by fear, others the opposite. One sits at a café, marveling at how the world ends in rain, since every moment is the end. He is not waiting for the rain to end, because waiting does not exist. Twenty minutes later, he Marvel's at how the world ends in sunlight. **** Time is a visible dimension. I guess this is omniscient time travel. One can look one way a see marriages, divorces; the other, children, deaths. One may choose to enter different time dimensions. I would find this highly torturous. One could step into the uncertainty of the future or stay stable, but once you see your future, everything changes. One might get lost in time, wonder at what you lost. Time is intermittent. At restarts of time, the pieces can sometimes not fit together perfectly. For example, a couple meet. In the middle of their conversation, time is restarted, unbeknownst to either. He reads something on her face that makes him think she is no longer in love with him, ending things forever. >>>> Interlude **** The Temple of Time. Only one Great Clock in the world, which people pilgrimage to from all over to pay their respects. This is basically about how we can be a slave to time; that we want it but we hate the power it has over our lives at the same time. At any given time, thousands are in queue; they stand secretly hating, for ""They must watch measured that which should not be measured. They have been trapped their own inventiveness and audacity. And they must pay with their lives."" Time is a local phenomenon. Different location, different speed. The time it takes to fall in love in one place could equate to one second in another. One drop of water, a girl becomes a woman. Thus results in much variety. Isolation. Would you want to travel to another time zone? This scenario is similar to the one where time stands still in one place. **** Time is predetermined; there is no freedom of choice. Therefore, is there no right or wrong? No person is responsible for their actions. Everyone is merely a spectator. I wonder, how would I feel in this world? On the one hand, I feel I would hate it. On the other, maybe I would feel at least a little good, relieved, literally, of the burden of choice?Countless copies. One feels all the others like him. Which reputation is his own, his true identity, his future? Should he leave his wife? What comfort has he given him? His thoughts loop back. Should he leave his wife? Confusion.A shifting past. How would we know what the true past is; why would we care if it could randomly change? One can trap time, which is a nightingale. This is difficult to do, a rare occurrence. When one does, the catchers delight in the moment now frozen; they savor the precise placement of family and friends and facial expressions, but soon discover that the nightingale expires. Essentially, the ability to freeze time. >>>> Epilogue Since this was so similar to Italo Calvino's ""Invisible Cities"", but I actually liked this far more, I think it is noteworthy to share more praise I had for Alan Lightman's after reading both: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
29,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7607437-nathan-n-r-gaddis,0,"Asking a physicist about experience is like asking a botanist about the distinction between a fruit and a vegetable. They're both experts so they'll give you an answer (possibly :: ""it's an illussshion""). Even though the concepts contained within the question are not part of their vocabulary. The honorable physicist/botanist would refer one to an expert in the relevant field. ______On a different timeline I wrote ::I'd say that what this pamphlet illustrates is what it's like to live in a world without human beings ; what it's like to be a f*'ing human being by way of the negative.

At any rate, unconvincing fiction. I much preferred the other book this one came packaged with to my doorstep."
30,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54731819-chris,5,"What a marvelous discovery, this little book about TIME, featuring Einstein, working as a patent clerk in 1905. In between his clerkship position, Einstein personally questions and imagines concepts of different elements of time and their effects on man and nature. There are 30 short chapters which include examples and beautiful, thoughtful prose on fast time, slow time, circular time, seasonal time, one day time, mechanical time, body time, three dimensional time, future time, backwards time, infinite time, etc. What is absolutely stunning is how eloquently the author writes about and describes the town and surrounding area, people, daily lives and how all those movements change within each time concept theory. For example seasonal time is being born, live and die in the winter and never experiencing the summer. Feeling a snowflake on the cheek but never experiencing the hot rays of the summer sun. Fast time is everyone moving too quickly, not fully engaging or paying attention to what is going on around them, chaotic. Slow time is lethargy, uncaring, boring, unchallenging. Both are gravitational in nature, i.e., time is faster in higher elevations, slower in valleys. Backwards time for example, is someone who is ill or who has died who comes back in reverse through their former lives; Gray hair turns youthful brown, wrinkles disappear, good health and vigor reappear in stages all the way back to the beginning, to nursing as a newborn babe in mother’s arms. Mechanical time is time harnessed and tracked through instruments, like the clock, which opens up all kinds of possibilities, like appointments, time to sleep, time to eat, having/adhering to a schedule. Body time is time governed only by your body and mind. Wake up or sleep whenever your body decides by itself. Eat whenever you want. For the one day time concept, you are born, live your entire life and die, all in one day. This was a very unique and beautifully written compact book about “TIME” by Alan Lightman, that exceeded my reading expectations. "
31,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52343138-lauren,5,"Wow! This small book packed a huge punch! Reading Einstein's Dreams was like watching scenes on a projector, flitting from one scene to another to another but all converging to create a wonderful, reflective and meditative piece on the essence of time. This book is really a series of vignettes painted vividly in various cities throughout Switzerland - here we enter worlds where time flows backward, - where there is no future and people just live and exist in the here and now, - where people glimpse pieces of the future and try to change their lives so their future doesn't come to pass,- where people only live for one entire day, - where time is a loop and the same events happen over and over again, - where people attempt to stop time by trapping nightingales in bell jars, - a world where people have no memories, - a world where each city experiences time differently, - a reality where people live multiple lives - and one of my favourites - a reality where people build their houses on stilts to be closer to the sky and therefore experience a slower passage of time. Honestly, this book was incredibly thought-provoking and beautifully-written. The imagery was otherworldly, the sentences capturing the different essences of time perfectly and the illustrations grounding the ethereal subject matter. My only gripe was that a couple of the vignettes just didn't do it for me.4.5 stars"
32,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21675244-stian,4,"This is a brilliantly entertaining read. The book gives off a magical sort of vibe: you join Lightman (or rather, Einstein) down the rabbit hole, in a sense, and experience time, and various conceptions of time, in Einstein's dreams. There are beautiful interludes between the short dreams, where we join Einstein: ""He has come to the office at dawn, after another upheaval. His hair is uncombed and his trousers are too big. In his hands he holds twenty crumbled pages, his new theory of time, which he will mail today to the German journal of physics."" And so, in this ""room full of practical ideas"" we follow Einstein's dreams about time. Circular time, where time repeats itself, and everyone is forced to repeat their lives; time as water, where, now and then, some ""cosmic disturbance will cause a rivulet of time to turn away from the mainstream, to make connection backstream"", transporting people back in time; dreams where time has three dimensions and all chains of events happen, simultaneously, and many other dreams. They are short and fascinating -- a musing on human creativity. But in the end, the few sentences that really stuck with me were these: ""Out of many possible natures of time, imagined in as many nights, one seems compelling. Not that others are impossible. The others might exist in other worlds."""

Nice prose, but there's nothing very compelling here.Skip it."

What if people had no conception of the future? What if everyone's life span was only one day? Etc etc etc. Sounds cool, sure.Unfortunately the writing is so lightweight that each five-page section seems to drag on forever. After you get how time ""works"" in the first few sentences, nothing interesting is revealed, and Lightman actually repeats paragraphs with the same exact idea, just with a different person/object/whatever. Making matters worse, Lightman's prose is...um...well, you may notice that a lot of blurbs and reviews call it ""simple"" or ""clear"" or ""easy to understand"", which in this case just means ""real bad"". Look, Lightman is obviously way smarter than I will ever be, and the idea itself is interesting, and works well in certain parts, but I can't help thinking how Borges or Calvino or someone with greater skills would've knocked this concept into another time zone. This just reads like a college writing exercise. Disappointing."

Maybe I should read Twilig-- nah, never mind.Einstein's Dreams was one of the better books I've come across in recent memory, much thanks to the recommendation of fellow Goodreader, Rowena Monde. For some reason, I expected something of a novel here, perhaps a single strand narrative of Einstein crafting his brilliant Theory of Relativity, but the book was more like a collection of stories. Each chapter, save for a few interludes, introduced a unique world where time acted differently.At first, I was a bit put off by the author's disconnected tone. Lightman just sort of describes things like an expressionless observer, there's no real immersion here, but as corny as it sounds - the book allows you to choose how you feel about each option, free from judgement and free from a specified interpretation. It was a pleasant experience.The ideas range from a world where time slows down at higher elevations, causing the rich to build stark mountaintop houses on stilts to gain longer lives while the bohemian types prance about in the valleys and meadows, unconcerned with the passage of time - choosing to embrace the warm beauty of life over cold longevity. My favorite story involved a man chained to a painful memory of urinating in school as a youngster. That humiliating experience lingered in his adult mind, governing his actions and controlling his perception of the world. As you can see, this man lived both in the past and the present, all by way of a memory.Such ideas, emotional or physical, are fascinating. Some of them are loosely rooted in actual aspects of Einstein's theories, such as time dilation. This is the kind of book I love to read, (pun alert) time and time again."

When was the last time you wish to stay young and live forever?In this thought-provoking book written by Alan Lightman, a professor of physics and writing at MIT, all these scenarios and many more were presented as a hypothetical series of Einstein's dreams during the time he worked as a patent clerk in Switzerland in 1905. In his dreams, time flows differently in different worlds. In one world, time has three dimensions, in another world time is sticky and some people get stuck in the past, in another world time is infinite, so on and so on.Of all the fictional worlds, people are, however counter-intuitive this may sound to you, most content when they live in the moment. They don't want an infinite life, they don't want to stay eternally in a happy moment, they don't want to go back to the past""Most people have learned how to live in the moment... It is a world of sincerity. It is a world in which every word spoken speaks just to that moment, every glance given had only one meaning, each touch has no past or no future, each kiss is a kiss of immediacy.""The book will take you to a journey into different worlds with different concepts of time in lyrical and intelligent prose. You will find these scenarios strikingly similar to your life or someone's you know. It will make you think deeper and be more conscious about time.A shinning 5-starred book."

Mankind invented calendars and decided that, for example, 2016 comes ten years after 2006. We might indeed look and feel ten years older. Our bodies are getting older, so we must be moving forward in time, right?. But within a universe that is billions of years old and constantly expanding, we know very little. We might have it all wrong about time, after all."
42,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1628041-book-concierge,4,"Alan Lightman is a physicist. In this fiction debut he imagines the kinds of dreams Einstein might have had in the spring and early summer of 1905, when he was a patent clerk in Switzerland, and working on his theory of relativity. Each chapter is a different flight of fancy. In one time is a circle bending back on itself, so that the world repeats itself precisely, endlessly. In another Time has three dimensions, so that there are three perpendicular futures; at every point of decision the world splits into three worlds, each with the same people, but different fates for those people. In one world Time is absolute, with clocks everywhere all in sync; in anther, Time is a local phenomenon, flowing at different speeds in different locations. In one dream people live for only one day – a baby born in December will never know daffodils or summer berries, while one born in July will never see snow. In another dream, people live forever. This collection of essays on “relativity of time” is engaging, interesting, fascinating, and thought-provoking. The writing is beautiful, with an ethereal quality reminiscent of dreams. Some examples:On this late afternoon, in these few moments while the sun is nestled in a snowy hollow of the Alps, a person could sit beside the lake and contemplate the texture of time.The tragedy of this world is that no one is happy, whether stuck in a time of pain or of joy. The tragedy of this world is that everyone is alone. For a life in the past cannot be shared with the present. Each person who gets stuck in time gets stuck alone.Dawn. A salmon fog floats through the city, carried on the breath of the river. The sun waits beyond the Nydegg Bridge, throws its long, reddened spikes along Kramgasse to the giant clock that measures time, illuminates the underside of balconies. Sounds of morning drift through the streets like the smell of bread. And from my favorite dream (because I have always visualized time, though not in the sense of foreseeing the future…)In this world, time is a visible dimension. Just as one may look off in the distance and see houses, trees, mountain peaks that are landmarks in space, so one may look out in another direction and see births, marriages, deaths that are signposts in time, stretching off dimly into the far future.There is no real plot to this work of fiction. So readers who need a strong story arc may not like it. But I loved it. The whole time I was reading I felt as if I had just awoken and could recall images but not quite grasp the full text of a dream. "

E que desilusão...O tema interessava-me (ideias de Einstein sobre a natureza do tempo) e a classificação média no Goodreads era superior a 4 estrelas, pelo que estava na minha lista há já algum tempo. Quando o descobri em casa da minha mãe, numa altura em que procurava um livro pequeno, foi fácil decidir-me por ele.O facto de ter levado quase um mês a ler um livro com cerca de 100 páginas deveu-se a várias coisas, entre as quais o já referido facto de ser uma seca. Não são propriamente contos, mas sim ""impressões"" que têm invariavelmente 3 páginas e que dificilmente corresponderiam a sonhos (os meus, pelo menos, são muito mais animados e emocionantes!...). Estas micro-narrativas têm uma forma essencialmente descritiva, sempre no mesmo cenário - a cidade onde Einstein se encontrava, as ruas, o rio, os Alpes ao fundo.Uma das razões por que não gosto de contos é que não consigo ler vários de seguida, por isso foi muito frustrante a leitura deste livrinho - na maior parte dos dias lia apenas as tais 3 páginas... e vingava-me com A Guerra dos Tronos.Não recomendo...So boring! And so disappointing...The subject interested me (Einstein thoughts about the nature of time) and the average rating on Goodreads was above 4, so this one was on my wishlist for a while. When I found it at my mom's, while looking for a small book to read, it was an easy call.The fact that I took almost one month to read a 100 page book was due to a number of things, one being that it was, as said, boring. These are not really short stories but ""impressions"", all of them 3 pages long, that would hardly be considered dreams (mine, at least, are far more lively and exciting!...). These micro-tales are essentially descriptive, always in the same setting - the city where Einstein lived: the streets, the river, the Alps at a distance.One of the reasons I don't like short stories is that I can't read a bunch of them in one sitting, so reading this book was very frustrating - on most days I would read the mentioned 3 pages... and then I took revenge with The Game of Thrones.Not recommended..."
44,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929972-dan,3,"Short fictions that might remind readers of Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities. Each of the fictions is set in a different fictional world, and each of these worlds can be distinguished from the others by the way in which time moves: in one, it moves in a circle; in another, it is like a river; in another it passes more quickly or slowly depending on where you are; in another it ""stands still,"" etc.The title of the book, along with the dates heading each of the fictions (all from 1905, and all in chronological order) and the inclusion of ""interludes"" depicting Albert Einstein during his time working in Zurich as a patent clerk, suggest that one might read the book as a novel in which each of the short fictions represents a single chapter. However, since there appears to be little character development and little relation among the stories apart from their representing Einstein's dreams, it is also possible to read the fictions on their own, and in any order one likes; starting with the last, for instance, and then reading the one before it, and the one before that, until one reaches the first of the fictions; or starting somewhere in the middle of the book, reading to the end, and then continuing from the beginning of the book to reach the point from which one originally started; or Hopscotching from one fiction at the beginning to one near the end, and then back to another fiction at the beginning, and so on; or even reading one of the fictions multiple times, as a way of delaying finishing the book, for instance."

Honestly, my brain is still reeling from reading this book.I am one of those persons who believes in time. I believe in reaching on time, being on time and respecting other people's time. Time is the only thing we cannot get back or get more of, which means it is something we should value and respect. Imagine how shattered my world is after reading this book.Lightman's writes stories showing the numerous ways we can look at time- as linear, as a circle, as disjointed, as three dimensional, endless, etc... Lightman opens our world to the numerous possibilities and make a case that time is measure how we see fit. This book really blew me away, it made me question how I look at time and how I currently live my life. While it is only 150 pages long, it deep and profound.

46,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"Einstein's Dreams is rather beautifully written, a collection of little vignettes about time. I don't understand physics and so on very well, really, but this is just a world of possibilities, as Einstein might have dreamt when he was coming up with his theories of time.It's not very substantial, and it won't take long to read, but it's lovely.

49,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4596358-ferdy,3,"SpoilersA series of vignettes which focus on time in different worlds and the unique way it manifests itself in each. Einstein's Dreams was definitely interesting to read and at times quite thought provoking, but once I got to the half way point it did get kind of repetitive with its message of family and love and not taking things for granted and knowing what's important and so forth. It all started to feel quite heavy handed and preachy. There were some concepts of time which were really fascinating, like time moving slowly the higher up people were, so everyone lived on mountains or on houses on stilts. Then there were the birds which if captured in a bell jar could stop time, it was illogical but also really imaginative.There were quite a few that were extremely nonsensical and weird, and not in a good way. Like the one where people traveled to the 'center of time' where time moved super slow and it took years and years to move a single step. Lovers and families went there so they could be together forever, but when they left there that 'forever' was actually only a few seconds to them so it made the whole thing kind of pointless. Then there was the one where time was discontinuous and stopped and started at random but the pauses in time were so insignificant that no one even noticed, so they were living their lives like normal anyhow. The memory one with the book of life was odd too, how did the world function when people forgot everything with each new day? How did they retain knowledge and skills and manage to survive and function when everyone was clueless apart from the notes they wrote? That world would be fucked, but it pretty much ran like normal. I won't even start on the world where everyone moved fast and lived in moving houses, it was so silly.The lack of logic or explanation to some of the worlds was pretty ridiculous,but overall it was still a different and at times very fascinating read."
50,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61361708-shaun-mendum,5,"In February, a friend lent me a copy of this book, Einstein's Dreams, by Alan Lightman. I had not heard of it, nor could I discern much from its title or blurb, and that made me all the more intrigued. Reading it took a matter of days. Alan Lightman lays out Einstein's theory of relativity in three-page chapters, in each of which he provides a different scenario. The question the entire novella centres around is 'What if time existed like this?'What if everyone lived forever? What if we only had one day to live? What if time was different from town to town? What happens after the end of the universe? All of these and more, questions myself and many others have questioned themselves, in bath, or in bed, but are too shy to ask these questions aloud.Now, it's a novella, sure, but I wouldn't necessarily call it a 'story'. I would call it an experience. I went through such a metaphysical journey with this one, from one thought-provoking chapter to another. It was so wonderful to see the possibilities already conceptualised in my head fleshed out and expanded upon. It was heavy to read, sure, but very short in length, and impossible to turn away. I promise that if you turn past the front page, you will not find a way back.Truly, this is the best book I have read to date, and I have already recommended it to many. Please, if you have a moment, delve into this book, and experience a concept you will never forget."
51,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9692204-satyajeet,5,"I read this in one sitting (2-3 hours), and I found it to be highly imaginative, thought-provoking and very well written. Lightman invites you to participate in explorations regarding the nature of time seen from the eyes of an acquaintance of Einstein during the time he formulated his theories of relativity. The different interpretations of time gives rise to different existential problems, and the book gives brief, intriguing descriptions of them.In each chapter, the reader is invited to imagine a world where time works in a particular way, and to consider the consequences. In one world, time is a perfect circle that repeats itself endlessly. In a different scenario, time stands still. Then time is a quality, not a quantity. We are even shown a place where time does not exist at all, and there are only images. Sometimes these visions of an alternative reality are described as abstract philosophical musings - in a world where people live forever, we suppose that there are those who will seek to cram as much as possible into their infinite existence (the 'Nows'), whilst others will procrastinate endlessly (the 'Laters').Take out 2 hours, and READ THIS"

53,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98685241-t-m-garc-a-rei,2,"Never have I been so prepared to fall in love with a book. I anticipated being held by both wrists, dragged across the stars, reduced into particles, and scattered all throughout time and space so that I may partake in the birth and death of the universe because I assume that’s how it should feel to be transported into the subconscious of The-fucking-Einstein. Instead, I got: “She is nice. She makes love to him very very slowly, over a period of months.”Very much like some men I’ve been with before, the book proved to be a massive disappointment. I’m sure it has more to tell, but I didn’t want to waste my time on it any longer. Needless to say, it broke my heart."
54,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1013849-christine,5,"this is one of the most amazing poetic explorations of einstein's theory of relativity i have ever read... technically it's considered a novel, but it's more like an essay collection in my opinion. i highly recommend this book. it gave me an entirely new perspective on viewing life and the meaning of ""time"".from amazon: The book takes flight when Einstein takes to his bed and we share his dreams, 30 little fables about places where time behaves quite differently. In one world, time is circular; in another a man is occasionally plucked from the present and deposited in the past: ""He is agonized. For if he makes the slightest alteration in anything, he may destroy the future ... he is forced to witness events without being part of them ... an inert gas, a ghost ... an exile of time.""[Lightman's]purpose is simply to study the different kinds of time in Einstein's mind, each with its own lucid consequences. There is no plot in this small volume--it's more like a poetry collection than a novel. Like Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time, it's a mind-stretching meditation by a scientist who's been to the far edge of physics and is back with wilder tales than Marco Polo's. And unlike many admirers of Hawking, readers of Einstein's Dreams have a high probability of actually finishing it. "
55,140007780X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1780797-jesse-houle,2,"A friend recommended this to me after I lent her God's Debris. I feel like if I read this before Scott Adams' book I might've liked it a little more but I still think it, while for the most part being a worthwhile read, was nothing incredible. Of course it doesn't cover a broad range of ideas like God's Debris as each chapter is simply a different take on time, and while I can see the similarities it's probably unfair to lump them in together as Lightman's book is, I'm afraid, quite a bit inferior. I felt like most of the book was simply fun ideas rather than potentially persuasive theories and the fun ideas were often not too striking. I think this would be good for someone who hasn't had a thousand conversations with friends about time and the universe, and I don't want to dismiss the book entirely, but to me it felt too much like I had already thought about much of what it was trying to make me think about and most of that wasn't deeply compelling."
