0,0140230122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24897389-richard,2,"I promised myself years ago that I'd finally stop reading this sort of book, had been sticking to it pretty well (just a couple of regrettable lapses during the 1990s) and had fair warning about this one: standing in the bookshop leafing through its pages, I spotted the word ""exformation"" - a sort of counterpart of ""information"" of course - yet still bought the thing anyway. I think I might need professional help (or Bookaholics Anonymous).You could summarise The User Illusion's thesis on a single page. 1, what we call ""the conscious mind"" doesn't do any of the following: it doesn't feel, dream, remember, imagine, think, decide or act; all these, everything the mind does in fact, are done non-consciously. 2, the reason consciousness doesn't do any of these is because it doesn't exist - the ""I"" and the conscious realm it seems to inhabit are an illusion analogous to the ""user illusion"" of computer terminology. Now as it happens, having mulled it over for years myself, I pretty much agree with 1 (although not 2); the most obvious problem with this thesis, though, is that you can't publish a book only one page long, so you pad it out (sorry, prepare the ground) with a series of huge digressions into anything even remotely fashionable at the time: information theory, Godel's Theorem, chaos, fractals, Julian Jaynes, left-versus-right cerebral hemispheres, some nice optical-illusion drawings you've seen a hundred times before...Gaia...Zeno's paradoxes...Won't tell you how my head feels this morning. Never again..."

It was surprisingly one of the better written texts describing Entropy I have encountered and I felt like the writer pulled from some magnificent sources for this work. It covered a broad number of fields from consciousness of course to philosophy, communism, cosmology, history, computer science and a whole host of other disciplines. There were really only three main points to it which in some instances became fairly repetitive but the scope of what he was trying to convey in through these other disciplines I thought was laudable and well conceived. It really made me want to pick up Julian Jaynes work which I have had on my to read shelf for awhile. I thought this was really good to be honest it was a lot of good brain candy. Its a completely different way to view the ego in representation to both the social community and to the unconscious ""me"" that presides over much of our actions. I feel both more and less of a human for the ""I"" and the ""Me"" that this body I have contains. "
2,0140230122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,5,"Still good, still thought-provoking after many years.I bought this about the time it first came out, and recently finished a re-read of it.Some parts of it are a bit dated, some parts are perhaps a bit uneven, and the book is arguably as much philosophy as it is science. That said, it's still a good book, good enough to definitely not deserve the 1- and 2-star ratings. So, even though for me alone, it's probably closer to 4 stars, I give it a 5-star rating.That said, philosophy and science can both be provocative at times. Quantum theory still is today. As is general relativity. As is existentialism. As is the question of ""what is consciousness.""It's not a ""fault"" of Norretranders if he doesn't precisely answer that; rather, today even, it's a question of ""can consciousness be precisely defined""? And, books by Dan Dennett and Steve Pinker aside, I say the answer is still no. Or, at best, like Potter Stewart on pornography: We know consciousness when we experience it.As for claims that the central idea is dated? Tosh.Dan Wegner and others go beyond where Dennett stops and refuses to go further, and note that ""no Cartesian consciousness"" also means ""no Cartesian free willer."" This book is exactly in line with that, with the whole idea of ""user illusion."" The reader is invited to wrestle along with Norretranders as to what this all means. Godel's incompleteness theorem, the recursiveness behind Mandelbrot's fractals and other ideas in the book all connect to that ""user illusion.""Yes, he could have cited Kierkegaard less, and other existentialists more. Yes, he comes a bit close to, though never going into, New Ageiness here and there on occasion.It's still a very good book"
3,0140230122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3433602-chris,2,"This book has some really interesting stuff in it, but it was just plain a slog to read through. The chapters have loads of details that are of, at best, passing interest, and it feels as though the book could have been condensed immensely. I found myself zipping through other non-fiction reads by comparison.If you know how to speed read or how to skim effectively then this book is a bit better of a read. Things improved when I stopped trying to read every word cover to cover and just skimmed through the pages picking up the important details as I went. Moreover, it is around the last hundred pages of the book where the truly interesting information is held -- up to this point mostly deals with the history of various scientific fields that build up to this point.Though there is a lot of interesting science in this book, it's worth noting that there's also a bit of supposition. Ideas like consciousness only arising within the last few thousand years makes one wonder, if true, how it was that it did so everywhere on the globe at once. Evolution would not act in that way -- such evolutionary traits would develop within larger regions, but clearly consciousness developed in North America, Asia, Europe, Australia (the native tribes thereof), etc. without any interbreeding taking place. At the very least, it still holds burden of proof.That said, many of the ideas set forth do make perfect sense under today's science and knowledge, and the book contains enough of these to be more than worthwhile, if you can manage to dig your way through enough of it to get at them."

7,0140230122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29791454-domhnall,5,"Tor Norretranders is Denmark’s leading science writer with a track record of best sellers. It follows that his book is a well written compilation of diverse scientific theories and findings, all presented in a chatty style and broken into short chapters and sections that help to keep our interest alive. For anyone who reads a fair number of popular science books there are a lot of familiar names, typically well explained and often presented in an original way or with genuinely useful insights. This alone is a good enough reason to read this book for pleasure. For today’s army of internet warriors, it will have many sharp points that help in debates on diverse topics. To keep us on our toes, it also includes a few seriously defective ones which may impress the unwary, the most egregious being the very poorly supported claim that humanity first became conscious about 3,000 years ago. That is one piece of spurious misinformation we must all now work to forget. In addition we need to be aware that the age of his book means it has no references to MRI brain scans, which open up entirely new ways to investigate the particular phenomena he describes. Science writers typically seem to go into paroxysms when trying to explain or discuss the phenomenon of consciousness. They insist that the topic is enormously complex and its solution is utterly beyond our reach, the ultimate puzzle of the universe, and for this reason they throw into the basket everything they know, some of which is even relevant. It provokes a tendency to mistake word games for poetry, clever twists of language for deep philosophy, geeks for creative artists. On the theme of consciousness, Norretranders has his own interesting twist, which is to argue that consciousness is far less central to the way our minds function than we may imagine; he virtually suggests that our conscious mind is a passive observer of the work done out of awareness by the unconscious mind. He makes a good case but I think he is wrong; he gets too lost in the sheer quantity of his material and fails to focus on the argument itself; he presents mountains of evidence to support his case and fails to appreciate that it is more important and more useful to pay attention to the material that calls it into doubt. Firstly, we have Popper’s concept of scientific method to remind us that no amount of supporting evidence can outweigh evidence of being wrong. Secondly, we have Norretranders’ own argument that a large quantity of information is no better than noise; it only becomes meaningful after most of it is discarded, selectively, and reduced to a simple product of reasoning, which becomes its point or its meaning. Worst of all, he tries to simplify a biological and psychological phenomenon into the language of physics and mathematics, in the form of information theory, and even his own material in this book is sufficient to tell him that this is a doomed assignment from the outset. Yes it is possible to reduce consciousness (for example) to a simpler, physical or mathematical description, but only by throwing away most of what we know, and we cannot reconstruct consciousness from the resulting simplistic description. He is just plain wrong; his argument can only work to the extent that there is a conscious mind available to read and consider his argument, which already demonstrates that his argument does not work after all. Some quotes from the book: The interesting things in life may not be the ones that take long explanations to describe but those that take many experiences to get to know. [p80]A biological creature is the result of a very long evolutionary computation. ... A “yes” or a “no” may be the result of a whole mass of hard-won experience. [p81]The concept of information is a very bad one if it is taken at face value. If you suppose that the information in information theory is about meaning, ... you are in for a disappointment. ... Because it is not what we say to each other every day that establishes all the meaning and beauty and truth our everyday conversations contain; it is everything we think before we speak. [p98]The interesting thing about words is not that they can be said but that there was something that could be said. The interesting thing about speech is not how we speak but that we have something to say. [p106]The American anthropologist and cyberneticist Gregory Bateson ... wrote in 1966 ... “As mammals we are familiar with, though largely unconscious of, the habit of communicating about our relationships... Like other terrestrial mammals, we do most of our communicating on this subject by means of kinesic [movement] and paralinguistic signals, such as bodily movements, involuntary tensions of voluntary muscles, changes of facial expression, hesitations, shifts in tempo of speech or movement, overtones of the voice and irregularities of expression...” ... The problem is that in practice we humans do not wish to admit that we are animals. We think our consciousness is identical with ourselves. So we tend to believe that everything we say lies in the words. We take ourselves literally. We think information is the important part of a conversation.[p149]The insight that consciousness plays a smaller role in human life than most of us would believe may be vital because it is the only insight capable of transforming a culture that has serious viability problems. [p161]If all the information that thunders through our senses is merely discarded, apart from the bit we are aware of, how can we tell that the bit we are aware of is the right one? [p173] ... If consciousness selects at random from what comes in, it really is not much use. There must necessarily be a degree of “wisdom” in the sorting that takes place – otherwise we could go around conscious of something random, with no connection to what really matters. [p173] ... Consciousness is based on an enormous discarding of information and the ingenuity of consciousness consists not of the information it contains but of the information it does not contain. [p173]We do not see what we sense. We see what we think we sense. Our consciousness is presented with an interpretation, not the raw data. Long before this presentation, an unconscious information processing has discarded information so that what we see is a simulation, a hypothesis, an interpretation, and we are not free to choose. [p187]What we experience has acquired meaning before we become conscious of it. [p187]The problem of other minds is closely related to the problem of the existence of the external world. How can we say there even is one. A Danish philosopher, Peter Zinkernagel, has solved this problem by pointing out that we cannot say there is no external reality: language breaks down totally if we assert that language does not have anything to talk about. ... But this is not proof that there are other minds (or an external reality, for that matter). It is merely a stating of the fact that here is a problem we cannot discuss... unless you acknowledge the existence of other minds, you have nobody to talk to about this point of view of yours. [p196]Human consciousness possesses a high degree of complexity. It is a phenomenon of considerable depth. A great deal of information is discarded in its making... We must therefore now ask: does creating consciousness take time? Does discarding most of the sensory information before we experience also take time?” Well, it must. So the real question is how long it takes... because we sense constantly and we are conscious – almost – all the time. So if consciousness takes time, it must constantly lag behind! [p209] An actor has a much higher bandwidth than language does. There are gestures and gesticulations, intonations, movements, glances, and charisma; a series of monverbale communications which the audience perceives more or less consciously. Similarly, the musician does not merely deliver the score but hopes to transform it into notes that supply it with pauses, accents, phrasing and other goodies. [p263]The theme of psychotherapy can be formulated as the I’s acceptance of the Me: the acceptance of the fact that it cannot control the real subject of an act even though our entire culture tells us we can if only we try to be a bit pious and holy. The point of psychotherapy for the individual is the lesson: I accept my Me. [p271]Heidegger expressed the angst at the way the world can be freely interpreted but experienced only through interpretation: the angst of the I at not being the Me. [p274]In The Sickness Unto Death, Kierkegaard describes the feeling of despair which comes at three levels: ... “The despair of not being conscious that one has a self; the despair of not wishing to be oneself; the despair at wishing to be oneself.” [p275]The content of our consciousness is already processed and reduced, put into context. Conscious experiences possess depth: They have been put in context; lots of information has been processed but is not presented to us. A mass of sensory information has been discarded before conscious awareness occurs – and this sensory information is not presented. Yet the experience itself is based on the discarded information. [p288] ... We experience not the raw sensory data but a simulation of them. The simulation of our sensory experiences is a hypothesis about reality. This simulation is what we experience... It takes time to achieve this depth... There are bundles and bundles of intermediate calculations that are not relevant to our actions in the world. We have to solve the binding problem before we can experience anything at all; we have to form a hypothesis about where the sound came from before we hear it. [p289]The bandwidth of language is far lower than the bandwidth of sensation. Most of what we know about the world we can never tell each other. [p309]The holism – reductionism controversy today is a debate that may be said to be passé; false opposites. Actually, none of the parties to this debate had grasped the real point, which P.W.Anderson had already formulated in his slogan “More is different,” which originated from a lecture he gave in 1967. “The ability to reduce everything to simple fundamental laws does not imply the ability to start from those laws and reconstruct the universe.” ... Anderson’s point, therefore, is that reductionism does not necessarily conflict with the view that complexity exists and new natural phenomena arise every time we step up the scale and study new layers of the universe. [p356]The road to complexity is simple but long. When simple rules are allowed to beaver away long enough in time or in a sufficient number of component parts, completely new properties appear; they emerge, break out, pop up, come into view. These emergent properties cannot be found by studying a small collection of component parts. They can be seen only when there are so many parts that collective influences, group properties, can occur. Temperature for example is a property that yields no meaning if we observe very few molecules. A large number is required before temperature is present. We cannot see from the individual molecules what temperature it is part of, for temperature is a collective property manifested as a statistical relation: A temperature describes the distribution of velocities among lots of molecules... [p364]Life is an emergent property of matter, not a property of matter’s component parts.[p385]Consciousness must make do with very few bits per second for nourishment. It is like fast food: There is almost nothing to digest, no bones and fibre to discard during and afterward. [p397]"

The author introduces known concepts in a vivid manner and talks about them in a novel way, adds some of his own new concepts and builds it into a coherent logic, a lens you can view the world with.My favourite excerpt is the Exformation of phone call, brilliant observation, hidden in plainsight!"
9,0140230122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6967393-nicholas,4," This is an explanation of consciousness via a tour of;entropy,information theory,thermodynamics,philosophy,computing,Godel's theorem and experimental neuroscience,to name but a few of the subjects employed.The result is an understanding of consciousness that is compelling,informative and which is entertaining enough to overcome any dryness caused by some of the more technical areas covered.The author is a Danish science writer and seems to know his readership well and I didn't find his style as trying as other reviewers claim to have, although some paragraphs need to be reread from time to time, but one would expect this when reading this type of material.Overall an enlightening read that causes you to shift your viewpoint and gain insight into the mechanisms of reality simulation and information transferal.The only thing that stopped me giving it 5 stars was that the final chapters,although interesting, tended to veer towards philosophy and personal viewpoint, which was somewhat at odds with the rest of the book."
10,0140230122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Human consciousness as a metaphor of the computer ageThis is a wonderful book translated from the Danish by Jonathan Sydenham, written more or less from a quantum physicist's point of view by a science journalist, but very readable, marred slightly by a Western bias.One of the things learned here is that it takes half a second for our consciousness to be aware of what we're doing. We don't notice this time lag because the mind back-peddles and makes it appear that we are on sync. The mind must backtrack so that our system will know when in real time an event took place. Reactions to things like removing a hand from a hot stove occur faster than our consciousness has time to be aware. So the mind just reconstructs the event and there is the illusion that we were aware in real time. We weren't.On page 256 is the example of a bicycle accident which happens too fast for the ""I"" to make a decision. The decision is made for the ""I."" So, is the ""I"" of consciousness really in charge or is that an illusion? The book's title gives Norretranders's opinion. I tend to agree. This is similar to the Buddhist idea that the ego-I of consciousness is an illusion.Norretranders makes a distinction between the ""I"" that is conscious and has a short bandwidth of perhaps 16 bits and the ""Me"" that is nonconscious and has a bandwidth of millions of bits. The ""I"" thinks it is in charge, but all it has is a slow-moving veto. On pages 268-269 Norretranders talks about how to get Self 2 (corresponds to the Me) ""to unfold its talents."" One method is to overload the ""I"" so that the ""Me"" is allowed to come to the fore. Give it ""so many things to attend to that it no longer has time to worry"" or ""veto."" Then the inner Me comes forward and plays beautiful music, etc. Similarly, we could say that the use of mantra, e.g., is effective as a meditation tool since it keeps the very verbal ""I"" occupied and allows the inner ""Me"" to come forward.Norretranders believes along with Julian Jaynes that consciousness arrived during recorded history or at least sometime during the first millennium B.C. He also believes that the use of mirrors helped to develop that consciousness. He notes (page 320) that ""The use of mirrors became widespread during the Renaissance"" which he says is ""characterized by the reappearance of consciousness."" (Thus we have our Western bias.)On the subject of the half-second delay in our conscious recognition of what is happening to us (discovered by Benjamin Libet): ""If there were not half a second in which to synchronize the inputs, [from our senses] we might, as Libet puts it, experience a jitter in our perception of reality."" (p 289)In reference to the title metaphor, we find on page 291: ""The user illusion, then, is the picture the user has of the machine"" [ i.e., his body and brain] ""...[I]t does not really matter whether this picture is accurate or complete, just as long as it is coherent and appropriate. It is better to have an incomplete, metaphorical picture of how the computer works than to have no picture at all.""On the 16-second bandwidth of consciousness: ""The bandwidth of language is far lower than the bandwidth of sensation. Most of what we know about the world we can never tell each other."" Norretranders believes that our religions reflect our level of consciousness. There is, he writes, ""a preconscious phase"" characterized by polytheistic religions; a socially conscious phase, characterized by religions like Judaism; and a personally conscious phase, of which ""Protestantism is a pure cultivation."" (from page 317)I don't necessary buy this (nor his time table of consciousness: I believe that cats and other animals have a rudimentary consciousness, and more so did the australopithecine); nonetheless the idea that Christianity is a religion of consciousness because it says we have sinned in our hearts while Judaism, for example, is only concerned with actions, is an interesting, if perhaps trivia, idea. Norretranders notes later on that, in this, Christianity may be out of bounds since the half second delay means that our consciousness has no control over what the Me or our nonconscious selves may be thinking. We can't blame the I for the impulses of the Me since the I only has a veto, as it were, and can't initiate actions or thoughts.This is an interesting schemata that he is drawing up, and like that of Freud it is clearly metaphorical and linguistic and not descriptive. Nonetheless, I think it has value in helping us to understand how our systems work.On pages 319 and 320 we have consciousness arising before Christ and then being lost for the middle ages and then recurring again with the birth of the renaissance. I would wonder what Norretranders thought was happening at the time in e.g., China and India? I think his (and Jaynes's) time table is too recent and much, much too fast. If consciousness is a cultural manifestation of our evolutionary abilities—an ""emergent property""—then I would prefer a cultural/evolutionary development that began around 100,000 years ago.In the chapter entitled ""On the Edge of Chaos"" Norretranders cites Doyne Farmer and Aletta d'A. Belin as saying that ""Life is a pattern in space and time rather than a material object (after all, atoms keep getting replaced)..."" This is profound.Consciousness is restricting. It discards information from the environment and returns a distilled essence. We miss a lot because there is no evolutionary necessity that we be aware of what our Me experiences. The vast amount of information would only confuse us, or at least make us less efficient. So consciousness is the veil of illusion that yoga, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc. talk about. The user illusion is maya. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"

16,0140230122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,5,"A spectacular book that has completely changed my understanding of the mind and consciousness. I poured through this 400+ pages in just a few days - I couldn't set it down.The critical arguments in this book are:1. Research shows that your unconscious processes a huge amount of sensory information; your conscious, on the other hand, processes only a tiny fraction of it (roughly 1 millionth).2. This implies that the unconscious is responsible for an enormous percentage of your thinking: it decides what data to pay attention to and what to discard. A large part of our life experience - what we enjoy, how we learn, etc - is completely unconscious (e.g. body language, enjoyment of music, sports). 3. In fact, the unconscious may even decide what actions you will take: numerous studies show that actions that feel intentional are actually triggered before you are consciously aware of having made the decision to act. This is hard to believe, right? However, the studies have been replicated many times. The implication is that the unconscious not only feeds a highly filtered view of the world to your conscious - it also feeds actions and decisions to it. The conscious can veto the decisions, but not initiate them!4. There is also ample evidence that the conscious is not fed a filtered list of raw data, but rather, a simulation of the real world. That is, the unconscious receives tons of raw data, figures out what to keep or discard, produces a simulation, and feeds the simulation (but not the process of how it was created!) to your conscious.5. Think over what it means for your conscious to be exposed to a simulation rather than raw data. This has deep ties to optical illusions, humor, sleeping, perception, learning, and more.6. The user illusion is our belief that this simulation *IS* life. But it is merely our internal model of it: useful and coherent, but definitely not accurate.I can't recommend this book enough.And now, a huge list of quotes from the book. I had to force myself to not stop every 5 paragraphs and write these down, as the book is full of insight that changes how you think.""A mess is hard to describe. Especially in detail.""""There may be an enormous amount of work or thought behind a given message or product. Yet it may be invisible. Making things look easy is hard.""""The least interesting aspect of good conversation is what is actually said. What is more interesting is all the deliberations and emotions that take place simultaneously during conversation in the heads and bodies of the conversers.""""The main thing in music is not the sound waves. It is that the composer/player converts a number of mental states into a pattern which evokes the same (or different) mental states in the listener.""""The bandwidth of consciousness is far lower than the bandwidth of our sensor preceptors.""""Only one millionth of what our eyes see, our ears hear, and our other senses inform us about appears in our consciousness.""""Fairy tales are not meant for children, you see. If they were, they would not work. For the true power of the fairy tale comes because children and grown-ups can together experience the wonder of the narrative.""""Stories read aloud are a matter not of words but what words do to people. Live concerts are not about music but about what the music does to people. Football matches watched at the stadium are not about football but what football does to people.""""Albert Einstein, who wrote 'The words or the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in my mechanism of thoughts.'""""The mind, in short, works on the data it receives very much as a sculptor works on his block of stone.

Picasso asked what the man meant by the expression. The man pulled a snapshot of his wife out of his wallet and said, 'That's my wife.' Picasso responded, ""Isn't she rather small and flat?'""""Our experience of reality is in a sense an experience of our simulation of what goes on out there.""""The desire to carry out an action becomes a conscious sensation long after the brain has started initiating it.""""In other words, the conscious experience is projected back in time in exactly the same way as a stimulation of the sensory cortex is projected onto the body.""""Consciousness cannot initiate an action, but it can decide that it should be carried out.""""Our consciousness lags behind because it has to present to us a picture of the surrounding world that is relevant. But it is precisely a picture of the surrounding world it presents us with, not a picture of the superb work the brain does.""""As British biologist Richard Dawkins puts it, 'Perhaps consciousness arises when the brain's simulation of the world becomes so complete that it must include a model of itself.'""""Alan Kay writes: 'The user experience was once the last part of a system to be designed. Now it is the first. It is recognized as being primary because, to novices and professionals alike, what is presented to one's senses is one's computer. The 'user illusion' as my colleagues and I called it at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, is the simplified myth everyone builds to explain (and make guesses about) the system's actions and what should be done next.'""""The user illusion, then, is the picture the user has of the machine. Kay and his colleagues realized that it does not really matter whether this picture is accurate or complete, just as long as it is coherent and appropriate.""""People do not merely see. We simulate; make models so that we can compare.""""When we dream, we may well be carrying out a simulation: We visualize something and understand (often weird) connections in it.""""Science is a collective project aimed at knowing the world in a way we can tell each other about.

In an unambiguous way.""""The bandwidth of language is far lower than the bandwidth of sensation. Most of what we know about the world we can never tell each other.""""Everything is connected, so we cannot comprehend anything exhaustively at all unless we comprehend everything exhaustively.

[...] The only map that displays every detail of the terrain is the terrain itself.""""In other words, we have to know everything a person has learned, and undergo all the experiences a person has undergone, before we have enough information to compute what that person will do. Everywhere that person has been, we must have been; everywhere that person has acted, we must have acted. But in that case we must necessarily be that person ourselves.""""Hofstadter's point is that even a fully defined and determined system of simple rules can display such complex behavior that it is meaningful to describe it in terms of decisions and will, quite irrespective of the fact that the laws affecting the simple level govern completely. A completely implemented version of a set of simple rules can display properties we cannot find in the rules themselves; the reason we cannot find the properties in the rules is a general condition of the world that is described in Godel's theorem and Chatin's extension of it."""
17,0140230122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117684835-tom,1,"This book is infuriating. The whole premise is based on such flimsy and ill-thought out psychology, like the idea that we can't perceive more than about 10 clicks per second before they sound like a constant tone so our aural bandwidth of consciousness is 10 bits a second - as though the only way we consciously perceive information is by counting individual bits. If only the inventors of the mp3 format knew this they needn't have spent years trying to make decent sounding music at 128,000 bits per second! All of the other experiments mentioned are similarly fatuous and though we doubtless don't instantaneously perceive a wide and detailed visual field the idea that, say, a maximum 7*7 grid of black and white pixels represents the limit of our conscious visual experience is flat out ludicrous. The author casts around a lot of different fields - information theory, chaos theory, perceptual pyschology, memory, philosophy of mind, free will, Marx, Hegel (!) - to try and bolster the thesis but though it is all individually well explained it doesn't hang together as the main premise is so flawed."

I usually say that the reason I prefer non-fiction over fiction is because there are so many recurring characters. (""It's like, they are all part of the same universe!"" ^^) And this book brings together so many favourite people. I love it. It also provides solid and clear as well as comprehensive explanations of ideas and discussions concerning Entropy, Information, Complexity, Communication, Consciousness and the Human Condition. Much in line with my own interests and understandings of the world at the moment. Makes me really curious about what a more updated version of this book would have more to tell. I mean, it has been almost 30 years.Also, the language and style is really... friendly? I like it :)"

It is the most inter-disciplinary yet cohesive book I’ve ever encountered. It is, however, dense at times (especially in the beginning) so if you struggle reading non-fiction in general or don’t have at least some science background it can be a difficult read but it is so worth it. In spite of the heavy science (I can’t be more specific than ‘science’ because it covers too many individual fields to try and number them) subject matter, many times it reads closer to prose than nonfiction."
20,0140230122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60062267-gintar-lingyt,5,"The best book! Not an easy read though, but nicely written science. For those who want to learn about conscious mind, read pure scientific view of it’s power, limitations, history and the planet itself. Often this type of books draws rather paranoid view on this topic or lack of fair arguments. But this one is not only rich of facts, but also delivers the message of how human is connected to the planet and how conscious mind is deriving the world. I am not the one who reads same book again, but “The User Illusion” is worth to be read multiple times."
21,0140230122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3694709-shobha-deepthi,4,"Are you more than your Consciousness? Is human a conscious, rational being? Can we explain everything that happens to us or around us? Are all our (re)actions, decisions, choices in life done consciously? One would be taken aback if I were ( sorry if the author and the science) were to tell you that consciousness plays hardly any role in our lives."" To be aware of an experience means that it has passed""How do you explain dreams? Am sure all of us would have at least one dream that came true. Not day dreams, but dreams - things that we saw, felt or perceived when we were asleep - unconscious. How do you explain that? How about De Ja Vu? What about the first impressions that we frame of people? Without knowing a thing about a person, what is it that tells us about the person that lets you perceive and frame an impression? When we see a thing or place, how much of it is from our memory or from first hand perception?""The least interesting aspect of good conversation is what is actually said. What is more interesting is all the deliberations and emotions that take place simultaneously""Why are we so good are doing automated, repeated tasks, say driving/ cycling? Are we consciously driving all the time? All these automated tasks are best done when we are unaware/ unconscious. The moment we become conscious, we in fact falter( that is what happens when we are under pressure ). Say if you were to consciously speak in a foreign language that you recently learnt, you would fumble.""The words are merely references to something not present""Sleepwalking, Blindsight, Love at first Sight, and many more things are really not results of consciousness. All these happen without your conscious. You are conscious of only the problem and the solution, but the process of arriving at solution is not through conscious. That is consciousness is only an implementer, there is something else, a silent, hidden observer that really is taking decisions.In effect consciousness is discarded/ filtered information, that is important to you. But the filtering is not done by consciousness. If things were so simple, Artificial Intelligence could have handed over mental activities from human to machines. No machine is as intelligent as a man is. All they are good at is ""Computation"".""It is not what we say to each other every day that establishes all the meaning and beauty and truth, it is everything we think before we speak""Well that is a load of information or processed discarded information? Too many questions. I happened to stumble upon this book through Quora. I was following a post on a lazy day and many mentioned how insightful this book ""The User Illusion"" by Tor Norretrandes is. And happened to get hands on this book in a completely unexpected way. This books is very intriguing, though at times it gets into too much theory, science and even history. The book is divided into four parts - Computation, Communication, Consciousness and Composure. First two chapters are tough to get through. Many a times it was too much for me to read or process all that data. The author tries to explain about consciousness from different scientific fields - Thermodynamics, Information Theory, Psychology, Chaos Theory etc. This is where he walks us through the history of science and how that the theory of consciousness was born way back during 1850’s as Maxwell’s Demon.""Is talking the smallest part of conversation?""Third chapter is the real gist of this book. He explains about Consciousness, the half-a-second delay, how much time the consciousness lags behind. Our reactions, decisions are lot quicker but till we are aware of them we cannot act. There is a hell lot of information that gets into the brain through different senses (over 11 millions of bits of information every second), eye, skin, ear, nose, and mouth whereas our consciousness can only process 40 bits per second. Hence the brain processes all these information filters most of it, and gives us(consciousness) only what is important to us. And the process of this ex-formation( filtering information) happens unconsciously. Most of our what we experience, and most of what we do is unconscious. Isn’t that surprising?“Civilization is about removing information about our surroundings; discarding information about nature so our senses are not burdened with all that information and our consciousness can concentrate on other matters.” Last chapter is about how we perceive world and what it really is. As humans we tend to seek predictability. We want to have a theory to everything, reason out and if possible find a formula which can be applied to give expected results. But this is not true. Consciousness is gating the tremendous possibilities. Consciousness is everything put in order, Subconscious is chaos. Can we manage Chaos? Is a human being more than what he thinks he is, is he more than what is his consciousness? Is consciousness an evolution to cope up with the complex world?""A thing not structured and organized contains more information, because it is more difficult to describe""""You sense far more than you are conscious of. Whether you want to or not"" "

26,0140230122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/186015-mike-s,5,"This book will change your understanding of yourself, and of consciousness in general. It draws from many fields of study including psychology, biology, information theory, philosophy, and physics. The author supports his ideas extremely well. It's easy to read, presenting complex ideas in very practical terms. You may find the first section of the book a bit slow and wonder how it relates to the main subject, but if you keep reading you'll appreciate why the author devoted so much time to those concepts. The book blew my mind, I found it impossible to argue with the main ideas, and I will never think of myself, or the conscious awareness of anybody, in the same way. I am amazed at the amount of research the author did, and am very impressed at how well he presented so much information in a way that flowed very nicely. I'm pretty busy, and this is a thick book at 480 pages, but I couldn't stop reading it, I wouldn't be surprised if you have the same reaction. And there's a bonus, you will almost assuredly be reminded that your awareness is quite incredible. If you would like some very thought-provoking quotes from the book, here are just a few (page_paragraph_location):--------------------------------------------------259_5_allMan is not primarily conscious. Man is primarily nonconscious. The idea of a conscious I as housekeeper of everything that comes in and goes out of one is an illusion; perhaps a useful one, but still an illusion.288_5_allWe experience sensation but do not experience that this sensation has been interpreted and processed. We do not experience the enormous mental work we do when we experience. We experience sensation as an immediate, direct sensation of the surface of things, but sensation is really the result of a process that gives depth to the sensory data experienced. Consciousness is depth but experienced as surface.289_3_allWe experience not the raw sensory data but a simulation of them. The simulation of our sensory experiences is a hypothesis about reality. This simulation is what we experience. We do not experience things themselves. We sense them. We do not experience the sensation. We experience the simulation of the sensation. 292_4_lastOur consciousness is our user illusion for ourselves and the world. 292_6_allThe user illusion is one's very own map of oneself and one's possibilities of intervening in the world. As the British biologist Richard Dawkins put it, ""Perhaps consciousness arises when the brain's simulation of the world becomes so complete that it must include a model of itself.""293_3-4_allThere are no colors, sounds, or smells out there in the world. They are things we experience. This does not mean that there is no world, for indeed there is. The world just is. It has no properties until it is experienced. At any rate, not properties like color, smell, and sound. What would happen if we could experience the world directly, without simulating it first, without requiring half a second to digest the experience, which is then presented as if it were contemporaneous with the material being experienced? --------------------------------------------------I loved this book. I'm afraid I annoyed my co-workers talking about it too much, maybe people here will like it more. "
27,0140230122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4269814-carolyn,4,"This large book covers a broad range of science, including physics (both Newtonian and quantum), information theory, psychology, and computer science, but its central message is the startling fact, well supported by the author's arguments, that the bandwidth of consciousness is a mere 16 bits per second of the 10 million bits per second or more that flood into our sensory systems. As we all know, apparently intelligent systems in the body control our heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, digestion, sleep cycles, etc. The author here posits that intelligent systems also control nearly everything else, too. A previous work that he cites frequently is Julian Jaynes's _The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind_. Just as animals function nearly perfectly without ""I-consciousness,"" so too, says the author, did humans until around 3000 BCE. It's a fascinating study, published in 1990. One wonders how much further these ideas have progressed since then, due to fMRI and other brain research tools. Unfortunately, not much of Norretranders's work has been translated from the Danish. One book, _The Generous Man: How Helping Others is the Sexiest Thing You Can Do_ (2006) is available from Amazon but seems to be on another topic. "
28,0140230122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52708972-juan,3,"When the author finally gets around to talking about consciousness, he does a really good job. The ideas are clear, there are plenty of references to back up his arguments and everything like that. The problem is the author really only talks about consciousness for the middle third of the book. The first third of the book talks about quantum mechanics and thermodynamics. While some of the ideas are used and referred to in the part about consciousness, the rest just seems like a personal journal of what he found to be interesting in physics and quantum mechanics. The last third of the book was the author taking the ideas of consciousness and expanding it to the larger universe, which is interesting but borders on pseudoscience (although I know plenty of people who would put psychology in that same realm, so to each their own).The book is interesting overall, but if you are looking for something that is straight to the point, you will be disappointed. If you're okay with going on long tangents to explore the idea of consciousness, then this book is for you."
