0,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,5,"I have a very strong memory of the day my youngest was born. I can still summon the piercing scent of puddled broken water in a middle room of the second floor of our house. Problem is that my daughter was born before we moved into that house. Yet I, and hopefully everyone else who comes up short in a quest for perfection, can take solace from this outstanding book. Kathryn Schulz - image from TEDSchulz coins the term “wrongology” as a tag for her view that being wrong can, in the scheme of things, be a pretty good thing, that we learn more from our mistakes than from our successes, that mistakes involve motion while perfect success implies stasis. In terms of the sheer volume of concepts raised in Being Wrong, this is a hefty work. It could have become a bit too heavy, but Schulz presents her case and her research with such puckish good humor that it all goes down very smoothly indeed.First of all, Schulz is a journalist, not a scientist, historian, philosopher or a linguist. Yet, all these viewpoints, and others, are well represented in this impressive work. This is not a fast read. Don’t bring it to the beach looking for a quick diversion. I tend to take notes in books of this sort, marking passages that hold particular appeal. I was kept quite busy while reading Being Wrong, noting, then typing out many, many passages that called my name. One measure for me of how rich a non-fiction read is can be found in how much time I spend typing out marked items. My hunt-and-peck time was considerable here. So many worthwhile observations, so much interesting material to be absorbed. Mother’s milk. You will learn a lot from reading this book, and will be entertained while doing so. I have a few quibbles. I suppose I was hoping for some familiar examples of error. Perhaps adding the Titanic to her trove of error evaluation chestnuts would be asking too much. And the most obvious and germane big-picture example of error, DNA mutation that results in evolution, receives only a passing mention near the end. Yet, not taking Schultz up on this challenge to look into her analysis of error would be…well, a mistake. To err is human but to read Being Wrong is divine.=============================EXTRA STUFFLinks to the author’s personal, Twitter and FB pagesAnd here is her wonderful TED talkA list of Schulz’s articles in  New York Magazine"
1,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,2,"I am not a particularly violent person. But there were so many places in this book where I wanted to sit the author down, smack her briskly and scream at her ""What were you thinking? It started with the very first word in the book, freshly minted for the occasion by the author. You read it and experience an involuntary recoil of revulsion at the sheer tin-eared ugliness of it. For God's sake, Kathryn Schulz, please don't title your opening chapter ""Wrongology"". If the first word in your book already makes my flesh crawl, that's hardly a good sign.I chose this book based on a fawningly positive NY Times review by Dwight Garner, who obviously suffers from some kind of unhealthy crush on Kathryn Schulz. According to Dwight, KS ""flies high in the intellectual skies, leaving beautiful sunlit contrails"". Now, I get off on the ozone rush of huffing a beautiful intellectual contrail as much as the next reader, but I'm afraid in this case Dwight is letting his slobbering fanboy worship cloud his judgement. Kathryn Schulz is not stupid, but she's certainly no intellectual goddess. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem, but given the direction she chose to take her investigation in this book, the reader begins to wonder if her choice was a wise one and (I hate to say it) if she really has the intellectual chops for the task she sets herself. I think it would have been a perfectly straightforward matter to come up with a reasonable working definition of ""being wrong"", one would that cover the great majority (say 95%) of situations that are of practical interest. Had Kathryn Schulz chosen to adopt this kind of pragmatic approach, she would have written a considerably shorter book and, I think, a much better one. Unfortunately, she has chosen instead to wax philosophical about epistemological difficulties in coming up with appropriate definitions of concepts such as ""knowledge"", ""being right"", ""error"", and if one wants to bump it up a meta-level, knowledge of errors (one's own and those of others). Not surprisingly this turns out to be a rabbit hole, and not a particularly interesting one. Schulz's choice to explore these questions has the immediate effect of lengthening the book considerably and burdening whole sections with the kind of jargon only a professional philosopher could love. A case in point: the First Person Constraint on Doxastic Explanation , which is apparently the phrase philosophers use for the phenomenon that anyone pressed to defend his/her beliefs will say that it's because they are true. Flawed logic, conflict of interest, reason clouded by emotion -- these problems may be immediately evident to other people, but we are notoriously bad at detecting them in our own thinking. To her credit, the author acknowledges the clunkiness of the philosphical jargon; I just wish the replacement she proposes - the 'Cuz It's True Constraint didn't set my teeth on edge with the faux-folksiness of that 'cuz. But this reflects a problem with Schulz's style that bothered me throughout the book. Maybe it's a consequence of her time as a reporter for Rolling Stone, but she never seems to find a consistent register. As she flips back and forth from discussing scientific results to illustrations from popular culture, this failure to establish an appropriate register becomes jarring. Whether it's her choice to write ""fuck up"" when ""screw up"" would clearly have been more appropriate, or sentences like this one, about Hamlet: ""It's not as if the prince dillydallies for fourteen scenes over whether to order the BLT or the chicken salad"", I just did not enjoy Schulz's writing style.Which is a shame, really, because buried in there among the superfluous philosophical baggage and the rambling mess of her own prose, she has some genuinely interesting points to make. In particular, her observation that making mistakes is an intrinsic part of human nature, and is an essential component of scientific enquiry, is important, if not particularly novel. However, Schulz is not the first person to have considered the questions in her book. A considerably clearer, more focused, discussion can be found in the excellent ""Mistakes Were Made"" by Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson. The rambling undisciplined character of Schulz's writing prevents me from giving her book more than two stars. The disappointment is that, with some decent editing, she could have written a far better book."
2,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/222151-ed,5,"Absolutely loved this book, which really does uncover the extent to which we deny our mistakes and how much we would gain by admitting them, at least to ourselves. There is also an art to understanding that doubt is good so long as it does not paralyze us.  The author found that when she told people that she was writing about mistakes, they all said: 'Oh I have made tons of mistakes in my life'. She would reply: 'Oh it would really help my research if you could tell me about a few of them.' And people couldn't remember a single example in most cases. :) Given this challenge, and being whom I am, of course, I could not resist then listing 70 major mistakes I had made in my life and sending them in an email to my wife for the record, as she is very kind! The mistakes covered relationships, friendships, financial, subjects I studied, career, housing. My goodness, that was pretty heavy, but I learned a lot. Try it sometime. It is oh so liberating if you can do it honestly, and then ask; 'OK so what might I do differently going forward'. Above all keep saying the Taoist phrase: 'no blame', just learn from the mistakes and don't beat up on yourself."
3,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish,3,"Schultz' review of H is for Hawk in the New Yorker magazine this spring really made me take notice not only of Macdonald's book but also of the art of reviewing. Schultz's review was as gorgeous and thoughtful as Macdonald's book. I set out to see what else Schultz wrote.I really like Schultz' premise on this one: we feel badly when we make mistakes, but everyone does it. As Schultz points out, before Descartes (""I think, therefore I am"") was St. Augustine (""I err, therefore I am"" or ""To err is human""). The thing is, while some errors are small ones, or funny ones (and Schultz gives examples) some folks make big ones (like Bush and his weapons of mass destruction or putting the wrong man in jail for life). What is clear from our own experience is that being wrong is so painful that we often just carry on as though we were right after all. We stick to our guns, as they say, and harden our position. Schultz points out that only with long experience in living do we come to the ""wisdom"" phase...""no one can be right all the time,"" so we should embrace error as the path to perfectibility.This discursive work is filled with anecdotes and case studies, experiments and examples. I think it is for this reason that I leapfrogged through it. Wrong of me, no doubt. I had to go back now and again to pick out useful pieces that encapsulated her thoughts. And this is where I found the problem, at least for me: I like examples pointing to conclusions, but the conclusions were less finely drawn than I would like and the examples perhaps too many and divergent. But we do get conclusions at the end, and it brings to mind Shambhala studies and democracy:""Here, then, are some ways we can try to prevent mistakes. We can foster the ability to listen to one another and the freedom to speak our minds. We can create open and transparent environments instead of cultures of secrecy and concealment. And we can permit and encourage everyone, not just a powerful inner circle, to speak up when they see the potential for error.""Schultz gave two TED talks in the aftermath of her book publication. Both are interesting, but the one on regret rang a bell, or a symphony, more like."
4,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2976142-thomas-edmund,5,"At the time I grabbed it, Being Wrong was just an interest book in my non-fiction wishlist, something that I would little away a few minutes on Kindle when waiting at the bus-stop, for dinner, or for friends to show up.Before I knew it I was jumping into the world of ""Wrongology"" for my daily fix. In her own words Schulz did not want to write an encyclopedia of Wrong, meaning the book isn't simply a long laundry list of different examples or major incidents of wrongness throughout history. Rather Schulz tackles the idea of Wrongness from several different angles, discussing our cognition, culture, and philosophies of error.The result is a piece that gets deep AF. Talking about how error rattles us not just because of our fragile egos, but because being shown to be wrong is to show us that reality is different than we truly though it was. Schulz even dives into humour and art, and the relationship with error.So if you're worried that this book is going to be a dry or sarcastic take on being mistaken, that isn't quite the ride you'll be in for. At times Being Wrong covers such diverse and in depth topics, I found myself getting lost (ironically I suppose) in exactly what subject I was reading about, but I was never bored or disinterested. I actually found Being Wrong to be more helpful than most other self-help or improvement type books by broadening my understanding of myself and others ""Wrongness"" "
5,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/288945-jane,5,"This is really a must-read. Do you realize how little we can trust ourselves to perceive the truth? This is a great analysis of how we get things wrong, why it matters, and why errors can be a good thing in the journey of life. Plus, its analysis of Hamlet is spot on. I mean, if the only evidence of murder you have is a ghost's message, don't you think you'd better try to vet the facts a bit before taking justice in your own hands?-g"
6,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3124054-sarah,1,"Being Wrong. Kathryn Schulz. 2010. Ecco. 400 pages. ISBN 9780061176043.Being Wrong is an exploration of how and why making errors is a crucial, natural and necessary component of being human, and how we must embrace being wrong to grow as people.Falling into the psychology versus scientific realm, Being Wrong provides an interesting history of wrongness using numerous examples of pop-culture incidents; if you can consider an intricate look at being wrong an interesting subject, that is. Schulz's voice is very eccentric, and the book will flood you with a barage of examples on how being wrong has transformed people and generated numerous events and mis-adventures since the beginning of time. Schulz also uses the experiences of past leaders and world-renowned figures as examples in terms of how being wrong has been significant in history.Being Wrong reads very much like a narrative, and we can really hear Schulz's opinions on the matter. Because the book has this particular tone, it tends to be quite long, drawn-out, and somewhat boring in most places. If the book had been written more to cater to the common audience using layman's terms, it would have been infinitely more interesting and appealing. I also noticed there are no definitions to some terms, phrases and words that the majority of readers will fail to understand. It's great when I can learn new words throughout the course of a book, but needing a dictionary several times in one paragraph tends to become more work then enjoyment. You can open Being Wrong to any random page in the book and immediately be able to pinpoint a sentence that requires assistance in some way, shape, or form to understand. To provide an example, I can open the book to a random page in Chapter 4 and find the following sentence,""For us, as for those shoppers, something in the alchemy of the interaction often causes our half-baked hypotheses to congeal on the spot.""What does that MEAN??!! What exactly is a ""half-baked hypothesis""?As it stands, I don't think Being Wrong will be a great experience for someone who isn't a psychologist or even mildly interested in the subject of being wrong. I give kudos to those readers who can interpret and enjoy Being Wrong.For more book reviews by DreamSE22 visit http://dreamworldbooks.com."
7,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1842008-kate,5,"Interesting how polarizing this book is. I think an open mind and a willingness to be wrong are helpful as you read; there's a lot to be gotten from the psychological delving. An excellent examination of the psychological and physiological aspects of ""being wrong."" The first 1/2-2/3 of the book are dedicated to explaning WHY we are wrong, and why we usually think we are right! The rest of the book talks about acknowledging when we are wrong and why being wrong can is a good thing, and indeed an essential element in art and literature. I found the chapters on people accepting areas in their life that they got wrong to be especially moving. A chapter on understanding why our spouse/partner is NOT exactly the person we think (because we of course are right!) they should be is worse the price of the book. When you come to see the 'truths' you take to be self evident are really your beliefs, and could possibly be wrong, or could change, you can be more open and forgiving of others. I thought this was an excellent read and not at all stuffy or too technical or too hard to read."
8,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2160001-jack-hart,5,"This is, to my way of thinking, an extraordinary book about a great topic. Although, if you're not an intellectually ambitious person the book may seem to have, as several Good Reads reviewers opined, too damn many words. But I like Kathryn Schulz's prose. She knows her western canon and cites it deftly. In the course of elaborating her ideas about the experience of wrongness she'll even uncover a novel point here and there about the literature and philosophy she so clearly loves.I also like that she's a reporter. She wants to tell stories about our world now, and finds people whose lives have forced on them deep meditations on wrongness and she gets them to open up to her: A divorce lawyer to the stars, a woman who was raped who's testimony put the wrong man in prison, a young fundamentalist woman who fell in love with an atheist. She draws on their experience and brings their words into her argument with considerable delicacy.The topic itself is fascinating. She explains that ""we don't experience, remember, track, or retain mistakes as a feature of our inner landscape."" As soon as we realize we have a bad theory about something it's like our brain grabs another one so that we can always experience ourselves as in the right. This argument is set out with great fun and skill, and if you buy into it you start to buy into a humanizing fascination with our relations to wrongness. She argues it's inextricably bound with our next best selves, and she makes this argument in a friendly, secular, wide-ranging way that I found myself taking to heart. "
9,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/883725-julianna,4,"Reviewed for THC ReviewsIf not for it being our latest book club read, I’m not sure I would have picked up Being Wrong on my own, not because it didn’t sound interesting (it did and was one of my top picks among the choices we voted for this month), but because I may not have found it without someone else bringing it to my attention. It’s simply not the type of book that probably would have come up in my day-to-day browsing of reading recommendations. But I can’t deny that it ended up being a very interesting read. As a psychology geek, who’s fascinated with the inner workings of the human mind, I was intrigued by all the many different ways in which we can be wrong, and more importantly, how we can delude ourselves into thinking that we’re right even when we aren’t. This was an extremely well-researched and well-written book that engaged my intellect, while also bringing me to the realization that perhaps I need to more closely examine my beliefs and sense of rightness in various areas.One of the main things this book does is delving into the various reasons why we can be so wrong about certain things. Some of it is rooted in a seeming quirk of human nature that drives us to have a need for beliefs. We being theorizing about the world around us as infants and by childhood we’re beginning to develop our beliefs. We all must believe in things, whether it’s as benign as what color of paint looks best in a certain room to something as momentous as the existence of God. And throughout life our beliefs may change, but usually we have trouble letting go of one belief until we have another one to replace it. Otherwise, we might find ourselves in an existential crisis. Whether we realize it or not, we also have a need for certainty in our lives. That’s why when someone seems so certain about something, it can be very appealing and lead us toward a belief in that thing whether it’s true or not. As humans, we additionally tend to have a tribal mentality, the sense that if the majority of the people in our social circle are going along with something, then it must be the right path when sometimes it isn’t. I was also intrigued by the ways in which our memories can be so fickle and faulty. I know that the next time someone insists that something happened a certain way, I’ll be taking it with a grain of salt, even if that someone is me.:-) One of the major strengths of the book for me was all the true stories of people who’ve been wrong in various ways. I think I’m the type of person who learns and understands better when I have concrete examples, so these stories really helped the message of the book come alive for me in a way it might not have without them. The author includes so many stories of ways in which people have been wrong, even phenomenally wrong, throughout the ages, even though they thought they were right. One that stood out was the Millerites in the 18th century, who claimed to have calculated down to the day when Christ was going to return. Many of them didn’t plant crops that year and/or sold off all their worldly possessions, believing they were going to be swept up to heaven on that day. But of course it didn’t happen. Some then left the faith altogether, while others readjusted their beliefs and what they thought they knew into something else, and still others doubled down on their beliefs. This movement later grew into the denomination known as Seventh Day Adventists. Another stand-out story was that of two contrasting rape cases. In both cases, the men convicted of the rapes were misidentified and later exonerated through DNA evidence. In one case, the woman who was raped was very accepting of the results and tried to reconcile with the man she misidentified. In the other case, the prosecutor, apparently unable to come to terms with the fact that he’d tried the wrong man, tied himself up in knots trying to explain away the scientific evidence while insisting the man was still guilty. There were so many of these great stories throughout the book that helped make it a fascinating read.I had a really hard time rating Being Wrong. It truly is very well done. The author is clearly an extremely intelligent, erudite, and articulate writer, who did her research well and organized this book in a way that made sense. I was constantly amazed at how she was able to tie everything together cohesively, and sometimes temporarily drop a thread, only to deftly weave it back in later. The absorbing, tantalizing, and sometime humorous anecdotes made the book more accessible, and there was much that I learned from its pages with regards to the human mind and how we can be wrong, but at the same time, I felt like there were things that I was missing. I freely admit that this may have been a failing of my own brain to grasp what was being said, but I can’t help feeling that if I had trouble with parts of it, others might as well. My book club is a pretty smart group and yet most of them agreed that this was definitely not an easy read. I think this is my main reason for dropping the star, but feel free to take that with a grain of salt. Just know that it will require a sharp mind and good concentration to grasp the contents.I will also leave with this last thought. Despite the author saying that she didn’t set out to write a self-help book, I felt that it did in many ways help me to better understand wrongness. I might have wished for a step-by-step guide for combating the reasons for wrongness, but I was still able to glean some strategies for this from within its pages. At the end of the day, that’s a win for me. If it makes me (and others who read it) look more carefully at my (their) assertions, then IMHO, the book will have done its job. So for that I definitely recommend it. In our current age, when so many people are entrenched in political or other divisive belief systems, I think delving into our wrongness is a great place to start the difficult work of change."

11,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2624836-reese,3,"My copy of BEING WRONG: ADVENTURES IN THE MARGIN OF ERROR was a gift -- a Goodreads giveaway. My being wrong -- occasionally, frequently, perhaps consistently -- is a ""gift"" from our Creator and/or my creators. The ways in which I experience being wrong are probably also ""gifts"" from my creators, teachers, friends, et al. As a parent, I have passed on the ""gift"" of intermittent or perpetual wrongness and promoted certain reactions to being wrong. When my son was a young child, he would respond to ""What time is it?"" with answers such as ""It's approximately 3:27."" If from this anecdote you have concluded that being right is very important in the family that I helped to create, you are -- I believe -- not wrong. Half-jokingly, my son would announce scores in the family's never-ending game of I'm-Right-You're-Wrong. While I used to think that our determination to avoid being wrong was extreme, Schulz's book has enabled me to see that our responses to wrongness are not unusual. For that reason alone, I can say that reading BEING WRONG was not a waste of my time.Nevertheless, I believe that I am not the ""right"" audience for this book. Too much information for an old woman with a fairly narrow range of interests and an old woman already familiar with Schulz's most important points. Other readers, too, if they get as far as the book's midpoint, are likely to decide that the work was not intended for them. If it happens to land in a bookstore's self-help section, heaven help the customer service staff of any bookstore that doesn't give refunds. I can imagine certain chapters of BEING WRONG showing up in rhetoric/readers and anthologies of nonfiction prose. And I can see the title of this book on syllabi for interdisciplinary studies courses. Schulz discusses history, philosophy, psychology, logic, sociology, theology, literature, and various sciences. Even if readers ignore the forty-five pages of endnotes, the number and length of her footnotes may cause some to wonder: ""Am I reading a marketable version of the author's dissertation?"" In many ways, the work is a textbook -- a well-written text, a valuable text. Its greatest value is in its potential to influence students -- young voters -- who need to understand the dangers of absolutism and to recognize that, unlike a rose, ""a truth is not a truth is not a truth."" How different our world would be if most people did not confuse beliefs and interpretations with facts. How different our world would be if most people acknowledged their mistakes and consciously used them to develop a new attitude, a better system, a higher standard of conduct.Suppose that all that I've written about Schulz's book is wrong -- and it may be -- so what? I've only presented beliefs -- I think. Can my beliefs be wrong? I don't know. Do you know? Do you believe that you know? Will you know tomorrow? If I'm wrong, will you laugh?  "
12,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5104201-jim,5,"Think about the last time you were wrong. Can you remember it? I could, after taking some time to think about it. I thought my car had been stolen, and had reported it stolen, before I realized that I'd left it in the parking lot of a nearby Safeway and walked home with my groceries by mistake. I wonder if the police dispatchers still laugh at that one, or if the incident's been replaced in their memories by others like it that happen a dozen times a day.That's one story of my being wrong. I have others. But like most people, I feel as if I'm right about everything I currently think, even though a reasonable percentage of it is probably wrong. But I like feeling as if I'm right. I'm comfortable with it. And I admit that I've not always behaved well when someone's pointed out my mistakes.What's great about Kathryn Schulz's book is that it's made me rethink my fear of being shown I'm wrong.Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margins of Error is an exceptional work that recommends taking an optimistic view of our capacity for wrongness without ignoring the costs of our errors. Being wrong, Schulz says, feels a lot like being right. But realizing we're wrong is often the first step toward a greater empathy with our flawed neighbors and sometimes a transformed sense of ourselves; while our refusal to admit mistakes usually encourages us to be cruel, judgmental, and angry. Our ability to err, Schulz argues, is essential to our ability to change and grow intellectually and morally. It's what allows the world to surprise us and sometimes even teaches us to think more carefully. Those looking for a companion piece to The Believing Brain would do well to buy, beg, borrow, or steal a copy."
13,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/651858-george-musser,3,"A worthwhile read that gives me much to think about in my own life. Schulz's broad point is that the fear of committing an error is often worse than the error itself -- it fills us with a fear of exploration and prevents us from acknowledging, correcting, and learning from our mistakes. The risk of error is often a necessary tradeoff for creativity and growth. I think Schulz convincingly makes her case.  I vow to ease up on screwups, whether mine or others'. To err is human; to forgive, humane.But I think the book would have been more effective as a magazine-length essay that focused on the most novel case studies. It has a winding, repetitive argument, a college-paper style that gets monotonous after 15 chapters, and lots of potted history that seems to have been written from encyclopedia lookups. The book also overstates its case. It claims to advocate error per se, but what it really advocates is an acceptance that we err. It's one thing to take a risk, quite another to actively seek to do wrong -- outside the contexts of comedy, art, and pep talks, that is purely destructive. And although there's utility in seeing the mishaps of daily life on a spectrum with the great errors of history, the latter often do involve more than mere error, but outright malevolence and a pathological neglect of simple prudence. Sometimes, in other words, we *shouldn't* be tolerant of error and just laugh it off as the price of being human. Schulz offers few thoughts on how to cope with these different degrees of error."
14,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/915317-elizabeth-hunter,4,"I found Being Wrong slow going, not because I wasn't enjoying it--although I do think that the first couple of chapters are the most dense--but because I needed to stop and digest and think about how what Schulz says resonates with my own experiences. One of the things I enjoyed most about the book, was Schulz' examination and concise rendering of questions I've often pondered. She looks at why we're wrong so often, why we have trouble admitting that and go to great lengths to stay on the ""right"" side of things, and why the connection between ""wrong"" and ""bad"" is so hard to sever. She relates personal anecdotes, historical events and medical case histories in an intelligent, yet amusing tone that made it feel like a conversation with a very well-informed friend. One interesting thing--not having looked before I started, I was surprised to realize after a couple of chapters that the author is a woman. So I also spent a fair amount of time thinking about why I was wrong about that and what the cues were that gave me that impression.I think I'll be referring back to this one often. Unless I'm wrong. "
15,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10386400-ryan-holiday,3,"I should have liked this more than I did. Having sat on it a bit, I kept going back to thinking how much I like the author. The book's a bit long at times and redundant, and I don't think it's organized well, but it's the right kind of book. There's actually a saying in the The Present Alone is Our Happiness: Interviews with Pierre Hadot -- that real philosophical dialog sets out to form rather than inform. That's what this book does. Most of these psychology books try to teach you a bunch of stuff. They talk about this study and these fallacies and how you must listen to them convince you that your way of thinking about the world is wrong. Schulz, I think, would just be happy if you left with a flicker of doubt. She adds a couple new pikes that might catch and snag you before you barrel down the road of wrongness. It's a rare approach for an author, one worth rewarding"
16,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174565-red,2,I really thought I was going to like this. I guess I was...
17,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/763730-stewart,5,"	 Over many years I have grappled with the related issues of error, ignorance, and uncertainty. When measured against what there is to know, what we humans do in fact know is in the order of zero-point-several zeroes. No matter how well-read, well-traveled, or well-informed we think we are, our ignorance is immense. We have to make decisions – most trivial, many of them life-changing, a few of them life-and-death – based on a trifling amount of information, the vast majority second- or third-hand. Because the amount of information we use to make everyday decisions ranges from minute to microscopic, we often make mistakes and miscalculations. We suffer misunderstandings. Unaware of so much in the universe, we get buffeted and in some cases crushed by its forces. To err is indeed human.	Thus when I found a book on error in a recent Daedalus book catalog, I quickly ordered it. And I wasn’t disappointed. ""Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error"" by Kathryn Shulz is an amazingly insightful, humorous, and quotable book, drawing on philosophy, science, history, politics, literature, and pop culture.	That I hadn’t heard of this 2010 book or seen a review in the many newspapers and magazines I read shows the ignorance in which I am immersed, despite thinking I am a well-read individual. It seems this worthwhile book somehow got lost in the shuffle among the tens of thousands of books published every year in English.	Shulz, a newspaper and magazine journalist and author, looks at error in many of its forms – the personal, political, religious, philosophical – and our efforts to deny our mistakes and deflect blame. She examines the success in lessening error in the life-and-death areas of aviation and hospitals. She spends a lot of time on inductive reasoning, our way of making sense of the world, and its limitations. She looks at error in romantic love and the rare cases of radical shifts of belief that people have made.	There is so much that is wise and quotable in this book that I couldn’t begin to list all the passages.	Although Shulz spends many pages discussing the larger issues people can be wrong about – religion, philosophy, science, world politics – she also spends a lot of time talking about situations closer to home, including relationships. “Our default attitude toward wrongness, then – our distaste for error and our appetite for being right – tends to be rough on relationships. This applies equally to relationships among nations, communities, colleagues, friends, and (as will not be lost on most readers) relatives. Indeed, an old adage of therapists is that you can either be right or be in a relationship: you can remain attached to Team You winning every confrontation, or you can remain attached to friends and family, but good luck trying to do both.	“If insisting on our rightness tends to compromise our relationships, it also reflects poorly on our grasp of probability.” We have thousands, if not tens of thousands of beliefs, ranging from the trivial (Joe’s Pizza Place closes at 9 p.m. on Fridays) to the complex and interlocking system of religious, political, and philosophical beliefs through which we experience the world. That all of these myriad beliefs are correct and reflective of the real world is exceedingly unlikely.	Shulz opines that the world would be a better place if we admitted how commonplace error is, in general and in our specific cases. 	“As a culture, we haven’t even mastered the basic skill of saying ‘I was wrong.’ This is a startling deficiency, given the simplicity of the phrase, the ubiquity of error, and the tremendous public service that acknowledging it can provide.” "
18,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/901342-jacob,5,"Wow! I've read quite a few books about being wrong (e.g. Don't Believe Everything you Think, Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me), How We Know What Isn't So, You Are Not So Smart), now that I look at it, but this one, focusing on the *experience* of being wrong and how it feels, is my favorite so far. Part of it is that I identify closely with the author's description of what being wrong is like, and part is the author's philosophical discussion about why being wrong is human, even essential to being human, and the source of some good (it's dry, but worth the read).The book addresses different reasons people tend to be wrong about things, addressing various personal, social, and other factors that contribute to people not recognizing when they're wrong, or acknowledging it when they do. The first part takes a while to warm up to, but it eventually gets really engrossing, especially when Schulz starts using stories to illustrate her points.The author makes the point in multiple ways that error is inextricably part of being human. Not only are we inherently fallible, and many of our human mechanisms for dealing with reality inherently include seeds of error, but our capacity for error actually provides us with motivation and mechanisms for doing better (like science). She argues it's also the source of our ability to imagine what isn't real, the foundation of art and humor, and our ability to empathize with others through imagining how they feel.And she's right. It's why, among other things, when Philip K. Dick gives a speech entitled ""How To Build A Universe That Doesn't Fall Apart Two Days Later"", his point is that you *do* want to build a universe that falls apart two days later because that's what will make a story interesting (https://urbigenous.net/library/how_to...). It's conflict that makes a story worth reading, and conflict comes from error of one sort or another.I was going to give this 4.5 stars and mention I'd give it a 5 if I ever reread it and still like it, but two thirds of the way through, the author makes a brave choice that pushed it right up into 5-star territory. She includes the story of a woman who was sure she identified the man who assaulted her, only to find out conclusively, years later, that she was wrong. After his exoneration, she made her peace with the man, but then the guy went on to actually commit a violent crime later. It makes the story messy and unclear, and Schulz was going to cut it and use a different story until she realized that's exactly what we do in dealing with error -- we try to ignore the messiness of life and things that don't fit with what we want to think. Her honesty and openness in including the story despite its unresolved issues earned that fifth star.Bonus points for mentions of:- Oregon as the author's ""home away from home""- Phil Tetlock (repeatedly) and his work on the failure of experts to predict things, or even recognize their predictions are wrong- The fact that science can't prove anything, only disprove it, and that it's an approximation of reality, not reality itselfNot everything is fantastic. Most pages are a wall of text, which makes it a little tougher to get through. And while the writing is interesting and the author includes decent amounts of humor, it's not as easily engaging as some other similar writing. Schulz's style is more philosophical, so be prepared to think about what she says and take time to understand it.There's a TED talk (very) short version of Schulz's ideas if you'd like to see it: https://www.ted.com/talks/kathryn_sch..."
19,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237178-carolyn,3,"I consider myself the consummate fuckup. Even when I succeed in accomplishing something difficult, once the warmth of self-congratulatory celebration dissipates I can’t help thinking about every screw up and each way they’ll likely weigh me down during the course of my life the rest of my life and preclude me from divinity and the promises of pennies from heaven. I know a lot of people who think like this while we know that this manner of thinking is stupid and counterproductive, every time we try to mentally put our mistakes into perspective and balance them with our accomplishments, the inner asshole that we all have in our head won’t let us accept them, and gleefully drowns out rationality by reciting a grocery list of all our screw ups. How could we make all those mistakes? Being Wrong provides an absorbing counterpoint to the notion that making a mistake somehow diminishes you as a person. “Twelve hundred years before Rene’ Descartes penned his famous ‘I think, therefore I am,’ the philosopher Augustine wrote ‘fallor ergo sum.’” – I err therefore I am. We shouldn’t fear error; rather, we should embrace it because it’s our capacity for making mistakes that makes us who we are. Schulz explores the nature of error: are big mistakes fundamentally different from small mistakes, or are they all essentially the same? How much does peer pressure, or crowd response, affect our capacity to blunder? Why do we remember relatively insignificant mistakes for the rest of our lives, long after they have ceased to be relevant to anything? And why do we take being wrong so personally. As Molière said, “It infuriates me to be wrong when I know I’m right.” Shultz is a witty and dynamic writer, capable of quoting everyone from Aristotle, to Pliny the Elder, to Hamlet and Beyonce. She argues in “Being Wrong” that, of all the things we’re wrong about, our ideas about error are probably our “meta-mistake: we are wrong about what it means to be wrong.” She continues, “Far from being a sign of intellectual inferiority, the capacity to err is crucial to human cognition.” She is full of stories and anecdotes but avoids turning the book into a “wrongology slide-show”. The stories include everything from Alan Greenspan’s firm faith in the economy proved wrong, a doomsday prophet whose apocalypse wasn’t now, a sexual assault victim whose mistaken testimony jailed an innocent man and a Klansman who became an unlikely advocate for civil rights. Shultz argues that when people are confronted with their wrongness, they can either must accept it, deny it or be transformed by it. However, her book still doesn’t read like a book; more like a collection of essays on the theory of wrongness. The book is fascinating from chapter to chapter, but there isn’t a theory that encapsulates the whole book, except that we shouldn’t worry about making mistakes. At the beginning of the book, she calls the book a study of “wrongology” but never builds the systematic arguments that “¬-ology” requires. Instead we get a “wrongologue” — a series of observations and insights that leave us feeling that we’ve had all the good thoughts one could possibly have about wrongness, but that we still don’t know which ones are . . . well, right. There’s none of the necessary conclusions about being wrong, so the book is a fascinating and compelling read, but not life-changing or groundbreaking. "

One of those ""easy reads"" with regards to how it's written, the way the language flows easily, the sense of humor has me chucking more than once every chapter, and then at the same time, this is not an easy read, not at all.

The science is well-explained, the quotes and anecdotes are perfectly picked, the philosophy is thoughtful and down-to-earth, and the focus on positive sides of error is inspiring.Notes and quotes for future me:p.3 quoting Moliere: ""It infuriates me to be wrong when I know I'm right.""p.4 ""A whole lot of us go through life assuming that we are basically right, basically all the time, about basically everything: about our political and intellectual convictions, our religious and moral beliefs, our assessment of other people, our memories, our grasp of facts. As absurd as it sounds when we stop to think about it, our steady state seems to be one of unconsciously assuming that we are very close to omniscient.""p.71 ""The feeling of knowing something is incredibly convincing and inordinately satisfying, but it is not a very good way to gauge the accuracy of our knowledge. That's the problem with the feeling of knowing: it fills us with the conviction of rightness whether we're right or not."" (This leads to a discussion of scientific studies showing that the vividness of a memory has essentially no correlation to the accuracy of a memory.)p.73 ""None of us capture our memories in perfect, strobe-like detail, but almost all of us believe in them with blinding conviction. ... Even with comparatively trivial matters, we believe in our recollections with touching sincerity and defend them with astounding tenacity.""p.106 ""the Lake Wobegon Effect, that endlessly entertaining statistical debacle whereby we all think that we are above average in every respect - including, amusingly, impartiality.""p.107 ""Ignorance Assumption. Since we think our own beliefs are based on the facts, we conclude that people who disagree with us just haven't been exposed to the right information, and that such exposure would inevitably bring them over to our team. ... The Ignorance Assumption isn't always wrong; sometimes our ideological adversaries don't know the facts. But it isn't always right, either. For starters, ignorance isn't necessarily a vacuum waiting to be filled; just as often, it is a wall, actively maintained.More to the point, though, the Ignorance Assumption can be wrong because we can be wrong.""The Ignorance Assumption is followed by the Idiocy Assumption (""we concede that our opponents know the facts, but deny that they have brains to comprehend them"") and the Evil Assumption (""people who disagree with us are not ignorant of the truth, and not unable to comprehend it, but have willfully turned their backs on it.""p.141 ""The vast majority of our beliefs are really beliefs once removed.

Second, they shield us from the disagreement of outsiders. Third, they cause us to disregard whatever outside disagreement we do encounter. Finally, they quash the development of disagreement from within. These factors create a kind of societal counterpart to cognition's confirmation bias, and they provoke the same problem. Whatever the other virtues of our communities, they are dangerously effective at bolstering our conviction that we are right and shielding us from the possibility that we are wrong.""p.159 Quoting Renouvier: ""Properly speaking, there is no certainty; there are only people who are certain.""p.163 Quoting Bierce: Certainty is ""being mistaken at the top of one's voice"".p.164 ""This is one of the most defining and dangerous characteristics of certainty: it is toxic to a shift in perspective. If imagination is what enables us to conceive of and enjoy stories other than our own, and if empathy is the act of taking other people's stories seriously, certainty deadens or destroys both qualities. When we are caught up in our own convictions, other people's stories ... cease to matter to us.""p.165 Pathological certainty => confabulation. Pathological doubt => obsessive compulsionsp.167 ""It's one thing to doubt the existence of Santa Claus, another thing to doubt the accuracy of a news story, and a third thing to doubt the accuracy of a news story you yourself wrote. How adept we are at these different degrees of doubt depends on a variety of factors, including how emotionally capable we are of tolerating uncertainty ... and how much we have been exposed to and explicitly trained in skeptical inquiry. Doubt, it seems, is a skill - and one that ... needs to be learned and honed. Credulity, by contrast, appears to be something very like an instinct.""p.169 ""Certainty might be a practical, logical, and evolutionary necessity, but the simplest truth about it is that it feels good. It gives us the comforting illusion that our environment is stable and knowable, and that therefore we are safe within it. ... It makes us feel informed, intelligent, and powerful. When we are certain, we are lords of our maps: the outer limits of our knowledge and the outer limits of the world are one and the same.""p. 178 ""We can retain our convictions-and our conviction-while jettisoning the barricade of certainty that surrounds them. Our commitment to an idea, he concluded, 'is healthiest when it is not without doubt, but in spite of doubt.'""p.256 ""Psychological studies have shown that people in shared living situations generally think they do more chores than their housemates, that people in relationships tend to think they try harder than their partner to resolve conjugal issues, and that each of the colleagues collaborating on a project typically thinks he or she is pulling more weight than everyone else. Granted, sometimes there's a genuine disparity between one person's work and another's. But at least as often, the hour I spent ... is just particularly real to me, whereas whatever work you might have done remains an abstraction - at worst unnoticed and at best fleetingly appreciated, but certainly not minutely calibrated in terms of time and energy expended.""p.273 Quoting Vaillant ""It is all too common for caterpillars to become butterflies and then maintain that in their youth they had been little butterflies.""p.281 ""After all, our sense of self, like our sense of everything else in the world, is comprised of a bunch of beliefs - and, like all beliefs, these can be in error.

This is an active, investigative doubt: the kind that inspires us to wander onto shaky limbs or out into left field; the kind that doesn't divide the mind so much as multiply it, like a tree in which there are three blackbirds and the entire Bronx Zoo.

24,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77274539-sanjeev-mishra,4,"I would give this 4.5 stars but it doesn't look like that's an option. Really amazing and insightful, and honestly helped me to breathe a little easier with uncertainty and overpowering wonder of the universe. Life is more pleasant when you lighten your death grip on your little theories and beliefs. Only would take a way a half star because of some weird takes like attributing the ongoing Iraq War to being too mean to war hawks and the part near the end that goes to bat too hard for settler democracy in my opinion. It's obvious that the author and I don't align politically 100% but luckily that isn't a prerequisite for enjoying and learning from her book. "
25,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"This book focused on many of the heuristics detailed in Daniel Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow. Like David McRaney, in his book You Are Not So Smart, Schulz is a bit more relatable than Kahneman, which makes the study of heuristics (fallible thinking), easier to digest. Unlike McRaney, Schulz does a much better job of making arguments that do not fall prey to the very heuristics being argued against. She got tripped up a few times, in that her argument for one thing could just as easily have been used to argue for the opposite position. Despite her succumbing a few times to obvious heuristics, this book was considerably better quality than Raney's You Are Not So Smart. One of my favorite things about it was her unapologetic argument for the value of heuristics. At the end of the day, Schulz views the brain as a probability machine. Instead of the brain being a stupid fallible organ, Schulz sees it as brilliant and right much of the time, and accepts that a percent of the time, it will get things wrong. The wrongness arises not from the fallibility of the brain, but from its absolutely brilliant strategy of calculating the probabilities. I fear I made this part of her argument sound slightly boring. It was not. This argument in particular was the highlight of the book. I probably would have given it 5 stars if not for the last chapter. I felt slightly annoyed, like it was a bit preachy. But, I am not certain if it really was. It might have been a bad fit for me, but could be a great way to end the book for other readers. No matter how much I liked this book, no book on heuristics could be better than Tarvis' Mistakes Were Made But Not By Me. I looked up Tarvis and it appears that she might even be a self help type of writer. This is shocking to me because I loath self help books, unless they have actual studies to back up their claims and those studies have robust methods. For me, most self-help books are the new snake oil. But Tarvis' book was not simply one of the best books I have read on fallible thinking but one of the best books I have ever read period. Somehow she avoids, more so than Schulz and significantly more so than McRaney, tripping over the very fallibility she argues against. To me, that is quite impressive. So, Schulz's book was really good, but not up to par with Travis. If I were to rank books on decision making, the order would be as follows: 1. Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow (it is the seminal work and has myriad studies but a tiny bit dry at times)2. Tarvis' Mistakes Were Made But Not By Me (the writing was fantastic and every page causes the self reflective reader a mini existential crisis)3. Being Wrong by Schulz4. I feel certain there are many books I have not read that are better than the next choiceN. McRaney's You Are Not So Smart. If you are only going to read one book, make it Tarvis' Mistakes were Made. If you are willing to read more than one book (because, let's face it, your brains is super interesting and probably a bit narcissistic and would love it if you gave it multiple books to read about itself), then I highly recommend Schulz book as well. "
26,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2340346-chris-walker,4,"Great stuff. This is what writers are for. To set down in language what you feel but can't necessarily enunciate well yourself. Take this example: ""Fortunately, we don't get stuck in this place of pure wrongness very often. And we don't get stuck there via the collapse of small or medium-size beliefs. We get stuck there when we are really wrong about really big things - beliefs so important and far-reaching that we can neither easily replace them nor easily live without them. If our trivial beliefs sometimes burst as lightly as bubbles - just a pop of surprise and they're gone - these gigantic beliefs collapse like stars, leaving only us and a black hole behind. If you mortgaged your family's future on your faith in Bernie Madoff; if you hitched your whole wagon to a doctrine or a deity you no longer believe in; if you were wrong about someone you loved and the kind of life you thought the two of you would live together; if you have betrayed your own principles in any of the countless dark ways we can surprise ourselves over the course of a lifetime: if any of this or anything like this has happened to you, then you have suffered in the space of pure wrongness."" Yes, the author gets a bit irritating from time to time with her too hip style of writing, meandering tone and personal intrusion in the pages (a bit like, but much more than, Malcolm Gladwell). Yes, there are too many footnotes where she wanders off on tangents (although usually interesting ones). But if you are interested in what the philosophers, psychologists and neuroscientists have to say about error in the many facets of our lives, she's done the work for you. And there's so much good content here to ponder - some of it is revelatory like glimpsing the Matrix - I think I'll have to read it again (and I don't say that lightly, given the pile of books to read beside my bed). This is above all else a comforting book. While she argues that those who are depressed may just be seeing existential matters more clearly than the rest of us, the book concludes that: ""No matter how often we have gotten things wrong in the past, we evince an abiding and touching faith in our own stories and theories. Traditionally, we are anxious to deny that those stories and theories are stories and theories - that we must rely on our own imperfect representations to make sense of the world, and are therefore destined to err. But ...[ultimately these are also]... the hallmark of two of our highest human endeavours, art and science, and through them we can imagine new realities."" "
27,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2321668-cathy,4,"I don't know about you but I'm rarely, if ever, wrong. No, really! I'm almost always right and the same is probably true of you. As Kathryn Schulz, author of Being Wrong; Adventures in the Margin of Error, explains, it's almost hardwired in humans to dislike being mistaken. Being wrong, even about minor things, makes almost everyone so incredibly, throughly uncomfortable that we often can't admit to ourselves that we've made a mistake. Yet, being wrong is also a key to growth and essential to our identity according to Schulz. Although the book gets off to a ponderous start, once it picks up speed, it becomes a thought provoking exploration of every conceivable aspect of being wrong. What if we're wrong about our core belief system? What if, as a witness to a crime, we testify against the wrong person? What about medical mistakes? How do we live with ourselves once monumental errors are revealed?  Ultimately Schulz concludes that our optimism in the face of a lifetime of errors is what allows us to pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off and continue toward the goal despite previous mishaps and mistakes. Ultimately we're stronger for the failures along the way and readers will be better for tackling Schulz's book too."

I had to print them out and cut them up myself to believe that my eyes were lying. The brief mention of autism has not aged well and the author chose to include the racist slurs in quotes which I just felt was unnecessary since we all know what those slurs are in the context of the KKK. I would have been interested to see what this book could have been like if all the conversion stories in it didn't reinforce Americans' and specifically progressive's idea of what is right (evangelical to atheist; racist to anti-racist; Muslim to Christian). That last one I thought was problematic in its representation out of context, because it was the story of a Muslim man in Afghanistan converting to Christianity that treated it as merely a change of belief without examining the colonizing effects of Christian missionaries or the political ramifications of changing religions when the law is based on that religion.Still an excellent read and we could all do with thinking about what wrongness means to each of us."

As it turns out, there's a lot more to be said, and Ms. Schulz says it quite elegantly, entertainingly, and movingly. With examples ranging from the mundane to the tragic, she carefully explains precisely how errors come about and why we feel about them as we do. Along the way, she makes the point that error not only has the capability to embarrass us, but also can have the power to teach, to expand minds and hearts, to make better people.She didn't quote Samuel Beckett, but I will: we can ""fail better.""I throughly enjoyed this read, was fascinated by her anecdotes and theories and delighted by her style.

34,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72842365-ryan-derby-talbot,5,"Book summary: There are two fundamental and unavoidable components to being a human being: one is the need to chase the feeling of being right –– of having solidity and comfort in how we experience and respond to the world. The other is dealing with being wrong: dealing with error, the inevitable (and sometimes devastating) encounters we have when our expectations end up not aligning with reality. This book is about how we cannot escape either of these forces, and what results — negative or positive –– we can get from attempting to navigate this tension.Our need to chase being right –– and the resulting confidence, empowerment and belongingness (proxies for love?) that come with the feeling of rightness –– run up against and try to discount and rule out all the ways we inevitably can get things wrong: through illusions, false or overstated beliefs, skewed understandings of data, biases, social influences that lead us astray, emotional investments in perspectives or communities, the need to feel love, and flat out denial. We have difficulty even seeing wrongness in action in us (thinking we are far more objective and omniscient than we are), partly because it is such a fleeting force –– striking either too quickly or too slowly for us to catch it. Moreover, we struggle with identifying and acknowledging wrongness because of the strong emotional and cognitive forces (the desire for the feeling of certainty, the biases) that protect us, and keep us overwhelmingly invested in particular perspectives at the expense of other perspectives more aligned with reality. However much we may want to insist on the contrary or wish away our propensity to get things wrong (and we do this routinely), if we actually look at it, we invariably, deeply, absurdly, and inevitably get things wrong. Actually facing this truth doesn’t need to doom us, however, to defeated nihilism. The gap between our perspectives and the world make possible our two distinctly powerful human abilities: imagination and empathy. (Both are the result of allowing more than one perspective in a situation, of permitting a bigger notion than just a single “rightness.”) Successful incorporation and integration of our own wrongness –– which requires going through the excruciating emotional pain of admitting and allowing wrongness –– expands our sensitivities and perspectives as human beings. Collectively, our relationship with the gap also makes possible the two best products of human work, art and science. At root, error –– encountering the gap –– contributes to diversity, wonder, and richness of human experience. Alas, however, it will not ever lead us to a refuge of solid objectivity. Alas, there is no magic formula for dealing with the tensions between our desired rightness and inevitable wrongness. We can, however, recognize the growth and wondrous (mystical?) perspectives that are available in confronting their clash within us, the fundamental and inevitable experience of being a human being.

35,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45191284-beth,4,"Kathryn Schulz delves into all the ways we can be wrong, explaining the strange whys and hows or error generation, denial, and results. The fact that the fabric of humanity is interwoven with error and inseparable from the state of being human is something abput which most of us live in denial. Schulz uncovers some of the universal characteristics of being wrong in a way that is more palatable than some of the ways society reminds us we are wrong. We are wired to resist the notion of our own fallibility, so this deft touch is necessary in order to circumvent our natural resistance. At the same time, she highlights the benefits of acknowledging and embracing our error in order to better our communities, our interpersonal relationships, and ourselves. For example:""This is one of the most powerful ways being wrong can transform us. It can help us be more compassionate people. Being right might be fun, but as we've seen, it has a tendency to bring out the worst in us. By contrast, being wrong might is often the furthest thing in the world from fun, and yet, in the end, it has the potential to bring out the best in us. Or, rather, to change us for the better.""This book now is added to 2 others - Tim Nochols' The Death of Expertise and Han Roslings's Factfulness- that I would recommend to any of my acquaintances who are trying to grapple with the perceived and real societal grievances battering for their attention. Schulz can get a little long-winded in places, but this is a deep topic and I found that if I hung with her she eventually led me to her point.One of my favorite passages is what I hope people gain from reading this book:""If you really want to be right, or at least improve the odds of being right, you have to start by acknowledging your fallibility. Deliberately seeking out your mistakes. And figuring out what caused you to make them."""

She explores with wit, charm, and tenacity the ways we go wrong in our thinking and, what's more, the ways we go wrong in our thinking about going wrong. My greatest surprise and pleasure was the deep emotional intelligence present in a book I had expected to be skewed heavily to the cerebral. I highly recommend to anyone who cares about better thinking. "

In all, Schulz does an admirable job of selecting her chosen anecdotes and ends up with a satisfying and thought-provoking read.NotesPerhaps the history of the errors of mankind, all things considered, is more valuable and interesting than that of their discoveries. Truth is uniform and narrow; it constantly exists, and does not seem to require so much an active energy, as a passive aptitude of the soul in order to encounter it. But error is endlessly diversified; it has no reality, but is the pure and simple creation of the mind that invents it. In this field the soul has room enough to expand herself, to display all her boundless faculties, and all her beautiful and interesting extravagancies and absurdities.—Benjamin Franklin______Many of the religious thinkers who tried to understand why we err found their answer at the gates of the Garden of Eden. Thus Thomas Aquinas, the thirteenth-century scholastic, held that we make mistakes because, when we were banished from paradise, we were cut off forever from direct access to divine truth. To Aquinas and many of his fellow theologians, our errors arise from the gap between our own limited and blemished minds and God’s unlimited and perfect omniscience.This same basic idea has received countless secular treatments as well. Plato thought that our primordial soul was at one with the universe, and that we only began to err when we took on our current physical form and forgot those cosmic truths. The Enlightenment philosopher John Locke thought that error seeped into our lives from the gap between the artificiality of words and the reality of the things they name—from the distance between an indescribable essence and the nearest sayable thing. The German philosopher Martin Heidegger thought that error could be explained by the fact that we live in time and space; because we are bound to a particular set of coordinates, we can’t rise above them and see reality as a whole, from a bird’s-eye (or God’s-eye) view. As different as these explanations seem, all these thinkers and many more conceived of error as arising from a gap: sometimes between the particular and the general, sometimes between words and things, sometimes between the present and the primeval, sometimes between the mortal and the divine—but in every case, and fundamentally, between our own mind and the rest of the world.For the most part, we spend our lives blithely ignoring this gap. And with good reason. Who wants to be reminded of the fall from grace, the separation from truth, the particular and limited nature of our existence? ______How can we square this feeling of rightness with the very real possibility that we are wrong? This is a question that haunts all of wrongology, not just errors of memory. The problem is suggested by the very phrase “the feeling of knowing.” In life, as in language, we begin with a psychological state (the “feeling” part) and end up with a claim about the truth (the “knowing” part). In other words, we feel that we are right because we feel that we are right: we take our own certainty as an indicator of accuracy. This isn’t completely foolish of us, since studies show that there is some correlation between confidence and correctness. But it isn’t completely foolproof, either. As the case of flashbulb memories makes clear, our certainty reflects the existence of a particularly vivid inner picture. But nothing in life guarantees that this picture reflects the real state of affairs.This reliance on a vivid inner picture helps explain why memories are particularly apt to trigger the feeling of knowing.______ The philosopher Avishai Marga lit put this nicely. ""It is not the case that I am caught in a web of beliefs,"" he wrote. "" . . . Rather, I am caught in a network of witnesses."" Our relationships to these ""witnesses""-the people and institutions that attest to the truth of various beliefs-predate and determine our reaction to whatever information they supply. As Margalit said, ""my belief in [one of these witnesses] is prior to my belief that (what she says is true)."" Belief in is prior: however far this might be from our sense of how we should form our ideas about the world, it is the first principle of how we actually do so. All of us are caught in Margalit's ""networks of witnesses""­ not just in one but in many, and not just from time to time but all the time, from the moment we are born until the day we die. As countless commen­tators have observed, this lends to our beliefs an element of the arbitrary. Montaigne, for instance, remarked that people ""are swept [into a belief]­ either by the custom of their country or by their parental upbringing, or by chance-as by a tempest, without judgment or choice, indeed most often before the age of discretion.""______These latter­ day zealots have hailed from many different backgrounds and held many different beliefs. At heart, though, and paradoxically, they have all shared a single conviction: that they and they alone are in possession of the truth. (The very word ""zealot"" comes from a Greek root meaning to be jealous of the truth-to guard it as your own.) What zealots have in common, then, is the absolute conviction that they are right. In fact, of all the symbolic ones and zeros that extremists use to write their ideological binary codes­ us/them, same/different, good/evil-the fundamental one is right/wrong. Zealotry demands a complete rejection of the possibility of error. The conviction that we cannot possibly be wrong: this is certainty.______[O]ur be­liefs come in bundles. That makes it hard to remove or replace one without affecting the others-and it gets harder as the belief in question gets more central. In this respect, beliefs are like the beams in a building or the words in a sentence: you can't eliminate one and expect the fundamental sound­ ness or fundamental meaning of the overall system to remain unchanged. As a result, being wrong sometimes triggers a cascade of transformations so extensive that the belief system that emerges afterward bears almost no resemblance to its predecessor. ______You fight your superficiality, your shallowness, so as to try to come at people without unreal expectations, without an overload of bias or hope or arrogance, as untanklike as you can be . . . and yet you never fail to get them wrong. You might as well have the brain of a tank. You get them wrong before you meet them: you get them wrong while you're with them and then you get home to tell somebody else about the meeting and you get them all wrong again. Since the same generally goes for them with you, the whole thing is really a dazzling illusion empty of all perception, an astonishing farce of misperception. And yet what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people, which gets bled of the significance we think it has and takes on a significance that is ludicrous, so ill equipped are we all to envision one another's interior workings and invisible aims? . . . The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway. It's getting them wrong that is living, getting them wrong and wrong and wrong and then, on careful reconsideration, getting them wrong again . That's how we know we are alive: we're wrong. —Phillip Roth, American Pastoral______We go to our jobs, stop by the bar on our way home, hang out with our friends, raise our kids­ because these things are the stuff of life, to be sure, but also because they are strategies for keeping the terror of isolation in check. Soren Kierkeg­aard, that existentialist before there was existentialism, compared us in this respect to those early American pioneers who banged on their pots and pans all night long, hoping to keep the wolves at bay. Keeping wolves at bay is a start. But of all our ways of dealing with this rift, our favorite by far is the one that promises to eliminate it entirely­ to transform our desert island into a tropical paradise, our fundamental separation into ecstatic union. This strategy is our last, best hope for escap­ing the loneliness of existence and giving despair the slip. I am talking, of course, about love.______The idea that we possess a true self serves a hugely important psycho­ logical purpose. If we have an essential and unchanging identity, one we are destined to discover sooner or later, then the beliefs we hold, the choices we make, the person we become-none of this happens by chance. Instead, the entire course of our lives is inevitable, dictated by the certainty that our real self will eventually surface...This narrative is appealing for the same reason that it is problematic: within it, we can do no wrong. Our false beliefs were foreordained, our ap­parent errors occurred strictly in the service of a larger truth. This idea is made explicit in the religious affirmation that ""God makes no mistakes"": even the seeming trials and blunders of our lives are part of a larger plan: As that implies, stories starring a true self are teleological; we end up exactly where we are meant to be. This, too, is both an attraction and a weakness of the idea of an essential self. It suggests that our lives are deterministic, that yesterday's convictions-which we thought we chose based on their intellectual, emotional, or spiritual merits-were merely a trap into which we were lured for the benefit of some predetermined future self. Whatever meaning or worth our past might have had on its own terms is effectively written out of existence. Even more problematically, the idea of a true self suggests that we will never undergo momentous upheaval again. How could we? Having finally discovered who we really are and have always been, there is no further transformation available to us. If the self is constantly changing, then we can constantly feel our way forward, constantly become someone new-but if each of us possesses a fixed essence, then we can only return to it. Accord­ingly, our past departure from that essential self can only be a single and inexplicable aberration, associated as often as not with betrayal, transgres­sion, and sin. (Recall Chambers denouncing Communism, his erstwhile faith, as ""evil, absolute evil."") Singular, aberrational, transgressive, evil: we've seen this constellation of ideas before. This is the pessimistic model of wrongness, in which error is an unwelcome anomaly, a mark of our exile from the sacred realm of truth. Helpfully, this reminds us that we have another model for making sense of wrongness as well-one that casts a different light not only on our errors but also on ourselves. Here, wrongness is a natural and ongoing process, and we are not deformed but transformed by it. ______""The main in­terest in life and work,"" said Foucault, ""is to become someone else that you were not in the beginning."" Such transformations don't only come about through wrongness, of course-but wrongness is always an opportunity for such transformations. ______I was of three minds, Like a tree In which there are three blackbirds. —Wallace Stevens, 13 Ways of Looking at a Blackbird______His desire to banish art is part of a long and often sinister tradition (which we glimpsed earlier) of trying to create ideal societies through eradicating error in all its forms. All of those disgruntled undergraduates, meanwhile, are motivated in part-whether they know it or not-by the optimistic model of wrongness. They recognize, as most of us do, not just the legitimacy but also the poten­tial beauty and power of individual, skewed, inaccurate representations of reality. In this model, the link between error and art i s not a n indictment of art but a defense of error. Cut off from the absolute essence of things-that ideal form that Plato felt existed only in the mind of God-our separate, subjective consciousnesses look around and see, instead, Water Lilies, or Starry Night, or Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Likewise, we can make Beowulf and Star Wars and Horton Hears a Who! for the same reason we can make mistakes: because, as I said earlier, we are capable of conjuring the world not just as it is, but also as it is not. Our capacity to err is inseparable from our imagination.______The most famous formulation of this relationship between art, doubt, and error comes from the Romantic poet John Keats. He had been talking over various matters with a friend, he wrote to his brothers in a letter in 1 817, ""and at once it struck me,"" what quality went to form a Man of Achievement especially in lit­erature & which Shakespeare possessed so enormously-! mean Negative Capability, that is when man is capable of being in un­certainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact & reason.Keats's attitude toward uncertainty-and, for that matter, toward ""fact & reason""-is not the common one. He embraced unknowability and falli­bility, but not for the utilitarian purposes we saw in the last chapter. There, the point of embracing error was to curtail it-a kind of homeopathic rem­ edy for wrongness. But Keats wasn't interested in remedying wrongness. He recognized error and art as conjoined twins, born of the same place and vital to one another's existence. In life as in linguistics, art is joined at the root to artificial-to the not-true, the unreal-just as a fiction is at once a creation and a falsehood. ______But unlike androids, we humans do not nor­ mally self-destruct in the face of our mistakes. On the contrary: we self­ create, and self-recreate. This idea of self-creation suggests something else important about error. Being wrong doesn't just make us human in general; it also helps make each of us the specific person we are. In our inability to get things exactly right, in the idiosyncrasies of our private visions of the world, the outline of selfhood appears. This is what Benjamin Franklin was getting at in the quote I used as an epigraph to this book. Error, he wrote, is ""the pure and simple creation of the mind that invents it,"" a place where ""the soul has room enough to expand herself."" Mistakes, he ·meant, are the evidence and expression of an individual identity. This is an idea with deep and important roots in our intellectual history. It is, in essence, the crucial insight of evolutionary theory. Because of errors in the replication of genetic sequences, we wind up with variation among individual members of a species; and because of that variation, the species as a whole can adapt and survive. Such errors literally keep their hosts alive. A population that is too small or too homogenous to support significant genetic variation is doomed. For every species, then, error is a mechanism of survival and change. For us human organisms, with our richer relation­ ship to wrongness, mistakes enable not only our biological evolution but our social, emotional, and intellectual evolution as well. And wrongness also allows us to thrive in another way. I began this book by noting that we think of being right as essential to our survival and happiness, but in one key respect, nothing could be further from the truth. Countless studies have shown that people who suffer from depression have more accurate worldviews than nondepressed people. Depressed people do not nurture the cheering illusion that they can control the course of their lives. They rarely possess the conviction, so common in the rest of us, that they are above average in virtually every respect. And they understand, all too acutely, the basic conditions of existence: that their lifespan is just a brief blip in the cold sweep of history, that suffering is real and ongoing, that they and all the people they love are going to die. That outlook is known as depressive realism. Depressed people might be unhappy, but­ when it comes to these big-picture, existential matters-they are generally more right than the rest of us. It scarcely requires saying that this kind of rightness is not fun. ""To see the world as it really is is devastating and terrifying,"" wrote the philosopher Ernest Becker. "" . . . It makes thoughtless living in the world of men an im­possibility. It places a trembling animal at the mercy of the entire cosmos and the problem of the meaning of it."" As that indicates, the correlation between accuracy and depression runs both ways: people who are depressed tend to perceive the harsher realities of life more clearly, and people who clearly perceive those harsh realities tend to be (or to get) depressed. In an odd reversal of the usual state of affairs, when it comes to these existential issues, the bigger and more important the belief, the less it pays to be right. That's why, as I've said, the goal of therapy isn't necessarily to make our beliefs more accurate; it is to make them more functional. Ronnie Janoff­ Bulman, the psychologist, has even argued that ""a key to the good life might well be illusions at our deepest, most generalized level of assump­ tions and accuracy at the most specific, least abstract levels."" (Fortunately for us, these two perspectives are compatible: research suggests that people who possess a generally positive outlook are better at acknowledging their everyday errors and changing their minds.) If excessive accuracy in our self-image and worldview is correlated with depression, the opposite is true, too. Sometimes, being wrong makes us happy. Think of Don Quixote, that exemplary knight errant, who lent his name to the condition of being pleasantly deluded. "

It very much is, but just saying that is a bit of a cop-out. The book is a brilliantly written examination of the concept of error from every perspective imaginable. Schulz explores wrongness as an outside observer, a philosopher, a victim and a compassionate friend. By so fully embracing the idea on every level, she synthesizes a unified thesis from many disparate parts and supports every conclusion she draws with the best in logic and anecdote.At the core of Being Wrong is a suggestion. Not advice, so much as a recommendation for people interested in living a little better. Embrace your mistakes. It’s not about making mistakes and not feeling bad about it. Schulz wants us all to live with our errors a little more and not shove them away in a flurry of denial and justification. She goes on to examine the reasons why we are so adverse to being wrong, from the biological, (it doesn’t make evolutionary sense to be uncertain about anything) to the social, (our culture rejects leader figures who are indecisive) to the psychological. (depressed people have much more accurate worldviews than balanced personalties)Schulz is at her strongest when she is telling a story. The highlights of the books are the anecdotes she uses to set up each of her chapters. The stories include everything from Alan Greenspan’s unwavering faith in the economy proved wrong, to the touching story of an Exalted Cyclops of the KKK becoming one of the frontline fighters in the war for desegregated schools. Schulz has a deft hand for splicing these stories with the philosophical and scientific meat that connect them back to the reader’s everyday experience. She does tend to get bogged down in some of the dense history of the topic, but the frequent footnotes and witty asides help to break these thick sections up a little.The text itself induces stumbling, at least for me. It’s probably because the subject matter makes me paranoid that I’ve missed something, or misinterpreted a critical conclusion. To that end, I’d really recommend reading this book in chapters, rather than tackling the entire thing all at once. The writing lends it self to easy sectioning and while reading order is important, the ideas are all pretty sticky, which makes it easier to spread over time.Close to the end of the third section, Schulz examines the story of Penny Beerntsen, a woman who was raped and ended up falsely accusing another man of the crime. He was eventually proved innocent, but in the interim the woman had struggled to get closure in other ways. She wanted to understand the reasons people did horrible things to each other. To do this, she volunteered in prisons and really got to know the realities of being a convicted criminal in the United States. When the verdict came down proving that she had identified the wrong man, she was horrified, but she instantly accepted her mistake and wanted to somehow make up for it. Rather than try to deny her fault, she only sought to improve the life of the man she had thrown into prison unjustly.While this is an extreme example, I can’t think of a better example of being a truly human person. It would be an exaggeration to say I want be like Penny, but her example is one that I can value as someone who can be wrong and can be stupid about it. And really, we all fall into that category sometimes. Anyone who has ever been a critic of any kind knows the giddy thrill of being unquestionably right. (you cannot successfully argue against opinion) It is never a bad thing to gain a little perspective on that feeling, and that’s just what this book has allowed me to do."

It is a neglected and deeply human attribute: being wrong, feeling wrong, discovering one's wrongness, changing as a result—or, more usually, denying it, ducking and running from the acknowledgement of error. I was fascinated, particularly so once I got through the first chapters. The writing is a curious mix of academic rigour and convivial, almost conversational, English. I found the book deeply engrossing, and it gave me perspective about my own error-filled journey. I finished the book a few days ago, and I am still turning it over in my mind. Highly recommend."
45,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2011274-brian,5,"Have you ever been wrong? Of course you have. Everybody makes mistakes and many people talk like that is all they do, ""Oh I am always messing up"" they might say. Now try reflecting on the moment when you realized that you were wrong about something. Don't reflect on your past beliefs, whether trivial or not, but rather think of that moment where you shifted from knowing that you were right to knowing that you were not. How did that moment feel when you realized that you were wrong, not when you were actually wrong but when you realized you were wrong?There isn't an external force that can inform us of the correctness or incorrectness of our beliefs a priori and therefore prevent us from making minor or grave mistakes. We have to force ourselves to reckon our beliefs with the external world and when we find our beliefs at odds with the world, it hurts. When we are wrong we feel alone, the moment we recognize our errors is "". . . a moment of alienation, both from ourselves and from [our] previously convincing vision of the world.""This profound and well grounded skepticism about things that feel so right and natural to us is deeply troubling to me. Schulz's prose is very good and is a joy to read and quote* but I have to admit that reflecting on our tendency to err, often in disastrous ways, is unsettling. I think it is disturbing because it goes against our nature not only to know but also to be known. In the current american culture the sexual attraction to others is pretty overt and therefore almost ever present in our minds. But I think we forget about the attractions we have to others than have nothing to do with sex or physical appearances at all. A meeting of the minds is a truly rewarding experience wherein our views of the world are validated and shared. We are in agreement with others about being correct and that is deeply satisfying. Again, Schulz says it a bit better:“Think about how distressing it is to feel misunderstood, and how frustrating it is when someone believes something about you—that you’re irresponsible or can’t handle commitment or don’t pull your weight at work—that you think is untrue. Conversely, there are few things more gratifying than the feeling that someone deeply understands us. In fact, as we are about to see, this feeling of being of being “gotten” is the sine qua non of our most important relationships, and the very hallmark of being in love.”[4]Full review here:http://wp.me/p6r7eE-2P"
46,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8744761-william,5,"This is an impressive and surprisingly enjoyable book. While Schulz is a journalist, the work seems closer to scholarly than journalistic, though it has a lighter touch than scholarship typically achieves. In reading it, don't skip the foot- and endnotes. There is often good stuff there.I experienced ""Being Wrong"" on three levels, and it works exceptionally well on two of them. To begin with, Schulz makes a compelling case that being wrong is by and large more a constructive thing than a negative one. Emotion, creativity and humor, she points out, draw heavily on error to be compelling. While it is explicitly not her intention, there is a self-help aspect to the book which works well. It was impossible for me to read it and not say to myself: ""Hey, lighten up. You don;t have to get everything right the first -- or second, or third -- time.The second level on which i found the book effective is just as good reading. Schultz writes well and with impressive wit. This book would be a good read if you even skipped the message and just read the stories which appear so frequently. My guess is I remember some of the stories better -- and will do so longer -- than the main purpose of the book.Where I find the book a little less satisfying is in the central argument. It's meticulous, sometimes to the point of tediousness. Who knew there was so much to write on this subject? And there are occasional generalizations with which I disagree. (1) We all disdain undecided voters. (177) Huh? (2) ""We almost never find ourselves between theories"" (186). Maybe it's just me, but there are frequently issues on which I have not made up my mind. (3) [quoting LaRochefoucauld] ""Everyone complains about their memory; no one complains about their judgment."" It seems to me all of us have had long talks with friends upset because they keep making the same mistake over and over, and we can often feel that way about ourselves as well.But regardless of my discomfort with some of the logic and a case which seems occasionally overstated, I found the book personally useful, certainly interesting and most of all both educational and entertaining."

That is not what this book is about. It does not try to approve or disapprove of making mistakes during an intentional brain dump (or storm). It does not try to repackage any established wisdom heard at a marketing conference. This book should not be pigeon-holded as ""self-help"" or ""business"" even though it may, by chance, give you the perceptual tools to somehow fix a decision you recently made, or are about to make, or help you stop hating your niece for joining that cult back in the 90s.It DOES research the history of why we feel, or believe, and why the final decision we make is believed to be true. Because this topic is covered from its most simple origin of sensing and belief you may have to read a few chapters before you get to one that changes the way you perceive the world. However you will enjoy the historical, personal and scientific references that are threaded throughout. Its funny and well written while it is smart, clever and funny. Bill Clinton reviewed it for f#ck sake, so you know its got to be pretty good. Albeit he probably spends most of every day trying to figure out why he did most of what he did in the 80s and 90s.Still not convinced? Well, the author did a TED talk that you may enjoy.

I'm not even sure why that is because I have just been nothing but fascinated, especially so at all the research this book must have required to write. The amount of work in putting the book together is not lost on me. My guess would be that this is one of those books that a college professor would assign to his class. I read it through once, and then reread each chapter once more if not twice for some. I have never taken any college courses but IO have self educated to a certain (non) degree. There is no doubt that I have really enjoyed this book, for I have penciled in some notes and highlighted sections, something I try to avoid doing usually. I am pretty impressed with the entire book, references and the authors personal references. All of which has really made for an interesting study of Being Wrong. I'm very pleased to add that this is one more of the books I've read that I will being easily entertained by and probably get more out of each time I go through it in the future."
49,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5881280-steve-penner,4,"""Being Wrong"" was a wonderful and fascinating plunge into the world of wrongology. It covers a wide-ranging host of topics on error, how it happens and particularly how we respond to being wrong. Her basic premise is that there are two models of error. One model propounds error as something to be avoided at all costs as it provides no benefits, only embarrassment and shame. The second, which Schulz celebrates, is that error is common and natural. It's benefit is that we can learn, grow and change as a result. It's a very positive spin on a topic that has been dealt with by Plato and other classic writers, Augustine and Aquinas, Enlightenment thinkers, Freud and many other comtemporary writers. Schulz is a wonderful story teller and her stories are the highlight of the book. She can be slightly irritating as a writer when she continually states that the topic ""is something I'll deal with later."" This ""pre-figuring"" happens at least 20 times and becomes wearisome. Hopefully a future editor will do a better job of tightening up this habit. Overall and beyond my pettiness, I heartily recommend this as a wonderful, leisurely read in which you will certainly learn something about history, literature and yourself."

It kinda took me 2 hours to finish 30 pages or so.. *english is my 2nd language here*.. The book starts so well into its core concept and it keeps going so thoroughly discussing the ideas and concepts. sometimes it goes all the way to the core of philosophy and logic and all these mind twisting concepts of error and wrong and emotion and perception..At other chapters you feel like the introduction of the chapter never ends and takes so so long it kinda makes you lost and bored into it.. at others, it's like you're in a river of fluid stream of ideas so connected you don't feel yourself in its beauty.. but if there's one thing to notice, it's gonna be the effort the author put in compiling all the MASSIVE information of the different perspectives and sources and fields of knowledge it's admirable..I love this book, it's one of those books you feel sad you finished, and you feel like you've changed your perspective about so many things in life after reading..

Schulz breaks down rather complex philosophical and psychological issues to easily understood concepts with direct practical application. Further, she does this without removing the terminology, making it easy for people to continue studying long after they've finished this book. This is not a work of post-modern woowoo, where being wrong means no truth can ever be determined. Instead this is a nuanced understanding of our human lives, filled as they are with probabilistic knowledge rather than absolutist dogma, and where we can trust our minds to do what they do, create stories, not form perfect encyclopedic recall. Doing so allows Schulz to make a truly delightful and helpful contribution to our existence: that being wrong is not something to attack like some horrid beast but an inevitable aspect of our lives to embrace and seek always to see how our mental tendencies to error can be mitigated through understanding.

I've found it really hard to focus on this book, due to the fact that I don't know all of the terms she mentions. Unfortunately it seems to happen so frequently, that i'd have to have a dictionary next to me through the entire book. Honestly, that's just not something I really want to do at this point.Maybe eventually, I'll be able to give the book my full attention, but for now, I'm unable to even get to chapter 2.

A compelling aspect of Being Wrong is a set of arguments for the value of making errors or being wrong. An obsession with eliminating all errors may result in worse outcomes. For example, by taking risks and making some errors, you can learn much more than by sticking with safe decisions.One of the most interesting chapters covered areas of wrongness and criminology, starting off with the story of Steven Avery's 18-year sentence for a crime he didn't commit. That was followed by a note that he was later convicted of a murder, the only setback to date of the Wisconsin Innocence Project. Just two days after I read that chapter, I read an article about the Netflix documentary Making a Murderer that suggests that Avery might also be innocent of that crime, framed once again by the same bad cops."

55,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11297501-anna,5,"Kathryn Schulz argues passionately for the value of error. She shows us that not only is 'being wrong' a given in life, it is also a gift that has the power to transform our worldviews, our relationships, and ourselves. By drawing on philosophy, neuroscience, psycholoanalysts and a bit of common sense, she charts out the intellectual history of the shifting definitions and attitudes ascribed to being wrong and masterfully combines it with relevant & relatable examples from the present day. Schulz is a terrific thinker & and she writes with an elegant clarity and simplicity that make it nearly impossible to believe this is her first book (it seems as though she has done this before). Definitely one of the best things I have read in years. I am kind of in love with her now. Check out her Ted talks. "
56,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826906-laura,4,"I saw the author speak (very entertainingly) at an education conference, which was appropriate since - as she argues persuasively - being wrong is an inextricable part of learning and imagination. Yet in education we can often inadvertently send a message that error is something to fear and avoid. This is an entertaining book which would have been enhanced by some cross-cultural examination - e.g. how is error conceived of in cultures with a very different sense of self? Nevertheless, it's a rare book that really is relevant to everyone - but since we've all been wrong, are currently wrong (though we don't yet know how) and will be wrong at some point in the future, we can all find something to learn and relate to here."

I admit I'm a sucker for that mix, so I've enjoyed her style mostly. Also, David seemed to say that the problem was that it got bogged down in semantics and word games, but I actually thought there was more emphasis on neuro-biology with anecdotes thrown in. She wasn't always the most illuminating--do I really need to hear about the old woman/young woman picture one more time?--but I think it helps flesh out the constellation of issues around our own images of ourselves and our rightness. At least, it makes my staff meeting make a whole lot more sense."

Still an interesting topic and discussion, although I think I agree with an earlier reviewer that the section on Love was not really related to the rest of the book and not really apropos to the topic. I found the idea of pessimistic versus optimistic views of wrongness intriguing. The author did inject some mild humor throughout the book that made the book more fun to read without being over the top or distracting.

59,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3761228-adman,4,"Insightful, therapeutic, and hopeful, this book belies its title inasmuch as it surveys error not so much as frontier but heartland, nay, even as a sort of self-sown weed of fate that springs out of any coordinates in any plot of land where we happen to plant our flag of sureness. Schulz crosses all sorts of habitual borders within which we assume we have found safety from error (or accidents, or sin) and shows that we badly overestimate such security (victory, righteousness). She does so with compassion and zeal, and this time stays quite true to her title. It really is an adventure to her to knock down the ego's badly-constructed refuges and blaze a new trail for how we think and act. It is not a sadistic or despairing adventure, though: Schulz believes this eyes-open journey can be better for her and for all of us than how we usually get along in life.Schulz covers a lot of territory. Material and mental subjects are treated in this book, from, say, stepping on a rake to the meta-mistake of rationalizing the mishap (intentional, unavoidable, someone else's fault, or really anything else other than our own error). Schulz hikes around between memory and science, moves from the mundane to the dramatic, sits down to chat with romance, politics, and religion. She does all this with a diplomacy that surprised and gladdened me. Taking a page from her own reflections, I wonder how much her topical environment guided her and her editors to observe even-handedly and deliver cautious judgments. I wish other authors would take note. Any of us, really, who is less blatantly kept in line by whatever happens to be the topic at hand might benefit from Schulz's choice. Far too much intellectual and practical territory, in print or in person, is overrun far too often by refusing to be open and hospitable about error -- in ourselves or others.The trail in this book does not lead to a new shelter where we can rest again from the hard work of living. Instead, how we make and walk our path seems to be Schulz's source of inspiration. How much better off might we be if we acknowledge and respect our seemingly inexhaustible capacity for error? What if we did not retreat in either denial or despair? What if we ventured from time to time out of the refuge of the self into the crowd or, the reverse, from the masses into the self? What if we diverted some of our energy from purging and purifying and celebrated and cultivated the capacity of some institutions -- art, religion, certain forms of government -- to introduce us to our limitations?I was struck by how relationship-oriented this book is. I suppose Schulz might respond, how could it not be? First of all and obviously, the book is not part of me -- not in my traditional sense of self. As with any book, I am contending with a thing outside of me. The book is not Ms. Schulz either, but rather a shadow-her that emerged as she researched and wrote, a page-bound self she may have hoped would reflect her living self. This shadow then introduced me, the reader, to other various, astute shadow-thinkers, -scientists, -theologians, and -philosophers. They all shared with me their experiences of a gap between the self and the world and also shared their ill-begotten efforts to remedy that gap. What a wilderness of joining and separating this is to be lost in! So many glances and so many voices have been cast over so many stone walls that stretch and tangle across an endless, fog-shrouded pasture of human experience.Or, if you prefer Ms. Schulz's own, less striving metaphor, life is like a game of telephone, and we often can't make up our minds how to feel -- or what to do -- about the inevitable degeneration of the initial message (though of course no one alive can lay claim to that first message) and our powerlessness to steer that degeneration.Schulz really gets to the bottom of things when she observes that we are in search of wholeness more than we are in search of rightness. Like small children, we want unity between whatever we understand to be the self and the not-self. Error -- accident, sin, the comical-or-frustrating evolution of the message in telephone, defeat at the hands of one's pen, keyboard, numb fingers or mute tongue to put one's spirit in touch with one's blind and deaf neighbors -- represents our failure (or, as we often like to pretend, the failure of others) to be one.Fortunately, around this point in the book, Schulz made an unexpected digression to identify art with error. I have often been driven to desperation and something in the neighborhood of madness by my inability to write poems or stories that express what I wish to convey in details or intensity. What a welcome, unexpected relief it was to read John Keats (among others) describing imperfection as the necessary and desired product of artistic endeavor. Why? I don't recall the line of reasoning she establishes but in the moment that I am writing this, I take it to mean that artistic error is evidence -- of the self, one's hopes, one's intentions, one's peculiar, unrepeatable humanness. It is evidence precisely in its failure to convey exactly what I want it to -- evidence of difference, disunity, and striving toward something else.Schulz ultimately praises error -- with a bit of hedging and a bashful allusion to the Judeochristian story of the Fall. She is not quite comfortable with blatantly saying bad is good. She simply wishes to offer hope that error is not the harbinger of doom we take it -- and often make it -- to be. Instead, it is a circumstance, a lesson, a challenge, an invitation."

64,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72842365-ryan-derby-talbot,5,"Book summary: There are two fundamental and unavoidable components to being a human being: one is the need to chase the feeling of being right –– of having solidity and comfort in how we experience and respond to the world. The other is dealing with being wrong: dealing with error, the inevitable (and sometimes devastating) encounters we have when our expectations end up not aligning with reality. This book is about how we cannot escape either of these forces, and what results — negative or positive –– we can get from attempting to navigate this tension.Our need to chase being right –– and the resulting confidence, empowerment and belongingness (proxies for love?) that come with the feeling of rightness –– run up against and try to discount and rule out all the ways we inevitably can get things wrong: through illusions, false or overstated beliefs, skewed understandings of data, biases, social influences that lead us astray, emotional investments in perspectives or communities, the need to feel love, and flat out denial. We have difficulty even seeing wrongness in action in us (thinking we are far more objective and omniscient than we are), partly because it is such a fleeting force –– striking either too quickly or too slowly for us to catch it. Moreover, we struggle with identifying and acknowledging wrongness because of the strong emotional and cognitive forces (the desire for the feeling of certainty, the biases) that protect us, and keep us overwhelmingly invested in particular perspectives at the expense of other perspectives more aligned with reality. However much we may want to insist on the contrary or wish away our propensity to get things wrong (and we do this routinely), if we actually look at it, we invariably, deeply, absurdly, and inevitably get things wrong. Actually facing this truth doesn’t need to doom us, however, to defeated nihilism. The gap between our perspectives and the world make possible our two distinctly powerful human abilities: imagination and empathy. (Both are the result of allowing more than one perspective in a situation, of permitting a bigger notion than just a single “rightness.”) Successful incorporation and integration of our own wrongness –– which requires going through the excruciating emotional pain of admitting and allowing wrongness –– expands our sensitivities and perspectives as human beings. Collectively, our relationship with the gap also makes possible the two best products of human work, art and science. At root, error –– encountering the gap –– contributes to diversity, wonder, and richness of human experience. Alas, however, it will not ever lead us to a refuge of solid objectivity. Alas, there is no magic formula for dealing with the tensions between our desired rightness and inevitable wrongness. We can, however, recognize the growth and wondrous (mystical?) perspectives that are available in confronting their clash within us, the fundamental and inevitable experience of being a human being. "
65,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45191284-beth,4,"Kathryn Schulz delves into all the ways we can be wrong, explaining the strange whys and hows or error generation, denial, and results. The fact that the fabric of humanity is interwoven with error and inseparable from the state of being human is something abput which most of us live in denial. Schulz uncovers some of the universal characteristics of being wrong in a way that is more palatable than some of the ways society reminds us we are wrong. We are wired to resist the notion of our own fallibility, so this deft touch is necessary in order to circumvent our natural resistance. At the same time, she highlights the benefits of acknowledging and embracing our error in order to better our communities, our interpersonal relationships, and ourselves. For example:""This is one of the most powerful ways being wrong can transform us. It can help us be more compassionate people. Being right might be fun, but as we've seen, it has a tendency to bring out the worst in us. By contrast, being wrong might is often the furthest thing in the world from fun, and yet, in the end, it has the potential to bring out the best in us. Or, rather, to change us for the better.""This book now is added to 2 others - Tim Nochols' The Death of Expertise and Han Roslings's Factfulness- that I would recommend to any of my acquaintances who are trying to grapple with the perceived and real societal grievances battering for their attention. Schulz can get a little long-winded in places, but this is a deep topic and I found that if I hung with her she eventually led me to her point.One of my favorite passages is what I hope people gain from reading this book:""If you really want to be right, or at least improve the odds of being right, you have to start by acknowledging your fallibility. Deliberately seeking out your mistakes. And figuring out what caused you to make them."""

In all, Schulz does an admirable job of selecting her chosen anecdotes and ends up with a satisfying and thought-provoking read.NotesPerhaps the history of the errors of mankind, all things considered, is more valuable and interesting than that of their discoveries. Truth is uniform and narrow; it constantly exists, and does not seem to require so much an active energy, as a passive aptitude of the soul in order to encounter it. But error is endlessly diversified; it has no reality, but is the pure and simple creation of the mind that invents it. In this field the soul has room enough to expand herself, to display all her boundless faculties, and all her beautiful and interesting extravagancies and absurdities.—Benjamin Franklin______Many of the religious thinkers who tried to understand why we err found their answer at the gates of the Garden of Eden. Thus Thomas Aquinas, the thirteenth-century scholastic, held that we make mistakes because, when we were banished from paradise, we were cut off forever from direct access to divine truth. To Aquinas and many of his fellow theologians, our errors arise from the gap between our own limited and blemished minds and God’s unlimited and perfect omniscience.This same basic idea has received countless secular treatments as well. Plato thought that our primordial soul was at one with the universe, and that we only began to err when we took on our current physical form and forgot those cosmic truths. The Enlightenment philosopher John Locke thought that error seeped into our lives from the gap between the artificiality of words and the reality of the things they name—from the distance between an indescribable essence and the nearest sayable thing. The German philosopher Martin Heidegger thought that error could be explained by the fact that we live in time and space; because we are bound to a particular set of coordinates, we can’t rise above them and see reality as a whole, from a bird’s-eye (or God’s-eye) view. As different as these explanations seem, all these thinkers and many more conceived of error as arising from a gap: sometimes between the particular and the general, sometimes between words and things, sometimes between the present and the primeval, sometimes between the mortal and the divine—but in every case, and fundamentally, between our own mind and the rest of the world.For the most part, we spend our lives blithely ignoring this gap. And with good reason. Who wants to be reminded of the fall from grace, the separation from truth, the particular and limited nature of our existence? ______How can we square this feeling of rightness with the very real possibility that we are wrong? This is a question that haunts all of wrongology, not just errors of memory. The problem is suggested by the very phrase “the feeling of knowing.” In life, as in language, we begin with a psychological state (the “feeling” part) and end up with a claim about the truth (the “knowing” part). In other words, we feel that we are right because we feel that we are right: we take our own certainty as an indicator of accuracy. This isn’t completely foolish of us, since studies show that there is some correlation between confidence and correctness. But it isn’t completely foolproof, either. As the case of flashbulb memories makes clear, our certainty reflects the existence of a particularly vivid inner picture. But nothing in life guarantees that this picture reflects the real state of affairs.This reliance on a vivid inner picture helps explain why memories are particularly apt to trigger the feeling of knowing.______ The philosopher Avishai Marga lit put this nicely. ""It is not the case that I am caught in a web of beliefs,"" he wrote. "" . . . Rather, I am caught in a network of witnesses."" Our relationships to these ""witnesses""-the people and institutions that attest to the truth of various beliefs-predate and determine our reaction to whatever information they supply. As Margalit said, ""my belief in [one of these witnesses] is prior to my belief that (what she says is true)."" Belief in is prior: however far this might be from our sense of how we should form our ideas about the world, it is the first principle of how we actually do so. All of us are caught in Margalit's ""networks of witnesses""­ not just in one but in many, and not just from time to time but all the time, from the moment we are born until the day we die. As countless commen­tators have observed, this lends to our beliefs an element of the arbitrary. Montaigne, for instance, remarked that people ""are swept [into a belief]­ either by the custom of their country or by their parental upbringing, or by chance-as by a tempest, without judgment or choice, indeed most often before the age of discretion.""______These latter­ day zealots have hailed from many different backgrounds and held many different beliefs. At heart, though, and paradoxically, they have all shared a single conviction: that they and they alone are in possession of the truth. (The very word ""zealot"" comes from a Greek root meaning to be jealous of the truth-to guard it as your own.) What zealots have in common, then, is the absolute conviction that they are right. In fact, of all the symbolic ones and zeros that extremists use to write their ideological binary codes­ us/them, same/different, good/evil-the fundamental one is right/wrong. Zealotry demands a complete rejection of the possibility of error. The conviction that we cannot possibly be wrong: this is certainty.______[O]ur be­liefs come in bundles. That makes it hard to remove or replace one without affecting the others-and it gets harder as the belief in question gets more central. In this respect, beliefs are like the beams in a building or the words in a sentence: you can't eliminate one and expect the fundamental sound­ ness or fundamental meaning of the overall system to remain unchanged. As a result, being wrong sometimes triggers a cascade of transformations so extensive that the belief system that emerges afterward bears almost no resemblance to its predecessor. ______You fight your superficiality, your shallowness, so as to try to come at people without unreal expectations, without an overload of bias or hope or arrogance, as untanklike as you can be . . . and yet you never fail to get them wrong. You might as well have the brain of a tank. You get them wrong before you meet them: you get them wrong while you're with them and then you get home to tell somebody else about the meeting and you get them all wrong again. Since the same generally goes for them with you, the whole thing is really a dazzling illusion empty of all perception, an astonishing farce of misperception. And yet what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people, which gets bled of the significance we think it has and takes on a significance that is ludicrous, so ill equipped are we all to envision one another's interior workings and invisible aims? . . . The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway. It's getting them wrong that is living, getting them wrong and wrong and wrong and then, on careful reconsideration, getting them wrong again . That's how we know we are alive: we're wrong. —Phillip Roth, American Pastoral______We go to our jobs, stop by the bar on our way home, hang out with our friends, raise our kids­ because these things are the stuff of life, to be sure, but also because they are strategies for keeping the terror of isolation in check. Soren Kierkeg­aard, that existentialist before there was existentialism, compared us in this respect to those early American pioneers who banged on their pots and pans all night long, hoping to keep the wolves at bay. Keeping wolves at bay is a start. But of all our ways of dealing with this rift, our favorite by far is the one that promises to eliminate it entirely­ to transform our desert island into a tropical paradise, our fundamental separation into ecstatic union. This strategy is our last, best hope for escap­ing the loneliness of existence and giving despair the slip. I am talking, of course, about love.______The idea that we possess a true self serves a hugely important psycho­ logical purpose. If we have an essential and unchanging identity, one we are destined to discover sooner or later, then the beliefs we hold, the choices we make, the person we become-none of this happens by chance. Instead, the entire course of our lives is inevitable, dictated by the certainty that our real self will eventually surface...This narrative is appealing for the same reason that it is problematic: within it, we can do no wrong. Our false beliefs were foreordained, our ap­parent errors occurred strictly in the service of a larger truth. This idea is made explicit in the religious affirmation that ""God makes no mistakes"": even the seeming trials and blunders of our lives are part of a larger plan: As that implies, stories starring a true self are teleological; we end up exactly where we are meant to be. This, too, is both an attraction and a weakness of the idea of an essential self. It suggests that our lives are deterministic, that yesterday's convictions-which we thought we chose based on their intellectual, emotional, or spiritual merits-were merely a trap into which we were lured for the benefit of some predetermined future self. Whatever meaning or worth our past might have had on its own terms is effectively written out of existence. Even more problematically, the idea of a true self suggests that we will never undergo momentous upheaval again. How could we? Having finally discovered who we really are and have always been, there is no further transformation available to us. If the self is constantly changing, then we can constantly feel our way forward, constantly become someone new-but if each of us possesses a fixed essence, then we can only return to it. Accord­ingly, our past departure from that essential self can only be a single and inexplicable aberration, associated as often as not with betrayal, transgres­sion, and sin. (Recall Chambers denouncing Communism, his erstwhile faith, as ""evil, absolute evil."") Singular, aberrational, transgressive, evil: we've seen this constellation of ideas before. This is the pessimistic model of wrongness, in which error is an unwelcome anomaly, a mark of our exile from the sacred realm of truth. Helpfully, this reminds us that we have another model for making sense of wrongness as well-one that casts a different light not only on our errors but also on ourselves. Here, wrongness is a natural and ongoing process, and we are not deformed but transformed by it. ______""The main in­terest in life and work,"" said Foucault, ""is to become someone else that you were not in the beginning."" Such transformations don't only come about through wrongness, of course-but wrongness is always an opportunity for such transformations. ______I was of three minds, Like a tree In which there are three blackbirds. —Wallace Stevens, 13 Ways of Looking at a Blackbird______His desire to banish art is part of a long and often sinister tradition (which we glimpsed earlier) of trying to create ideal societies through eradicating error in all its forms. All of those disgruntled undergraduates, meanwhile, are motivated in part-whether they know it or not-by the optimistic model of wrongness. They recognize, as most of us do, not just the legitimacy but also the poten­tial beauty and power of individual, skewed, inaccurate representations of reality. In this model, the link between error and art i s not a n indictment of art but a defense of error. Cut off from the absolute essence of things-that ideal form that Plato felt existed only in the mind of God-our separate, subjective consciousnesses look around and see, instead, Water Lilies, or Starry Night, or Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Likewise, we can make Beowulf and Star Wars and Horton Hears a Who! for the same reason we can make mistakes: because, as I said earlier, we are capable of conjuring the world not just as it is, but also as it is not. Our capacity to err is inseparable from our imagination.______The most famous formulation of this relationship between art, doubt, and error comes from the Romantic poet John Keats. He had been talking over various matters with a friend, he wrote to his brothers in a letter in 1 817, ""and at once it struck me,"" what quality went to form a Man of Achievement especially in lit­erature & which Shakespeare possessed so enormously-! mean Negative Capability, that is when man is capable of being in un­certainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact & reason.Keats's attitude toward uncertainty-and, for that matter, toward ""fact & reason""-is not the common one. He embraced unknowability and falli­bility, but not for the utilitarian purposes we saw in the last chapter. There, the point of embracing error was to curtail it-a kind of homeopathic rem­ edy for wrongness. But Keats wasn't interested in remedying wrongness. He recognized error and art as conjoined twins, born of the same place and vital to one another's existence. In life as in linguistics, art is joined at the root to artificial-to the not-true, the unreal-just as a fiction is at once a creation and a falsehood. ______But unlike androids, we humans do not nor­ mally self-destruct in the face of our mistakes. On the contrary: we self­ create, and self-recreate. This idea of self-creation suggests something else important about error. Being wrong doesn't just make us human in general; it also helps make each of us the specific person we are. In our inability to get things exactly right, in the idiosyncrasies of our private visions of the world, the outline of selfhood appears. This is what Benjamin Franklin was getting at in the quote I used as an epigraph to this book. Error, he wrote, is ""the pure and simple creation of the mind that invents it,"" a place where ""the soul has room enough to expand herself."" Mistakes, he ·meant, are the evidence and expression of an individual identity. This is an idea with deep and important roots in our intellectual history. It is, in essence, the crucial insight of evolutionary theory. Because of errors in the replication of genetic sequences, we wind up with variation among individual members of a species; and because of that variation, the species as a whole can adapt and survive. Such errors literally keep their hosts alive. A population that is too small or too homogenous to support significant genetic variation is doomed. For every species, then, error is a mechanism of survival and change. For us human organisms, with our richer relation­ ship to wrongness, mistakes enable not only our biological evolution but our social, emotional, and intellectual evolution as well. And wrongness also allows us to thrive in another way. I began this book by noting that we think of being right as essential to our survival and happiness, but in one key respect, nothing could be further from the truth. Countless studies have shown that people who suffer from depression have more accurate worldviews than nondepressed people. Depressed people do not nurture the cheering illusion that they can control the course of their lives. They rarely possess the conviction, so common in the rest of us, that they are above average in virtually every respect. And they understand, all too acutely, the basic conditions of existence: that their lifespan is just a brief blip in the cold sweep of history, that suffering is real and ongoing, that they and all the people they love are going to die. That outlook is known as depressive realism. Depressed people might be unhappy, but­ when it comes to these big-picture, existential matters-they are generally more right than the rest of us. It scarcely requires saying that this kind of rightness is not fun. ""To see the world as it really is is devastating and terrifying,"" wrote the philosopher Ernest Becker. "" . . . It makes thoughtless living in the world of men an im­possibility. It places a trembling animal at the mercy of the entire cosmos and the problem of the meaning of it."" As that indicates, the correlation between accuracy and depression runs both ways: people who are depressed tend to perceive the harsher realities of life more clearly, and people who clearly perceive those harsh realities tend to be (or to get) depressed. In an odd reversal of the usual state of affairs, when it comes to these existential issues, the bigger and more important the belief, the less it pays to be right. That's why, as I've said, the goal of therapy isn't necessarily to make our beliefs more accurate; it is to make them more functional. Ronnie Janoff­ Bulman, the psychologist, has even argued that ""a key to the good life might well be illusions at our deepest, most generalized level of assump­ tions and accuracy at the most specific, least abstract levels."" (Fortunately for us, these two perspectives are compatible: research suggests that people who possess a generally positive outlook are better at acknowledging their everyday errors and changing their minds.) If excessive accuracy in our self-image and worldview is correlated with depression, the opposite is true, too. Sometimes, being wrong makes us happy. Think of Don Quixote, that exemplary knight errant, who lent his name to the condition of being pleasantly deluded. "

It very much is, but just saying that is a bit of a cop-out. The book is a brilliantly written examination of the concept of error from every perspective imaginable. Schulz explores wrongness as an outside observer, a philosopher, a victim and a compassionate friend. By so fully embracing the idea on every level, she synthesizes a unified thesis from many disparate parts and supports every conclusion she draws with the best in logic and anecdote.At the core of Being Wrong is a suggestion. Not advice, so much as a recommendation for people interested in living a little better. Embrace your mistakes. It’s not about making mistakes and not feeling bad about it. Schulz wants us all to live with our errors a little more and not shove them away in a flurry of denial and justification. She goes on to examine the reasons why we are so adverse to being wrong, from the biological, (it doesn’t make evolutionary sense to be uncertain about anything) to the social, (our culture rejects leader figures who are indecisive) to the psychological. (depressed people have much more accurate worldviews than balanced personalties)Schulz is at her strongest when she is telling a story. The highlights of the books are the anecdotes she uses to set up each of her chapters. The stories include everything from Alan Greenspan’s unwavering faith in the economy proved wrong, to the touching story of an Exalted Cyclops of the KKK becoming one of the frontline fighters in the war for desegregated schools. Schulz has a deft hand for splicing these stories with the philosophical and scientific meat that connect them back to the reader’s everyday experience. She does tend to get bogged down in some of the dense history of the topic, but the frequent footnotes and witty asides help to break these thick sections up a little.The text itself induces stumbling, at least for me. It’s probably because the subject matter makes me paranoid that I’ve missed something, or misinterpreted a critical conclusion. To that end, I’d really recommend reading this book in chapters, rather than tackling the entire thing all at once. The writing lends it self to easy sectioning and while reading order is important, the ideas are all pretty sticky, which makes it easier to spread over time.Close to the end of the third section, Schulz examines the story of Penny Beerntsen, a woman who was raped and ended up falsely accusing another man of the crime. He was eventually proved innocent, but in the interim the woman had struggled to get closure in other ways. She wanted to understand the reasons people did horrible things to each other. To do this, she volunteered in prisons and really got to know the realities of being a convicted criminal in the United States. When the verdict came down proving that she had identified the wrong man, she was horrified, but she instantly accepted her mistake and wanted to somehow make up for it. Rather than try to deny her fault, she only sought to improve the life of the man she had thrown into prison unjustly.While this is an extreme example, I can’t think of a better example of being a truly human person. It would be an exaggeration to say I want be like Penny, but her example is one that I can value as someone who can be wrong and can be stupid about it. And really, we all fall into that category sometimes. Anyone who has ever been a critic of any kind knows the giddy thrill of being unquestionably right. (you cannot successfully argue against opinion) It is never a bad thing to gain a little perspective on that feeling, and that’s just what this book has allowed me to do."

It is a neglected and deeply human attribute: being wrong, feeling wrong, discovering one's wrongness, changing as a result—or, more usually, denying it, ducking and running from the acknowledgement of error. I was fascinated, particularly so once I got through the first chapters. The writing is a curious mix of academic rigour and convivial, almost conversational, English. I found the book deeply engrossing, and it gave me perspective about my own error-filled journey. I finished the book a few days ago, and I am still turning it over in my mind. Highly recommend."

Everybody makes mistakes and many people talk like that is all they do, ""Oh I am always messing up"" they might say. Now try reflecting on the moment when you realized that you were wrong about something. Don't reflect on your past beliefs, whether trivial or not, but rather think of that moment where you shifted from knowing that you were right to knowing that you were not. How did that moment feel when you realized that you were wrong, not when you were actually wrong but when you realized you were wrong?There isn't an external force that can inform us of the correctness or incorrectness of our beliefs a priori and therefore prevent us from making minor or grave mistakes. We have to force ourselves to reckon our beliefs with the external world and when we find our beliefs at odds with the world, it hurts. When we are wrong we feel alone, the moment we recognize our errors is "". . . a moment of alienation, both from ourselves and from [our] previously convincing vision of the world.""This profound and well grounded skepticism about things that feel so right and natural to us is deeply troubling to me. Schulz's prose is very good and is a joy to read and quote* but I have to admit that reflecting on our tendency to err, often in disastrous ways, is unsettling. I think it is disturbing because it goes against our nature not only to know but also to be known. In the current american culture the sexual attraction to others is pretty overt and therefore almost ever present in our minds. But I think we forget about the attractions we have to others than have nothing to do with sex or physical appearances at all. A meeting of the minds is a truly rewarding experience wherein our views of the world are validated and shared. We are in agreement with others about being correct and that is deeply satisfying. Again, Schulz says it a bit better:“Think about how distressing it is to feel misunderstood, and how frustrating it is when someone believes something about you—that you’re irresponsible or can’t handle commitment or don’t pull your weight at work—that you think is untrue. Conversely, there are few things more gratifying than the feeling that someone deeply understands us. In fact, as we are about to see, this feeling of being of being “gotten” is the sine qua non of our most important relationships, and the very hallmark of being in love.”[4]Full review here:http://wp.me/p6r7eE-2P"
76,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8744761-william,5,"This is an impressive and surprisingly enjoyable book. While Schulz is a journalist, the work seems closer to scholarly than journalistic, though it has a lighter touch than scholarship typically achieves. In reading it, don't skip the foot- and endnotes. There is often good stuff there.I experienced ""Being Wrong"" on three levels, and it works exceptionally well on two of them. To begin with, Schulz makes a compelling case that being wrong is by and large more a constructive thing than a negative one. Emotion, creativity and humor, she points out, draw heavily on error to be compelling. While it is explicitly not her intention, there is a self-help aspect to the book which works well. It was impossible for me to read it and not say to myself: ""Hey, lighten up. You don;t have to get everything right the first -- or second, or third -- time.The second level on which i found the book effective is just as good reading. Schultz writes well and with impressive wit. This book would be a good read if you even skipped the message and just read the stories which appear so frequently. My guess is I remember some of the stories better -- and will do so longer -- than the main purpose of the book.Where I find the book a little less satisfying is in the central argument. It's meticulous, sometimes to the point of tediousness. Who knew there was so much to write on this subject? And there are occasional generalizations with which I disagree. (1) We all disdain undecided voters. (177) Huh? (2) ""We almost never find ourselves between theories"" (186). Maybe it's just me, but there are frequently issues on which I have not made up my mind. (3) [quoting LaRochefoucauld] ""Everyone complains about their memory; no one complains about their judgment."" It seems to me all of us have had long talks with friends upset because they keep making the same mistake over and over, and we can often feel that way about ourselves as well.But regardless of my discomfort with some of the logic and a case which seems occasionally overstated, I found the book personally useful, certainly interesting and most of all both educational and entertaining."

That is not what this book is about. It does not try to approve or disapprove of making mistakes during an intentional brain dump (or storm). It does not try to repackage any established wisdom heard at a marketing conference. This book should not be pigeon-holded as ""self-help"" or ""business"" even though it may, by chance, give you the perceptual tools to somehow fix a decision you recently made, or are about to make, or help you stop hating your niece for joining that cult back in the 90s.It DOES research the history of why we feel, or believe, and why the final decision we make is believed to be true. Because this topic is covered from its most simple origin of sensing and belief you may have to read a few chapters before you get to one that changes the way you perceive the world. However you will enjoy the historical, personal and scientific references that are threaded throughout. Its funny and well written while it is smart, clever and funny. Bill Clinton reviewed it for f#ck sake, so you know its got to be pretty good. Albeit he probably spends most of every day trying to figure out why he did most of what he did in the 80s and 90s.Still not convinced? Well, the author did a TED talk that you may enjoy. If nothing else it will get you to experience her insightful fun voice of her writing which I really enjoy. "

I'm not even sure why that is because I have just been nothing but fascinated, especially so at all the research this book must have required to write. The amount of work in putting the book together is not lost on me. My guess would be that this is one of those books that a college professor would assign to his class. I read it through once, and then reread each chapter once more if not twice for some. I have never taken any college courses but IO have self educated to a certain (non) degree. There is no doubt that I have really enjoyed this book, for I have penciled in some notes and highlighted sections, something I try to avoid doing usually. I am pretty impressed with the entire book, references and the authors personal references. All of which has really made for an interesting study of Being Wrong. I'm very pleased to add that this is one more of the books I've read that I will being easily entertained by and probably get more out of each time I go through it in the future."
79,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5881280-steve-penner,4,"""Being Wrong"" was a wonderful and fascinating plunge into the world of wrongology. It covers a wide-ranging host of topics on error, how it happens and particularly how we respond to being wrong. Her basic premise is that there are two models of error. One model propounds error as something to be avoided at all costs as it provides no benefits, only embarrassment and shame. The second, which Schulz celebrates, is that error is common and natural. It's benefit is that we can learn, grow and change as a result. It's a very positive spin on a topic that has been dealt with by Plato and other classic writers, Augustine and Aquinas, Enlightenment thinkers, Freud and many other comtemporary writers. Schulz is a wonderful story teller and her stories are the highlight of the book. She can be slightly irritating as a writer when she continually states that the topic ""is something I'll deal with later."" This ""pre-figuring"" happens at least 20 times and becomes wearisome. Hopefully a future editor will do a better job of tightening up this habit. Overall and beyond my pettiness, I heartily recommend this as a wonderful, leisurely read in which you will certainly learn something about history, literature and yourself."

It kinda took me 2 hours to finish 30 pages or so.. *english is my 2nd language here*.. The book starts so well into its core concept and it keeps going so thoroughly discussing the ideas and concepts. sometimes it goes all the way to the core of philosophy and logic and all these mind twisting concepts of error and wrong and emotion and perception..At other chapters you feel like the introduction of the chapter never ends and takes so so long it kinda makes you lost and bored into it.. at others, it's like you're in a river of fluid stream of ideas so connected you don't feel yourself in its beauty.. but if there's one thing to notice, it's gonna be the effort the author put in compiling all the MASSIVE information of the different perspectives and sources and fields of knowledge it's admirable..I love this book, it's one of those books you feel sad you finished, and you feel like you've changed your perspective about so many things in life after reading..

Schulz breaks down rather complex philosophical and psychological issues to easily understood concepts with direct practical application. Further, she does this without removing the terminology, making it easy for people to continue studying long after they've finished this book. This is not a work of post-modern woowoo, where being wrong means no truth can ever be determined. Instead this is a nuanced understanding of our human lives, filled as they are with probabilistic knowledge rather than absolutist dogma, and where we can trust our minds to do what they do, create stories, not form perfect encyclopedic recall. Doing so allows Schulz to make a truly delightful and helpful contribution to our existence: that being wrong is not something to attack like some horrid beast but an inevitable aspect of our lives to embrace and seek always to see how our mental tendencies to error can be mitigated through understanding.

I've found it really hard to focus on this book, due to the fact that I don't know all of the terms she mentions. Unfortunately it seems to happen so frequently, that i'd have to have a dictionary next to me through the entire book.

A compelling aspect of Being Wrong is a set of arguments for the value of making errors or being wrong. An obsession with eliminating all errors may result in worse outcomes. For example, by taking risks and making some errors, you can learn much more than by sticking with safe decisions.One of the most interesting chapters covered areas of wrongness and criminology, starting off with the story of Steven Avery's 18-year sentence for a crime he didn't commit. That was followed by a note that he was later convicted of a murder, the only setback to date of the Wisconsin Innocence Project. Just two days after I read that chapter, I read an article about the Netflix documentary Making a Murderer that suggests that Avery might also be innocent of that crime, framed once again by the same bad cops."

85,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11297501-anna,5,"Kathryn Schulz argues passionately for the value of error. She shows us that not only is 'being wrong' a given in life, it is also a gift that has the power to transform our worldviews, our relationships, and ourselves. By drawing on philosophy, neuroscience, psycholoanalysts and a bit of common sense, she charts out the intellectual history of the shifting definitions and attitudes ascribed to being wrong and masterfully combines it with relevant & relatable examples from the present day. Schulz is a terrific thinker & and she writes with an elegant clarity and simplicity that make it nearly impossible to believe this is her first book (it seems as though she has done this before). Definitely one of the best things I have read in years. I am kind of in love with her now. Check out her Ted talks. "

Yet in education we can often inadvertently send a message that error is something to fear and avoid. This is an entertaining book which would have been enhanced by some cross-cultural examination - e.g. how is error conceived of in cultures with a very different sense of self? Nevertheless, it's a rare book that really is relevant to everyone - but since we've all been wrong, are currently wrong (though we don't yet know how) and will be wrong at some point in the future, we can all find something to learn and relate to here."

Also, David seemed to say that the problem was that it got bogged down in semantics and word games, but I actually thought there was more emphasis on neuro-biology with anecdotes thrown in. She wasn't always the most illuminating--do I really need to hear about the old woman/young woman picture one more time?--but I think it helps flesh out the constellation of issues around our own images of ourselves and our rightness.

Still an interesting topic and discussion, although I think I agree with an earlier reviewer that the section on Love was not really related to the rest of the book and not really apropos to the topic. I found the idea of pessimistic versus optimistic views of wrongness intriguing.

89,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3761228-adman,4,"Insightful, therapeutic, and hopeful, this book belies its title inasmuch as it surveys error not so much as frontier but heartland, nay, even as a sort of self-sown weed of fate that springs out of any coordinates in any plot of land where we happen to plant our flag of sureness. Schulz crosses all sorts of habitual borders within which we assume we have found safety from error (or accidents, or sin) and shows that we badly overestimate such security (victory, righteousness). She does so with compassion and zeal, and this time stays quite true to her title. It really is an adventure to her to knock down the ego's badly-constructed refuges and blaze a new trail for how we think and act. It is not a sadistic or despairing adventure, though: Schulz believes this eyes-open journey can be better for her and for all of us than how we usually get along in life.Schulz covers a lot of territory. Material and mental subjects are treated in this book, from, say, stepping on a rake to the meta-mistake of rationalizing the mishap (intentional, unavoidable, someone else's fault, or really anything else other than our own error). Schulz hikes around between memory and science, moves from the mundane to the dramatic, sits down to chat with romance, politics, and religion. She does all this with a diplomacy that surprised and gladdened me. Taking a page from her own reflections, I wonder how much her topical environment guided her and her editors to observe even-handedly and deliver cautious judgments. I wish other authors would take note. Any of us, really, who is less blatantly kept in line by whatever happens to be the topic at hand might benefit from Schulz's choice. Far too much intellectual and practical territory, in print or in person, is overrun far too often by refusing to be open and hospitable about error -- in ourselves or others.The trail in this book does not lead to a new shelter where we can rest again from the hard work of living. Instead, how we make and walk our path seems to be Schulz's source of inspiration. How much better off might we be if we acknowledge and respect our seemingly inexhaustible capacity for error? What if we did not retreat in either denial or despair? What if we ventured from time to time out of the refuge of the self into the crowd or, the reverse, from the masses into the self? What if we diverted some of our energy from purging and purifying and celebrated and cultivated the capacity of some institutions -- art, religion, certain forms of government -- to introduce us to our limitations?I was struck by how relationship-oriented this book is. I suppose Schulz might respond, how could it not be? First of all and obviously, the book is not part of me -- not in my traditional sense of self. As with any book, I am contending with a thing outside of me. The book is not Ms. Schulz either, but rather a shadow-her that emerged as she researched and wrote, a page-bound self she may have hoped would reflect her living self. This shadow then introduced me, the reader, to other various, astute shadow-thinkers, -scientists, -theologians, and -philosophers. They all shared with me their experiences of a gap between the self and the world and also shared their ill-begotten efforts to remedy that gap. What a wilderness of joining and separating this is to be lost in! So many glances and so many voices have been cast over so many stone walls that stretch and tangle across an endless, fog-shrouded pasture of human experience.Or, if you prefer Ms. Schulz's own, less striving metaphor, life is like a game of telephone, and we often can't make up our minds how to feel -- or what to do -- about the inevitable degeneration of the initial message (though of course no one alive can lay claim to that first message) and our powerlessness to steer that degeneration.Schulz really gets to the bottom of things when she observes that we are in search of wholeness more than we are in search of rightness. Like small children, we want unity between whatever we understand to be the self and the not-self. Error -- accident, sin, the comical-or-frustrating evolution of the message in telephone, defeat at the hands of one's pen, keyboard, numb fingers or mute tongue to put one's spirit in touch with one's blind and deaf neighbors -- represents our failure (or, as we often like to pretend, the failure of others) to be one.Fortunately, around this point in the book, Schulz made an unexpected digression to identify art with error. I have often been driven to desperation and something in the neighborhood of madness by my inability to write poems or stories that express what I wish to convey in details or intensity. What a welcome, unexpected relief it was to read John Keats (among others) describing imperfection as the necessary and desired product of artistic endeavor. Why? I don't recall the line of reasoning she establishes but in the moment that I am writing this, I take it to mean that artistic error is evidence -- of the self, one's hopes, one's intentions, one's peculiar, unrepeatable humanness. It is evidence precisely in its failure to convey exactly what I want it to -- evidence of difference, disunity, and striving toward something else.Schulz ultimately praises error -- with a bit of hedging and a bashful allusion to the Judeochristian story of the Fall. She is not quite comfortable with blatantly saying bad is good. She simply wishes to offer hope that error is not the harbinger of doom we take it -- and often make it -- to be. Instead, it is a circumstance, a lesson, a challenge, an invitation."

94,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72842365-ryan-derby-talbot,5,"Book summary: There are two fundamental and unavoidable components to being a human being: one is the need to chase the feeling of being right –– of having solidity and comfort in how we experience and respond to the world. The other is dealing with being wrong: dealing with error, the inevitable (and sometimes devastating) encounters we have when our expectations end up not aligning with reality. This book is about how we cannot escape either of these forces, and what results — negative or positive –– we can get from attempting to navigate this tension.Our need to chase being right –– and the resulting confidence, empowerment and belongingness (proxies for love?) that come with the feeling of rightness –– run up against and try to discount and rule out all the ways we inevitably can get things wrong: through illusions, false or overstated beliefs, skewed understandings of data, biases, social influences that lead us astray, emotional investments in perspectives or communities, the need to feel love, and flat out denial. We have difficulty even seeing wrongness in action in us (thinking we are far more objective and omniscient than we are), partly because it is such a fleeting force –– striking either too quickly or too slowly for us to catch it. Moreover, we struggle with identifying and acknowledging wrongness because of the strong emotional and cognitive forces (the desire for the feeling of certainty, the biases) that protect us, and keep us overwhelmingly invested in particular perspectives at the expense of other perspectives more aligned with reality. However much we may want to insist on the contrary or wish away our propensity to get things wrong (and we do this routinely), if we actually look at it, we invariably, deeply, absurdly, and inevitably get things wrong. Actually facing this truth doesn’t need to doom us, however, to defeated nihilism. The gap between our perspectives and the world make possible our two distinctly powerful human abilities: imagination and empathy. (Both are the result of allowing more than one perspective in a situation, of permitting a bigger notion than just a single “rightness.”) Successful incorporation and integration of our own wrongness –– which requires going through the excruciating emotional pain of admitting and allowing wrongness –– expands our sensitivities and perspectives as human beings. Collectively, our relationship with the gap also makes possible the two best products of human work, art and science. At root, error –– encountering the gap –– contributes to diversity, wonder, and richness of human experience. Alas, however, it will not ever lead us to a refuge of solid objectivity. Alas, there is no magic formula for dealing with the tensions between our desired rightness and inevitable wrongness. We can, however, recognize the growth and wondrous (mystical?) perspectives that are available in confronting their clash within us, the fundamental and inevitable experience of being a human being. "
95,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45191284-beth,4,"Kathryn Schulz delves into all the ways we can be wrong, explaining the strange whys and hows or error generation, denial, and results. The fact that the fabric of humanity is interwoven with error and inseparable from the state of being human is something abput which most of us live in denial. Schulz uncovers some of the universal characteristics of being wrong in a way that is more palatable than some of the ways society reminds us we are wrong. We are wired to resist the notion of our own fallibility, so this deft touch is necessary in order to circumvent our natural resistance. At the same time, she highlights the benefits of acknowledging and embracing our error in order to better our communities, our interpersonal relationships, and ourselves. For example:""This is one of the most powerful ways being wrong can transform us. It can help us be more compassionate people. Being right might be fun, but as we've seen, it has a tendency to bring out the worst in us. By contrast, being wrong might is often the furthest thing in the world from fun, and yet, in the end, it has the potential to bring out the best in us. Or, rather, to change us for the better.""This book now is added to 2 others - Tim Nochols' The Death of Expertise and Han Roslings's Factfulness- that I would recommend to any of my acquaintances who are trying to grapple with the perceived and real societal grievances battering for their attention. Schulz can get a little long-winded in places, but this is a deep topic and I found that if I hung with her she eventually led me to her point.One of my favorite passages is what I hope people gain from reading this book:""If you really want to be right, or at least improve the odds of being right, you have to start by acknowledging your fallibility. Deliberately seeking out your mistakes. And figuring out what caused you to make them."""

In all, Schulz does an admirable job of selecting her chosen anecdotes and ends up with a satisfying and thought-provoking read.NotesPerhaps the history of the errors of mankind, all things considered, is more valuable and interesting than that of their discoveries. Truth is uniform and narrow; it constantly exists, and does not seem to require so much an active energy, as a passive aptitude of the soul in order to encounter it. But error is endlessly diversified; it has no reality, but is the pure and simple creation of the mind that invents it. In this field the soul has room enough to expand herself, to display all her boundless faculties, and all her beautiful and interesting extravagancies and absurdities.—Benjamin Franklin______Many of the religious thinkers who tried to understand why we err found their answer at the gates of the Garden of Eden. Thus Thomas Aquinas, the thirteenth-century scholastic, held that we make mistakes because, when we were banished from paradise, we were cut off forever from direct access to divine truth. To Aquinas and many of his fellow theologians, our errors arise from the gap between our own limited and blemished minds and God’s unlimited and perfect omniscience.This same basic idea has received countless secular treatments as well. Plato thought that our primordial soul was at one with the universe, and that we only began to err when we took on our current physical form and forgot those cosmic truths. The Enlightenment philosopher John Locke thought that error seeped into our lives from the gap between the artificiality of words and the reality of the things they name—from the distance between an indescribable essence and the nearest sayable thing. The German philosopher Martin Heidegger thought that error could be explained by the fact that we live in time and space; because we are bound to a particular set of coordinates, we can’t rise above them and see reality as a whole, from a bird’s-eye (or God’s-eye) view. As different as these explanations seem, all these thinkers and many more conceived of error as arising from a gap: sometimes between the particular and the general, sometimes between words and things, sometimes between the present and the primeval, sometimes between the mortal and the divine—but in every case, and fundamentally, between our own mind and the rest of the world.For the most part, we spend our lives blithely ignoring this gap. And with good reason. Who wants to be reminded of the fall from grace, the separation from truth, the particular and limited nature of our existence? ______How can we square this feeling of rightness with the very real possibility that we are wrong? This is a question that haunts all of wrongology, not just errors of memory. The problem is suggested by the very phrase “the feeling of knowing.” In life, as in language, we begin with a psychological state (the “feeling” part) and end up with a claim about the truth (the “knowing” part). In other words, we feel that we are right because we feel that we are right: we take our own certainty as an indicator of accuracy. This isn’t completely foolish of us, since studies show that there is some correlation between confidence and correctness. But it isn’t completely foolproof, either. As the case of flashbulb memories makes clear, our certainty reflects the existence of a particularly vivid inner picture. But nothing in life guarantees that this picture reflects the real state of affairs.This reliance on a vivid inner picture helps explain why memories are particularly apt to trigger the feeling of knowing.______ The philosopher Avishai Marga lit put this nicely. ""It is not the case that I am caught in a web of beliefs,"" he wrote. "" . . . Rather, I am caught in a network of witnesses."" Our relationships to these ""witnesses""-the people and institutions that attest to the truth of various beliefs-predate and determine our reaction to whatever information they supply. As Margalit said, ""my belief in [one of these witnesses] is prior to my belief that (what she says is true)."" Belief in is prior: however far this might be from our sense of how we should form our ideas about the world, it is the first principle of how we actually do so. All of us are caught in Margalit's ""networks of witnesses""­ not just in one but in many, and not just from time to time but all the time, from the moment we are born until the day we die. As countless commen­tators have observed, this lends to our beliefs an element of the arbitrary. Montaigne, for instance, remarked that people ""are swept [into a belief]­ either by the custom of their country or by their parental upbringing, or by chance-as by a tempest, without judgment or choice, indeed most often before the age of discretion.""______These latter­ day zealots have hailed from many different backgrounds and held many different beliefs. At heart, though, and paradoxically, they have all shared a single conviction: that they and they alone are in possession of the truth. (The very word ""zealot"" comes from a Greek root meaning to be jealous of the truth-to guard it as your own.) What zealots have in common, then, is the absolute conviction that they are right. In fact, of all the symbolic ones and zeros that extremists use to write their ideological binary codes­ us/them, same/different, good/evil-the fundamental one is right/wrong. Zealotry demands a complete rejection of the possibility of error. The conviction that we cannot possibly be wrong: this is certainty.______[O]ur be­liefs come in bundles. That makes it hard to remove or replace one without affecting the others-and it gets harder as the belief in question gets more central. In this respect, beliefs are like the beams in a building or the words in a sentence: you can't eliminate one and expect the fundamental sound­ ness or fundamental meaning of the overall system to remain unchanged. As a result, being wrong sometimes triggers a cascade of transformations so extensive that the belief system that emerges afterward bears almost no resemblance to its predecessor. ______You fight your superficiality, your shallowness, so as to try to come at people without unreal expectations, without an overload of bias or hope or arrogance, as untanklike as you can be . . . and yet you never fail to get them wrong. You might as well have the brain of a tank. You get them wrong before you meet them: you get them wrong while you're with them and then you get home to tell somebody else about the meeting and you get them all wrong again. Since the same generally goes for them with you, the whole thing is really a dazzling illusion empty of all perception, an astonishing farce of misperception. And yet what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people, which gets bled of the significance we think it has and takes on a significance that is ludicrous, so ill equipped are we all to envision one another's interior workings and invisible aims? . . . The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway. It's getting them wrong that is living, getting them wrong and wrong and wrong and then, on careful reconsideration, getting them wrong again . That's how we know we are alive: we're wrong. —Phillip Roth, American Pastoral______We go to our jobs, stop by the bar on our way home, hang out with our friends, raise our kids­ because these things are the stuff of life, to be sure, but also because they are strategies for keeping the terror of isolation in check. Soren Kierkeg­aard, that existentialist before there was existentialism, compared us in this respect to those early American pioneers who banged on their pots and pans all night long, hoping to keep the wolves at bay. Keeping wolves at bay is a start. But of all our ways of dealing with this rift, our favorite by far is the one that promises to eliminate it entirely­ to transform our desert island into a tropical paradise, our fundamental separation into ecstatic union. This strategy is our last, best hope for escap­ing the loneliness of existence and giving despair the slip. I am talking, of course, about love.______The idea that we possess a true self serves a hugely important psycho­ logical purpose. If we have an essential and unchanging identity, one we are destined to discover sooner or later, then the beliefs we hold, the choices we make, the person we become-none of this happens by chance. Instead, the entire course of our lives is inevitable, dictated by the certainty that our real self will eventually surface...This narrative is appealing for the same reason that it is problematic: within it, we can do no wrong. Our false beliefs were foreordained, our ap­parent errors occurred strictly in the service of a larger truth. This idea is made explicit in the religious affirmation that ""God makes no mistakes"": even the seeming trials and blunders of our lives are part of a larger plan: As that implies, stories starring a true self are teleological; we end up exactly where we are meant to be. This, too, is both an attraction and a weakness of the idea of an essential self. It suggests that our lives are deterministic, that yesterday's convictions-which we thought we chose based on their intellectual, emotional, or spiritual merits-were merely a trap into which we were lured for the benefit of some predetermined future self. Whatever meaning or worth our past might have had on its own terms is effectively written out of existence. Even more problematically, the idea of a true self suggests that we will never undergo momentous upheaval again. How could we? Having finally discovered who we really are and have always been, there is no further transformation available to us. If the self is constantly changing, then we can constantly feel our way forward, constantly become someone new-but if each of us possesses a fixed essence, then we can only return to it. Accord­ingly, our past departure from that essential self can only be a single and inexplicable aberration, associated as often as not with betrayal, transgres­sion, and sin. (Recall Chambers denouncing Communism, his erstwhile faith, as ""evil, absolute evil."") Singular, aberrational, transgressive, evil: we've seen this constellation of ideas before. This is the pessimistic model of wrongness, in which error is an unwelcome anomaly, a mark of our exile from the sacred realm of truth. Helpfully, this reminds us that we have another model for making sense of wrongness as well-one that casts a different light not only on our errors but also on ourselves. Here, wrongness is a natural and ongoing process, and we are not deformed but transformed by it. ______""The main in­terest in life and work,"" said Foucault, ""is to become someone else that you were not in the beginning."" Such transformations don't only come about through wrongness, of course-but wrongness is always an opportunity for such transformations. ______I was of three minds, Like a tree In which there are three blackbirds. —Wallace Stevens, 13 Ways of Looking at a Blackbird______His desire to banish art is part of a long and often sinister tradition (which we glimpsed earlier) of trying to create ideal societies through eradicating error in all its forms. All of those disgruntled undergraduates, meanwhile, are motivated in part-whether they know it or not-by the optimistic model of wrongness. They recognize, as most of us do, not just the legitimacy but also the poten­tial beauty and power of individual, skewed, inaccurate representations of reality. In this model, the link between error and art i s not a n indictment of art but a defense of error. Cut off from the absolute essence of things-that ideal form that Plato felt existed only in the mind of God-our separate, subjective consciousnesses look around and see, instead, Water Lilies, or Starry Night, or Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Likewise, we can make Beowulf and Star Wars and Horton Hears a Who! for the same reason we can make mistakes: because, as I said earlier, we are capable of conjuring the world not just as it is, but also as it is not. Our capacity to err is inseparable from our imagination.______The most famous formulation of this relationship between art, doubt, and error comes from the Romantic poet John Keats. He had been talking over various matters with a friend, he wrote to his brothers in a letter in 1 817, ""and at once it struck me,"" what quality went to form a Man of Achievement especially in lit­erature & which Shakespeare possessed so enormously-! mean Negative Capability, that is when man is capable of being in un­certainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact & reason.Keats's attitude toward uncertainty-and, for that matter, toward ""fact & reason""-is not the common one. He embraced unknowability and falli­bility, but not for the utilitarian purposes we saw in the last chapter. There, the point of embracing error was to curtail it-a kind of homeopathic rem­ edy for wrongness. But Keats wasn't interested in remedying wrongness. He recognized error and art as conjoined twins, born of the same place and vital to one another's existence. In life as in linguistics, art is joined at the root to artificial-to the not-true, the unreal-just as a fiction is at once a creation and a falsehood. ______But unlike androids, we humans do not nor­ mally self-destruct in the face of our mistakes. On the contrary: we self­ create, and self-recreate. This idea of self-creation suggests something else important about error. Being wrong doesn't just make us human in general; it also helps make each of us the specific person we are. In our inability to get things exactly right, in the idiosyncrasies of our private visions of the world, the outline of selfhood appears. This is what Benjamin Franklin was getting at in the quote I used as an epigraph to this book. Error, he wrote, is ""the pure and simple creation of the mind that invents it,"" a place where ""the soul has room enough to expand herself."" Mistakes, he ·meant, are the evidence and expression of an individual identity. This is an idea with deep and important roots in our intellectual history. It is, in essence, the crucial insight of evolutionary theory. Because of errors in the replication of genetic sequences, we wind up with variation among individual members of a species; and because of that variation, the species as a whole can adapt and survive. Such errors literally keep their hosts alive. A population that is too small or too homogenous to support significant genetic variation is doomed. For every species, then, error is a mechanism of survival and change. For us human organisms, with our richer relation­ ship to wrongness, mistakes enable not only our biological evolution but our social, emotional, and intellectual evolution as well. And wrongness also allows us to thrive in another way. I began this book by noting that we think of being right as essential to our survival and happiness, but in one key respect, nothing could be further from the truth. Countless studies have shown that people who suffer from depression have more accurate worldviews than nondepressed people. Depressed people do not nurture the cheering illusion that they can control the course of their lives. They rarely possess the conviction, so common in the rest of us, that they are above average in virtually every respect. And they understand, all too acutely, the basic conditions of existence: that their lifespan is just a brief blip in the cold sweep of history, that suffering is real and ongoing, that they and all the people they love are going to die. That outlook is known as depressive realism. Depressed people might be unhappy, but­ when it comes to these big-picture, existential matters-they are generally more right than the rest of us. It scarcely requires saying that this kind of rightness is not fun. ""To see the world as it really is is devastating and terrifying,"" wrote the philosopher Ernest Becker. "" . . . It makes thoughtless living in the world of men an im­possibility. It places a trembling animal at the mercy of the entire cosmos and the problem of the meaning of it."" As that indicates, the correlation between accuracy and depression runs both ways: people who are depressed tend to perceive the harsher realities of life more clearly, and people who clearly perceive those harsh realities tend to be (or to get) depressed. In an odd reversal of the usual state of affairs, when it comes to these existential issues, the bigger and more important the belief, the less it pays to be right. That's why, as I've said, the goal of therapy isn't necessarily to make our beliefs more accurate; it is to make them more functional. Ronnie Janoff­ Bulman, the psychologist, has even argued that ""a key to the good life might well be illusions at our deepest, most generalized level of assump­ tions and accuracy at the most specific, least abstract levels."" (Fortunately for us, these two perspectives are compatible: research suggests that people who possess a generally positive outlook are better at acknowledging their everyday errors and changing their minds.) If excessive accuracy in our self-image and worldview is correlated with depression, the opposite is true, too. Sometimes, being wrong makes us happy. Think of Don Quixote, that exemplary knight errant, who lent his name to the condition of being pleasantly deluded. "

It very much is, but just saying that is a bit of a cop-out. The book is a brilliantly written examination of the concept of error from every perspective imaginable. Schulz explores wrongness as an outside observer, a philosopher, a victim and a compassionate friend. By so fully embracing the idea on every level, she synthesizes a unified thesis from many disparate parts and supports every conclusion she draws with the best in logic and anecdote.At the core of Being Wrong is a suggestion. Not advice, so much as a recommendation for people interested in living a little better. Embrace your mistakes. It’s not about making mistakes and not feeling bad about it. Schulz wants us all to live with our errors a little more and not shove them away in a flurry of denial and justification. She goes on to examine the reasons why we are so adverse to being wrong, from the biological, (it doesn’t make evolutionary sense to be uncertain about anything) to the social, (our culture rejects leader figures who are indecisive) to the psychological. (depressed people have much more accurate worldviews than balanced personalties)Schulz is at her strongest when she is telling a story. The highlights of the books are the anecdotes she uses to set up each of her chapters. The stories include everything from Alan Greenspan’s unwavering faith in the economy proved wrong, to the touching story of an Exalted Cyclops of the KKK becoming one of the frontline fighters in the war for desegregated schools. Schulz has a deft hand for splicing these stories with the philosophical and scientific meat that connect them back to the reader’s everyday experience. She does tend to get bogged down in some of the dense history of the topic, but the frequent footnotes and witty asides help to break these thick sections up a little.The text itself induces stumbling, at least for me. It’s probably because the subject matter makes me paranoid that I’ve missed something, or misinterpreted a critical conclusion. To that end, I’d really recommend reading this book in chapters, rather than tackling the entire thing all at once. The writing lends it self to easy sectioning and while reading order is important, the ideas are all pretty sticky, which makes it easier to spread over time.Close to the end of the third section, Schulz examines the story of Penny Beerntsen, a woman who was raped and ended up falsely accusing another man of the crime. He was eventually proved innocent, but in the interim the woman had struggled to get closure in other ways. She wanted to understand the reasons people did horrible things to each other. To do this, she volunteered in prisons and really got to know the realities of being a convicted criminal in the United States. When the verdict came down proving that she had identified the wrong man, she was horrified, but she instantly accepted her mistake and wanted to somehow make up for it. Rather than try to deny her fault, she only sought to improve the life of the man she had thrown into prison unjustly.While this is an extreme example, I can’t think of a better example of being a truly human person. It would be an exaggeration to say I want be like Penny, but her example is one that I can value as someone who can be wrong and can be stupid about it. And really, we all fall into that category sometimes. Anyone who has ever been a critic of any kind knows the giddy thrill of being unquestionably right. (you cannot successfully argue against opinion) It is never a bad thing to gain a little perspective on that feeling, and that’s just what this book has allowed me to do."

It is a neglected and deeply human attribute: being wrong, feeling wrong, discovering one's wrongness, changing as a result—or, more usually, denying it, ducking and running from the acknowledgement of error. I was fascinated, particularly so once I got through the first chapters. The writing is a curious mix of academic rigour and convivial, almost conversational, English. I found the book deeply engrossing, and it gave me perspective about my own error-filled journey. I finished the book a few days ago, and I am still turning it over in my mind. Highly recommend."

Everybody makes mistakes and many people talk like that is all they do, ""Oh I am always messing up"" they might say. Now try reflecting on the moment when you realized that you were wrong about something. Don't reflect on your past beliefs, whether trivial or not, but rather think of that moment where you shifted from knowing that you were right to knowing that you were not. How did that moment feel when you realized that you were wrong, not when you were actually wrong but when you realized you were wrong?There isn't an external force that can inform us of the correctness or incorrectness of our beliefs a priori and therefore prevent us from making minor or grave mistakes. We have to force ourselves to reckon our beliefs with the external world and when we find our beliefs at odds with the world, it hurts. When we are wrong we feel alone, the moment we recognize our errors is "". . . a moment of alienation, both from ourselves and from [our] previously convincing vision of the world.""This profound and well grounded skepticism about things that feel so right and natural to us is deeply troubling to me. Schulz's prose is very good and is a joy to read and quote* but I have to admit that reflecting on our tendency to err, often in disastrous ways, is unsettling. I think it is disturbing because it goes against our nature not only to know but also to be known. In the current american culture the sexual attraction to others is pretty overt and therefore almost ever present in our minds. But I think we forget about the attractions we have to others than have nothing to do with sex or physical appearances at all. A meeting of the minds is a truly rewarding experience wherein our views of the world are validated and shared. We are in agreement with others about being correct and that is deeply satisfying. Again, Schulz says it a bit better:“Think about how distressing it is to feel misunderstood, and how frustrating it is when someone believes something about you—that you’re irresponsible or can’t handle commitment or don’t pull your weight at work—that you think is untrue. Conversely, there are few things more gratifying than the feeling that someone deeply understands us. In fact, as we are about to see, this feeling of being of being “gotten” is the sine qua non of our most important relationships, and the very hallmark of being in love.”[4]Full review here:http://wp.me/p6r7eE-2P"
106,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8744761-william,5,"This is an impressive and surprisingly enjoyable book. While Schulz is a journalist, the work seems closer to scholarly than journalistic, though it has a lighter touch than scholarship typically achieves. In reading it, don't skip the foot- and endnotes. There is often good stuff there.I experienced ""Being Wrong"" on three levels, and it works exceptionally well on two of them. To begin with, Schulz makes a compelling case that being wrong is by and large more a constructive thing than a negative one. Emotion, creativity and humor, she points out, draw heavily on error to be compelling. While it is explicitly not her intention, there is a self-help aspect to the book which works well. It was impossible for me to read it and not say to myself: ""Hey, lighten up. You don;t have to get everything right the first -- or second, or third -- time.The second level on which i found the book effective is just as good reading. Schultz writes well and with impressive wit. This book would be a good read if you even skipped the message and just read the stories which appear so frequently. My guess is I remember some of the stories better -- and will do so longer -- than the main purpose of the book.Where I find the book a little less satisfying is in the central argument. It's meticulous, sometimes to the point of tediousness. Who knew there was so much to write on this subject? And there are occasional generalizations with which I disagree. (1) We all disdain undecided voters. (177) Huh? (2) ""We almost never find ourselves between theories"" (186). Maybe it's just me, but there are frequently issues on which I have not made up my mind. (3) [quoting LaRochefoucauld] ""Everyone complains about their memory; no one complains about their judgment."" It seems to me all of us have had long talks with friends upset because they keep making the same mistake over and over, and we can often feel that way about ourselves as well.But regardless of my discomfort with some of the logic and a case which seems occasionally overstated, I found the book personally useful, certainly interesting and most of all both educational and entertaining."

It covers a wide-ranging host of topics on error, how it happens and particularly how we respond to being wrong. Her basic premise is that there are two models of error. One model propounds error as something to be avoided at all costs as it provides no benefits, only embarrassment and shame. The second, which Schulz celebrates, is that error is common and natural. It's benefit is that we can learn, grow and change as a result. It's a very positive spin on a topic that has been dealt with by Plato and other classic writers, Augustine and Aquinas, Enlightenment thinkers, Freud and many other comtemporary writers. Schulz is a wonderful story teller and her stories are the highlight of the book. She can be slightly irritating as a writer when she continually states that the topic ""is something I'll deal with later."" This ""pre-figuring"" happens at least 20 times and becomes wearisome. Hopefully a future editor will do a better job of tightening up this habit. Overall and beyond my pettiness, I heartily recommend this as a wonderful, leisurely read in which you will certainly learn something about history, literature and yourself."

It kinda took me 2 hours to finish 30 pages or so.. *english is my 2nd language here*.. The book starts so well into its core concept and it keeps going so thoroughly discussing the ideas and concepts. sometimes it goes all the way to the core of philosophy and logic and all these mind twisting concepts of error and wrong and emotion and perception..At other chapters you feel like the introduction of the chapter never ends and takes so so long it kinda makes you lost and bored into it.. at others, it's like you're in a river of fluid stream of ideas so connected you don't feel yourself in its beauty.. but if there's one thing to notice, it's gonna be the effort the author put in compiling all the MASSIVE information of the different perspectives and sources and fields of knowledge it's admirable..I love this book, it's one of those books you feel sad you finished, and you feel like you've changed your perspective about so many things in life after reading.. This is how I felt, at least.. thank you Kathryn."

Schulz breaks down rather complex philosophical and psychological issues to easily understood concepts with direct practical application. Further, she does this without removing the terminology, making it easy for people to continue studying long after they've finished this book. This is not a work of post-modern woowoo, where being wrong means no truth can ever be determined. Instead this is a nuanced understanding of our human lives, filled as they are with probabilistic knowledge rather than absolutist dogma, and where we can trust our minds to do what they do, create stories, not form perfect encyclopedic recall. Doing so allows Schulz to make a truly delightful and helpful contribution to our existence: that being wrong is not something to attack like some horrid beast but an inevitable aspect of our lives to embrace and seek always to see how our mental tendencies to error can be mitigated through understanding. "
112,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1907832-carlene,3,"I'm sticking this on my ""read"" shelf, even though I didn't finish it.I'm intrigued of the idea of the book, from a completely psychological standpoint. However, I don't know if the book is written above my intelligence, if I'm not understanding some of what I'm reading because I'm in a medicinal fog, or some combination of the two. I've found it really hard to focus on this book, due to the fact that I don't know all of the terms she mentions. Unfortunately it seems to happen so frequently, that i'd have to have a dictionary next to me through the entire book. Honestly, that's just not something I really want to do at this point.Maybe eventually, I'll be able to give the book my full attention, but for now, I'm unable to even get to chapter 2. (this is in no way, me blaming the author. I take full responsibility for not comprehending things)Edit: I had forgotten to add that I received this book free, from Goodreads."

A compelling aspect of Being Wrong is a set of arguments for the value of making errors or being wrong. An obsession with eliminating all errors may result in worse outcomes. For example, by taking risks and making some errors, you can learn much more than by sticking with safe decisions.One of the most interesting chapters covered areas of wrongness and criminology, starting off with the story of Steven Avery's 18-year sentence for a crime he didn't commit. That was followed by a note that he was later convicted of a murder, the only setback to date of the Wisconsin Innocence Project. Just two days after I read that chapter, I read an article about the Netflix documentary Making a Murderer that suggests that Avery might also be innocent of that crime, framed once again by the same bad cops."

Odds: 55 copies available, 1006 people requesting.There is something wrong with the table of contents in my copy of the book. I wonder if it's there intentionally, just to see how many people would notice and point out the error. Oh, scratch that! I just noticed on the back it says ""uncorrected proof""; they are probably going to fix it before it's out.Anyway, I'm finding this book very readable, and interesting, and thought-provoking. I have a list of things that I want to quote and this is all just from the first couple of chapters, haha... This is another book that reminds me of Saint Thomas Aquinas: The Dumb Ox; it directly refers to Thomas Aquinas in a few places. "
115,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11297501-anna,5,"Kathryn Schulz argues passionately for the value of error. She shows us that not only is 'being wrong' a given in life, it is also a gift that has the power to transform our worldviews, our relationships, and ourselves. By drawing on philosophy, neuroscience, psycholoanalysts and a bit of common sense, she charts out the intellectual history of the shifting definitions and attitudes ascribed to being wrong and masterfully combines it with relevant & relatable examples from the present day. Schulz is a terrific thinker & and she writes with an elegant clarity and simplicity that make it nearly impossible to believe this is her first book (it seems as though she has done this before). Definitely one of the best things I have read in years. I am kind of in love with her now. Check out her Ted talks. "
116,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826906-laura,4,"I saw the author speak (very entertainingly) at an education conference, which was appropriate since - as she argues persuasively - being wrong is an inextricable part of learning and imagination. Yet in education we can often inadvertently send a message that error is something to fear and avoid. This is an entertaining book which would have been enhanced by some cross-cultural examination - e.g. how is error conceived of in cultures with a very different sense of self? Nevertheless, it's a rare book that really is relevant to everyone - but since we've all been wrong, are currently wrong (though we don't yet know how) and will be wrong at some point in the future, we can all find something to learn and relate to here."

It seems that much of the firepower is arraigned towards the writing style, especially the mix of academic language with the more colloquial. I admit I'm a sucker for that mix, so I've enjoyed her style mostly. Also, David seemed to say that the problem was that it got bogged down in semantics and word games, but I actually thought there was more emphasis on neuro-biology with anecdotes thrown in. She wasn't always the most illuminating--do I really need to hear about the old woman/young woman picture one more time?--but I think it helps flesh out the constellation of issues around our own images of ourselves and our rightness. At least, it makes my staff meeting make a whole lot more sense."

Still an interesting topic and discussion, although I think I agree with an earlier reviewer that the section on Love was not really related to the rest of the book and not really apropos to the topic. I found the idea of pessimistic versus optimistic views of wrongness intriguing. The author did inject some mild humor throughout the book that made the book more fun to read without being over the top or distracting. This review is based on a review copy received for free through the Goodreads giveaway program."
119,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3761228-adman,4,"Insightful, therapeutic, and hopeful, this book belies its title inasmuch as it surveys error not so much as frontier but heartland, nay, even as a sort of self-sown weed of fate that springs out of any coordinates in any plot of land where we happen to plant our flag of sureness. Schulz crosses all sorts of habitual borders within which we assume we have found safety from error (or accidents, or sin) and shows that we badly overestimate such security (victory, righteousness). She does so with compassion and zeal, and this time stays quite true to her title. It really is an adventure to her to knock down the ego's badly-constructed refuges and blaze a new trail for how we think and act. It is not a sadistic or despairing adventure, though: Schulz believes this eyes-open journey can be better for her and for all of us than how we usually get along in life.Schulz covers a lot of territory. Material and mental subjects are treated in this book, from, say, stepping on a rake to the meta-mistake of rationalizing the mishap (intentional, unavoidable, someone else's fault, or really anything else other than our own error). Schulz hikes around between memory and science, moves from the mundane to the dramatic, sits down to chat with romance, politics, and religion. She does all this with a diplomacy that surprised and gladdened me. Taking a page from her own reflections, I wonder how much her topical environment guided her and her editors to observe even-handedly and deliver cautious judgments. I wish other authors would take note. Any of us, really, who is less blatantly kept in line by whatever happens to be the topic at hand might benefit from Schulz's choice. Far too much intellectual and practical territory, in print or in person, is overrun far too often by refusing to be open and hospitable about error -- in ourselves or others.The trail in this book does not lead to a new shelter where we can rest again from the hard work of living. Instead, how we make and walk our path seems to be Schulz's source of inspiration. How much better off might we be if we acknowledge and respect our seemingly inexhaustible capacity for error? What if we did not retreat in either denial or despair? What if we ventured from time to time out of the refuge of the self into the crowd or, the reverse, from the masses into the self? What if we diverted some of our energy from purging and purifying and celebrated and cultivated the capacity of some institutions -- art, religion, certain forms of government -- to introduce us to our limitations?I was struck by how relationship-oriented this book is. I suppose Schulz might respond, how could it not be? First of all and obviously, the book is not part of me -- not in my traditional sense of self. As with any book, I am contending with a thing outside of me. The book is not Ms. Schulz either, but rather a shadow-her that emerged as she researched and wrote, a page-bound self she may have hoped would reflect her living self. This shadow then introduced me, the reader, to other various, astute shadow-thinkers, -scientists, -theologians, and -philosophers. They all shared with me their experiences of a gap between the self and the world and also shared their ill-begotten efforts to remedy that gap. What a wilderness of joining and separating this is to be lost in! So many glances and so many voices have been cast over so many stone walls that stretch and tangle across an endless, fog-shrouded pasture of human experience.Or, if you prefer Ms. Schulz's own, less striving metaphor, life is like a game of telephone, and we often can't make up our minds how to feel -- or what to do -- about the inevitable degeneration of the initial message (though of course no one alive can lay claim to that first message) and our powerlessness to steer that degeneration.Schulz really gets to the bottom of things when she observes that we are in search of wholeness more than we are in search of rightness. Like small children, we want unity between whatever we understand to be the self and the not-self. Error -- accident, sin, the comical-or-frustrating evolution of the message in telephone, defeat at the hands of one's pen, keyboard, numb fingers or mute tongue to put one's spirit in touch with one's blind and deaf neighbors -- represents our failure (or, as we often like to pretend, the failure of others) to be one.Fortunately, around this point in the book, Schulz made an unexpected digression to identify art with error. I have often been driven to desperation and something in the neighborhood of madness by my inability to write poems or stories that express what I wish to convey in details or intensity. What a welcome, unexpected relief it was to read John Keats (among others) describing imperfection as the necessary and desired product of artistic endeavor. Why? I don't recall the line of reasoning she establishes but in the moment that I am writing this, I take it to mean that artistic error is evidence -- of the self, one's hopes, one's intentions, one's peculiar, unrepeatable humanness. It is evidence precisely in its failure to convey exactly what I want it to -- evidence of difference, disunity, and striving toward something else.Schulz ultimately praises error -- with a bit of hedging and a bashful allusion to the Judeochristian story of the Fall. She is not quite comfortable with blatantly saying bad is good. She simply wishes to offer hope that error is not the harbinger of doom we take it -- and often make it -- to be. Instead, it is a circumstance, a lesson, a challenge, an invitation."

Takes Kuhn, Kahneman, and Jervis a step further into practical discussion and brainstorming. While the author often takes self-involved tangents on occasion, this book must be included in the discussion of bias, error, and decision making. Reading this book takes some patience since the author explores in and around her thoughts regarding ""wrongology;"" however, it is worth taking the journey with her. Definitely recommend this book as an accompaniment to Blink or Thinking, Fast and Slow. "

124,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72842365-ryan-derby-talbot,5,"Book summary: There are two fundamental and unavoidable components to being a human being: one is the need to chase the feeling of being right –– of having solidity and comfort in how we experience and respond to the world. The other is dealing with being wrong: dealing with error, the inevitable (and sometimes devastating) encounters we have when our expectations end up not aligning with reality. This book is about how we cannot escape either of these forces, and what results — negative or positive –– we can get from attempting to navigate this tension.Our need to chase being right –– and the resulting confidence, empowerment and belongingness (proxies for love?) that come with the feeling of rightness –– run up against and try to discount and rule out all the ways we inevitably can get things wrong: through illusions, false or overstated beliefs, skewed understandings of data, biases, social influences that lead us astray, emotional investments in perspectives or communities, the need to feel love, and flat out denial. We have difficulty even seeing wrongness in action in us (thinking we are far more objective and omniscient than we are), partly because it is such a fleeting force –– striking either too quickly or too slowly for us to catch it. Moreover, we struggle with identifying and acknowledging wrongness because of the strong emotional and cognitive forces (the desire for the feeling of certainty, the biases) that protect us, and keep us overwhelmingly invested in particular perspectives at the expense of other perspectives more aligned with reality. However much we may want to insist on the contrary or wish away our propensity to get things wrong (and we do this routinely), if we actually look at it, we invariably, deeply, absurdly, and inevitably get things wrong. Actually facing this truth doesn’t need to doom us, however, to defeated nihilism. The gap between our perspectives and the world make possible our two distinctly powerful human abilities: imagination and empathy. (Both are the result of allowing more than one perspective in a situation, of permitting a bigger notion than just a single “rightness.”) Successful incorporation and integration of our own wrongness –– which requires going through the excruciating emotional pain of admitting and allowing wrongness –– expands our sensitivities and perspectives as human beings. Collectively, our relationship with the gap also makes possible the two best products of human work, art and science. At root, error –– encountering the gap –– contributes to diversity, wonder, and richness of human experience. Alas, however, it will not ever lead us to a refuge of solid objectivity. Alas, there is no magic formula for dealing with the tensions between our desired rightness and inevitable wrongness. We can, however, recognize the growth and wondrous (mystical?) perspectives that are available in confronting their clash within us, the fundamental and inevitable experience of being a human being.

125,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45191284-beth,4,"Kathryn Schulz delves into all the ways we can be wrong, explaining the strange whys and hows or error generation, denial, and results. The fact that the fabric of humanity is interwoven with error and inseparable from the state of being human is something abput which most of us live in denial. Schulz uncovers some of the universal characteristics of being wrong in a way that is more palatable than some of the ways society reminds us we are wrong. We are wired to resist the notion of our own fallibility, so this deft touch is necessary in order to circumvent our natural resistance. At the same time, she highlights the benefits of acknowledging and embracing our error in order to better our communities, our interpersonal relationships, and ourselves. For example:""This is one of the most powerful ways being wrong can transform us. It can help us be more compassionate people. Being right might be fun, but as we've seen, it has a tendency to bring out the worst in us. By contrast, being wrong might is often the furthest thing in the world from fun, and yet, in the end, it has the potential to bring out the best in us. Or, rather, to change us for the better.""This book now is added to 2 others - Tim Nochols' The Death of Expertise and Han Roslings's Factfulness- that I would recommend to any of my acquaintances who are trying to grapple with the perceived and real societal grievances battering for their attention. Schulz can get a little long-winded in places, but this is a deep topic and I found that if I hung with her she eventually led me to her point.One of my favorite passages is what I hope people gain from reading this book:""If you really want to be right, or at least improve the odds of being right, you have to start by acknowledging your fallibility. Deliberately seeking out your mistakes. And figuring out what caused you to make them."""
126,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3532236-charlie,4,"Schulz offers a powerful introduction to the examined life. She explores with wit, charm, and tenacity the ways we go wrong in our thinking and, what's more, the ways we go wrong in our thinking about going wrong.

In all, Schulz does an admirable job of selecting her chosen anecdotes and ends up with a satisfying and thought-provoking read.NotesPerhaps the history of the errors of mankind, all things considered, is more valuable and interesting than that of their discoveries. Truth is uniform and narrow; it constantly exists, and does not seem to require so much an active energy, as a passive aptitude of the soul in order to encounter it. But error is endlessly diversified; it has no reality, but is the pure and simple creation of the mind that invents it. In this field the soul has room enough to expand herself, to display all her boundless faculties, and all her beautiful and interesting extravagancies and absurdities.—Benjamin Franklin______Many of the religious thinkers who tried to understand why we err found their answer at the gates of the Garden of Eden. Thus Thomas Aquinas, the thirteenth-century scholastic, held that we make mistakes because, when we were banished from paradise, we were cut off forever from direct access to divine truth. To Aquinas and many of his fellow theologians, our errors arise from the gap between our own limited and blemished minds and God’s unlimited and perfect omniscience.This same basic idea has received countless secular treatments as well. Plato thought that our primordial soul was at one with the universe, and that we only began to err when we took on our current physical form and forgot those cosmic truths. The Enlightenment philosopher John Locke thought that error seeped into our lives from the gap between the artificiality of words and the reality of the things they name—from the distance between an indescribable essence and the nearest sayable thing. The German philosopher Martin Heidegger thought that error could be explained by the fact that we live in time and space; because we are bound to a particular set of coordinates, we can’t rise above them and see reality as a whole, from a bird’s-eye (or God’s-eye) view. As different as these explanations seem, all these thinkers and many more conceived of error as arising from a gap: sometimes between the particular and the general, sometimes between words and things, sometimes between the present and the primeval, sometimes between the mortal and the divine—but in every case, and fundamentally, between our own mind and the rest of the world.For the most part, we spend our lives blithely ignoring this gap. And with good reason. Who wants to be reminded of the fall from grace, the separation from truth, the particular and limited nature of our existence? ______How can we square this feeling of rightness with the very real possibility that we are wrong? This is a question that haunts all of wrongology, not just errors of memory. The problem is suggested by the very phrase “the feeling of knowing.” In life, as in language, we begin with a psychological state (the “feeling” part) and end up with a claim about the truth (the “knowing” part). In other words, we feel that we are right because we feel that we are right: we take our own certainty as an indicator of accuracy. This isn’t completely foolish of us, since studies show that there is some correlation between confidence and correctness. But it isn’t completely foolproof, either. As the case of flashbulb memories makes clear, our certainty reflects the existence of a particularly vivid inner picture. But nothing in life guarantees that this picture reflects the real state of affairs.This reliance on a vivid inner picture helps explain why memories are particularly apt to trigger the feeling of knowing.______ The philosopher Avishai Marga lit put this nicely. ""It is not the case that I am caught in a web of beliefs,"" he wrote. "" . . . Rather, I am caught in a network of witnesses."" Our relationships to these ""witnesses""-the people and institutions that attest to the truth of various beliefs-predate and determine our reaction to whatever information they supply. As Margalit said, ""my belief in [one of these witnesses] is prior to my belief that (what she says is true)."" Belief in is prior: however far this might be from our sense of how we should form our ideas about the world, it is the first principle of how we actually do so. All of us are caught in Margalit's ""networks of witnesses""­ not just in one but in many, and not just from time to time but all the time, from the moment we are born until the day we die. As countless commen­tators have observed, this lends to our beliefs an element of the arbitrary. Montaigne, for instance, remarked that people ""are swept [into a belief]­ either by the custom of their country or by their parental upbringing, or by chance-as by a tempest, without judgment or choice, indeed most often before the age of discretion.""______These latter­ day zealots have hailed from many different backgrounds and held many different beliefs. At heart, though, and paradoxically, they have all shared a single conviction: that they and they alone are in possession of the truth. (The very word ""zealot"" comes from a Greek root meaning to be jealous of the truth-to guard it as your own.) What zealots have in common, then, is the absolute conviction that they are right. In fact, of all the symbolic ones and zeros that extremists use to write their ideological binary codes­ us/them, same/different, good/evil-the fundamental one is right/wrong. Zealotry demands a complete rejection of the possibility of error. The conviction that we cannot possibly be wrong: this is certainty.______[O]ur be­liefs come in bundles. That makes it hard to remove or replace one without affecting the others-and it gets harder as the belief in question gets more central. In this respect, beliefs are like the beams in a building or the words in a sentence: you can't eliminate one and expect the fundamental sound­ ness or fundamental meaning of the overall system to remain unchanged. As a result, being wrong sometimes triggers a cascade of transformations so extensive that the belief system that emerges afterward bears almost no resemblance to its predecessor. ______You fight your superficiality, your shallowness, so as to try to come at people without unreal expectations, without an overload of bias or hope or arrogance, as untanklike as you can be . . . and yet you never fail to get them wrong. You might as well have the brain of a tank. You get them wrong before you meet them: you get them wrong while you're with them and then you get home to tell somebody else about the meeting and you get them all wrong again. Since the same generally goes for them with you, the whole thing is really a dazzling illusion empty of all perception, an astonishing farce of misperception. And yet what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people, which gets bled of the significance we think it has and takes on a significance that is ludicrous, so ill equipped are we all to envision one another's interior workings and invisible aims? . . . The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway. It's getting them wrong that is living, getting them wrong and wrong and wrong and then, on careful reconsideration, getting them wrong again . That's how we know we are alive: we're wrong. —Phillip Roth, American Pastoral______We go to our jobs, stop by the bar on our way home, hang out with our friends, raise our kids­ because these things are the stuff of life, to be sure, but also because they are strategies for keeping the terror of isolation in check. Soren Kierkeg­aard, that existentialist before there was existentialism, compared us in this respect to those early American pioneers who banged on their pots and pans all night long, hoping to keep the wolves at bay. Keeping wolves at bay is a start. But of all our ways of dealing with this rift, our favorite by far is the one that promises to eliminate it entirely­ to transform our desert island into a tropical paradise, our fundamental separation into ecstatic union. This strategy is our last, best hope for escap­ing the loneliness of existence and giving despair the slip. I am talking, of course, about love.______The idea that we possess a true self serves a hugely important psycho­ logical purpose. If we have an essential and unchanging identity, one we are destined to discover sooner or later, then the beliefs we hold, the choices we make, the person we become-none of this happens by chance. Instead, the entire course of our lives is inevitable, dictated by the certainty that our real self will eventually surface...This narrative is appealing for the same reason that it is problematic: within it, we can do no wrong. Our false beliefs were foreordained, our ap­parent errors occurred strictly in the service of a larger truth. This idea is made explicit in the religious affirmation that ""God makes no mistakes"": even the seeming trials and blunders of our lives are part of a larger plan: As that implies, stories starring a true self are teleological; we end up exactly where we are meant to be. This, too, is both an attraction and a weakness of the idea of an essential self. It suggests that our lives are deterministic, that yesterday's convictions-which we thought we chose based on their intellectual, emotional, or spiritual merits-were merely a trap into which we were lured for the benefit of some predetermined future self. Whatever meaning or worth our past might have had on its own terms is effectively written out of existence. Even more problematically, the idea of a true self suggests that we will never undergo momentous upheaval again. How could we? Having finally discovered who we really are and have always been, there is no further transformation available to us. If the self is constantly changing, then we can constantly feel our way forward, constantly become someone new-but if each of us possesses a fixed essence, then we can only return to it. Accord­ingly, our past departure from that essential self can only be a single and inexplicable aberration, associated as often as not with betrayal, transgres­sion, and sin. (Recall Chambers denouncing Communism, his erstwhile faith, as ""evil, absolute evil."") Singular, aberrational, transgressive, evil: we've seen this constellation of ideas before. This is the pessimistic model of wrongness, in which error is an unwelcome anomaly, a mark of our exile from the sacred realm of truth. Helpfully, this reminds us that we have another model for making sense of wrongness as well-one that casts a different light not only on our errors but also on ourselves. Here, wrongness is a natural and ongoing process, and we are not deformed but transformed by it. ______""The main in­terest in life and work,"" said Foucault, ""is to become someone else that you were not in the beginning."" Such transformations don't only come about through wrongness, of course-but wrongness is always an opportunity for such transformations. ______I was of three minds, Like a tree In which there are three blackbirds. —Wallace Stevens, 13 Ways of Looking at a Blackbird______His desire to banish art is part of a long and often sinister tradition (which we glimpsed earlier) of trying to create ideal societies through eradicating error in all its forms. All of those disgruntled undergraduates, meanwhile, are motivated in part-whether they know it or not-by the optimistic model of wrongness. They recognize, as most of us do, not just the legitimacy but also the poten­tial beauty and power of individual, skewed, inaccurate representations of reality. In this model, the link between error and art i s not a n indictment of art but a defense of error. Cut off from the absolute essence of things-that ideal form that Plato felt existed only in the mind of God-our separate, subjective consciousnesses look around and see, instead, Water Lilies, or Starry Night, or Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Likewise, we can make Beowulf and Star Wars and Horton Hears a Who! for the same reason we can make mistakes: because, as I said earlier, we are capable of conjuring the world not just as it is, but also as it is not. Our capacity to err is inseparable from our imagination.______The most famous formulation of this relationship between art, doubt, and error comes from the Romantic poet John Keats. He had been talking over various matters with a friend, he wrote to his brothers in a letter in 1 817, ""and at once it struck me,"" what quality went to form a Man of Achievement especially in lit­erature & which Shakespeare possessed so enormously-! mean Negative Capability, that is when man is capable of being in un­certainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact & reason.Keats's attitude toward uncertainty-and, for that matter, toward ""fact & reason""-is not the common one. He embraced unknowability and falli­bility, but not for the utilitarian purposes we saw in the last chapter. There, the point of embracing error was to curtail it-a kind of homeopathic rem­ edy for wrongness. But Keats wasn't interested in remedying wrongness. He recognized error and art as conjoined twins, born of the same place and vital to one another's existence. In life as in linguistics, art is joined at the root to artificial-to the not-true, the unreal-just as a fiction is at once a creation and a falsehood. ______But unlike androids, we humans do not nor­ mally self-destruct in the face of our mistakes. On the contrary: we self­ create, and self-recreate. This idea of self-creation suggests something else important about error. Being wrong doesn't just make us human in general; it also helps make each of us the specific person we are. In our inability to get things exactly right, in the idiosyncrasies of our private visions of the world, the outline of selfhood appears. This is what Benjamin Franklin was getting at in the quote I used as an epigraph to this book. Error, he wrote, is ""the pure and simple creation of the mind that invents it,"" a place where ""the soul has room enough to expand herself."" Mistakes, he ·meant, are the evidence and expression of an individual identity. This is an idea with deep and important roots in our intellectual history. It is, in essence, the crucial insight of evolutionary theory. Because of errors in the replication of genetic sequences, we wind up with variation among individual members of a species; and because of that variation, the species as a whole can adapt and survive. Such errors literally keep their hosts alive. A population that is too small or too homogenous to support significant genetic variation is doomed. For every species, then, error is a mechanism of survival and change. For us human organisms, with our richer relation­ ship to wrongness, mistakes enable not only our biological evolution but our social, emotional, and intellectual evolution as well. And wrongness also allows us to thrive in another way. I began this book by noting that we think of being right as essential to our survival and happiness, but in one key respect, nothing could be further from the truth. Countless studies have shown that people who suffer from depression have more accurate worldviews than nondepressed people. Depressed people do not nurture the cheering illusion that they can control the course of their lives. They rarely possess the conviction, so common in the rest of us, that they are above average in virtually every respect. And they understand, all too acutely, the basic conditions of existence: that their lifespan is just a brief blip in the cold sweep of history, that suffering is real and ongoing, that they and all the people they love are going to die. That outlook is known as depressive realism. Depressed people might be unhappy, but­ when it comes to these big-picture, existential matters-they are generally more right than the rest of us. It scarcely requires saying that this kind of rightness is not fun. ""To see the world as it really is is devastating and terrifying,"" wrote the philosopher Ernest Becker. "" . . . It makes thoughtless living in the world of men an im­possibility. It places a trembling animal at the mercy of the entire cosmos and the problem of the meaning of it."" As that indicates, the correlation between accuracy and depression runs both ways: people who are depressed tend to perceive the harsher realities of life more clearly, and people who clearly perceive those harsh realities tend to be (or to get) depressed. In an odd reversal of the usual state of affairs, when it comes to these existential issues, the bigger and more important the belief, the less it pays to be right. That's why, as I've said, the goal of therapy isn't necessarily to make our beliefs more accurate; it is to make them more functional. Ronnie Janoff­ Bulman, the psychologist, has even argued that ""a key to the good life might well be illusions at our deepest, most generalized level of assump­ tions and accuracy at the most specific, least abstract levels."" (Fortunately for us, these two perspectives are compatible: research suggests that people who possess a generally positive outlook are better at acknowledging their everyday errors and changing their minds.) If excessive accuracy in our self-image and worldview is correlated with depression, the opposite is true, too. Sometimes, being wrong makes us happy. Think of Don Quixote, that exemplary knight errant, who lent his name to the condition of being pleasantly deluded. "

It very much is, but just saying that is a bit of a cop-out. The book is a brilliantly written examination of the concept of error from every perspective imaginable. Schulz explores wrongness as an outside observer, a philosopher, a victim and a compassionate friend. By so fully embracing the idea on every level, she synthesizes a unified thesis from many disparate parts and supports every conclusion she draws with the best in logic and anecdote.At the core of Being Wrong is a suggestion. Not advice, so much as a recommendation for people interested in living a little better. Embrace your mistakes. It’s not about making mistakes and not feeling bad about it. Schulz wants us all to live with our errors a little more and not shove them away in a flurry of denial and justification. She goes on to examine the reasons why we are so adverse to being wrong, from the biological, (it doesn’t make evolutionary sense to be uncertain about anything) to the social, (our culture rejects leader figures who are indecisive) to the psychological. (depressed people have much more accurate worldviews than balanced personalties)Schulz is at her strongest when she is telling a story. The highlights of the books are the anecdotes she uses to set up each of her chapters. The stories include everything from Alan Greenspan’s unwavering faith in the economy proved wrong, to the touching story of an Exalted Cyclops of the KKK becoming one of the frontline fighters in the war for desegregated schools. Schulz has a deft hand for splicing these stories with the philosophical and scientific meat that connect them back to the reader’s everyday experience. She does tend to get bogged down in some of the dense history of the topic, but the frequent footnotes and witty asides help to break these thick sections up a little.The text itself induces stumbling, at least for me. It’s probably because the subject matter makes me paranoid that I’ve missed something, or misinterpreted a critical conclusion. To that end, I’d really recommend reading this book in chapters, rather than tackling the entire thing all at once. The writing lends it self to easy sectioning and while reading order is important, the ideas are all pretty sticky, which makes it easier to spread over time.Close to the end of the third section, Schulz examines the story of Penny Beerntsen, a woman who was raped and ended up falsely accusing another man of the crime. He was eventually proved innocent, but in the interim the woman had struggled to get closure in other ways. She wanted to understand the reasons people did horrible things to each other. To do this, she volunteered in prisons and really got to know the realities of being a convicted criminal in the United States. When the verdict came down proving that she had identified the wrong man, she was horrified, but she instantly accepted her mistake and wanted to somehow make up for it. Rather than try to deny her fault, she only sought to improve the life of the man she had thrown into prison unjustly.While this is an extreme example, I can’t think of a better example of being a truly human person. It would be an exaggeration to say I want be like Penny, but her example is one that I can value as someone who can be wrong and can be stupid about it. And really, we all fall into that category sometimes. Anyone who has ever been a critic of any kind knows the giddy thrill of being unquestionably right. (you cannot successfully argue against opinion) It is never a bad thing to gain a little perspective on that feeling, and that’s just what this book has allowed me to do."

The Latin, in turn, gave us the English word “erratic,” used to describe movement that is unpredictable or aimless.

It is a neglected and deeply human attribute: being wrong, feeling wrong, discovering one's wrongness, changing as a result—or, more usually, denying it, ducking and running from the acknowledgement of error. I was fascinated, particularly so once I got through the first chapters. The writing is a curious mix of academic rigour and convivial, almost conversational, English. I found the book deeply engrossing, and it gave me perspective about my own error-filled journey. I finished the book a few days ago, and I am still turning it over in my mind. Highly recommend."

Everybody makes mistakes and many people talk like that is all they do, ""Oh I am always messing up"" they might say. Now try reflecting on the moment when you realized that you were wrong about something. Don't reflect on your past beliefs, whether trivial or not, but rather think of that moment where you shifted from knowing that you were right to knowing that you were not. How did that moment feel when you realized that you were wrong, not when you were actually wrong but when you realized you were wrong?There isn't an external force that can inform us of the correctness or incorrectness of our beliefs a priori and therefore prevent us from making minor or grave mistakes. We have to force ourselves to reckon our beliefs with the external world and when we find our beliefs at odds with the world, it hurts. When we are wrong we feel alone, the moment we recognize our errors is "". . . a moment of alienation, both from ourselves and from [our] previously convincing vision of the world.""This profound and well grounded skepticism about things that feel so right and natural to us is deeply troubling to me. Schulz's prose is very good and is a joy to read and quote* but I have to admit that reflecting on our tendency to err, often in disastrous ways, is unsettling. I think it is disturbing because it goes against our nature not only to know but also to be known. In the current american culture the sexual attraction to others is pretty overt and therefore almost ever present in our minds. But I think we forget about the attractions we have to others than have nothing to do with sex or physical appearances at all. A meeting of the minds is a truly rewarding experience wherein our views of the world are validated and shared. We are in agreement with others about being correct and that is deeply satisfying. Again, Schulz says it a bit better:“Think about how distressing it is to feel misunderstood, and how frustrating it is when someone believes something about you—that you’re irresponsible or can’t handle commitment or don’t pull your weight at work—that you think is untrue. Conversely, there are few things more gratifying than the feeling that someone deeply understands us. In fact, as we are about to see, this feeling of being of being “gotten” is the sine qua non of our most important relationships, and the very hallmark of being in love.”[4]Full review here:http://wp.me/p6r7eE-2P"
136,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8744761-william,5,"This is an impressive and surprisingly enjoyable book. While Schulz is a journalist, the work seems closer to scholarly than journalistic, though it has a lighter touch than scholarship typically achieves. In reading it, don't skip the foot- and endnotes. There is often good stuff there.I experienced ""Being Wrong"" on three levels, and it works exceptionally well on two of them. To begin with, Schulz makes a compelling case that being wrong is by and large more a constructive thing than a negative one. Emotion, creativity and humor, she points out, draw heavily on error to be compelling. While it is explicitly not her intention, there is a self-help aspect to the book which works well. It was impossible for me to read it and not say to myself: ""Hey, lighten up. You don;t have to get everything right the first -- or second, or third -- time.The second level on which i found the book effective is just as good reading. Schultz writes well and with impressive wit. This book would be a good read if you even skipped the message and just read the stories which appear so frequently. My guess is I remember some of the stories better -- and will do so longer -- than the main purpose of the book.Where I find the book a little less satisfying is in the central argument. It's meticulous, sometimes to the point of tediousness. Who knew there was so much to write on this subject? And there are occasional generalizations with which I disagree. (1) We all disdain undecided voters. (177) Huh? (2) ""We almost never find ourselves between theories"" (186). Maybe it's just me, but there are frequently issues on which I have not made up my mind. (3) [quoting LaRochefoucauld] ""Everyone complains about their memory; no one complains about their judgment."" It seems to me all of us have had long talks with friends upset because they keep making the same mistake over and over, and we can often feel that way about ourselves as well.But regardless of my discomfort with some of the logic and a case which seems occasionally overstated, I found the book personally useful, certainly interesting and most of all both educational and entertaining."

It does not try to repackage any established wisdom heard at a marketing conference. This book should not be pigeon-holded as ""self-help"" or ""business"" even though it may, by chance, give you the perceptual tools to somehow fix a decision you recently made, or are about to make, or help you stop hating your niece for joining that cult back in the 90s.It DOES research the history of why we feel, or believe, and why the final decision we make is believed to be true. Because this topic is covered from its most simple origin of sensing and belief you may have to read a few chapters before you get to one that changes the way you perceive the world. However you will enjoy the historical, personal and scientific references that are threaded throughout. Its funny and well written while it is smart, clever and funny. Bill Clinton reviewed it for f#ck sake, so you know its got to be pretty good. Albeit he probably spends most of every day trying to figure out why he did most of what he did in the 80s and 90s.Still not convinced? Well, the author did a TED talk that you may enjoy.

The amount of work in putting the book together is not lost on me. My guess would be that this is one of those books that a college professor would assign to his class. I read it through once, and then reread each chapter once more if not twice for some. I have never taken any college courses but IO have self educated to a certain (non) degree. There is no doubt that I have really enjoyed this book, for I have penciled in some notes and highlighted sections, something I try to avoid doing usually. I am pretty impressed with the entire book, references and the authors personal references. All of which has really made for an interesting study of Being Wrong.

It covers a wide-ranging host of topics on error, how it happens and particularly how we respond to being wrong. Her basic premise is that there are two models of error. One model propounds error as something to be avoided at all costs as it provides no benefits, only embarrassment and shame. The second, which Schulz celebrates, is that error is common and natural. It's benefit is that we can learn, grow and change as a result. It's a very positive spin on a topic that has been dealt with by Plato and other classic writers, Augustine and Aquinas, Enlightenment thinkers, Freud and many other comtemporary writers. Schulz is a wonderful story teller and her stories are the highlight of the book. She can be slightly irritating as a writer when she continually states that the topic ""is something I'll deal with later."" This ""pre-figuring"" happens at least 20 times and becomes wearisome. Hopefully a future editor will do a better job of tightening up this habit. Overall and beyond my pettiness, I heartily recommend this as a wonderful, leisurely read in which you will certainly learn something about history, literature and yourself."

Schulz breaks down rather complex philosophical and psychological issues to easily understood concepts with direct practical application. Further, she does this without removing the terminology, making it easy for people to continue studying long after they've finished this book. This is not a work of post-modern woowoo, where being wrong means no truth can ever be determined. Instead this is a nuanced understanding of our human lives, filled as they are with probabilistic knowledge rather than absolutist dogma, and where we can trust our minds to do what they do, create stories, not form perfect encyclopedic recall. Doing so allows Schulz to make a truly delightful and helpful contribution to our existence: that being wrong is not something to attack like some horrid beast but an inevitable aspect of our lives to embrace and seek always to see how our mental tendencies to error can be mitigated through understanding.

A compelling aspect of Being Wrong is a set of arguments for the value of making errors or being wrong. An obsession with eliminating all errors may result in worse outcomes. For example, by taking risks and making some errors, you can learn much more than by sticking with safe decisions.One of the most interesting chapters covered areas of wrongness and criminology, starting off with the story of Steven Avery's 18-year sentence for a crime he didn't commit. That was followed by a note that he was later convicted of a murder, the only setback to date of the Wisconsin Innocence Project. Just two days after I read that chapter, I read an article about the Netflix documentary Making a Murderer that suggests that Avery might also be innocent of that crime, framed once again by the same bad cops."

Odds: 55 copies available, 1006 people requesting.There is something wrong with the table of contents in my copy of the book. I wonder if it's there intentionally, just to see how many people would notice and point out the error. Oh, scratch that! I just noticed on the back it says ""uncorrected proof""; they are probably going to fix it before it's out.Anyway, I'm finding this book very readable, and interesting, and thought-provoking. I have a list of things that I want to quote and this is all just from the first couple of chapters, haha...

145,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11297501-anna,5,"Kathryn Schulz argues passionately for the value of error. She shows us that not only is 'being wrong' a given in life, it is also a gift that has the power to transform our worldviews, our relationships, and ourselves. By drawing on philosophy, neuroscience, psycholoanalysts and a bit of common sense, she charts out the intellectual history of the shifting definitions and attitudes ascribed to being wrong and masterfully combines it with relevant & relatable examples from the present day. Schulz is a terrific thinker & and she writes with an elegant clarity and simplicity that make it nearly impossible to believe this is her first book (it seems as though she has done this before). Definitely one of the best things I have read in years. I am kind of in love with her now. Check out her Ted talks. "
146,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826906-laura,4,"I saw the author speak (very entertainingly) at an education conference, which was appropriate since - as she argues persuasively - being wrong is an inextricable part of learning and imagination. Yet in education we can often inadvertently send a message that error is something to fear and avoid. This is an entertaining book which would have been enhanced by some cross-cultural examination - e.g. how is error conceived of in cultures with a very different sense of self? Nevertheless, it's a rare book that really is relevant to everyone - but since we've all been wrong, are currently wrong (though we don't yet know how) and will be wrong at some point in the future, we can all find something to learn and relate to here."

It seems that much of the firepower is arraigned towards the writing style, especially the mix of academic language with the more colloquial. I admit I'm a sucker for that mix, so I've enjoyed her style mostly. Also, David seemed to say that the problem was that it got bogged down in semantics and word games, but I actually thought there was more emphasis on neuro-biology with anecdotes thrown in. She wasn't always the most illuminating--do I really need to hear about the old woman/young woman picture one more time?--but I think it helps flesh out the constellation of issues around our own images of ourselves and our rightness. At least, it makes my staff meeting make a whole lot more sense."

Still an interesting topic and discussion, although I think I agree with an earlier reviewer that the section on Love was not really related to the rest of the book and not really apropos to the topic. I found the idea of pessimistic versus optimistic views of wrongness intriguing. The author did inject some mild humor throughout the book that made the book more fun to read without being over the top or distracting.

149,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3761228-adman,4,"Insightful, therapeutic, and hopeful, this book belies its title inasmuch as it surveys error not so much as frontier but heartland, nay, even as a sort of self-sown weed of fate that springs out of any coordinates in any plot of land where we happen to plant our flag of sureness. Schulz crosses all sorts of habitual borders within which we assume we have found safety from error (or accidents, or sin) and shows that we badly overestimate such security (victory, righteousness). She does so with compassion and zeal, and this time stays quite true to her title. It really is an adventure to her to knock down the ego's badly-constructed refuges and blaze a new trail for how we think and act. It is not a sadistic or despairing adventure, though: Schulz believes this eyes-open journey can be better for her and for all of us than how we usually get along in life.Schulz covers a lot of territory. Material and mental subjects are treated in this book, from, say, stepping on a rake to the meta-mistake of rationalizing the mishap (intentional, unavoidable, someone else's fault, or really anything else other than our own error). Schulz hikes around between memory and science, moves from the mundane to the dramatic, sits down to chat with romance, politics, and religion. She does all this with a diplomacy that surprised and gladdened me. Taking a page from her own reflections, I wonder how much her topical environment guided her and her editors to observe even-handedly and deliver cautious judgments. I wish other authors would take note. Any of us, really, who is less blatantly kept in line by whatever happens to be the topic at hand might benefit from Schulz's choice. Far too much intellectual and practical territory, in print or in person, is overrun far too often by refusing to be open and hospitable about error -- in ourselves or others.The trail in this book does not lead to a new shelter where we can rest again from the hard work of living. Instead, how we make and walk our path seems to be Schulz's source of inspiration. How much better off might we be if we acknowledge and respect our seemingly inexhaustible capacity for error? What if we did not retreat in either denial or despair? What if we ventured from time to time out of the refuge of the self into the crowd or, the reverse, from the masses into the self? What if we diverted some of our energy from purging and purifying and celebrated and cultivated the capacity of some institutions -- art, religion, certain forms of government -- to introduce us to our limitations?I was struck by how relationship-oriented this book is. I suppose Schulz might respond, how could it not be? First of all and obviously, the book is not part of me -- not in my traditional sense of self. As with any book, I am contending with a thing outside of me. The book is not Ms. Schulz either, but rather a shadow-her that emerged as she researched and wrote, a page-bound self she may have hoped would reflect her living self. This shadow then introduced me, the reader, to other various, astute shadow-thinkers, -scientists, -theologians, and -philosophers. They all shared with me their experiences of a gap between the self and the world and also shared their ill-begotten efforts to remedy that gap. What a wilderness of joining and separating this is to be lost in! So many glances and so many voices have been cast over so many stone walls that stretch and tangle across an endless, fog-shrouded pasture of human experience.Or, if you prefer Ms. Schulz's own, less striving metaphor, life is like a game of telephone, and we often can't make up our minds how to feel -- or what to do -- about the inevitable degeneration of the initial message (though of course no one alive can lay claim to that first message) and our powerlessness to steer that degeneration.Schulz really gets to the bottom of things when she observes that we are in search of wholeness more than we are in search of rightness. Like small children, we want unity between whatever we understand to be the self and the not-self. Error -- accident, sin, the comical-or-frustrating evolution of the message in telephone, defeat at the hands of one's pen, keyboard, numb fingers or mute tongue to put one's spirit in touch with one's blind and deaf neighbors -- represents our failure (or, as we often like to pretend, the failure of others) to be one.Fortunately, around this point in the book, Schulz made an unexpected digression to identify art with error. I have often been driven to desperation and something in the neighborhood of madness by my inability to write poems or stories that express what I wish to convey in details or intensity. What a welcome, unexpected relief it was to read John Keats (among others) describing imperfection as the necessary and desired product of artistic endeavor. Why? I don't recall the line of reasoning she establishes but in the moment that I am writing this, I take it to mean that artistic error is evidence -- of the self, one's hopes, one's intentions, one's peculiar, unrepeatable humanness. It is evidence precisely in its failure to convey exactly what I want it to -- evidence of difference, disunity, and striving toward something else.Schulz ultimately praises error -- with a bit of hedging and a bashful allusion to the Judeochristian story of the Fall. She is not quite comfortable with blatantly saying bad is good. She simply wishes to offer hope that error is not the harbinger of doom we take it -- and often make it -- to be. Instead, it is a circumstance, a lesson, a challenge, an invitation."

154,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72842365-ryan-derby-talbot,5,"Book summary: There are two fundamental and unavoidable components to being a human being: one is the need to chase the feeling of being right –– of having solidity and comfort in how we experience and respond to the world. The other is dealing with being wrong: dealing with error, the inevitable (and sometimes devastating) encounters we have when our expectations end up not aligning with reality. This book is about how we cannot escape either of these forces, and what results — negative or positive –– we can get from attempting to navigate this tension.Our need to chase being right –– and the resulting confidence, empowerment and belongingness (proxies for love?) that come with the feeling of rightness –– run up against and try to discount and rule out all the ways we inevitably can get things wrong: through illusions, false or overstated beliefs, skewed understandings of data, biases, social influences that lead us astray, emotional investments in perspectives or communities, the need to feel love, and flat out denial. We have difficulty even seeing wrongness in action in us (thinking we are far more objective and omniscient than we are), partly because it is such a fleeting force –– striking either too quickly or too slowly for us to catch it. Moreover, we struggle with identifying and acknowledging wrongness because of the strong emotional and cognitive forces (the desire for the feeling of certainty, the biases) that protect us, and keep us overwhelmingly invested in particular perspectives at the expense of other perspectives more aligned with reality. However much we may want to insist on the contrary or wish away our propensity to get things wrong (and we do this routinely), if we actually look at it, we invariably, deeply, absurdly, and inevitably get things wrong. Actually facing this truth doesn’t need to doom us, however, to defeated nihilism. The gap between our perspectives and the world make possible our two distinctly powerful human abilities: imagination and empathy. (Both are the result of allowing more than one perspective in a situation, of permitting a bigger notion than just a single “rightness.”) Successful incorporation and integration of our own wrongness –– which requires going through the excruciating emotional pain of admitting and allowing wrongness –– expands our sensitivities and perspectives as human beings. Collectively, our relationship with the gap also makes possible the two best products of human work, art and science. At root, error –– encountering the gap –– contributes to diversity, wonder, and richness of human experience. Alas, however, it will not ever lead us to a refuge of solid objectivity. Alas, there is no magic formula for dealing with the tensions between our desired rightness and inevitable wrongness. We can, however, recognize the growth and wondrous (mystical?) perspectives that are available in confronting their clash within us, the fundamental and inevitable experience of being a human being.

155,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45191284-beth,4,"Kathryn Schulz delves into all the ways we can be wrong, explaining the strange whys and hows or error generation, denial, and results. The fact that the fabric of humanity is interwoven with error and inseparable from the state of being human is something abput which most of us live in denial. Schulz uncovers some of the universal characteristics of being wrong in a way that is more palatable than some of the ways society reminds us we are wrong. We are wired to resist the notion of our own fallibility, so this deft touch is necessary in order to circumvent our natural resistance. At the same time, she highlights the benefits of acknowledging and embracing our error in order to better our communities, our interpersonal relationships, and ourselves. For example:""This is one of the most powerful ways being wrong can transform us. It can help us be more compassionate people. Being right might be fun, but as we've seen, it has a tendency to bring out the worst in us. By contrast, being wrong might is often the furthest thing in the world from fun, and yet, in the end, it has the potential to bring out the best in us. Or, rather, to change us for the better.""This book now is added to 2 others - Tim Nochols' The Death of Expertise and Han Roslings's Factfulness- that I would recommend to any of my acquaintances who are trying to grapple with the perceived and real societal grievances battering for their attention. Schulz can get a little long-winded in places, but this is a deep topic and I found that if I hung with her she eventually led me to her point.One of my favorite passages is what I hope people gain from reading this book:""If you really want to be right, or at least improve the odds of being right, you have to start by acknowledging your fallibility. Deliberately seeking out your mistakes. And figuring out what caused you to make them."""

In all, Schulz does an admirable job of selecting her chosen anecdotes and ends up with a satisfying and thought-provoking read.NotesPerhaps the history of the errors of mankind, all things considered, is more valuable and interesting than that of their discoveries. Truth is uniform and narrow; it constantly exists, and does not seem to require so much an active energy, as a passive aptitude of the soul in order to encounter it. But error is endlessly diversified; it has no reality, but is the pure and simple creation of the mind that invents it. In this field the soul has room enough to expand herself, to display all her boundless faculties, and all her beautiful and interesting extravagancies and absurdities.—Benjamin Franklin______Many of the religious thinkers who tried to understand why we err found their answer at the gates of the Garden of Eden. Thus Thomas Aquinas, the thirteenth-century scholastic, held that we make mistakes because, when we were banished from paradise, we were cut off forever from direct access to divine truth. To Aquinas and many of his fellow theologians, our errors arise from the gap between our own limited and blemished minds and God’s unlimited and perfect omniscience.This same basic idea has received countless secular treatments as well. Plato thought that our primordial soul was at one with the universe, and that we only began to err when we took on our current physical form and forgot those cosmic truths. The Enlightenment philosopher John Locke thought that error seeped into our lives from the gap between the artificiality of words and the reality of the things they name—from the distance between an indescribable essence and the nearest sayable thing. The German philosopher Martin Heidegger thought that error could be explained by the fact that we live in time and space; because we are bound to a particular set of coordinates, we can’t rise above them and see reality as a whole, from a bird’s-eye (or God’s-eye) view. As different as these explanations seem, all these thinkers and many more conceived of error as arising from a gap: sometimes between the particular and the general, sometimes between words and things, sometimes between the present and the primeval, sometimes between the mortal and the divine—but in every case, and fundamentally, between our own mind and the rest of the world.For the most part, we spend our lives blithely ignoring this gap. And with good reason. Who wants to be reminded of the fall from grace, the separation from truth, the particular and limited nature of our existence? ______How can we square this feeling of rightness with the very real possibility that we are wrong? This is a question that haunts all of wrongology, not just errors of memory. The problem is suggested by the very phrase “the feeling of knowing.” In life, as in language, we begin with a psychological state (the “feeling” part) and end up with a claim about the truth (the “knowing” part). In other words, we feel that we are right because we feel that we are right: we take our own certainty as an indicator of accuracy. This isn’t completely foolish of us, since studies show that there is some correlation between confidence and correctness. But it isn’t completely foolproof, either. As the case of flashbulb memories makes clear, our certainty reflects the existence of a particularly vivid inner picture. But nothing in life guarantees that this picture reflects the real state of affairs.This reliance on a vivid inner picture helps explain why memories are particularly apt to trigger the feeling of knowing.______ The philosopher Avishai Marga lit put this nicely. ""It is not the case that I am caught in a web of beliefs,"" he wrote. "" . . . Rather, I am caught in a network of witnesses."" Our relationships to these ""witnesses""-the people and institutions that attest to the truth of various beliefs-predate and determine our reaction to whatever information they supply. As Margalit said, ""my belief in [one of these witnesses] is prior to my belief that (what she says is true)."" Belief in is prior: however far this might be from our sense of how we should form our ideas about the world, it is the first principle of how we actually do so. All of us are caught in Margalit's ""networks of witnesses""­ not just in one but in many, and not just from time to time but all the time, from the moment we are born until the day we die. As countless commen­tators have observed, this lends to our beliefs an element of the arbitrary. Montaigne, for instance, remarked that people ""are swept [into a belief]­ either by the custom of their country or by their parental upbringing, or by chance-as by a tempest, without judgment or choice, indeed most often before the age of discretion.""______These latter­ day zealots have hailed from many different backgrounds and held many different beliefs. At heart, though, and paradoxically, they have all shared a single conviction: that they and they alone are in possession of the truth. (The very word ""zealot"" comes from a Greek root meaning to be jealous of the truth-to guard it as your own.) What zealots have in common, then, is the absolute conviction that they are right. In fact, of all the symbolic ones and zeros that extremists use to write their ideological binary codes­ us/them, same/different, good/evil-the fundamental one is right/wrong. Zealotry demands a complete rejection of the possibility of error. The conviction that we cannot possibly be wrong: this is certainty.______[O]ur be­liefs come in bundles. That makes it hard to remove or replace one without affecting the others-and it gets harder as the belief in question gets more central. In this respect, beliefs are like the beams in a building or the words in a sentence: you can't eliminate one and expect the fundamental sound­ ness or fundamental meaning of the overall system to remain unchanged. As a result, being wrong sometimes triggers a cascade of transformations so extensive that the belief system that emerges afterward bears almost no resemblance to its predecessor. ______You fight your superficiality, your shallowness, so as to try to come at people without unreal expectations, without an overload of bias or hope or arrogance, as untanklike as you can be . . . and yet you never fail to get them wrong. You might as well have the brain of a tank. You get them wrong before you meet them: you get them wrong while you're with them and then you get home to tell somebody else about the meeting and you get them all wrong again. Since the same generally goes for them with you, the whole thing is really a dazzling illusion empty of all perception, an astonishing farce of misperception. And yet what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people, which gets bled of the significance we think it has and takes on a significance that is ludicrous, so ill equipped are we all to envision one another's interior workings and invisible aims? . . . The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway. It's getting them wrong that is living, getting them wrong and wrong and wrong and then, on careful reconsideration, getting them wrong again . That's how we know we are alive: we're wrong. —Phillip Roth, American Pastoral______We go to our jobs, stop by the bar on our way home, hang out with our friends, raise our kids­ because these things are the stuff of life, to be sure, but also because they are strategies for keeping the terror of isolation in check. Soren Kierkeg­aard, that existentialist before there was existentialism, compared us in this respect to those early American pioneers who banged on their pots and pans all night long, hoping to keep the wolves at bay. Keeping wolves at bay is a start. But of all our ways of dealing with this rift, our favorite by far is the one that promises to eliminate it entirely­ to transform our desert island into a tropical paradise, our fundamental separation into ecstatic union. This strategy is our last, best hope for escap­ing the loneliness of existence and giving despair the slip. I am talking, of course, about love.______The idea that we possess a true self serves a hugely important psycho­ logical purpose. If we have an essential and unchanging identity, one we are destined to discover sooner or later, then the beliefs we hold, the choices we make, the person we become-none of this happens by chance. Instead, the entire course of our lives is inevitable, dictated by the certainty that our real self will eventually surface...This narrative is appealing for the same reason that it is problematic: within it, we can do no wrong. Our false beliefs were foreordained, our ap­parent errors occurred strictly in the service of a larger truth. This idea is made explicit in the religious affirmation that ""God makes no mistakes"": even the seeming trials and blunders of our lives are part of a larger plan: As that implies, stories starring a true self are teleological; we end up exactly where we are meant to be. This, too, is both an attraction and a weakness of the idea of an essential self. It suggests that our lives are deterministic, that yesterday's convictions-which we thought we chose based on their intellectual, emotional, or spiritual merits-were merely a trap into which we were lured for the benefit of some predetermined future self. Whatever meaning or worth our past might have had on its own terms is effectively written out of existence. Even more problematically, the idea of a true self suggests that we will never undergo momentous upheaval again. How could we? Having finally discovered who we really are and have always been, there is no further transformation available to us. If the self is constantly changing, then we can constantly feel our way forward, constantly become someone new-but if each of us possesses a fixed essence, then we can only return to it. Accord­ingly, our past departure from that essential self can only be a single and inexplicable aberration, associated as often as not with betrayal, transgres­sion, and sin. (Recall Chambers denouncing Communism, his erstwhile faith, as ""evil, absolute evil."") Singular, aberrational, transgressive, evil: we've seen this constellation of ideas before. This is the pessimistic model of wrongness, in which error is an unwelcome anomaly, a mark of our exile from the sacred realm of truth. Helpfully, this reminds us that we have another model for making sense of wrongness as well-one that casts a different light not only on our errors but also on ourselves. Here, wrongness is a natural and ongoing process, and we are not deformed but transformed by it. ______""The main in­terest in life and work,"" said Foucault, ""is to become someone else that you were not in the beginning."" Such transformations don't only come about through wrongness, of course-but wrongness is always an opportunity for such transformations. ______I was of three minds, Like a tree In which there are three blackbirds. —Wallace Stevens, 13 Ways of Looking at a Blackbird______His desire to banish art is part of a long and often sinister tradition (which we glimpsed earlier) of trying to create ideal societies through eradicating error in all its forms. All of those disgruntled undergraduates, meanwhile, are motivated in part-whether they know it or not-by the optimistic model of wrongness. They recognize, as most of us do, not just the legitimacy but also the poten­tial beauty and power of individual, skewed, inaccurate representations of reality. In this model, the link between error and art i s not a n indictment of art but a defense of error. Cut off from the absolute essence of things-that ideal form that Plato felt existed only in the mind of God-our separate, subjective consciousnesses look around and see, instead, Water Lilies, or Starry Night, or Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Likewise, we can make Beowulf and Star Wars and Horton Hears a Who! for the same reason we can make mistakes: because, as I said earlier, we are capable of conjuring the world not just as it is, but also as it is not. Our capacity to err is inseparable from our imagination.______The most famous formulation of this relationship between art, doubt, and error comes from the Romantic poet John Keats. He had been talking over various matters with a friend, he wrote to his brothers in a letter in 1 817, ""and at once it struck me,"" what quality went to form a Man of Achievement especially in lit­erature & which Shakespeare possessed so enormously-! mean Negative Capability, that is when man is capable of being in un­certainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact & reason.Keats's attitude toward uncertainty-and, for that matter, toward ""fact & reason""-is not the common one. He embraced unknowability and falli­bility, but not for the utilitarian purposes we saw in the last chapter. There, the point of embracing error was to curtail it-a kind of homeopathic rem­ edy for wrongness. But Keats wasn't interested in remedying wrongness. He recognized error and art as conjoined twins, born of the same place and vital to one another's existence. In life as in linguistics, art is joined at the root to artificial-to the not-true, the unreal-just as a fiction is at once a creation and a falsehood. ______But unlike androids, we humans do not nor­ mally self-destruct in the face of our mistakes. On the contrary: we self­ create, and self-recreate. This idea of self-creation suggests something else important about error. Being wrong doesn't just make us human in general; it also helps make each of us the specific person we are. In our inability to get things exactly right, in the idiosyncrasies of our private visions of the world, the outline of selfhood appears. This is what Benjamin Franklin was getting at in the quote I used as an epigraph to this book. Error, he wrote, is ""the pure and simple creation of the mind that invents it,"" a place where ""the soul has room enough to expand herself."" Mistakes, he ·meant, are the evidence and expression of an individual identity. This is an idea with deep and important roots in our intellectual history. It is, in essence, the crucial insight of evolutionary theory. Because of errors in the replication of genetic sequences, we wind up with variation among individual members of a species; and because of that variation, the species as a whole can adapt and survive. Such errors literally keep their hosts alive. A population that is too small or too homogenous to support significant genetic variation is doomed. For every species, then, error is a mechanism of survival and change. For us human organisms, with our richer relation­ ship to wrongness, mistakes enable not only our biological evolution but our social, emotional, and intellectual evolution as well. And wrongness also allows us to thrive in another way. I began this book by noting that we think of being right as essential to our survival and happiness, but in one key respect, nothing could be further from the truth. Countless studies have shown that people who suffer from depression have more accurate worldviews than nondepressed people. Depressed people do not nurture the cheering illusion that they can control the course of their lives. They rarely possess the conviction, so common in the rest of us, that they are above average in virtually every respect. And they understand, all too acutely, the basic conditions of existence: that their lifespan is just a brief blip in the cold sweep of history, that suffering is real and ongoing, that they and all the people they love are going to die. That outlook is known as depressive realism. Depressed people might be unhappy, but­ when it comes to these big-picture, existential matters-they are generally more right than the rest of us. It scarcely requires saying that this kind of rightness is not fun. ""To see the world as it really is is devastating and terrifying,"" wrote the philosopher Ernest Becker. "" . . . It makes thoughtless living in the world of men an im­possibility. It places a trembling animal at the mercy of the entire cosmos and the problem of the meaning of it."" As that indicates, the correlation between accuracy and depression runs both ways: people who are depressed tend to perceive the harsher realities of life more clearly, and people who clearly perceive those harsh realities tend to be (or to get) depressed. In an odd reversal of the usual state of affairs, when it comes to these existential issues, the bigger and more important the belief, the less it pays to be right. That's why, as I've said, the goal of therapy isn't necessarily to make our beliefs more accurate; it is to make them more functional. Ronnie Janoff­ Bulman, the psychologist, has even argued that ""a key to the good life might well be illusions at our deepest, most generalized level of assump­ tions and accuracy at the most specific, least abstract levels."" (Fortunately for us, these two perspectives are compatible: research suggests that people who possess a generally positive outlook are better at acknowledging their everyday errors and changing their minds.) If excessive accuracy in our self-image and worldview is correlated with depression, the opposite is true, too. Sometimes, being wrong makes us happy. Think of Don Quixote, that exemplary knight errant, who lent his name to the condition of being pleasantly deluded. "

It very much is, but just saying that is a bit of a cop-out. The book is a brilliantly written examination of the concept of error from every perspective imaginable. Schulz explores wrongness as an outside observer, a philosopher, a victim and a compassionate friend. By so fully embracing the idea on every level, she synthesizes a unified thesis from many disparate parts and supports every conclusion she draws with the best in logic and anecdote.At the core of Being Wrong is a suggestion. Not advice, so much as a recommendation for people interested in living a little better. Embrace your mistakes. It’s not about making mistakes and not feeling bad about it. Schulz wants us all to live with our errors a little more and not shove them away in a flurry of denial and justification. She goes on to examine the reasons why we are so adverse to being wrong, from the biological, (it doesn’t make evolutionary sense to be uncertain about anything) to the social, (our culture rejects leader figures who are indecisive) to the psychological. (depressed people have much more accurate worldviews than balanced personalties)Schulz is at her strongest when she is telling a story. The highlights of the books are the anecdotes she uses to set up each of her chapters. The stories include everything from Alan Greenspan’s unwavering faith in the economy proved wrong, to the touching story of an Exalted Cyclops of the KKK becoming one of the frontline fighters in the war for desegregated schools. Schulz has a deft hand for splicing these stories with the philosophical and scientific meat that connect them back to the reader’s everyday experience. She does tend to get bogged down in some of the dense history of the topic, but the frequent footnotes and witty asides help to break these thick sections up a little.The text itself induces stumbling, at least for me. It’s probably because the subject matter makes me paranoid that I’ve missed something, or misinterpreted a critical conclusion. To that end, I’d really recommend reading this book in chapters, rather than tackling the entire thing all at once. The writing lends it self to easy sectioning and while reading order is important, the ideas are all pretty sticky, which makes it easier to spread over time.Close to the end of the third section, Schulz examines the story of Penny Beerntsen, a woman who was raped and ended up falsely accusing another man of the crime. He was eventually proved innocent, but in the interim the woman had struggled to get closure in other ways. She wanted to understand the reasons people did horrible things to each other. To do this, she volunteered in prisons and really got to know the realities of being a convicted criminal in the United States. When the verdict came down proving that she had identified the wrong man, she was horrified, but she instantly accepted her mistake and wanted to somehow make up for it. Rather than try to deny her fault, she only sought to improve the life of the man she had thrown into prison unjustly.While this is an extreme example, I can’t think of a better example of being a truly human person. It would be an exaggeration to say I want be like Penny, but her example is one that I can value as someone who can be wrong and can be stupid about it. And really, we all fall into that category sometimes. Anyone who has ever been a critic of any kind knows the giddy thrill of being unquestionably right. (you cannot successfully argue against opinion) It is never a bad thing to gain a little perspective on that feeling, and that’s just what this book has allowed me to do."

But more gastric: sometimes, instead of wanting to die, we just want to vomit. Or so one might assume from the strangely culinary vocabulary we use to talk about being wrong. In the aftermath of our mistakes, we eat crow, eat humble pie, eat our hat, or, at the other end of the sartorial menu, eat our shoe. And, of course, we eat our words.

The Latin, in turn, gave us the English word “erratic,” used to describe movement that is unpredictable or aimless.

It is a neglected and deeply human attribute: being wrong, feeling wrong, discovering one's wrongness, changing as a result—or, more usually, denying it, ducking and running from the acknowledgement of error. I was fascinated, particularly so once I got through the first chapters. The writing is a curious mix of academic rigour and convivial, almost conversational, English. I found the book deeply engrossing, and it gave me perspective about my own error-filled journey. I finished the book a few days ago, and I am still turning it over in my mind. Highly recommend."
165,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2011274-brian,5,"Have you ever been wrong? Of course you have. Everybody makes mistakes and many people talk like that is all they do, ""Oh I am always messing up"" they might say. Now try reflecting on the moment when you realized that you were wrong about something. Don't reflect on your past beliefs, whether trivial or not, but rather think of that moment where you shifted from knowing that you were right to knowing that you were not. How did that moment feel when you realized that you were wrong, not when you were actually wrong but when you realized you were wrong?There isn't an external force that can inform us of the correctness or incorrectness of our beliefs a priori and therefore prevent us from making minor or grave mistakes. We have to force ourselves to reckon our beliefs with the external world and when we find our beliefs at odds with the world, it hurts. When we are wrong we feel alone, the moment we recognize our errors is "". . . a moment of alienation, both from ourselves and from [our] previously convincing vision of the world.""This profound and well grounded skepticism about things that feel so right and natural to us is deeply troubling to me. Schulz's prose is very good and is a joy to read and quote* but I have to admit that reflecting on our tendency to err, often in disastrous ways, is unsettling. I think it is disturbing because it goes against our nature not only to know but also to be known. In the current american culture the sexual attraction to others is pretty overt and therefore almost ever present in our minds. But I think we forget about the attractions we have to others than have nothing to do with sex or physical appearances at all. A meeting of the minds is a truly rewarding experience wherein our views of the world are validated and shared. We are in agreement with others about being correct and that is deeply satisfying. Again, Schulz says it a bit better:“Think about how distressing it is to feel misunderstood, and how frustrating it is when someone believes something about you—that you’re irresponsible or can’t handle commitment or don’t pull your weight at work—that you think is untrue. Conversely, there are few things more gratifying than the feeling that someone deeply understands us. In fact, as we are about to see, this feeling of being of being “gotten” is the sine qua non of our most important relationships, and the very hallmark of being in love.”[4]Full review here:http://wp.me/p6r7eE-2P"
166,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8744761-william,5,"This is an impressive and surprisingly enjoyable book. While Schulz is a journalist, the work seems closer to scholarly than journalistic, though it has a lighter touch than scholarship typically achieves. In reading it, don't skip the foot- and endnotes. There is often good stuff there.I experienced ""Being Wrong"" on three levels, and it works exceptionally well on two of them. To begin with, Schulz makes a compelling case that being wrong is by and large more a constructive thing than a negative one. Emotion, creativity and humor, she points out, draw heavily on error to be compelling. While it is explicitly not her intention, there is a self-help aspect to the book which works well. It was impossible for me to read it and not say to myself: ""Hey, lighten up. You don;t have to get everything right the first -- or second, or third -- time.The second level on which i found the book effective is just as good reading. Schultz writes well and with impressive wit. This book would be a good read if you even skipped the message and just read the stories which appear so frequently. My guess is I remember some of the stories better -- and will do so longer -- than the main purpose of the book.Where I find the book a little less satisfying is in the central argument. It's meticulous, sometimes to the point of tediousness. Who knew there was so much to write on this subject? And there are occasional generalizations with which I disagree. (1) We all disdain undecided voters. (177) Huh? (2) ""We almost never find ourselves between theories"" (186). Maybe it's just me, but there are frequently issues on which I have not made up my mind. (3) [quoting LaRochefoucauld] ""Everyone complains about their memory; no one complains about their judgment."" It seems to me all of us have had long talks with friends upset because they keep making the same mistake over and over, and we can often feel that way about ourselves as well.But regardless of my discomfort with some of the logic and a case which seems occasionally overstated, I found the book personally useful, certainly interesting and most of all both educational and entertaining."

That is not what this book is about. It does not try to approve or disapprove of making mistakes during an intentional brain dump (or storm). It does not try to repackage any established wisdom heard at a marketing conference. This book should not be pigeon-holded as ""self-help"" or ""business"" even though it may, by chance, give you the perceptual tools to somehow fix a decision you recently made, or are about to make, or help you stop hating your niece for joining that cult back in the 90s.It DOES research the history of why we feel, or believe, and why the final decision we make is believed to be true. Because this topic is covered from its most simple origin of sensing and belief you may have to read a few chapters before you get to one that changes the way you perceive the world. However you will enjoy the historical, personal and scientific references that are threaded throughout. Its funny and well written while it is smart, clever and funny. Bill Clinton reviewed it for f#ck sake, so you know its got to be pretty good. Albeit he probably spends most of every day trying to figure out why he did most of what he did in the 80s and 90s.Still not convinced? Well, the author did a TED talk that you may enjoy.

I'm not even sure why that is because I have just been nothing but fascinated, especially so at all the research this book must have required to write. The amount of work in putting the book together is not lost on me. My guess would be that this is one of those books that a college professor would assign to his class. I read it through once, and then reread each chapter once more if not twice for some. I have never taken any college courses but IO have self educated to a certain (non) degree. There is no doubt that I have really enjoyed this book, for I have penciled in some notes and highlighted sections, something I try to avoid doing usually. I am pretty impressed with the entire book, references and the authors personal references. All of which has really made for an interesting study of Being Wrong.

It covers a wide-ranging host of topics on error, how it happens and particularly how we respond to being wrong. Her basic premise is that there are two models of error. One model propounds error as something to be avoided at all costs as it provides no benefits, only embarrassment and shame. The second, which Schulz celebrates, is that error is common and natural. It's benefit is that we can learn, grow and change as a result. It's a very positive spin on a topic that has been dealt with by Plato and other classic writers, Augustine and Aquinas, Enlightenment thinkers, Freud and many other comtemporary writers. Schulz is a wonderful story teller and her stories are the highlight of the book. She can be slightly irritating as a writer when she continually states that the topic ""is something I'll deal with later."" This ""pre-figuring"" happens at least 20 times and becomes wearisome. Hopefully a future editor will do a better job of tightening up this habit. Overall and beyond my pettiness, I heartily recommend this as a wonderful, leisurely read in which you will certainly learn something about history, literature and yourself."

It kinda took me 2 hours to finish 30 pages or so.. *english is my 2nd language here*.. The book starts so well into its core concept and it keeps going so thoroughly discussing the ideas and concepts. sometimes it goes all the way to the core of philosophy and logic and all these mind twisting concepts of error and wrong and emotion and perception..At other chapters you feel like the introduction of the chapter never ends and takes so so long it kinda makes you lost and bored into it.. at others, it's like you're in a river of fluid stream of ideas so connected you don't feel yourself in its beauty.. but if there's one thing to notice, it's gonna be the effort the author put in compiling all the MASSIVE information of the different perspectives and sources and fields of knowledge it's admirable..I love this book, it's one of those books you feel sad you finished, and you feel like you've changed your perspective about so many things in life after reading..

Schulz breaks down rather complex philosophical and psychological issues to easily understood concepts with direct practical application. Further, she does this without removing the terminology, making it easy for people to continue studying long after they've finished this book. This is not a work of post-modern woowoo, where being wrong means no truth can ever be determined. Instead this is a nuanced understanding of our human lives, filled as they are with probabilistic knowledge rather than absolutist dogma, and where we can trust our minds to do what they do, create stories, not form perfect encyclopedic recall. Doing so allows Schulz to make a truly delightful and helpful contribution to our existence: that being wrong is not something to attack like some horrid beast but an inevitable aspect of our lives to embrace and seek always to see how our mental tendencies to error can be mitigated through understanding.

A compelling aspect of Being Wrong is a set of arguments for the value of making errors or being wrong. An obsession with eliminating all errors may result in worse outcomes. For example, by taking risks and making some errors, you can learn much more than by sticking with safe decisions.One of the most interesting chapters covered areas of wrongness and criminology, starting off with the story of Steven Avery's 18-year sentence for a crime he didn't commit. That was followed by a note that he was later convicted of a murder, the only setback to date of the Wisconsin Innocence Project. Just two days after I read that chapter, I read an article about the Netflix documentary Making a Murderer that suggests that Avery might also be innocent of that crime, framed once again by the same bad cops."

175,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11297501-anna,5,"Kathryn Schulz argues passionately for the value of error. She shows us that not only is 'being wrong' a given in life, it is also a gift that has the power to transform our worldviews, our relationships, and ourselves. By drawing on philosophy, neuroscience, psycholoanalysts and a bit of common sense, she charts out the intellectual history of the shifting definitions and attitudes ascribed to being wrong and masterfully combines it with relevant & relatable examples from the present day. Schulz is a terrific thinker & and she writes with an elegant clarity and simplicity that make it nearly impossible to believe this is her first book (it seems as though she has done this before). Definitely one of the best things I have read in years. I am kind of in love with her now. Check out her Ted talks. "

Yet in education we can often inadvertently send a message that error is something to fear and avoid. This is an entertaining book which would have been enhanced by some cross-cultural examination - e.g. how is error conceived of in cultures with a very different sense of self? Nevertheless, it's a rare book that really is relevant to everyone - but since we've all been wrong, are currently wrong (though we don't yet know how) and will be wrong at some point in the future, we can all find something to learn and relate to here."

I admit I'm a sucker for that mix, so I've enjoyed her style mostly. Also, David seemed to say that the problem was that it got bogged down in semantics and word games, but I actually thought there was more emphasis on neuro-biology with anecdotes thrown in. She wasn't always the most illuminating--do I really need to hear about the old woman/young woman picture one more time?--but I think it helps flesh out the constellation of issues around our own images of ourselves and our rightness. At least, it makes my staff meeting make a whole lot more sense."

Still an interesting topic and discussion, although I think I agree with an earlier reviewer that the section on Love was not really related to the rest of the book and not really apropos to the topic. I found the idea of pessimistic versus optimistic views of wrongness intriguing. The author did inject some mild humor throughout the book that made the book more fun to read without being over the top or distracting.

179,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3761228-adman,4,"Insightful, therapeutic, and hopeful, this book belies its title inasmuch as it surveys error not so much as frontier but heartland, nay, even as a sort of self-sown weed of fate that springs out of any coordinates in any plot of land where we happen to plant our flag of sureness. Schulz crosses all sorts of habitual borders within which we assume we have found safety from error (or accidents, or sin) and shows that we badly overestimate such security (victory, righteousness). She does so with compassion and zeal, and this time stays quite true to her title. It really is an adventure to her to knock down the ego's badly-constructed refuges and blaze a new trail for how we think and act. It is not a sadistic or despairing adventure, though: Schulz believes this eyes-open journey can be better for her and for all of us than how we usually get along in life.Schulz covers a lot of territory. Material and mental subjects are treated in this book, from, say, stepping on a rake to the meta-mistake of rationalizing the mishap (intentional, unavoidable, someone else's fault, or really anything else other than our own error). Schulz hikes around between memory and science, moves from the mundane to the dramatic, sits down to chat with romance, politics, and religion. She does all this with a diplomacy that surprised and gladdened me. Taking a page from her own reflections, I wonder how much her topical environment guided her and her editors to observe even-handedly and deliver cautious judgments. I wish other authors would take note. Any of us, really, who is less blatantly kept in line by whatever happens to be the topic at hand might benefit from Schulz's choice. Far too much intellectual and practical territory, in print or in person, is overrun far too often by refusing to be open and hospitable about error -- in ourselves or others.The trail in this book does not lead to a new shelter where we can rest again from the hard work of living. Instead, how we make and walk our path seems to be Schulz's source of inspiration. How much better off might we be if we acknowledge and respect our seemingly inexhaustible capacity for error? What if we did not retreat in either denial or despair? What if we ventured from time to time out of the refuge of the self into the crowd or, the reverse, from the masses into the self? What if we diverted some of our energy from purging and purifying and celebrated and cultivated the capacity of some institutions -- art, religion, certain forms of government -- to introduce us to our limitations?I was struck by how relationship-oriented this book is. I suppose Schulz might respond, how could it not be? First of all and obviously, the book is not part of me -- not in my traditional sense of self. As with any book, I am contending with a thing outside of me. The book is not Ms. Schulz either, but rather a shadow-her that emerged as she researched and wrote, a page-bound self she may have hoped would reflect her living self. This shadow then introduced me, the reader, to other various, astute shadow-thinkers, -scientists, -theologians, and -philosophers. They all shared with me their experiences of a gap between the self and the world and also shared their ill-begotten efforts to remedy that gap. What a wilderness of joining and separating this is to be lost in! So many glances and so many voices have been cast over so many stone walls that stretch and tangle across an endless, fog-shrouded pasture of human experience.Or, if you prefer Ms. Schulz's own, less striving metaphor, life is like a game of telephone, and we often can't make up our minds how to feel -- or what to do -- about the inevitable degeneration of the initial message (though of course no one alive can lay claim to that first message) and our powerlessness to steer that degeneration.Schulz really gets to the bottom of things when she observes that we are in search of wholeness more than we are in search of rightness. Like small children, we want unity between whatever we understand to be the self and the not-self. Error -- accident, sin, the comical-or-frustrating evolution of the message in telephone, defeat at the hands of one's pen, keyboard, numb fingers or mute tongue to put one's spirit in touch with one's blind and deaf neighbors -- represents our failure (or, as we often like to pretend, the failure of others) to be one.Fortunately, around this point in the book, Schulz made an unexpected digression to identify art with error. I have often been driven to desperation and something in the neighborhood of madness by my inability to write poems or stories that express what I wish to convey in details or intensity. What a welcome, unexpected relief it was to read John Keats (among others) describing imperfection as the necessary and desired product of artistic endeavor. Why? I don't recall the line of reasoning she establishes but in the moment that I am writing this, I take it to mean that artistic error is evidence -- of the self, one's hopes, one's intentions, one's peculiar, unrepeatable humanness. It is evidence precisely in its failure to convey exactly what I want it to -- evidence of difference, disunity, and striving toward something else.Schulz ultimately praises error -- with a bit of hedging and a bashful allusion to the Judeochristian story of the Fall. She is not quite comfortable with blatantly saying bad is good. She simply wishes to offer hope that error is not the harbinger of doom we take it -- and often make it -- to be. Instead, it is a circumstance, a lesson, a challenge, an invitation."

Takes Kuhn, Kahneman, and Jervis a step further into practical discussion and brainstorming. While the author often takes self-involved tangents on occasion, this book must be included in the discussion of bias, error, and decision making. Reading this book takes some patience since the author explores in and around her thoughts regarding ""wrongology;"" however, it is worth taking the journey with her.

184,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72842365-ryan-derby-talbot,5,"Book summary: There are two fundamental and unavoidable components to being a human being: one is the need to chase the feeling of being right –– of having solidity and comfort in how we experience and respond to the world. The other is dealing with being wrong: dealing with error, the inevitable (and sometimes devastating) encounters we have when our expectations end up not aligning with reality. This book is about how we cannot escape either of these forces, and what results — negative or positive –– we can get from attempting to navigate this tension.Our need to chase being right –– and the resulting confidence, empowerment and belongingness (proxies for love?) that come with the feeling of rightness –– run up against and try to discount and rule out all the ways we inevitably can get things wrong: through illusions, false or overstated beliefs, skewed understandings of data, biases, social influences that lead us astray, emotional investments in perspectives or communities, the need to feel love, and flat out denial. We have difficulty even seeing wrongness in action in us (thinking we are far more objective and omniscient than we are), partly because it is such a fleeting force –– striking either too quickly or too slowly for us to catch it. Moreover, we struggle with identifying and acknowledging wrongness because of the strong emotional and cognitive forces (the desire for the feeling of certainty, the biases) that protect us, and keep us overwhelmingly invested in particular perspectives at the expense of other perspectives more aligned with reality. However much we may want to insist on the contrary or wish away our propensity to get things wrong (and we do this routinely), if we actually look at it, we invariably, deeply, absurdly, and inevitably get things wrong. Actually facing this truth doesn’t need to doom us, however, to defeated nihilism. The gap between our perspectives and the world make possible our two distinctly powerful human abilities: imagination and empathy. (Both are the result of allowing more than one perspective in a situation, of permitting a bigger notion than just a single “rightness.”) Successful incorporation and integration of our own wrongness –– which requires going through the excruciating emotional pain of admitting and allowing wrongness –– expands our sensitivities and perspectives as human beings. Collectively, our relationship with the gap also makes possible the two best products of human work, art and science. At root, error –– encountering the gap –– contributes to diversity, wonder, and richness of human experience. Alas, however, it will not ever lead us to a refuge of solid objectivity. Alas, there is no magic formula for dealing with the tensions between our desired rightness and inevitable wrongness. We can, however, recognize the growth and wondrous (mystical?) perspectives that are available in confronting their clash within us, the fundamental and inevitable experience of being a human being.

185,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45191284-beth,4,"Kathryn Schulz delves into all the ways we can be wrong, explaining the strange whys and hows or error generation, denial, and results. The fact that the fabric of humanity is interwoven with error and inseparable from the state of being human is something abput which most of us live in denial. Schulz uncovers some of the universal characteristics of being wrong in a way that is more palatable than some of the ways society reminds us we are wrong. We are wired to resist the notion of our own fallibility, so this deft touch is necessary in order to circumvent our natural resistance. At the same time, she highlights the benefits of acknowledging and embracing our error in order to better our communities, our interpersonal relationships, and ourselves. For example:""This is one of the most powerful ways being wrong can transform us. It can help us be more compassionate people. Being right might be fun, but as we've seen, it has a tendency to bring out the worst in us. By contrast, being wrong might is often the furthest thing in the world from fun, and yet, in the end, it has the potential to bring out the best in us. Or, rather, to change us for the better.""This book now is added to 2 others - Tim Nochols' The Death of Expertise and Han Roslings's Factfulness- that I would recommend to any of my acquaintances who are trying to grapple with the perceived and real societal grievances battering for their attention. Schulz can get a little long-winded in places, but this is a deep topic and I found that if I hung with her she eventually led me to her point.One of my favorite passages is what I hope people gain from reading this book:""If you really want to be right, or at least improve the odds of being right, you have to start by acknowledging your fallibility. Deliberately seeking out your mistakes. And figuring out what caused you to make them."""

In all, Schulz does an admirable job of selecting her chosen anecdotes and ends up with a satisfying and thought-provoking read.NotesPerhaps the history of the errors of mankind, all things considered, is more valuable and interesting than that of their discoveries. Truth is uniform and narrow; it constantly exists, and does not seem to require so much an active energy, as a passive aptitude of the soul in order to encounter it. But error is endlessly diversified; it has no reality, but is the pure and simple creation of the mind that invents it. In this field the soul has room enough to expand herself, to display all her boundless faculties, and all her beautiful and interesting extravagancies and absurdities.—Benjamin Franklin______Many of the religious thinkers who tried to understand why we err found their answer at the gates of the Garden of Eden. Thus Thomas Aquinas, the thirteenth-century scholastic, held that we make mistakes because, when we were banished from paradise, we were cut off forever from direct access to divine truth. To Aquinas and many of his fellow theologians, our errors arise from the gap between our own limited and blemished minds and God’s unlimited and perfect omniscience.This same basic idea has received countless secular treatments as well. Plato thought that our primordial soul was at one with the universe, and that we only began to err when we took on our current physical form and forgot those cosmic truths. The Enlightenment philosopher John Locke thought that error seeped into our lives from the gap between the artificiality of words and the reality of the things they name—from the distance between an indescribable essence and the nearest sayable thing. The German philosopher Martin Heidegger thought that error could be explained by the fact that we live in time and space; because we are bound to a particular set of coordinates, we can’t rise above them and see reality as a whole, from a bird’s-eye (or God’s-eye) view. As different as these explanations seem, all these thinkers and many more conceived of error as arising from a gap: sometimes between the particular and the general, sometimes between words and things, sometimes between the present and the primeval, sometimes between the mortal and the divine—but in every case, and fundamentally, between our own mind and the rest of the world.For the most part, we spend our lives blithely ignoring this gap. And with good reason. Who wants to be reminded of the fall from grace, the separation from truth, the particular and limited nature of our existence? ______How can we square this feeling of rightness with the very real possibility that we are wrong? This is a question that haunts all of wrongology, not just errors of memory. The problem is suggested by the very phrase “the feeling of knowing.” In life, as in language, we begin with a psychological state (the “feeling” part) and end up with a claim about the truth (the “knowing” part). In other words, we feel that we are right because we feel that we are right: we take our own certainty as an indicator of accuracy. This isn’t completely foolish of us, since studies show that there is some correlation between confidence and correctness. But it isn’t completely foolproof, either. As the case of flashbulb memories makes clear, our certainty reflects the existence of a particularly vivid inner picture. But nothing in life guarantees that this picture reflects the real state of affairs.This reliance on a vivid inner picture helps explain why memories are particularly apt to trigger the feeling of knowing.______ The philosopher Avishai Marga lit put this nicely. ""It is not the case that I am caught in a web of beliefs,"" he wrote. "" . . . Rather, I am caught in a network of witnesses."" Our relationships to these ""witnesses""-the people and institutions that attest to the truth of various beliefs-predate and determine our reaction to whatever information they supply. As Margalit said, ""my belief in [one of these witnesses] is prior to my belief that (what she says is true)."" Belief in is prior: however far this might be from our sense of how we should form our ideas about the world, it is the first principle of how we actually do so. All of us are caught in Margalit's ""networks of witnesses""­ not just in one but in many, and not just from time to time but all the time, from the moment we are born until the day we die. As countless commen­tators have observed, this lends to our beliefs an element of the arbitrary. Montaigne, for instance, remarked that people ""are swept [into a belief]­ either by the custom of their country or by their parental upbringing, or by chance-as by a tempest, without judgment or choice, indeed most often before the age of discretion.""______These latter­ day zealots have hailed from many different backgrounds and held many different beliefs. At heart, though, and paradoxically, they have all shared a single conviction: that they and they alone are in possession of the truth. (The very word ""zealot"" comes from a Greek root meaning to be jealous of the truth-to guard it as your own.) What zealots have in common, then, is the absolute conviction that they are right. In fact, of all the symbolic ones and zeros that extremists use to write their ideological binary codes­ us/them, same/different, good/evil-the fundamental one is right/wrong. Zealotry demands a complete rejection of the possibility of error. The conviction that we cannot possibly be wrong: this is certainty.______[O]ur be­liefs come in bundles. That makes it hard to remove or replace one without affecting the others-and it gets harder as the belief in question gets more central. In this respect, beliefs are like the beams in a building or the words in a sentence: you can't eliminate one and expect the fundamental sound­ ness or fundamental meaning of the overall system to remain unchanged. As a result, being wrong sometimes triggers a cascade of transformations so extensive that the belief system that emerges afterward bears almost no resemblance to its predecessor. ______You fight your superficiality, your shallowness, so as to try to come at people without unreal expectations, without an overload of bias or hope or arrogance, as untanklike as you can be . . . and yet you never fail to get them wrong. You might as well have the brain of a tank. You get them wrong before you meet them: you get them wrong while you're with them and then you get home to tell somebody else about the meeting and you get them all wrong again. Since the same generally goes for them with you, the whole thing is really a dazzling illusion empty of all perception, an astonishing farce of misperception. And yet what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people, which gets bled of the significance we think it has and takes on a significance that is ludicrous, so ill equipped are we all to envision one another's interior workings and invisible aims? . . . The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway. It's getting them wrong that is living, getting them wrong and wrong and wrong and then, on careful reconsideration, getting them wrong again . That's how we know we are alive: we're wrong. —Phillip Roth, American Pastoral______We go to our jobs, stop by the bar on our way home, hang out with our friends, raise our kids­ because these things are the stuff of life, to be sure, but also because they are strategies for keeping the terror of isolation in check. Soren Kierkeg­aard, that existentialist before there was existentialism, compared us in this respect to those early American pioneers who banged on their pots and pans all night long, hoping to keep the wolves at bay. Keeping wolves at bay is a start. But of all our ways of dealing with this rift, our favorite by far is the one that promises to eliminate it entirely­ to transform our desert island into a tropical paradise, our fundamental separation into ecstatic union. This strategy is our last, best hope for escap­ing the loneliness of existence and giving despair the slip. I am talking, of course, about love.______The idea that we possess a true self serves a hugely important psycho­ logical purpose. If we have an essential and unchanging identity, one we are destined to discover sooner or later, then the beliefs we hold, the choices we make, the person we become-none of this happens by chance. Instead, the entire course of our lives is inevitable, dictated by the certainty that our real self will eventually surface...This narrative is appealing for the same reason that it is problematic: within it, we can do no wrong. Our false beliefs were foreordained, our ap­parent errors occurred strictly in the service of a larger truth. This idea is made explicit in the religious affirmation that ""God makes no mistakes"": even the seeming trials and blunders of our lives are part of a larger plan: As that implies, stories starring a true self are teleological; we end up exactly where we are meant to be. This, too, is both an attraction and a weakness of the idea of an essential self. It suggests that our lives are deterministic, that yesterday's convictions-which we thought we chose based on their intellectual, emotional, or spiritual merits-were merely a trap into which we were lured for the benefit of some predetermined future self. Whatever meaning or worth our past might have had on its own terms is effectively written out of existence. Even more problematically, the idea of a true self suggests that we will never undergo momentous upheaval again. How could we? Having finally discovered who we really are and have always been, there is no further transformation available to us. If the self is constantly changing, then we can constantly feel our way forward, constantly become someone new-but if each of us possesses a fixed essence, then we can only return to it. Accord­ingly, our past departure from that essential self can only be a single and inexplicable aberration, associated as often as not with betrayal, transgres­sion, and sin. (Recall Chambers denouncing Communism, his erstwhile faith, as ""evil, absolute evil."") Singular, aberrational, transgressive, evil: we've seen this constellation of ideas before. This is the pessimistic model of wrongness, in which error is an unwelcome anomaly, a mark of our exile from the sacred realm of truth. Helpfully, this reminds us that we have another model for making sense of wrongness as well-one that casts a different light not only on our errors but also on ourselves. Here, wrongness is a natural and ongoing process, and we are not deformed but transformed by it. ______""The main in­terest in life and work,"" said Foucault, ""is to become someone else that you were not in the beginning."" Such transformations don't only come about through wrongness, of course-but wrongness is always an opportunity for such transformations. ______I was of three minds, Like a tree In which there are three blackbirds. —Wallace Stevens, 13 Ways of Looking at a Blackbird______His desire to banish art is part of a long and often sinister tradition (which we glimpsed earlier) of trying to create ideal societies through eradicating error in all its forms. All of those disgruntled undergraduates, meanwhile, are motivated in part-whether they know it or not-by the optimistic model of wrongness. They recognize, as most of us do, not just the legitimacy but also the poten­tial beauty and power of individual, skewed, inaccurate representations of reality. In this model, the link between error and art i s not a n indictment of art but a defense of error. Cut off from the absolute essence of things-that ideal form that Plato felt existed only in the mind of God-our separate, subjective consciousnesses look around and see, instead, Water Lilies, or Starry Night, or Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Likewise, we can make Beowulf and Star Wars and Horton Hears a Who! for the same reason we can make mistakes: because, as I said earlier, we are capable of conjuring the world not just as it is, but also as it is not. Our capacity to err is inseparable from our imagination.______The most famous formulation of this relationship between art, doubt, and error comes from the Romantic poet John Keats. He had been talking over various matters with a friend, he wrote to his brothers in a letter in 1 817, ""and at once it struck me,"" what quality went to form a Man of Achievement especially in lit­erature & which Shakespeare possessed so enormously-! mean Negative Capability, that is when man is capable of being in un­certainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact & reason.Keats's attitude toward uncertainty-and, for that matter, toward ""fact & reason""-is not the common one. He embraced unknowability and falli­bility, but not for the utilitarian purposes we saw in the last chapter. There, the point of embracing error was to curtail it-a kind of homeopathic rem­ edy for wrongness. But Keats wasn't interested in remedying wrongness. He recognized error and art as conjoined twins, born of the same place and vital to one another's existence. In life as in linguistics, art is joined at the root to artificial-to the not-true, the unreal-just as a fiction is at once a creation and a falsehood. ______But unlike androids, we humans do not nor­ mally self-destruct in the face of our mistakes. On the contrary: we self­ create, and self-recreate. This idea of self-creation suggests something else important about error. Being wrong doesn't just make us human in general; it also helps make each of us the specific person we are. In our inability to get things exactly right, in the idiosyncrasies of our private visions of the world, the outline of selfhood appears. This is what Benjamin Franklin was getting at in the quote I used as an epigraph to this book. Error, he wrote, is ""the pure and simple creation of the mind that invents it,"" a place where ""the soul has room enough to expand herself."" Mistakes, he ·meant, are the evidence and expression of an individual identity. This is an idea with deep and important roots in our intellectual history. It is, in essence, the crucial insight of evolutionary theory. Because of errors in the replication of genetic sequences, we wind up with variation among individual members of a species; and because of that variation, the species as a whole can adapt and survive. Such errors literally keep their hosts alive. A population that is too small or too homogenous to support significant genetic variation is doomed. For every species, then, error is a mechanism of survival and change. For us human organisms, with our richer relation­ ship to wrongness, mistakes enable not only our biological evolution but our social, emotional, and intellectual evolution as well. And wrongness also allows us to thrive in another way. I began this book by noting that we think of being right as essential to our survival and happiness, but in one key respect, nothing could be further from the truth. Countless studies have shown that people who suffer from depression have more accurate worldviews than nondepressed people. Depressed people do not nurture the cheering illusion that they can control the course of their lives. They rarely possess the conviction, so common in the rest of us, that they are above average in virtually every respect. And they understand, all too acutely, the basic conditions of existence: that their lifespan is just a brief blip in the cold sweep of history, that suffering is real and ongoing, that they and all the people they love are going to die. That outlook is known as depressive realism. Depressed people might be unhappy, but­ when it comes to these big-picture, existential matters-they are generally more right than the rest of us. It scarcely requires saying that this kind of rightness is not fun. ""To see the world as it really is is devastating and terrifying,"" wrote the philosopher Ernest Becker. "" . . . It makes thoughtless living in the world of men an im­possibility. It places a trembling animal at the mercy of the entire cosmos and the problem of the meaning of it."" As that indicates, the correlation between accuracy and depression runs both ways: people who are depressed tend to perceive the harsher realities of life more clearly, and people who clearly perceive those harsh realities tend to be (or to get) depressed. In an odd reversal of the usual state of affairs, when it comes to these existential issues, the bigger and more important the belief, the less it pays to be right. That's why, as I've said, the goal of therapy isn't necessarily to make our beliefs more accurate; it is to make them more functional. Ronnie Janoff­ Bulman, the psychologist, has even argued that ""a key to the good life might well be illusions at our deepest, most generalized level of assump­ tions and accuracy at the most specific, least abstract levels."" (Fortunately for us, these two perspectives are compatible: research suggests that people who possess a generally positive outlook are better at acknowledging their everyday errors and changing their minds.) If excessive accuracy in our self-image and worldview is correlated with depression, the opposite is true, too. Sometimes, being wrong makes us happy. Think of Don Quixote, that exemplary knight errant, who lent his name to the condition of being pleasantly deluded. "
191,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5511477-forrest,5,"It would be easy to simply say that reading Being Wrong is a small but powerful life changing experience. It very much is, but just saying that is a bit of a cop-out. The book is a brilliantly written examination of the concept of error from every perspective imaginable. Schulz explores wrongness as an outside observer, a philosopher, a victim and a compassionate friend. By so fully embracing the idea on every level, she synthesizes a unified thesis from many disparate parts and supports every conclusion she draws with the best in logic and anecdote.At the core of Being Wrong is a suggestion. Not advice, so much as a recommendation for people interested in living a little better. Embrace your mistakes. It’s not about making mistakes and not feeling bad about it. Schulz wants us all to live with our errors a little more and not shove them away in a flurry of denial and justification. She goes on to examine the reasons why we are so adverse to being wrong, from the biological, (it doesn’t make evolutionary sense to be uncertain about anything) to the social, (our culture rejects leader figures who are indecisive) to the psychological. (depressed people have much more accurate worldviews than balanced personalties)Schulz is at her strongest when she is telling a story. The highlights of the books are the anecdotes she uses to set up each of her chapters. The stories include everything from Alan Greenspan’s unwavering faith in the economy proved wrong, to the touching story of an Exalted Cyclops of the KKK becoming one of the frontline fighters in the war for desegregated schools. Schulz has a deft hand for splicing these stories with the philosophical and scientific meat that connect them back to the reader’s everyday experience. She does tend to get bogged down in some of the dense history of the topic, but the frequent footnotes and witty asides help to break these thick sections up a little.The text itself induces stumbling, at least for me. It’s probably because the subject matter makes me paranoid that I’ve missed something, or misinterpreted a critical conclusion. To that end, I’d really recommend reading this book in chapters, rather than tackling the entire thing all at once. The writing lends it self to easy sectioning and while reading order is important, the ideas are all pretty sticky, which makes it easier to spread over time.Close to the end of the third section, Schulz examines the story of Penny Beerntsen, a woman who was raped and ended up falsely accusing another man of the crime. He was eventually proved innocent, but in the interim the woman had struggled to get closure in other ways. She wanted to understand the reasons people did horrible things to each other. To do this, she volunteered in prisons and really got to know the realities of being a convicted criminal in the United States. When the verdict came down proving that she had identified the wrong man, she was horrified, but she instantly accepted her mistake and wanted to somehow make up for it. Rather than try to deny her fault, she only sought to improve the life of the man she had thrown into prison unjustly.While this is an extreme example, I can’t think of a better example of being a truly human person. It would be an exaggeration to say I want be like Penny, but her example is one that I can value as someone who can be wrong and can be stupid about it. And really, we all fall into that category sometimes. Anyone who has ever been a critic of any kind knows the giddy thrill of being unquestionably right. (you cannot successfully argue against opinion) It is never a bad thing to gain a little perspective on that feeling, and that’s just what this book has allowed me to do."

But more gastric: sometimes, instead of wanting to die, we just want to vomit. Or so one might assume from the strangely culinary vocabulary we use to talk about being wrong. In the aftermath of our mistakes, we eat crow, eat humble pie, eat our hat, or, at the other end of the sartorial menu, eat our shoe. And, of course, we eat our words.

The Latin, in turn, gave us the English word “erratic,” used to describe movement that is unpredictable or aimless.

It is a neglected and deeply human attribute: being wrong, feeling wrong, discovering one's wrongness, changing as a result—or, more usually, denying it, ducking and running from the acknowledgement of error. I was fascinated, particularly so once I got through the first chapters. The writing is a curious mix of academic rigour and convivial, almost conversational, English. I found the book deeply engrossing, and it gave me perspective about my own error-filled journey. I finished the book a few days ago, and I am still turning it over in my mind. Highly recommend."
195,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2011274-brian,5,"Have you ever been wrong? Of course you have. Everybody makes mistakes and many people talk like that is all they do, ""Oh I am always messing up"" they might say. Now try reflecting on the moment when you realized that you were wrong about something. Don't reflect on your past beliefs, whether trivial or not, but rather think of that moment where you shifted from knowing that you were right to knowing that you were not. How did that moment feel when you realized that you were wrong, not when you were actually wrong but when you realized you were wrong?There isn't an external force that can inform us of the correctness or incorrectness of our beliefs a priori and therefore prevent us from making minor or grave mistakes. We have to force ourselves to reckon our beliefs with the external world and when we find our beliefs at odds with the world, it hurts. When we are wrong we feel alone, the moment we recognize our errors is "". . . a moment of alienation, both from ourselves and from [our] previously convincing vision of the world.""This profound and well grounded skepticism about things that feel so right and natural to us is deeply troubling to me. Schulz's prose is very good and is a joy to read and quote* but I have to admit that reflecting on our tendency to err, often in disastrous ways, is unsettling. I think it is disturbing because it goes against our nature not only to know but also to be known. In the current american culture the sexual attraction to others is pretty overt and therefore almost ever present in our minds. But I think we forget about the attractions we have to others than have nothing to do with sex or physical appearances at all. A meeting of the minds is a truly rewarding experience wherein our views of the world are validated and shared. We are in agreement with others about being correct and that is deeply satisfying. Again, Schulz says it a bit better:“Think about how distressing it is to feel misunderstood, and how frustrating it is when someone believes something about you—that you’re irresponsible or can’t handle commitment or don’t pull your weight at work—that you think is untrue. Conversely, there are few things more gratifying than the feeling that someone deeply understands us. In fact, as we are about to see, this feeling of being of being “gotten” is the sine qua non of our most important relationships, and the very hallmark of being in love.”[4]Full review here:http://wp.me/p6r7eE-2P"
196,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8744761-william,5,"This is an impressive and surprisingly enjoyable book. While Schulz is a journalist, the work seems closer to scholarly than journalistic, though it has a lighter touch than scholarship typically achieves. In reading it, don't skip the foot- and endnotes. There is often good stuff there.I experienced ""Being Wrong"" on three levels, and it works exceptionally well on two of them. To begin with, Schulz makes a compelling case that being wrong is by and large more a constructive thing than a negative one. Emotion, creativity and humor, she points out, draw heavily on error to be compelling. While it is explicitly not her intention, there is a self-help aspect to the book which works well. It was impossible for me to read it and not say to myself: ""Hey, lighten up. You don;t have to get everything right the first -- or second, or third -- time.The second level on which i found the book effective is just as good reading. Schultz writes well and with impressive wit. This book would be a good read if you even skipped the message and just read the stories which appear so frequently. My guess is I remember some of the stories better -- and will do so longer -- than the main purpose of the book.Where I find the book a little less satisfying is in the central argument. It's meticulous, sometimes to the point of tediousness. Who knew there was so much to write on this subject? And there are occasional generalizations with which I disagree. (1) We all disdain undecided voters. (177) Huh? (2) ""We almost never find ourselves between theories"" (186). Maybe it's just me, but there are frequently issues on which I have not made up my mind. (3) [quoting LaRochefoucauld] ""Everyone complains about their memory; no one complains about their judgment."" It seems to me all of us have had long talks with friends upset because they keep making the same mistake over and over, and we can often feel that way about ourselves as well.But regardless of my discomfort with some of the logic and a case which seems occasionally overstated, I found the book personally useful, certainly interesting and most of all both educational and entertaining."

That is not what this book is about. It does not try to approve or disapprove of making mistakes during an intentional brain dump (or storm). It does not try to repackage any established wisdom heard at a marketing conference. This book should not be pigeon-holded as ""self-help"" or ""business"" even though it may, by chance, give you the perceptual tools to somehow fix a decision you recently made, or are about to make, or help you stop hating your niece for joining that cult back in the 90s.It DOES research the history of why we feel, or believe, and why the final decision we make is believed to be true. Because this topic is covered from its most simple origin of sensing and belief you may have to read a few chapters before you get to one that changes the way you perceive the world. However you will enjoy the historical, personal and scientific references that are threaded throughout. Its funny and well written while it is smart, clever and funny. Bill Clinton reviewed it for f#ck sake, so you know its got to be pretty good. Albeit he probably spends most of every day trying to figure out why he did most of what he did in the 80s and 90s.Still not convinced? Well, the author did a TED talk that you may enjoy. If nothing else it will get you to experience her insightful fun voice of her writing which I really enjoy. "

I'm not even sure why that is because I have just been nothing but fascinated, especially so at all the research this book must have required to write. The amount of work in putting the book together is not lost on me. My guess would be that this is one of those books that a college professor would assign to his class. I read it through once, and then reread each chapter once more if not twice for some. I have never taken any college courses but IO have self educated to a certain (non) degree. There is no doubt that I have really enjoyed this book, for I have penciled in some notes and highlighted sections, something I try to avoid doing usually. I am pretty impressed with the entire book, references and the authors personal references. All of which has really made for an interesting study of Being Wrong. I'm very pleased to add that this is one more of the books I've read that I will being easily entertained by and probably get more out of each time I go through it in the future."
199,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5881280-steve-penner,4,"""Being Wrong"" was a wonderful and fascinating plunge into the world of wrongology. It covers a wide-ranging host of topics on error, how it happens and particularly how we respond to being wrong. Her basic premise is that there are two models of error. One model propounds error as something to be avoided at all costs as it provides no benefits, only embarrassment and shame. The second, which Schulz celebrates, is that error is common and natural. It's benefit is that we can learn, grow and change as a result. It's a very positive spin on a topic that has been dealt with by Plato and other classic writers, Augustine and Aquinas, Enlightenment thinkers, Freud and many other comtemporary writers. Schulz is a wonderful story teller and her stories are the highlight of the book. She can be slightly irritating as a writer when she continually states that the topic ""is something I'll deal with later."" This ""pre-figuring"" happens at least 20 times and becomes wearisome. Hopefully a future editor will do a better job of tightening up this habit. Overall and beyond my pettiness, I heartily recommend this as a wonderful, leisurely read in which you will certainly learn something about history, literature and yourself."

It kinda took me 2 hours to finish 30 pages or so.. *english is my 2nd language here*.. The book starts so well into its core concept and it keeps going so thoroughly discussing the ideas and concepts. sometimes it goes all the way to the core of philosophy and logic and all these mind twisting concepts of error and wrong and emotion and perception..At other chapters you feel like the introduction of the chapter never ends and takes so so long it kinda makes you lost and bored into it.. at others, it's like you're in a river of fluid stream of ideas so connected you don't feel yourself in its beauty.. but if there's one thing to notice, it's gonna be the effort the author put in compiling all the MASSIVE information of the different perspectives and sources and fields of knowledge it's admirable..I love this book, it's one of those books you feel sad you finished, and you feel like you've changed your perspective about so many things in life after reading..

Schulz breaks down rather complex philosophical and psychological issues to easily understood concepts with direct practical application. Further, she does this without removing the terminology, making it easy for people to continue studying long after they've finished this book. This is not a work of post-modern woowoo, where being wrong means no truth can ever be determined. Instead this is a nuanced understanding of our human lives, filled as they are with probabilistic knowledge rather than absolutist dogma, and where we can trust our minds to do what they do, create stories, not form perfect encyclopedic recall. Doing so allows Schulz to make a truly delightful and helpful contribution to our existence: that being wrong is not something to attack like some horrid beast but an inevitable aspect of our lives to embrace and seek always to see how our mental tendencies to error can be mitigated through understanding.

I've found it really hard to focus on this book, due to the fact that I don't know all of the terms she mentions. Unfortunately it seems to happen so frequently, that i'd have to have a dictionary next to me through the entire book. Honestly, that's just not something I really want to do at this point.Maybe eventually, I'll be able to give the book my full attention, but for now, I'm unable to even get to chapter 2.

A compelling aspect of Being Wrong is a set of arguments for the value of making errors or being wrong. An obsession with eliminating all errors may result in worse outcomes. For example, by taking risks and making some errors, you can learn much more than by sticking with safe decisions.One of the most interesting chapters covered areas of wrongness and criminology, starting off with the story of Steven Avery's 18-year sentence for a crime he didn't commit. That was followed by a note that he was later convicted of a murder, the only setback to date of the Wisconsin Innocence Project. Just two days after I read that chapter, I read an article about the Netflix documentary Making a Murderer that suggests that Avery might also be innocent of that crime, framed once again by the same bad cops."

205,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11297501-anna,5,"Kathryn Schulz argues passionately for the value of error. She shows us that not only is 'being wrong' a given in life, it is also a gift that has the power to transform our worldviews, our relationships, and ourselves. By drawing on philosophy, neuroscience, psycholoanalysts and a bit of common sense, she charts out the intellectual history of the shifting definitions and attitudes ascribed to being wrong and masterfully combines it with relevant & relatable examples from the present day. Schulz is a terrific thinker & and she writes with an elegant clarity and simplicity that make it nearly impossible to believe this is her first book (it seems as though she has done this before). Definitely one of the best things I have read in years. I am kind of in love with her now. Check out her Ted talks. "
206,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826906-laura,4,"I saw the author speak (very entertainingly) at an education conference, which was appropriate since - as she argues persuasively - being wrong is an inextricable part of learning and imagination. Yet in education we can often inadvertently send a message that error is something to fear and avoid. This is an entertaining book which would have been enhanced by some cross-cultural examination - e.g. how is error conceived of in cultures with a very different sense of self? Nevertheless, it's a rare book that really is relevant to everyone - but since we've all been wrong, are currently wrong (though we don't yet know how) and will be wrong at some point in the future, we can all find something to learn and relate to here."

It seems that much of the firepower is arraigned towards the writing style, especially the mix of academic language with the more colloquial. I admit I'm a sucker for that mix, so I've enjoyed her style mostly. Also, David seemed to say that the problem was that it got bogged down in semantics and word games, but I actually thought there was more emphasis on neuro-biology with anecdotes thrown in. She wasn't always the most illuminating--do I really need to hear about the old woman/young woman picture one more time?--but I think it helps flesh out the constellation of issues around our own images of ourselves and our rightness. At least, it makes my staff meeting make a whole lot more sense."

Still an interesting topic and discussion, although I think I agree with an earlier reviewer that the section on Love was not really related to the rest of the book and not really apropos to the topic. I found the idea of pessimistic versus optimistic views of wrongness intriguing. The author did inject some mild humor throughout the book that made the book more fun to read without being over the top or distracting.

209,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3761228-adman,4,"Insightful, therapeutic, and hopeful, this book belies its title inasmuch as it surveys error not so much as frontier but heartland, nay, even as a sort of self-sown weed of fate that springs out of any coordinates in any plot of land where we happen to plant our flag of sureness. Schulz crosses all sorts of habitual borders within which we assume we have found safety from error (or accidents, or sin) and shows that we badly overestimate such security (victory, righteousness). She does so with compassion and zeal, and this time stays quite true to her title. It really is an adventure to her to knock down the ego's badly-constructed refuges and blaze a new trail for how we think and act. It is not a sadistic or despairing adventure, though: Schulz believes this eyes-open journey can be better for her and for all of us than how we usually get along in life.Schulz covers a lot of territory. Material and mental subjects are treated in this book, from, say, stepping on a rake to the meta-mistake of rationalizing the mishap (intentional, unavoidable, someone else's fault, or really anything else other than our own error). Schulz hikes around between memory and science, moves from the mundane to the dramatic, sits down to chat with romance, politics, and religion. She does all this with a diplomacy that surprised and gladdened me. Taking a page from her own reflections, I wonder how much her topical environment guided her and her editors to observe even-handedly and deliver cautious judgments. I wish other authors would take note. Any of us, really, who is less blatantly kept in line by whatever happens to be the topic at hand might benefit from Schulz's choice. Far too much intellectual and practical territory, in print or in person, is overrun far too often by refusing to be open and hospitable about error -- in ourselves or others.The trail in this book does not lead to a new shelter where we can rest again from the hard work of living. Instead, how we make and walk our path seems to be Schulz's source of inspiration. How much better off might we be if we acknowledge and respect our seemingly inexhaustible capacity for error? What if we did not retreat in either denial or despair? What if we ventured from time to time out of the refuge of the self into the crowd or, the reverse, from the masses into the self? What if we diverted some of our energy from purging and purifying and celebrated and cultivated the capacity of some institutions -- art, religion, certain forms of government -- to introduce us to our limitations?I was struck by how relationship-oriented this book is. I suppose Schulz might respond, how could it not be? First of all and obviously, the book is not part of me -- not in my traditional sense of self. As with any book, I am contending with a thing outside of me. The book is not Ms. Schulz either, but rather a shadow-her that emerged as she researched and wrote, a page-bound self she may have hoped would reflect her living self. This shadow then introduced me, the reader, to other various, astute shadow-thinkers, -scientists, -theologians, and -philosophers. They all shared with me their experiences of a gap between the self and the world and also shared their ill-begotten efforts to remedy that gap. What a wilderness of joining and separating this is to be lost in! So many glances and so many voices have been cast over so many stone walls that stretch and tangle across an endless, fog-shrouded pasture of human experience.Or, if you prefer Ms. Schulz's own, less striving metaphor, life is like a game of telephone, and we often can't make up our minds how to feel -- or what to do -- about the inevitable degeneration of the initial message (though of course no one alive can lay claim to that first message) and our powerlessness to steer that degeneration.Schulz really gets to the bottom of things when she observes that we are in search of wholeness more than we are in search of rightness. Like small children, we want unity between whatever we understand to be the self and the not-self. Error -- accident, sin, the comical-or-frustrating evolution of the message in telephone, defeat at the hands of one's pen, keyboard, numb fingers or mute tongue to put one's spirit in touch with one's blind and deaf neighbors -- represents our failure (or, as we often like to pretend, the failure of others) to be one.Fortunately, around this point in the book, Schulz made an unexpected digression to identify art with error. I have often been driven to desperation and something in the neighborhood of madness by my inability to write poems or stories that express what I wish to convey in details or intensity. What a welcome, unexpected relief it was to read John Keats (among others) describing imperfection as the necessary and desired product of artistic endeavor. Why? I don't recall the line of reasoning she establishes but in the moment that I am writing this, I take it to mean that artistic error is evidence -- of the self, one's hopes, one's intentions, one's peculiar, unrepeatable humanness. It is evidence precisely in its failure to convey exactly what I want it to -- evidence of difference, disunity, and striving toward something else.Schulz ultimately praises error -- with a bit of hedging and a bashful allusion to the Judeochristian story of the Fall. She is not quite comfortable with blatantly saying bad is good. She simply wishes to offer hope that error is not the harbinger of doom we take it -- and often make it -- to be. Instead, it is a circumstance, a lesson, a challenge, an invitation."

214,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72842365-ryan-derby-talbot,5,"Book summary: There are two fundamental and unavoidable components to being a human being: one is the need to chase the feeling of being right –– of having solidity and comfort in how we experience and respond to the world. The other is dealing with being wrong: dealing with error, the inevitable (and sometimes devastating) encounters we have when our expectations end up not aligning with reality. This book is about how we cannot escape either of these forces, and what results — negative or positive –– we can get from attempting to navigate this tension.Our need to chase being right –– and the resulting confidence, empowerment and belongingness (proxies for love?) that come with the feeling of rightness –– run up against and try to discount and rule out all the ways we inevitably can get things wrong: through illusions, false or overstated beliefs, skewed understandings of data, biases, social influences that lead us astray, emotional investments in perspectives or communities, the need to feel love, and flat out denial. We have difficulty even seeing wrongness in action in us (thinking we are far more objective and omniscient than we are), partly because it is such a fleeting force –– striking either too quickly or too slowly for us to catch it. Moreover, we struggle with identifying and acknowledging wrongness because of the strong emotional and cognitive forces (the desire for the feeling of certainty, the biases) that protect us, and keep us overwhelmingly invested in particular perspectives at the expense of other perspectives more aligned with reality. However much we may want to insist on the contrary or wish away our propensity to get things wrong (and we do this routinely), if we actually look at it, we invariably, deeply, absurdly, and inevitably get things wrong. Actually facing this truth doesn’t need to doom us, however, to defeated nihilism. The gap between our perspectives and the world make possible our two distinctly powerful human abilities: imagination and empathy. (Both are the result of allowing more than one perspective in a situation, of permitting a bigger notion than just a single “rightness.”) Successful incorporation and integration of our own wrongness –– which requires going through the excruciating emotional pain of admitting and allowing wrongness –– expands our sensitivities and perspectives as human beings. Collectively, our relationship with the gap also makes possible the two best products of human work, art and science. At root, error –– encountering the gap –– contributes to diversity, wonder, and richness of human experience. Alas, however, it will not ever lead us to a refuge of solid objectivity. Alas, there is no magic formula for dealing with the tensions between our desired rightness and inevitable wrongness. We can, however, recognize the growth and wondrous (mystical?) perspectives that are available in confronting their clash within us, the fundamental and inevitable experience of being a human being.

215,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45191284-beth,4,"Kathryn Schulz delves into all the ways we can be wrong, explaining the strange whys and hows or error generation, denial, and results. The fact that the fabric of humanity is interwoven with error and inseparable from the state of being human is something abput which most of us live in denial. Schulz uncovers some of the universal characteristics of being wrong in a way that is more palatable than some of the ways society reminds us we are wrong. We are wired to resist the notion of our own fallibility, so this deft touch is necessary in order to circumvent our natural resistance. At the same time, she highlights the benefits of acknowledging and embracing our error in order to better our communities, our interpersonal relationships, and ourselves. For example:""This is one of the most powerful ways being wrong can transform us. It can help us be more compassionate people. Being right might be fun, but as we've seen, it has a tendency to bring out the worst in us. By contrast, being wrong might is often the furthest thing in the world from fun, and yet, in the end, it has the potential to bring out the best in us. Or, rather, to change us for the better.""This book now is added to 2 others - Tim Nochols' The Death of Expertise and Han Roslings's Factfulness- that I would recommend to any of my acquaintances who are trying to grapple with the perceived and real societal grievances battering for their attention. Schulz can get a little long-winded in places, but this is a deep topic and I found that if I hung with her she eventually led me to her point.One of my favorite passages is what I hope people gain from reading this book:""If you really want to be right, or at least improve the odds of being right, you have to start by acknowledging your fallibility. Deliberately seeking out your mistakes. And figuring out what caused you to make them."""

In all, Schulz does an admirable job of selecting her chosen anecdotes and ends up with a satisfying and thought-provoking read.NotesPerhaps the history of the errors of mankind, all things considered, is more valuable and interesting than that of their discoveries. Truth is uniform and narrow; it constantly exists, and does not seem to require so much an active energy, as a passive aptitude of the soul in order to encounter it. But error is endlessly diversified; it has no reality, but is the pure and simple creation of the mind that invents it. In this field the soul has room enough to expand herself, to display all her boundless faculties, and all her beautiful and interesting extravagancies and absurdities.—Benjamin Franklin______Many of the religious thinkers who tried to understand why we err found their answer at the gates of the Garden of Eden. Thus Thomas Aquinas, the thirteenth-century scholastic, held that we make mistakes because, when we were banished from paradise, we were cut off forever from direct access to divine truth. To Aquinas and many of his fellow theologians, our errors arise from the gap between our own limited and blemished minds and God’s unlimited and perfect omniscience.This same basic idea has received countless secular treatments as well. Plato thought that our primordial soul was at one with the universe, and that we only began to err when we took on our current physical form and forgot those cosmic truths. The Enlightenment philosopher John Locke thought that error seeped into our lives from the gap between the artificiality of words and the reality of the things they name—from the distance between an indescribable essence and the nearest sayable thing. The German philosopher Martin Heidegger thought that error could be explained by the fact that we live in time and space; because we are bound to a particular set of coordinates, we can’t rise above them and see reality as a whole, from a bird’s-eye (or God’s-eye) view. As different as these explanations seem, all these thinkers and many more conceived of error as arising from a gap: sometimes between the particular and the general, sometimes between words and things, sometimes between the present and the primeval, sometimes between the mortal and the divine—but in every case, and fundamentally, between our own mind and the rest of the world.For the most part, we spend our lives blithely ignoring this gap. And with good reason. Who wants to be reminded of the fall from grace, the separation from truth, the particular and limited nature of our existence? ______How can we square this feeling of rightness with the very real possibility that we are wrong? This is a question that haunts all of wrongology, not just errors of memory. The problem is suggested by the very phrase “the feeling of knowing.” In life, as in language, we begin with a psychological state (the “feeling” part) and end up with a claim about the truth (the “knowing” part). In other words, we feel that we are right because we feel that we are right: we take our own certainty as an indicator of accuracy. This isn’t completely foolish of us, since studies show that there is some correlation between confidence and correctness. But it isn’t completely foolproof, either. As the case of flashbulb memories makes clear, our certainty reflects the existence of a particularly vivid inner picture. But nothing in life guarantees that this picture reflects the real state of affairs.This reliance on a vivid inner picture helps explain why memories are particularly apt to trigger the feeling of knowing.______ The philosopher Avishai Marga lit put this nicely. ""It is not the case that I am caught in a web of beliefs,"" he wrote. "" . . . Rather, I am caught in a network of witnesses."" Our relationships to these ""witnesses""-the people and institutions that attest to the truth of various beliefs-predate and determine our reaction to whatever information they supply. As Margalit said, ""my belief in [one of these witnesses] is prior to my belief that (what she says is true)."" Belief in is prior: however far this might be from our sense of how we should form our ideas about the world, it is the first principle of how we actually do so. All of us are caught in Margalit's ""networks of witnesses""­ not just in one but in many, and not just from time to time but all the time, from the moment we are born until the day we die. As countless commen­tators have observed, this lends to our beliefs an element of the arbitrary. Montaigne, for instance, remarked that people ""are swept [into a belief]­ either by the custom of their country or by their parental upbringing, or by chance-as by a tempest, without judgment or choice, indeed most often before the age of discretion.""______These latter­ day zealots have hailed from many different backgrounds and held many different beliefs. At heart, though, and paradoxically, they have all shared a single conviction: that they and they alone are in possession of the truth. (The very word ""zealot"" comes from a Greek root meaning to be jealous of the truth-to guard it as your own.) What zealots have in common, then, is the absolute conviction that they are right. In fact, of all the symbolic ones and zeros that extremists use to write their ideological binary codes­ us/them, same/different, good/evil-the fundamental one is right/wrong. Zealotry demands a complete rejection of the possibility of error. The conviction that we cannot possibly be wrong: this is certainty.______[O]ur be­liefs come in bundles. That makes it hard to remove or replace one without affecting the others-and it gets harder as the belief in question gets more central. In this respect, beliefs are like the beams in a building or the words in a sentence: you can't eliminate one and expect the fundamental sound­ ness or fundamental meaning of the overall system to remain unchanged. As a result, being wrong sometimes triggers a cascade of transformations so extensive that the belief system that emerges afterward bears almost no resemblance to its predecessor. ______You fight your superficiality, your shallowness, so as to try to come at people without unreal expectations, without an overload of bias or hope or arrogance, as untanklike as you can be . . . and yet you never fail to get them wrong. You might as well have the brain of a tank. You get them wrong before you meet them: you get them wrong while you're with them and then you get home to tell somebody else about the meeting and you get them all wrong again. Since the same generally goes for them with you, the whole thing is really a dazzling illusion empty of all perception, an astonishing farce of misperception. And yet what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people, which gets bled of the significance we think it has and takes on a significance that is ludicrous, so ill equipped are we all to envision one another's interior workings and invisible aims? . . . The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway. It's getting them wrong that is living, getting them wrong and wrong and wrong and then, on careful reconsideration, getting them wrong again . That's how we know we are alive: we're wrong. —Phillip Roth, American Pastoral______We go to our jobs, stop by the bar on our way home, hang out with our friends, raise our kids­ because these things are the stuff of life, to be sure, but also because they are strategies for keeping the terror of isolation in check. Soren Kierkeg­aard, that existentialist before there was existentialism, compared us in this respect to those early American pioneers who banged on their pots and pans all night long, hoping to keep the wolves at bay. Keeping wolves at bay is a start. But of all our ways of dealing with this rift, our favorite by far is the one that promises to eliminate it entirely­ to transform our desert island into a tropical paradise, our fundamental separation into ecstatic union. This strategy is our last, best hope for escap­ing the loneliness of existence and giving despair the slip. I am talking, of course, about love.______The idea that we possess a true self serves a hugely important psycho­ logical purpose. If we have an essential and unchanging identity, one we are destined to discover sooner or later, then the beliefs we hold, the choices we make, the person we become-none of this happens by chance. Instead, the entire course of our lives is inevitable, dictated by the certainty that our real self will eventually surface...This narrative is appealing for the same reason that it is problematic: within it, we can do no wrong. Our false beliefs were foreordained, our ap­parent errors occurred strictly in the service of a larger truth. This idea is made explicit in the religious affirmation that ""God makes no mistakes"": even the seeming trials and blunders of our lives are part of a larger plan: As that implies, stories starring a true self are teleological; we end up exactly where we are meant to be. This, too, is both an attraction and a weakness of the idea of an essential self. It suggests that our lives are deterministic, that yesterday's convictions-which we thought we chose based on their intellectual, emotional, or spiritual merits-were merely a trap into which we were lured for the benefit of some predetermined future self. Whatever meaning or worth our past might have had on its own terms is effectively written out of existence. Even more problematically, the idea of a true self suggests that we will never undergo momentous upheaval again. How could we? Having finally discovered who we really are and have always been, there is no further transformation available to us. If the self is constantly changing, then we can constantly feel our way forward, constantly become someone new-but if each of us possesses a fixed essence, then we can only return to it. Accord­ingly, our past departure from that essential self can only be a single and inexplicable aberration, associated as often as not with betrayal, transgres­sion, and sin. (Recall Chambers denouncing Communism, his erstwhile faith, as ""evil, absolute evil."") Singular, aberrational, transgressive, evil: we've seen this constellation of ideas before. This is the pessimistic model of wrongness, in which error is an unwelcome anomaly, a mark of our exile from the sacred realm of truth. Helpfully, this reminds us that we have another model for making sense of wrongness as well-one that casts a different light not only on our errors but also on ourselves. Here, wrongness is a natural and ongoing process, and we are not deformed but transformed by it. ______""The main in­terest in life and work,"" said Foucault, ""is to become someone else that you were not in the beginning."" Such transformations don't only come about through wrongness, of course-but wrongness is always an opportunity for such transformations. ______I was of three minds, Like a tree In which there are three blackbirds. —Wallace Stevens, 13 Ways of Looking at a Blackbird______His desire to banish art is part of a long and often sinister tradition (which we glimpsed earlier) of trying to create ideal societies through eradicating error in all its forms. All of those disgruntled undergraduates, meanwhile, are motivated in part-whether they know it or not-by the optimistic model of wrongness. They recognize, as most of us do, not just the legitimacy but also the poten­tial beauty and power of individual, skewed, inaccurate representations of reality. In this model, the link between error and art i s not a n indictment of art but a defense of error. Cut off from the absolute essence of things-that ideal form that Plato felt existed only in the mind of God-our separate, subjective consciousnesses look around and see, instead, Water Lilies, or Starry Night, or Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Likewise, we can make Beowulf and Star Wars and Horton Hears a Who! for the same reason we can make mistakes: because, as I said earlier, we are capable of conjuring the world not just as it is, but also as it is not. Our capacity to err is inseparable from our imagination.______The most famous formulation of this relationship between art, doubt, and error comes from the Romantic poet John Keats. He had been talking over various matters with a friend, he wrote to his brothers in a letter in 1 817, ""and at once it struck me,"" what quality went to form a Man of Achievement especially in lit­erature & which Shakespeare possessed so enormously-! mean Negative Capability, that is when man is capable of being in un­certainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact & reason.Keats's attitude toward uncertainty-and, for that matter, toward ""fact & reason""-is not the common one. He embraced unknowability and falli­bility, but not for the utilitarian purposes we saw in the last chapter. There, the point of embracing error was to curtail it-a kind of homeopathic rem­ edy for wrongness. But Keats wasn't interested in remedying wrongness. He recognized error and art as conjoined twins, born of the same place and vital to one another's existence. In life as in linguistics, art is joined at the root to artificial-to the not-true, the unreal-just as a fiction is at once a creation and a falsehood. ______But unlike androids, we humans do not nor­ mally self-destruct in the face of our mistakes. On the contrary: we self­ create, and self-recreate. This idea of self-creation suggests something else important about error. Being wrong doesn't just make us human in general; it also helps make each of us the specific person we are. In our inability to get things exactly right, in the idiosyncrasies of our private visions of the world, the outline of selfhood appears. This is what Benjamin Franklin was getting at in the quote I used as an epigraph to this book. Error, he wrote, is ""the pure and simple creation of the mind that invents it,"" a place where ""the soul has room enough to expand herself."" Mistakes, he ·meant, are the evidence and expression of an individual identity. This is an idea with deep and important roots in our intellectual history. It is, in essence, the crucial insight of evolutionary theory. Because of errors in the replication of genetic sequences, we wind up with variation among individual members of a species; and because of that variation, the species as a whole can adapt and survive. Such errors literally keep their hosts alive. A population that is too small or too homogenous to support significant genetic variation is doomed. For every species, then, error is a mechanism of survival and change. For us human organisms, with our richer relation­ ship to wrongness, mistakes enable not only our biological evolution but our social, emotional, and intellectual evolution as well. And wrongness also allows us to thrive in another way. I began this book by noting that we think of being right as essential to our survival and happiness, but in one key respect, nothing could be further from the truth. Countless studies have shown that people who suffer from depression have more accurate worldviews than nondepressed people. Depressed people do not nurture the cheering illusion that they can control the course of their lives. They rarely possess the conviction, so common in the rest of us, that they are above average in virtually every respect. And they understand, all too acutely, the basic conditions of existence: that their lifespan is just a brief blip in the cold sweep of history, that suffering is real and ongoing, that they and all the people they love are going to die. That outlook is known as depressive realism. Depressed people might be unhappy, but­ when it comes to these big-picture, existential matters-they are generally more right than the rest of us. It scarcely requires saying that this kind of rightness is not fun. ""To see the world as it really is is devastating and terrifying,"" wrote the philosopher Ernest Becker. "" . . . It makes thoughtless living in the world of men an im­possibility. It places a trembling animal at the mercy of the entire cosmos and the problem of the meaning of it."" As that indicates, the correlation between accuracy and depression runs both ways: people who are depressed tend to perceive the harsher realities of life more clearly, and people who clearly perceive those harsh realities tend to be (or to get) depressed. In an odd reversal of the usual state of affairs, when it comes to these existential issues, the bigger and more important the belief, the less it pays to be right. That's why, as I've said, the goal of therapy isn't necessarily to make our beliefs more accurate; it is to make them more functional. Ronnie Janoff­ Bulman, the psychologist, has even argued that ""a key to the good life might well be illusions at our deepest, most generalized level of assump­ tions and accuracy at the most specific, least abstract levels."" (Fortunately for us, these two perspectives are compatible: research suggests that people who possess a generally positive outlook are better at acknowledging their everyday errors and changing their minds.) If excessive accuracy in our self-image and worldview is correlated with depression, the opposite is true, too. Sometimes, being wrong makes us happy. Think of Don Quixote, that exemplary knight errant, who lent his name to the condition of being pleasantly deluded. "
221,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5511477-forrest,5,"It would be easy to simply say that reading Being Wrong is a small but powerful life changing experience. It very much is, but just saying that is a bit of a cop-out. The book is a brilliantly written examination of the concept of error from every perspective imaginable. Schulz explores wrongness as an outside observer, a philosopher, a victim and a compassionate friend. By so fully embracing the idea on every level, she synthesizes a unified thesis from many disparate parts and supports every conclusion she draws with the best in logic and anecdote.At the core of Being Wrong is a suggestion. Not advice, so much as a recommendation for people interested in living a little better. Embrace your mistakes. It’s not about making mistakes and not feeling bad about it. Schulz wants us all to live with our errors a little more and not shove them away in a flurry of denial and justification. She goes on to examine the reasons why we are so adverse to being wrong, from the biological, (it doesn’t make evolutionary sense to be uncertain about anything) to the social, (our culture rejects leader figures who are indecisive) to the psychological. (depressed people have much more accurate worldviews than balanced personalties)Schulz is at her strongest when she is telling a story. The highlights of the books are the anecdotes she uses to set up each of her chapters. The stories include everything from Alan Greenspan’s unwavering faith in the economy proved wrong, to the touching story of an Exalted Cyclops of the KKK becoming one of the frontline fighters in the war for desegregated schools. Schulz has a deft hand for splicing these stories with the philosophical and scientific meat that connect them back to the reader’s everyday experience. She does tend to get bogged down in some of the dense history of the topic, but the frequent footnotes and witty asides help to break these thick sections up a little.The text itself induces stumbling, at least for me. It’s probably because the subject matter makes me paranoid that I’ve missed something, or misinterpreted a critical conclusion. To that end, I’d really recommend reading this book in chapters, rather than tackling the entire thing all at once. The writing lends it self to easy sectioning and while reading order is important, the ideas are all pretty sticky, which makes it easier to spread over time.Close to the end of the third section, Schulz examines the story of Penny Beerntsen, a woman who was raped and ended up falsely accusing another man of the crime. He was eventually proved innocent, but in the interim the woman had struggled to get closure in other ways. She wanted to understand the reasons people did horrible things to each other. To do this, she volunteered in prisons and really got to know the realities of being a convicted criminal in the United States. When the verdict came down proving that she had identified the wrong man, she was horrified, but she instantly accepted her mistake and wanted to somehow make up for it. Rather than try to deny her fault, she only sought to improve the life of the man she had thrown into prison unjustly.While this is an extreme example, I can’t think of a better example of being a truly human person. It would be an exaggeration to say I want be like Penny, but her example is one that I can value as someone who can be wrong and can be stupid about it. And really, we all fall into that category sometimes. Anyone who has ever been a critic of any kind knows the giddy thrill of being unquestionably right. (you cannot successfully argue against opinion) It is never a bad thing to gain a little perspective on that feeling, and that’s just what this book has allowed me to do."

That root gave rise to the Latin verb errare, meaning to wander or, more rakishly, to roam. The Latin, in turn, gave us the English word “erratic,” used to describe movement that is unpredictable or aimless. And, of course, it gave us “error.” From the beginning, then, the idea of error has contained a sense of motion: of wandering, seeking, going astray. Implicitly, what we are seeking—and what we have strayed from—is the truth.""-Page 61 |""inattentional blindness is commonly exploited by thieves who work in pairs or groups to create a distraction, thereby drawing their target’s attention away from what would otherwise be the obvious pilfering of his or her possessions.""-Page 64 |""“I know” seems to describe a state of affairs which guarantees what is known, guarantees it as a fact.

It is a neglected and deeply human attribute: being wrong, feeling wrong, discovering one's wrongness, changing as a result—or, more usually, denying it, ducking and running from the acknowledgement of error. I was fascinated, particularly so once I got through the first chapters. The writing is a curious mix of academic rigour and convivial, almost conversational, English. I found the book deeply engrossing, and it gave me perspective about my own error-filled journey. I finished the book a few days ago, and I am still turning it over in my mind. Highly recommend."
225,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2011274-brian,5,"Have you ever been wrong? Of course you have. Everybody makes mistakes and many people talk like that is all they do, ""Oh I am always messing up"" they might say. Now try reflecting on the moment when you realized that you were wrong about something. Don't reflect on your past beliefs, whether trivial or not, but rather think of that moment where you shifted from knowing that you were right to knowing that you were not. How did that moment feel when you realized that you were wrong, not when you were actually wrong but when you realized you were wrong?There isn't an external force that can inform us of the correctness or incorrectness of our beliefs a priori and therefore prevent us from making minor or grave mistakes. We have to force ourselves to reckon our beliefs with the external world and when we find our beliefs at odds with the world, it hurts. When we are wrong we feel alone, the moment we recognize our errors is "". . . a moment of alienation, both from ourselves and from [our] previously convincing vision of the world.""This profound and well grounded skepticism about things that feel so right and natural to us is deeply troubling to me. Schulz's prose is very good and is a joy to read and quote* but I have to admit that reflecting on our tendency to err, often in disastrous ways, is unsettling. I think it is disturbing because it goes against our nature not only to know but also to be known. In the current american culture the sexual attraction to others is pretty overt and therefore almost ever present in our minds. But I think we forget about the attractions we have to others than have nothing to do with sex or physical appearances at all. A meeting of the minds is a truly rewarding experience wherein our views of the world are validated and shared. We are in agreement with others about being correct and that is deeply satisfying. Again, Schulz says it a bit better:“Think about how distressing it is to feel misunderstood, and how frustrating it is when someone believes something about you—that you’re irresponsible or can’t handle commitment or don’t pull your weight at work—that you think is untrue. Conversely, there are few things more gratifying than the feeling that someone deeply understands us. In fact, as we are about to see, this feeling of being of being “gotten” is the sine qua non of our most important relationships, and the very hallmark of being in love.”[4]Full review here:http://wp.me/p6r7eE-2P"
226,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8744761-william,5,"This is an impressive and surprisingly enjoyable book. While Schulz is a journalist, the work seems closer to scholarly than journalistic, though it has a lighter touch than scholarship typically achieves. In reading it, don't skip the foot- and endnotes. There is often good stuff there.I experienced ""Being Wrong"" on three levels, and it works exceptionally well on two of them. To begin with, Schulz makes a compelling case that being wrong is by and large more a constructive thing than a negative one. Emotion, creativity and humor, she points out, draw heavily on error to be compelling. While it is explicitly not her intention, there is a self-help aspect to the book which works well. It was impossible for me to read it and not say to myself: ""Hey, lighten up. You don;t have to get everything right the first -- or second, or third -- time.The second level on which i found the book effective is just as good reading. Schultz writes well and with impressive wit. This book would be a good read if you even skipped the message and just read the stories which appear so frequently. My guess is I remember some of the stories better -- and will do so longer -- than the main purpose of the book.Where I find the book a little less satisfying is in the central argument. It's meticulous, sometimes to the point of tediousness. Who knew there was so much to write on this subject? And there are occasional generalizations with which I disagree. (1) We all disdain undecided voters. (177) Huh? (2) ""We almost never find ourselves between theories"" (186). Maybe it's just me, but there are frequently issues on which I have not made up my mind. (3) [quoting LaRochefoucauld] ""Everyone complains about their memory; no one complains about their judgment."" It seems to me all of us have had long talks with friends upset because they keep making the same mistake over and over, and we can often feel that way about ourselves as well.But regardless of my discomfort with some of the logic and a case which seems occasionally overstated, I found the book personally useful, certainly interesting and most of all both educational and entertaining."

That is not what this book is about. It does not try to approve or disapprove of making mistakes during an intentional brain dump (or storm). It does not try to repackage any established wisdom heard at a marketing conference. This book should not be pigeon-holded as ""self-help"" or ""business"" even though it may, by chance, give you the perceptual tools to somehow fix a decision you recently made, or are about to make, or help you stop hating your niece for joining that cult back in the 90s.It DOES research the history of why we feel, or believe, and why the final decision we make is believed to be true. Because this topic is covered from its most simple origin of sensing and belief you may have to read a few chapters before you get to one that changes the way you perceive the world. However you will enjoy the historical, personal and scientific references that are threaded throughout. Its funny and well written while it is smart, clever and funny. Bill Clinton reviewed it for f#ck sake, so you know its got to be pretty good. Albeit he probably spends most of every day trying to figure out why he did most of what he did in the 80s and 90s.Still not convinced? Well, the author did a TED talk that you may enjoy. If nothing else it will get you to experience her insightful fun voice of her writing which I really enjoy. "

I'm not even sure why that is because I have just been nothing but fascinated, especially so at all the research this book must have required to write. The amount of work in putting the book together is not lost on me. My guess would be that this is one of those books that a college professor would assign to his class. I read it through once, and then reread each chapter once more if not twice for some. I have never taken any college courses but IO have self educated to a certain (non) degree. There is no doubt that I have really enjoyed this book, for I have penciled in some notes and highlighted sections, something I try to avoid doing usually. I am pretty impressed with the entire book, references and the authors personal references. All of which has really made for an interesting study of Being Wrong. I'm very pleased to add that this is one more of the books I've read that I will being easily entertained by and probably get more out of each time I go through it in the future."
229,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5881280-steve-penner,4,"""Being Wrong"" was a wonderful and fascinating plunge into the world of wrongology. It covers a wide-ranging host of topics on error, how it happens and particularly how we respond to being wrong. Her basic premise is that there are two models of error. One model propounds error as something to be avoided at all costs as it provides no benefits, only embarrassment and shame. The second, which Schulz celebrates, is that error is common and natural. It's benefit is that we can learn, grow and change as a result. It's a very positive spin on a topic that has been dealt with by Plato and other classic writers, Augustine and Aquinas, Enlightenment thinkers, Freud and many other comtemporary writers. Schulz is a wonderful story teller and her stories are the highlight of the book. She can be slightly irritating as a writer when she continually states that the topic ""is something I'll deal with later."" This ""pre-figuring"" happens at least 20 times and becomes wearisome. Hopefully a future editor will do a better job of tightening up this habit. Overall and beyond my pettiness, I heartily recommend this as a wonderful, leisurely read in which you will certainly learn something about history, literature and yourself."

It kinda took me 2 hours to finish 30 pages or so.. *english is my 2nd language here*.. The book starts so well into its core concept and it keeps going so thoroughly discussing the ideas and concepts. sometimes it goes all the way to the core of philosophy and logic and all these mind twisting concepts of error and wrong and emotion and perception..At other chapters you feel like the introduction of the chapter never ends and takes so so long it kinda makes you lost and bored into it.. at others, it's like you're in a river of fluid stream of ideas so connected you don't feel yourself in its beauty.. but if there's one thing to notice, it's gonna be the effort the author put in compiling all the MASSIVE information of the different perspectives and sources and fields of knowledge it's admirable..I love this book, it's one of those books you feel sad you finished, and you feel like you've changed your perspective about so many things in life after reading..

Schulz breaks down rather complex philosophical and psychological issues to easily understood concepts with direct practical application. Further, she does this without removing the terminology, making it easy for people to continue studying long after they've finished this book. This is not a work of post-modern woowoo, where being wrong means no truth can ever be determined. Instead this is a nuanced understanding of our human lives, filled as they are with probabilistic knowledge rather than absolutist dogma, and where we can trust our minds to do what they do, create stories, not form perfect encyclopedic recall. Doing so allows Schulz to make a truly delightful and helpful contribution to our existence: that being wrong is not something to attack like some horrid beast but an inevitable aspect of our lives to embrace and seek always to see how our mental tendencies to error can be mitigated through understanding.

However, I don't know if the book is written above my intelligence, if I'm not understanding some of what I'm reading because I'm in a medicinal fog, or some combination of the two. I've found it really hard to focus on this book, due to the fact that I don't know all of the terms she mentions. Unfortunately it seems to happen so frequently, that i'd have to have a dictionary next to me through the entire book. Honestly, that's just not something I really want to do at this point.Maybe eventually, I'll be able to give the book my full attention, but for now, I'm unable to even get to chapter 2.

A compelling aspect of Being Wrong is a set of arguments for the value of making errors or being wrong. An obsession with eliminating all errors may result in worse outcomes. For example, by taking risks and making some errors, you can learn much more than by sticking with safe decisions.One of the most interesting chapters covered areas of wrongness and criminology, starting off with the story of Steven Avery's 18-year sentence for a crime he didn't commit. That was followed by a note that he was later convicted of a murder, the only setback to date of the Wisconsin Innocence Project. Just two days after I read that chapter, I read an article about the Netflix documentary Making a Murderer that suggests that Avery might also be innocent of that crime, framed once again by the same bad cops."

I have a list of things that I want to quote and this is all just from the first couple of chapters, haha...

235,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11297501-anna,5,"Kathryn Schulz argues passionately for the value of error. She shows us that not only is 'being wrong' a given in life, it is also a gift that has the power to transform our worldviews, our relationships, and ourselves. By drawing on philosophy, neuroscience, psycholoanalysts and a bit of common sense, she charts out the intellectual history of the shifting definitions and attitudes ascribed to being wrong and masterfully combines it with relevant & relatable examples from the present day. Schulz is a terrific thinker & and she writes with an elegant clarity and simplicity that make it nearly impossible to believe this is her first book (it seems as though she has done this before). Definitely one of the best things I have read in years. I am kind of in love with her now. Check out her Ted talks. "
236,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826906-laura,4,"I saw the author speak (very entertainingly) at an education conference, which was appropriate since - as she argues persuasively - being wrong is an inextricable part of learning and imagination. Yet in education we can often inadvertently send a message that error is something to fear and avoid. This is an entertaining book which would have been enhanced by some cross-cultural examination - e.g. how is error conceived of in cultures with a very different sense of self? Nevertheless, it's a rare book that really is relevant to everyone - but since we've all been wrong, are currently wrong (though we don't yet know how) and will be wrong at some point in the future, we can all find something to learn and relate to here."

It seems that much of the firepower is arraigned towards the writing style, especially the mix of academic language with the more colloquial. I admit I'm a sucker for that mix, so I've enjoyed her style mostly. Also, David seemed to say that the problem was that it got bogged down in semantics and word games, but I actually thought there was more emphasis on neuro-biology with anecdotes thrown in. She wasn't always the most illuminating--do I really need to hear about the old woman/young woman picture one more time?--but I think it helps flesh out the constellation of issues around our own images of ourselves and our rightness. At least, it makes my staff meeting make a whole lot more sense."

Still an interesting topic and discussion, although I think I agree with an earlier reviewer that the section on Love was not really related to the rest of the book and not really apropos to the topic. I found the idea of pessimistic versus optimistic views of wrongness intriguing. The author did inject some mild humor throughout the book that made the book more fun to read without being over the top or distracting.

239,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3761228-adman,4,"Insightful, therapeutic, and hopeful, this book belies its title inasmuch as it surveys error not so much as frontier but heartland, nay, even as a sort of self-sown weed of fate that springs out of any coordinates in any plot of land where we happen to plant our flag of sureness. Schulz crosses all sorts of habitual borders within which we assume we have found safety from error (or accidents, or sin) and shows that we badly overestimate such security (victory, righteousness). She does so with compassion and zeal, and this time stays quite true to her title. It really is an adventure to her to knock down the ego's badly-constructed refuges and blaze a new trail for how we think and act. It is not a sadistic or despairing adventure, though: Schulz believes this eyes-open journey can be better for her and for all of us than how we usually get along in life.Schulz covers a lot of territory. Material and mental subjects are treated in this book, from, say, stepping on a rake to the meta-mistake of rationalizing the mishap (intentional, unavoidable, someone else's fault, or really anything else other than our own error). Schulz hikes around between memory and science, moves from the mundane to the dramatic, sits down to chat with romance, politics, and religion. She does all this with a diplomacy that surprised and gladdened me. Taking a page from her own reflections, I wonder how much her topical environment guided her and her editors to observe even-handedly and deliver cautious judgments. I wish other authors would take note. Any of us, really, who is less blatantly kept in line by whatever happens to be the topic at hand might benefit from Schulz's choice. Far too much intellectual and practical territory, in print or in person, is overrun far too often by refusing to be open and hospitable about error -- in ourselves or others.The trail in this book does not lead to a new shelter where we can rest again from the hard work of living. Instead, how we make and walk our path seems to be Schulz's source of inspiration. How much better off might we be if we acknowledge and respect our seemingly inexhaustible capacity for error? What if we did not retreat in either denial or despair? What if we ventured from time to time out of the refuge of the self into the crowd or, the reverse, from the masses into the self? What if we diverted some of our energy from purging and purifying and celebrated and cultivated the capacity of some institutions -- art, religion, certain forms of government -- to introduce us to our limitations?I was struck by how relationship-oriented this book is. I suppose Schulz might respond, how could it not be? First of all and obviously, the book is not part of me -- not in my traditional sense of self. As with any book, I am contending with a thing outside of me. The book is not Ms. Schulz either, but rather a shadow-her that emerged as she researched and wrote, a page-bound self she may have hoped would reflect her living self. This shadow then introduced me, the reader, to other various, astute shadow-thinkers, -scientists, -theologians, and -philosophers. They all shared with me their experiences of a gap between the self and the world and also shared their ill-begotten efforts to remedy that gap. What a wilderness of joining and separating this is to be lost in! So many glances and so many voices have been cast over so many stone walls that stretch and tangle across an endless, fog-shrouded pasture of human experience.Or, if you prefer Ms. Schulz's own, less striving metaphor, life is like a game of telephone, and we often can't make up our minds how to feel -- or what to do -- about the inevitable degeneration of the initial message (though of course no one alive can lay claim to that first message) and our powerlessness to steer that degeneration.Schulz really gets to the bottom of things when she observes that we are in search of wholeness more than we are in search of rightness. Like small children, we want unity between whatever we understand to be the self and the not-self. Error -- accident, sin, the comical-or-frustrating evolution of the message in telephone, defeat at the hands of one's pen, keyboard, numb fingers or mute tongue to put one's spirit in touch with one's blind and deaf neighbors -- represents our failure (or, as we often like to pretend, the failure of others) to be one.Fortunately, around this point in the book, Schulz made an unexpected digression to identify art with error. I have often been driven to desperation and something in the neighborhood of madness by my inability to write poems or stories that express what I wish to convey in details or intensity. What a welcome, unexpected relief it was to read John Keats (among others) describing imperfection as the necessary and desired product of artistic endeavor. Why? I don't recall the line of reasoning she establishes but in the moment that I am writing this, I take it to mean that artistic error is evidence -- of the self, one's hopes, one's intentions, one's peculiar, unrepeatable humanness. It is evidence precisely in its failure to convey exactly what I want it to -- evidence of difference, disunity, and striving toward something else.Schulz ultimately praises error -- with a bit of hedging and a bashful allusion to the Judeochristian story of the Fall. She is not quite comfortable with blatantly saying bad is good. She simply wishes to offer hope that error is not the harbinger of doom we take it -- and often make it -- to be. Instead, it is a circumstance, a lesson, a challenge, an invitation."

244,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72842365-ryan-derby-talbot,5,"Book summary: There are two fundamental and unavoidable components to being a human being: one is the need to chase the feeling of being right –– of having solidity and comfort in how we experience and respond to the world. The other is dealing with being wrong: dealing with error, the inevitable (and sometimes devastating) encounters we have when our expectations end up not aligning with reality. This book is about how we cannot escape either of these forces, and what results — negative or positive –– we can get from attempting to navigate this tension.Our need to chase being right –– and the resulting confidence, empowerment and belongingness (proxies for love?) that come with the feeling of rightness –– run up against and try to discount and rule out all the ways we inevitably can get things wrong: through illusions, false or overstated beliefs, skewed understandings of data, biases, social influences that lead us astray, emotional investments in perspectives or communities, the need to feel love, and flat out denial. We have difficulty even seeing wrongness in action in us (thinking we are far more objective and omniscient than we are), partly because it is such a fleeting force –– striking either too quickly or too slowly for us to catch it. Moreover, we struggle with identifying and acknowledging wrongness because of the strong emotional and cognitive forces (the desire for the feeling of certainty, the biases) that protect us, and keep us overwhelmingly invested in particular perspectives at the expense of other perspectives more aligned with reality. However much we may want to insist on the contrary or wish away our propensity to get things wrong (and we do this routinely), if we actually look at it, we invariably, deeply, absurdly, and inevitably get things wrong. Actually facing this truth doesn’t need to doom us, however, to defeated nihilism. The gap between our perspectives and the world make possible our two distinctly powerful human abilities: imagination and empathy. (Both are the result of allowing more than one perspective in a situation, of permitting a bigger notion than just a single “rightness.”) Successful incorporation and integration of our own wrongness –– which requires going through the excruciating emotional pain of admitting and allowing wrongness –– expands our sensitivities and perspectives as human beings. Collectively, our relationship with the gap also makes possible the two best products of human work, art and science. At root, error –– encountering the gap –– contributes to diversity, wonder, and richness of human experience. Alas, however, it will not ever lead us to a refuge of solid objectivity. Alas, there is no magic formula for dealing with the tensions between our desired rightness and inevitable wrongness. We can, however, recognize the growth and wondrous (mystical?) perspectives that are available in confronting their clash within us, the fundamental and inevitable experience of being a human being.

245,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45191284-beth,4,"Kathryn Schulz delves into all the ways we can be wrong, explaining the strange whys and hows or error generation, denial, and results. The fact that the fabric of humanity is interwoven with error and inseparable from the state of being human is something abput which most of us live in denial. Schulz uncovers some of the universal characteristics of being wrong in a way that is more palatable than some of the ways society reminds us we are wrong. We are wired to resist the notion of our own fallibility, so this deft touch is necessary in order to circumvent our natural resistance. At the same time, she highlights the benefits of acknowledging and embracing our error in order to better our communities, our interpersonal relationships, and ourselves. For example:""This is one of the most powerful ways being wrong can transform us. It can help us be more compassionate people. Being right might be fun, but as we've seen, it has a tendency to bring out the worst in us. By contrast, being wrong might is often the furthest thing in the world from fun, and yet, in the end, it has the potential to bring out the best in us. Or, rather, to change us for the better.""This book now is added to 2 others - Tim Nochols' The Death of Expertise and Han Roslings's Factfulness- that I would recommend to any of my acquaintances who are trying to grapple with the perceived and real societal grievances battering for their attention. Schulz can get a little long-winded in places, but this is a deep topic and I found that if I hung with her she eventually led me to her point.One of my favorite passages is what I hope people gain from reading this book:""If you really want to be right, or at least improve the odds of being right, you have to start by acknowledging your fallibility. Deliberately seeking out your mistakes. And figuring out what caused you to make them."""

In all, Schulz does an admirable job of selecting her chosen anecdotes and ends up with a satisfying and thought-provoking read.NotesPerhaps the history of the errors of mankind, all things considered, is more valuable and interesting than that of their discoveries. Truth is uniform and narrow; it constantly exists, and does not seem to require so much an active energy, as a passive aptitude of the soul in order to encounter it. But error is endlessly diversified; it has no reality, but is the pure and simple creation of the mind that invents it. In this field the soul has room enough to expand herself, to display all her boundless faculties, and all her beautiful and interesting extravagancies and absurdities.—Benjamin Franklin______Many of the religious thinkers who tried to understand why we err found their answer at the gates of the Garden of Eden. Thus Thomas Aquinas, the thirteenth-century scholastic, held that we make mistakes because, when we were banished from paradise, we were cut off forever from direct access to divine truth. To Aquinas and many of his fellow theologians, our errors arise from the gap between our own limited and blemished minds and God’s unlimited and perfect omniscience.This same basic idea has received countless secular treatments as well. Plato thought that our primordial soul was at one with the universe, and that we only began to err when we took on our current physical form and forgot those cosmic truths. The Enlightenment philosopher John Locke thought that error seeped into our lives from the gap between the artificiality of words and the reality of the things they name—from the distance between an indescribable essence and the nearest sayable thing. The German philosopher Martin Heidegger thought that error could be explained by the fact that we live in time and space; because we are bound to a particular set of coordinates, we can’t rise above them and see reality as a whole, from a bird’s-eye (or God’s-eye) view. As different as these explanations seem, all these thinkers and many more conceived of error as arising from a gap: sometimes between the particular and the general, sometimes between words and things, sometimes between the present and the primeval, sometimes between the mortal and the divine—but in every case, and fundamentally, between our own mind and the rest of the world.For the most part, we spend our lives blithely ignoring this gap. And with good reason. Who wants to be reminded of the fall from grace, the separation from truth, the particular and limited nature of our existence? ______How can we square this feeling of rightness with the very real possibility that we are wrong? This is a question that haunts all of wrongology, not just errors of memory. The problem is suggested by the very phrase “the feeling of knowing.” In life, as in language, we begin with a psychological state (the “feeling” part) and end up with a claim about the truth (the “knowing” part). In other words, we feel that we are right because we feel that we are right: we take our own certainty as an indicator of accuracy. This isn’t completely foolish of us, since studies show that there is some correlation between confidence and correctness. But it isn’t completely foolproof, either. As the case of flashbulb memories makes clear, our certainty reflects the existence of a particularly vivid inner picture. But nothing in life guarantees that this picture reflects the real state of affairs.This reliance on a vivid inner picture helps explain why memories are particularly apt to trigger the feeling of knowing.______ The philosopher Avishai Marga lit put this nicely. ""It is not the case that I am caught in a web of beliefs,"" he wrote. "" . . . Rather, I am caught in a network of witnesses."" Our relationships to these ""witnesses""-the people and institutions that attest to the truth of various beliefs-predate and determine our reaction to whatever information they supply. As Margalit said, ""my belief in [one of these witnesses] is prior to my belief that (what she says is true)."" Belief in is prior: however far this might be from our sense of how we should form our ideas about the world, it is the first principle of how we actually do so. All of us are caught in Margalit's ""networks of witnesses""­ not just in one but in many, and not just from time to time but all the time, from the moment we are born until the day we die. As countless commen­tators have observed, this lends to our beliefs an element of the arbitrary. Montaigne, for instance, remarked that people ""are swept [into a belief]­ either by the custom of their country or by their parental upbringing, or by chance-as by a tempest, without judgment or choice, indeed most often before the age of discretion.""______These latter­ day zealots have hailed from many different backgrounds and held many different beliefs. At heart, though, and paradoxically, they have all shared a single conviction: that they and they alone are in possession of the truth. (The very word ""zealot"" comes from a Greek root meaning to be jealous of the truth-to guard it as your own.) What zealots have in common, then, is the absolute conviction that they are right. In fact, of all the symbolic ones and zeros that extremists use to write their ideological binary codes­ us/them, same/different, good/evil-the fundamental one is right/wrong. Zealotry demands a complete rejection of the possibility of error. The conviction that we cannot possibly be wrong: this is certainty.______[O]ur be­liefs come in bundles. That makes it hard to remove or replace one without affecting the others-and it gets harder as the belief in question gets more central. In this respect, beliefs are like the beams in a building or the words in a sentence: you can't eliminate one and expect the fundamental sound­ ness or fundamental meaning of the overall system to remain unchanged. As a result, being wrong sometimes triggers a cascade of transformations so extensive that the belief system that emerges afterward bears almost no resemblance to its predecessor. ______You fight your superficiality, your shallowness, so as to try to come at people without unreal expectations, without an overload of bias or hope or arrogance, as untanklike as you can be . . . and yet you never fail to get them wrong. You might as well have the brain of a tank. You get them wrong before you meet them: you get them wrong while you're with them and then you get home to tell somebody else about the meeting and you get them all wrong again. Since the same generally goes for them with you, the whole thing is really a dazzling illusion empty of all perception, an astonishing farce of misperception. And yet what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people, which gets bled of the significance we think it has and takes on a significance that is ludicrous, so ill equipped are we all to envision one another's interior workings and invisible aims? . . . The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway. It's getting them wrong that is living, getting them wrong and wrong and wrong and then, on careful reconsideration, getting them wrong again . That's how we know we are alive: we're wrong. —Phillip Roth, American Pastoral______We go to our jobs, stop by the bar on our way home, hang out with our friends, raise our kids­ because these things are the stuff of life, to be sure, but also because they are strategies for keeping the terror of isolation in check. Soren Kierkeg­aard, that existentialist before there was existentialism, compared us in this respect to those early American pioneers who banged on their pots and pans all night long, hoping to keep the wolves at bay. Keeping wolves at bay is a start. But of all our ways of dealing with this rift, our favorite by far is the one that promises to eliminate it entirely­ to transform our desert island into a tropical paradise, our fundamental separation into ecstatic union. This strategy is our last, best hope for escap­ing the loneliness of existence and giving despair the slip. I am talking, of course, about love.______The idea that we possess a true self serves a hugely important psycho­ logical purpose. If we have an essential and unchanging identity, one we are destined to discover sooner or later, then the beliefs we hold, the choices we make, the person we become-none of this happens by chance. Instead, the entire course of our lives is inevitable, dictated by the certainty that our real self will eventually surface...This narrative is appealing for the same reason that it is problematic: within it, we can do no wrong. Our false beliefs were foreordained, our ap­parent errors occurred strictly in the service of a larger truth. This idea is made explicit in the religious affirmation that ""God makes no mistakes"": even the seeming trials and blunders of our lives are part of a larger plan: As that implies, stories starring a true self are teleological; we end up exactly where we are meant to be. This, too, is both an attraction and a weakness of the idea of an essential self. It suggests that our lives are deterministic, that yesterday's convictions-which we thought we chose based on their intellectual, emotional, or spiritual merits-were merely a trap into which we were lured for the benefit of some predetermined future self. Whatever meaning or worth our past might have had on its own terms is effectively written out of existence. Even more problematically, the idea of a true self suggests that we will never undergo momentous upheaval again. How could we? Having finally discovered who we really are and have always been, there is no further transformation available to us. If the self is constantly changing, then we can constantly feel our way forward, constantly become someone new-but if each of us possesses a fixed essence, then we can only return to it. Accord­ingly, our past departure from that essential self can only be a single and inexplicable aberration, associated as often as not with betrayal, transgres­sion, and sin. (Recall Chambers denouncing Communism, his erstwhile faith, as ""evil, absolute evil."") Singular, aberrational, transgressive, evil: we've seen this constellation of ideas before. This is the pessimistic model of wrongness, in which error is an unwelcome anomaly, a mark of our exile from the sacred realm of truth. Helpfully, this reminds us that we have another model for making sense of wrongness as well-one that casts a different light not only on our errors but also on ourselves. Here, wrongness is a natural and ongoing process, and we are not deformed but transformed by it. ______""The main in­terest in life and work,"" said Foucault, ""is to become someone else that you were not in the beginning."" Such transformations don't only come about through wrongness, of course-but wrongness is always an opportunity for such transformations. ______I was of three minds, Like a tree In which there are three blackbirds. —Wallace Stevens, 13 Ways of Looking at a Blackbird______His desire to banish art is part of a long and often sinister tradition (which we glimpsed earlier) of trying to create ideal societies through eradicating error in all its forms. All of those disgruntled undergraduates, meanwhile, are motivated in part-whether they know it or not-by the optimistic model of wrongness. They recognize, as most of us do, not just the legitimacy but also the poten­tial beauty and power of individual, skewed, inaccurate representations of reality. In this model, the link between error and art i s not a n indictment of art but a defense of error. Cut off from the absolute essence of things-that ideal form that Plato felt existed only in the mind of God-our separate, subjective consciousnesses look around and see, instead, Water Lilies, or Starry Night, or Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Likewise, we can make Beowulf and Star Wars and Horton Hears a Who! for the same reason we can make mistakes: because, as I said earlier, we are capable of conjuring the world not just as it is, but also as it is not. Our capacity to err is inseparable from our imagination.______The most famous formulation of this relationship between art, doubt, and error comes from the Romantic poet John Keats. He had been talking over various matters with a friend, he wrote to his brothers in a letter in 1 817, ""and at once it struck me,"" what quality went to form a Man of Achievement especially in lit­erature & which Shakespeare possessed so enormously-! mean Negative Capability, that is when man is capable of being in un­certainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact & reason.Keats's attitude toward uncertainty-and, for that matter, toward ""fact & reason""-is not the common one. He embraced unknowability and falli­bility, but not for the utilitarian purposes we saw in the last chapter. There, the point of embracing error was to curtail it-a kind of homeopathic rem­ edy for wrongness. But Keats wasn't interested in remedying wrongness. He recognized error and art as conjoined twins, born of the same place and vital to one another's existence. In life as in linguistics, art is joined at the root to artificial-to the not-true, the unreal-just as a fiction is at once a creation and a falsehood. ______But unlike androids, we humans do not nor­ mally self-destruct in the face of our mistakes. On the contrary: we self­ create, and self-recreate. This idea of self-creation suggests something else important about error. Being wrong doesn't just make us human in general; it also helps make each of us the specific person we are. In our inability to get things exactly right, in the idiosyncrasies of our private visions of the world, the outline of selfhood appears. This is what Benjamin Franklin was getting at in the quote I used as an epigraph to this book. Error, he wrote, is ""the pure and simple creation of the mind that invents it,"" a place where ""the soul has room enough to expand herself."" Mistakes, he ·meant, are the evidence and expression of an individual identity. This is an idea with deep and important roots in our intellectual history. It is, in essence, the crucial insight of evolutionary theory. Because of errors in the replication of genetic sequences, we wind up with variation among individual members of a species; and because of that variation, the species as a whole can adapt and survive. Such errors literally keep their hosts alive. A population that is too small or too homogenous to support significant genetic variation is doomed. For every species, then, error is a mechanism of survival and change. For us human organisms, with our richer relation­ ship to wrongness, mistakes enable not only our biological evolution but our social, emotional, and intellectual evolution as well. And wrongness also allows us to thrive in another way. I began this book by noting that we think of being right as essential to our survival and happiness, but in one key respect, nothing could be further from the truth. Countless studies have shown that people who suffer from depression have more accurate worldviews than nondepressed people. Depressed people do not nurture the cheering illusion that they can control the course of their lives. They rarely possess the conviction, so common in the rest of us, that they are above average in virtually every respect. And they understand, all too acutely, the basic conditions of existence: that their lifespan is just a brief blip in the cold sweep of history, that suffering is real and ongoing, that they and all the people they love are going to die. That outlook is known as depressive realism. Depressed people might be unhappy, but­ when it comes to these big-picture, existential matters-they are generally more right than the rest of us. It scarcely requires saying that this kind of rightness is not fun. ""To see the world as it really is is devastating and terrifying,"" wrote the philosopher Ernest Becker. "" . . . It makes thoughtless living in the world of men an im­possibility. It places a trembling animal at the mercy of the entire cosmos and the problem of the meaning of it."" As that indicates, the correlation between accuracy and depression runs both ways: people who are depressed tend to perceive the harsher realities of life more clearly, and people who clearly perceive those harsh realities tend to be (or to get) depressed. In an odd reversal of the usual state of affairs, when it comes to these existential issues, the bigger and more important the belief, the less it pays to be right. That's why, as I've said, the goal of therapy isn't necessarily to make our beliefs more accurate; it is to make them more functional. Ronnie Janoff­ Bulman, the psychologist, has even argued that ""a key to the good life might well be illusions at our deepest, most generalized level of assump­ tions and accuracy at the most specific, least abstract levels."" (Fortunately for us, these two perspectives are compatible: research suggests that people who possess a generally positive outlook are better at acknowledging their everyday errors and changing their minds.) If excessive accuracy in our self-image and worldview is correlated with depression, the opposite is true, too. Sometimes, being wrong makes us happy. Think of Don Quixote, that exemplary knight errant, who lent his name to the condition of being pleasantly deluded. "
251,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5511477-forrest,5,"It would be easy to simply say that reading Being Wrong is a small but powerful life changing experience. It very much is, but just saying that is a bit of a cop-out. The book is a brilliantly written examination of the concept of error from every perspective imaginable. Schulz explores wrongness as an outside observer, a philosopher, a victim and a compassionate friend. By so fully embracing the idea on every level, she synthesizes a unified thesis from many disparate parts and supports every conclusion she draws with the best in logic and anecdote.At the core of Being Wrong is a suggestion. Not advice, so much as a recommendation for people interested in living a little better. Embrace your mistakes. It’s not about making mistakes and not feeling bad about it. Schulz wants us all to live with our errors a little more and not shove them away in a flurry of denial and justification. She goes on to examine the reasons why we are so adverse to being wrong, from the biological, (it doesn’t make evolutionary sense to be uncertain about anything) to the social, (our culture rejects leader figures who are indecisive) to the psychological. (depressed people have much more accurate worldviews than balanced personalties)Schulz is at her strongest when she is telling a story. The highlights of the books are the anecdotes she uses to set up each of her chapters. The stories include everything from Alan Greenspan’s unwavering faith in the economy proved wrong, to the touching story of an Exalted Cyclops of the KKK becoming one of the frontline fighters in the war for desegregated schools. Schulz has a deft hand for splicing these stories with the philosophical and scientific meat that connect them back to the reader’s everyday experience. She does tend to get bogged down in some of the dense history of the topic, but the frequent footnotes and witty asides help to break these thick sections up a little.The text itself induces stumbling, at least for me. It’s probably because the subject matter makes me paranoid that I’ve missed something, or misinterpreted a critical conclusion. To that end, I’d really recommend reading this book in chapters, rather than tackling the entire thing all at once. The writing lends it self to easy sectioning and while reading order is important, the ideas are all pretty sticky, which makes it easier to spread over time.Close to the end of the third section, Schulz examines the story of Penny Beerntsen, a woman who was raped and ended up falsely accusing another man of the crime. He was eventually proved innocent, but in the interim the woman had struggled to get closure in other ways. She wanted to understand the reasons people did horrible things to each other. To do this, she volunteered in prisons and really got to know the realities of being a convicted criminal in the United States. When the verdict came down proving that she had identified the wrong man, she was horrified, but she instantly accepted her mistake and wanted to somehow make up for it. Rather than try to deny her fault, she only sought to improve the life of the man she had thrown into prison unjustly.While this is an extreme example, I can’t think of a better example of being a truly human person. It would be an exaggeration to say I want be like Penny, but her example is one that I can value as someone who can be wrong and can be stupid about it. And really, we all fall into that category sometimes. Anyone who has ever been a critic of any kind knows the giddy thrill of being unquestionably right. (you cannot successfully argue against opinion) It is never a bad thing to gain a little perspective on that feeling, and that’s just what this book has allowed me to do."

It is a neglected and deeply human attribute: being wrong, feeling wrong, discovering one's wrongness, changing as a result—or, more usually, denying it, ducking and running from the acknowledgement of error. I was fascinated, particularly so once I got through the first chapters. The writing is a curious mix of academic rigour and convivial, almost conversational, English. I found the book deeply engrossing, and it gave me perspective about my own error-filled journey. I finished the book a few days ago, and I am still turning it over in my mind. Highly recommend."
255,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2011274-brian,5,"Have you ever been wrong? Of course you have. Everybody makes mistakes and many people talk like that is all they do, ""Oh I am always messing up"" they might say. Now try reflecting on the moment when you realized that you were wrong about something. Don't reflect on your past beliefs, whether trivial or not, but rather think of that moment where you shifted from knowing that you were right to knowing that you were not. How did that moment feel when you realized that you were wrong, not when you were actually wrong but when you realized you were wrong?There isn't an external force that can inform us of the correctness or incorrectness of our beliefs a priori and therefore prevent us from making minor or grave mistakes. We have to force ourselves to reckon our beliefs with the external world and when we find our beliefs at odds with the world, it hurts. When we are wrong we feel alone, the moment we recognize our errors is "". . . a moment of alienation, both from ourselves and from [our] previously convincing vision of the world.""This profound and well grounded skepticism about things that feel so right and natural to us is deeply troubling to me. Schulz's prose is very good and is a joy to read and quote* but I have to admit that reflecting on our tendency to err, often in disastrous ways, is unsettling. I think it is disturbing because it goes against our nature not only to know but also to be known. In the current american culture the sexual attraction to others is pretty overt and therefore almost ever present in our minds. But I think we forget about the attractions we have to others than have nothing to do with sex or physical appearances at all. A meeting of the minds is a truly rewarding experience wherein our views of the world are validated and shared. We are in agreement with others about being correct and that is deeply satisfying. Again, Schulz says it a bit better:“Think about how distressing it is to feel misunderstood, and how frustrating it is when someone believes something about you—that you’re irresponsible or can’t handle commitment or don’t pull your weight at work—that you think is untrue. Conversely, there are few things more gratifying than the feeling that someone deeply understands us. In fact, as we are about to see, this feeling of being of being “gotten” is the sine qua non of our most important relationships, and the very hallmark of being in love.”[4]Full review here:http://wp.me/p6r7eE-2P"
256,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8744761-william,5,"This is an impressive and surprisingly enjoyable book. While Schulz is a journalist, the work seems closer to scholarly than journalistic, though it has a lighter touch than scholarship typically achieves. In reading it, don't skip the foot- and endnotes. There is often good stuff there.I experienced ""Being Wrong"" on three levels, and it works exceptionally well on two of them. To begin with, Schulz makes a compelling case that being wrong is by and large more a constructive thing than a negative one. Emotion, creativity and humor, she points out, draw heavily on error to be compelling. While it is explicitly not her intention, there is a self-help aspect to the book which works well. It was impossible for me to read it and not say to myself: ""Hey, lighten up. You don;t have to get everything right the first -- or second, or third -- time.The second level on which i found the book effective is just as good reading. Schultz writes well and with impressive wit. This book would be a good read if you even skipped the message and just read the stories which appear so frequently. My guess is I remember some of the stories better -- and will do so longer -- than the main purpose of the book.Where I find the book a little less satisfying is in the central argument. It's meticulous, sometimes to the point of tediousness. Who knew there was so much to write on this subject? And there are occasional generalizations with which I disagree. (1) We all disdain undecided voters. (177) Huh? (2) ""We almost never find ourselves between theories"" (186). Maybe it's just me, but there are frequently issues on which I have not made up my mind. (3) [quoting LaRochefoucauld] ""Everyone complains about their memory; no one complains about their judgment."" It seems to me all of us have had long talks with friends upset because they keep making the same mistake over and over, and we can often feel that way about ourselves as well.But regardless of my discomfort with some of the logic and a case which seems occasionally overstated, I found the book personally useful, certainly interesting and most of all both educational and entertaining."

That is not what this book is about. It does not try to approve or disapprove of making mistakes during an intentional brain dump (or storm). It does not try to repackage any established wisdom heard at a marketing conference. This book should not be pigeon-holded as ""self-help"" or ""business"" even though it may, by chance, give you the perceptual tools to somehow fix a decision you recently made, or are about to make, or help you stop hating your niece for joining that cult back in the 90s.It DOES research the history of why we feel, or believe, and why the final decision we make is believed to be true. Because this topic is covered from its most simple origin of sensing and belief you may have to read a few chapters before you get to one that changes the way you perceive the world. However you will enjoy the historical, personal and scientific references that are threaded throughout. Its funny and well written while it is smart, clever and funny. Bill Clinton reviewed it for f#ck sake, so you know its got to be pretty good. Albeit he probably spends most of every day trying to figure out why he did most of what he did in the 80s and 90s.Still not convinced? Well, the author did a TED talk that you may enjoy. If nothing else it will get you to experience her insightful fun voice of her writing which I really enjoy. "

I'm not even sure why that is because I have just been nothing but fascinated, especially so at all the research this book must have required to write. The amount of work in putting the book together is not lost on me. My guess would be that this is one of those books that a college professor would assign to his class. I read it through once, and then reread each chapter once more if not twice for some. I have never taken any college courses but IO have self educated to a certain (non) degree. There is no doubt that I have really enjoyed this book, for I have penciled in some notes and highlighted sections, something I try to avoid doing usually. I am pretty impressed with the entire book, references and the authors personal references. All of which has really made for an interesting study of Being Wrong. I'm very pleased to add that this is one more of the books I've read that I will being easily entertained by and probably get more out of each time I go through it in the future."
259,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5881280-steve-penner,4,"""Being Wrong"" was a wonderful and fascinating plunge into the world of wrongology. It covers a wide-ranging host of topics on error, how it happens and particularly how we respond to being wrong. Her basic premise is that there are two models of error. One model propounds error as something to be avoided at all costs as it provides no benefits, only embarrassment and shame. The second, which Schulz celebrates, is that error is common and natural. It's benefit is that we can learn, grow and change as a result. It's a very positive spin on a topic that has been dealt with by Plato and other classic writers, Augustine and Aquinas, Enlightenment thinkers, Freud and many other comtemporary writers. Schulz is a wonderful story teller and her stories are the highlight of the book. She can be slightly irritating as a writer when she continually states that the topic ""is something I'll deal with later."" This ""pre-figuring"" happens at least 20 times and becomes wearisome. Hopefully a future editor will do a better job of tightening up this habit. Overall and beyond my pettiness, I heartily recommend this as a wonderful, leisurely read in which you will certainly learn something about history, literature and yourself."

It kinda took me 2 hours to finish 30 pages or so.. *english is my 2nd language here*.. The book starts so well into its core concept and it keeps going so thoroughly discussing the ideas and concepts. sometimes it goes all the way to the core of philosophy and logic and all these mind twisting concepts of error and wrong and emotion and perception..At other chapters you feel like the introduction of the chapter never ends and takes so so long it kinda makes you lost and bored into it.. at others, it's like you're in a river of fluid stream of ideas so connected you don't feel yourself in its beauty.. but if there's one thing to notice, it's gonna be the effort the author put in compiling all the MASSIVE information of the different perspectives and sources and fields of knowledge it's admirable..I love this book, it's one of those books you feel sad you finished, and you feel like you've changed your perspective about so many things in life after reading..

Schulz breaks down rather complex philosophical and psychological issues to easily understood concepts with direct practical application. Further, she does this without removing the terminology, making it easy for people to continue studying long after they've finished this book. This is not a work of post-modern woowoo, where being wrong means no truth can ever be determined. Instead this is a nuanced understanding of our human lives, filled as they are with probabilistic knowledge rather than absolutist dogma, and where we can trust our minds to do what they do, create stories, not form perfect encyclopedic recall. Doing so allows Schulz to make a truly delightful and helpful contribution to our existence: that being wrong is not something to attack like some horrid beast but an inevitable aspect of our lives to embrace and seek always to see how our mental tendencies to error can be mitigated through understanding.

However, I don't know if the book is written above my intelligence, if I'm not understanding some of what I'm reading because I'm in a medicinal fog, or some combination of the two. I've found it really hard to focus on this book, due to the fact that I don't know all of the terms she mentions. Unfortunately it seems to happen so frequently, that i'd have to have a dictionary next to me through the entire book. Honestly, that's just not something I really want to do at this point.Maybe eventually, I'll be able to give the book my full attention, but for now, I'm unable to even get to chapter 2.

A compelling aspect of Being Wrong is a set of arguments for the value of making errors or being wrong. An obsession with eliminating all errors may result in worse outcomes. For example, by taking risks and making some errors, you can learn much more than by sticking with safe decisions.One of the most interesting chapters covered areas of wrongness and criminology, starting off with the story of Steven Avery's 18-year sentence for a crime he didn't commit. That was followed by a note that he was later convicted of a murder, the only setback to date of the Wisconsin Innocence Project. Just two days after I read that chapter, I read an article about the Netflix documentary Making a Murderer that suggests that Avery might also be innocent of that crime, framed once again by the same bad cops."

265,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11297501-anna,5,"Kathryn Schulz argues passionately for the value of error. She shows us that not only is 'being wrong' a given in life, it is also a gift that has the power to transform our worldviews, our relationships, and ourselves. By drawing on philosophy, neuroscience, psycholoanalysts and a bit of common sense, she charts out the intellectual history of the shifting definitions and attitudes ascribed to being wrong and masterfully combines it with relevant & relatable examples from the present day. Schulz is a terrific thinker & and she writes with an elegant clarity and simplicity that make it nearly impossible to believe this is her first book (it seems as though she has done this before). Definitely one of the best things I have read in years. I am kind of in love with her now. Check out her Ted talks. "
266,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826906-laura,4,"I saw the author speak (very entertainingly) at an education conference, which was appropriate since - as she argues persuasively - being wrong is an inextricable part of learning and imagination. Yet in education we can often inadvertently send a message that error is something to fear and avoid. This is an entertaining book which would have been enhanced by some cross-cultural examination - e.g. how is error conceived of in cultures with a very different sense of self? Nevertheless, it's a rare book that really is relevant to everyone - but since we've all been wrong, are currently wrong (though we don't yet know how) and will be wrong at some point in the future, we can all find something to learn and relate to here."

It seems that much of the firepower is arraigned towards the writing style, especially the mix of academic language with the more colloquial. I admit I'm a sucker for that mix, so I've enjoyed her style mostly. Also, David seemed to say that the problem was that it got bogged down in semantics and word games, but I actually thought there was more emphasis on neuro-biology with anecdotes thrown in. She wasn't always the most illuminating--do I really need to hear about the old woman/young woman picture one more time?--but I think it helps flesh out the constellation of issues around our own images of ourselves and our rightness. At least, it makes my staff meeting make a whole lot more sense."

Still an interesting topic and discussion, although I think I agree with an earlier reviewer that the section on Love was not really related to the rest of the book and not really apropos to the topic. I found the idea of pessimistic versus optimistic views of wrongness intriguing. The author did inject some mild humor throughout the book that made the book more fun to read without being over the top or distracting.

269,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3761228-adman,4,"Insightful, therapeutic, and hopeful, this book belies its title inasmuch as it surveys error not so much as frontier but heartland, nay, even as a sort of self-sown weed of fate that springs out of any coordinates in any plot of land where we happen to plant our flag of sureness. Schulz crosses all sorts of habitual borders within which we assume we have found safety from error (or accidents, or sin) and shows that we badly overestimate such security (victory, righteousness). She does so with compassion and zeal, and this time stays quite true to her title. It really is an adventure to her to knock down the ego's badly-constructed refuges and blaze a new trail for how we think and act. It is not a sadistic or despairing adventure, though: Schulz believes this eyes-open journey can be better for her and for all of us than how we usually get along in life.Schulz covers a lot of territory. Material and mental subjects are treated in this book, from, say, stepping on a rake to the meta-mistake of rationalizing the mishap (intentional, unavoidable, someone else's fault, or really anything else other than our own error). Schulz hikes around between memory and science, moves from the mundane to the dramatic, sits down to chat with romance, politics, and religion. She does all this with a diplomacy that surprised and gladdened me. Taking a page from her own reflections, I wonder how much her topical environment guided her and her editors to observe even-handedly and deliver cautious judgments. I wish other authors would take note. Any of us, really, who is less blatantly kept in line by whatever happens to be the topic at hand might benefit from Schulz's choice. Far too much intellectual and practical territory, in print or in person, is overrun far too often by refusing to be open and hospitable about error -- in ourselves or others.The trail in this book does not lead to a new shelter where we can rest again from the hard work of living. Instead, how we make and walk our path seems to be Schulz's source of inspiration. How much better off might we be if we acknowledge and respect our seemingly inexhaustible capacity for error? What if we did not retreat in either denial or despair? What if we ventured from time to time out of the refuge of the self into the crowd or, the reverse, from the masses into the self? What if we diverted some of our energy from purging and purifying and celebrated and cultivated the capacity of some institutions -- art, religion, certain forms of government -- to introduce us to our limitations?I was struck by how relationship-oriented this book is. I suppose Schulz might respond, how could it not be? First of all and obviously, the book is not part of me -- not in my traditional sense of self. As with any book, I am contending with a thing outside of me. The book is not Ms. Schulz either, but rather a shadow-her that emerged as she researched and wrote, a page-bound self she may have hoped would reflect her living self. This shadow then introduced me, the reader, to other various, astute shadow-thinkers, -scientists, -theologians, and -philosophers. They all shared with me their experiences of a gap between the self and the world and also shared their ill-begotten efforts to remedy that gap. What a wilderness of joining and separating this is to be lost in! So many glances and so many voices have been cast over so many stone walls that stretch and tangle across an endless, fog-shrouded pasture of human experience.Or, if you prefer Ms. Schulz's own, less striving metaphor, life is like a game of telephone, and we often can't make up our minds how to feel -- or what to do -- about the inevitable degeneration of the initial message (though of course no one alive can lay claim to that first message) and our powerlessness to steer that degeneration.Schulz really gets to the bottom of things when she observes that we are in search of wholeness more than we are in search of rightness. Like small children, we want unity between whatever we understand to be the self and the not-self. Error -- accident, sin, the comical-or-frustrating evolution of the message in telephone, defeat at the hands of one's pen, keyboard, numb fingers or mute tongue to put one's spirit in touch with one's blind and deaf neighbors -- represents our failure (or, as we often like to pretend, the failure of others) to be one.Fortunately, around this point in the book, Schulz made an unexpected digression to identify art with error. I have often been driven to desperation and something in the neighborhood of madness by my inability to write poems or stories that express what I wish to convey in details or intensity. What a welcome, unexpected relief it was to read John Keats (among others) describing imperfection as the necessary and desired product of artistic endeavor. Why? I don't recall the line of reasoning she establishes but in the moment that I am writing this, I take it to mean that artistic error is evidence -- of the self, one's hopes, one's intentions, one's peculiar, unrepeatable humanness. It is evidence precisely in its failure to convey exactly what I want it to -- evidence of difference, disunity, and striving toward something else.Schulz ultimately praises error -- with a bit of hedging and a bashful allusion to the Judeochristian story of the Fall. She is not quite comfortable with blatantly saying bad is good. She simply wishes to offer hope that error is not the harbinger of doom we take it -- and often make it -- to be. Instead, it is a circumstance, a lesson, a challenge, an invitation."

274,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72842365-ryan-derby-talbot,5,"Book summary: There are two fundamental and unavoidable components to being a human being: one is the need to chase the feeling of being right –– of having solidity and comfort in how we experience and respond to the world. The other is dealing with being wrong: dealing with error, the inevitable (and sometimes devastating) encounters we have when our expectations end up not aligning with reality. This book is about how we cannot escape either of these forces, and what results — negative or positive –– we can get from attempting to navigate this tension.Our need to chase being right –– and the resulting confidence, empowerment and belongingness (proxies for love?) that come with the feeling of rightness –– run up against and try to discount and rule out all the ways we inevitably can get things wrong: through illusions, false or overstated beliefs, skewed understandings of data, biases, social influences that lead us astray, emotional investments in perspectives or communities, the need to feel love, and flat out denial. We have difficulty even seeing wrongness in action in us (thinking we are far more objective and omniscient than we are), partly because it is such a fleeting force –– striking either too quickly or too slowly for us to catch it. Moreover, we struggle with identifying and acknowledging wrongness because of the strong emotional and cognitive forces (the desire for the feeling of certainty, the biases) that protect us, and keep us overwhelmingly invested in particular perspectives at the expense of other perspectives more aligned with reality. However much we may want to insist on the contrary or wish away our propensity to get things wrong (and we do this routinely), if we actually look at it, we invariably, deeply, absurdly, and inevitably get things wrong. Actually facing this truth doesn’t need to doom us, however, to defeated nihilism. The gap between our perspectives and the world make possible our two distinctly powerful human abilities: imagination and empathy. (Both are the result of allowing more than one perspective in a situation, of permitting a bigger notion than just a single “rightness.”) Successful incorporation and integration of our own wrongness –– which requires going through the excruciating emotional pain of admitting and allowing wrongness –– expands our sensitivities and perspectives as human beings. Collectively, our relationship with the gap also makes possible the two best products of human work, art and science. At root, error –– encountering the gap –– contributes to diversity, wonder, and richness of human experience. Alas, however, it will not ever lead us to a refuge of solid objectivity. Alas, there is no magic formula for dealing with the tensions between our desired rightness and inevitable wrongness. We can, however, recognize the growth and wondrous (mystical?) perspectives that are available in confronting their clash within us, the fundamental and inevitable experience of being a human being.

275,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45191284-beth,4,"Kathryn Schulz delves into all the ways we can be wrong, explaining the strange whys and hows or error generation, denial, and results. The fact that the fabric of humanity is interwoven with error and inseparable from the state of being human is something abput which most of us live in denial. Schulz uncovers some of the universal characteristics of being wrong in a way that is more palatable than some of the ways society reminds us we are wrong. We are wired to resist the notion of our own fallibility, so this deft touch is necessary in order to circumvent our natural resistance. At the same time, she highlights the benefits of acknowledging and embracing our error in order to better our communities, our interpersonal relationships, and ourselves. For example:""This is one of the most powerful ways being wrong can transform us. It can help us be more compassionate people. Being right might be fun, but as we've seen, it has a tendency to bring out the worst in us. By contrast, being wrong might is often the furthest thing in the world from fun, and yet, in the end, it has the potential to bring out the best in us. Or, rather, to change us for the better.""This book now is added to 2 others - Tim Nochols' The Death of Expertise and Han Roslings's Factfulness- that I would recommend to any of my acquaintances who are trying to grapple with the perceived and real societal grievances battering for their attention. Schulz can get a little long-winded in places, but this is a deep topic and I found that if I hung with her she eventually led me to her point.One of my favorite passages is what I hope people gain from reading this book:""If you really want to be right, or at least improve the odds of being right, you have to start by acknowledging your fallibility. Deliberately seeking out your mistakes. And figuring out what caused you to make them."""
276,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3532236-charlie,4,"Schulz offers a powerful introduction to the examined life. She explores with wit, charm, and tenacity the ways we go wrong in our thinking and, what's more, the ways we go wrong in our thinking about going wrong. My greatest surprise and pleasure was the deep emotional intelligence present in a book I had expected to be skewed heavily to the cerebral. I highly recommend to anyone who cares about better thinking. "

There is freedom from jargon and unnecessary complication, but also freedom from any padding whatsoever. It's utterly precise. So I would describe it as accessible but exhausting.

In all, Schulz does an admirable job of selecting her chosen anecdotes and ends up with a satisfying and thought-provoking read.NotesPerhaps the history of the errors of mankind, all things considered, is more valuable and interesting than that of their discoveries. Truth is uniform and narrow; it constantly exists, and does not seem to require so much an active energy, as a passive aptitude of the soul in order to encounter it. But error is endlessly diversified; it has no reality, but is the pure and simple creation of the mind that invents it. In this field the soul has room enough to expand herself, to display all her boundless faculties, and all her beautiful and interesting extravagancies and absurdities.—Benjamin Franklin______Many of the religious thinkers who tried to understand why we err found their answer at the gates of the Garden of Eden. Thus Thomas Aquinas, the thirteenth-century scholastic, held that we make mistakes because, when we were banished from paradise, we were cut off forever from direct access to divine truth. To Aquinas and many of his fellow theologians, our errors arise from the gap between our own limited and blemished minds and God’s unlimited and perfect omniscience.This same basic idea has received countless secular treatments as well. Plato thought that our primordial soul was at one with the universe, and that we only began to err when we took on our current physical form and forgot those cosmic truths. The Enlightenment philosopher John Locke thought that error seeped into our lives from the gap between the artificiality of words and the reality of the things they name—from the distance between an indescribable essence and the nearest sayable thing. The German philosopher Martin Heidegger thought that error could be explained by the fact that we live in time and space; because we are bound to a particular set of coordinates, we can’t rise above them and see reality as a whole, from a bird’s-eye (or God’s-eye) view. As different as these explanations seem, all these thinkers and many more conceived of error as arising from a gap: sometimes between the particular and the general, sometimes between words and things, sometimes between the present and the primeval, sometimes between the mortal and the divine—but in every case, and fundamentally, between our own mind and the rest of the world.For the most part, we spend our lives blithely ignoring this gap. And with good reason. Who wants to be reminded of the fall from grace, the separation from truth, the particular and limited nature of our existence? ______How can we square this feeling of rightness with the very real possibility that we are wrong? This is a question that haunts all of wrongology, not just errors of memory. The problem is suggested by the very phrase “the feeling of knowing.” In life, as in language, we begin with a psychological state (the “feeling” part) and end up with a claim about the truth (the “knowing” part). In other words, we feel that we are right because we feel that we are right: we take our own certainty as an indicator of accuracy. This isn’t completely foolish of us, since studies show that there is some correlation between confidence and correctness. But it isn’t completely foolproof, either. As the case of flashbulb memories makes clear, our certainty reflects the existence of a particularly vivid inner picture. But nothing in life guarantees that this picture reflects the real state of affairs.This reliance on a vivid inner picture helps explain why memories are particularly apt to trigger the feeling of knowing.______ The philosopher Avishai Marga lit put this nicely. ""It is not the case that I am caught in a web of beliefs,"" he wrote. "" . . . Rather, I am caught in a network of witnesses."" Our relationships to these ""witnesses""-the people and institutions that attest to the truth of various beliefs-predate and determine our reaction to whatever information they supply. As Margalit said, ""my belief in [one of these witnesses] is prior to my belief that (what she says is true)."" Belief in is prior: however far this might be from our sense of how we should form our ideas about the world, it is the first principle of how we actually do so. All of us are caught in Margalit's ""networks of witnesses""­ not just in one but in many, and not just from time to time but all the time, from the moment we are born until the day we die. As countless commen­tators have observed, this lends to our beliefs an element of the arbitrary. Montaigne, for instance, remarked that people ""are swept [into a belief]­ either by the custom of their country or by their parental upbringing, or by chance-as by a tempest, without judgment or choice, indeed most often before the age of discretion.""______These latter­ day zealots have hailed from many different backgrounds and held many different beliefs. At heart, though, and paradoxically, they have all shared a single conviction: that they and they alone are in possession of the truth. (The very word ""zealot"" comes from a Greek root meaning to be jealous of the truth-to guard it as your own.) What zealots have in common, then, is the absolute conviction that they are right. In fact, of all the symbolic ones and zeros that extremists use to write their ideological binary codes­ us/them, same/different, good/evil-the fundamental one is right/wrong. Zealotry demands a complete rejection of the possibility of error. The conviction that we cannot possibly be wrong: this is certainty.______[O]ur be­liefs come in bundles. That makes it hard to remove or replace one without affecting the others-and it gets harder as the belief in question gets more central. In this respect, beliefs are like the beams in a building or the words in a sentence: you can't eliminate one and expect the fundamental sound­ ness or fundamental meaning of the overall system to remain unchanged. As a result, being wrong sometimes triggers a cascade of transformations so extensive that the belief system that emerges afterward bears almost no resemblance to its predecessor. ______You fight your superficiality, your shallowness, so as to try to come at people without unreal expectations, without an overload of bias or hope or arrogance, as untanklike as you can be . . . and yet you never fail to get them wrong. You might as well have the brain of a tank. You get them wrong before you meet them: you get them wrong while you're with them and then you get home to tell somebody else about the meeting and you get them all wrong again. Since the same generally goes for them with you, the whole thing is really a dazzling illusion empty of all perception, an astonishing farce of misperception. And yet what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people, which gets bled of the significance we think it has and takes on a significance that is ludicrous, so ill equipped are we all to envision one another's interior workings and invisible aims? . . . The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway. It's getting them wrong that is living, getting them wrong and wrong and wrong and then, on careful reconsideration, getting them wrong again . That's how we know we are alive: we're wrong. —Phillip Roth, American Pastoral______We go to our jobs, stop by the bar on our way home, hang out with our friends, raise our kids­ because these things are the stuff of life, to be sure, but also because they are strategies for keeping the terror of isolation in check. Soren Kierkeg­aard, that existentialist before there was existentialism, compared us in this respect to those early American pioneers who banged on their pots and pans all night long, hoping to keep the wolves at bay. Keeping wolves at bay is a start. But of all our ways of dealing with this rift, our favorite by far is the one that promises to eliminate it entirely­ to transform our desert island into a tropical paradise, our fundamental separation into ecstatic union. This strategy is our last, best hope for escap­ing the loneliness of existence and giving despair the slip. I am talking, of course, about love.______The idea that we possess a true self serves a hugely important psycho­ logical purpose. If we have an essential and unchanging identity, one we are destined to discover sooner or later, then the beliefs we hold, the choices we make, the person we become-none of this happens by chance. Instead, the entire course of our lives is inevitable, dictated by the certainty that our real self will eventually surface...This narrative is appealing for the same reason that it is problematic: within it, we can do no wrong. Our false beliefs were foreordained, our ap­parent errors occurred strictly in the service of a larger truth. This idea is made explicit in the religious affirmation that ""God makes no mistakes"": even the seeming trials and blunders of our lives are part of a larger plan: As that implies, stories starring a true self are teleological; we end up exactly where we are meant to be. This, too, is both an attraction and a weakness of the idea of an essential self. It suggests that our lives are deterministic, that yesterday's convictions-which we thought we chose based on their intellectual, emotional, or spiritual merits-were merely a trap into which we were lured for the benefit of some predetermined future self. Whatever meaning or worth our past might have had on its own terms is effectively written out of existence. Even more problematically, the idea of a true self suggests that we will never undergo momentous upheaval again. How could we? Having finally discovered who we really are and have always been, there is no further transformation available to us. If the self is constantly changing, then we can constantly feel our way forward, constantly become someone new-but if each of us possesses a fixed essence, then we can only return to it. Accord­ingly, our past departure from that essential self can only be a single and inexplicable aberration, associated as often as not with betrayal, transgres­sion, and sin. (Recall Chambers denouncing Communism, his erstwhile faith, as ""evil, absolute evil."") Singular, aberrational, transgressive, evil: we've seen this constellation of ideas before. This is the pessimistic model of wrongness, in which error is an unwelcome anomaly, a mark of our exile from the sacred realm of truth. Helpfully, this reminds us that we have another model for making sense of wrongness as well-one that casts a different light not only on our errors but also on ourselves. Here, wrongness is a natural and ongoing process, and we are not deformed but transformed by it. ______""The main in­terest in life and work,"" said Foucault, ""is to become someone else that you were not in the beginning."" Such transformations don't only come about through wrongness, of course-but wrongness is always an opportunity for such transformations. ______I was of three minds, Like a tree In which there are three blackbirds. —Wallace Stevens, 13 Ways of Looking at a Blackbird______His desire to banish art is part of a long and often sinister tradition (which we glimpsed earlier) of trying to create ideal societies through eradicating error in all its forms. All of those disgruntled undergraduates, meanwhile, are motivated in part-whether they know it or not-by the optimistic model of wrongness. They recognize, as most of us do, not just the legitimacy but also the poten­tial beauty and power of individual, skewed, inaccurate representations of reality. In this model, the link between error and art i s not a n indictment of art but a defense of error. Cut off from the absolute essence of things-that ideal form that Plato felt existed only in the mind of God-our separate, subjective consciousnesses look around and see, instead, Water Lilies, or Starry Night, or Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Likewise, we can make Beowulf and Star Wars and Horton Hears a Who! for the same reason we can make mistakes: because, as I said earlier, we are capable of conjuring the world not just as it is, but also as it is not. Our capacity to err is inseparable from our imagination.______The most famous formulation of this relationship between art, doubt, and error comes from the Romantic poet John Keats. He had been talking over various matters with a friend, he wrote to his brothers in a letter in 1 817, ""and at once it struck me,"" what quality went to form a Man of Achievement especially in lit­erature & which Shakespeare possessed so enormously-! mean Negative Capability, that is when man is capable of being in un­certainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact & reason.Keats's attitude toward uncertainty-and, for that matter, toward ""fact & reason""-is not the common one. He embraced unknowability and falli­bility, but not for the utilitarian purposes we saw in the last chapter. There, the point of embracing error was to curtail it-a kind of homeopathic rem­ edy for wrongness. But Keats wasn't interested in remedying wrongness. He recognized error and art as conjoined twins, born of the same place and vital to one another's existence. In life as in linguistics, art is joined at the root to artificial-to the not-true, the unreal-just as a fiction is at once a creation and a falsehood. ______But unlike androids, we humans do not nor­ mally self-destruct in the face of our mistakes. On the contrary: we self­ create, and self-recreate. This idea of self-creation suggests something else important about error. Being wrong doesn't just make us human in general; it also helps make each of us the specific person we are. In our inability to get things exactly right, in the idiosyncrasies of our private visions of the world, the outline of selfhood appears. This is what Benjamin Franklin was getting at in the quote I used as an epigraph to this book. Error, he wrote, is ""the pure and simple creation of the mind that invents it,"" a place where ""the soul has room enough to expand herself."" Mistakes, he ·meant, are the evidence and expression of an individual identity. This is an idea with deep and important roots in our intellectual history. It is, in essence, the crucial insight of evolutionary theory. Because of errors in the replication of genetic sequences, we wind up with variation among individual members of a species; and because of that variation, the species as a whole can adapt and survive. Such errors literally keep their hosts alive. A population that is too small or too homogenous to support significant genetic variation is doomed. For every species, then, error is a mechanism of survival and change. For us human organisms, with our richer relation­ ship to wrongness, mistakes enable not only our biological evolution but our social, emotional, and intellectual evolution as well. And wrongness also allows us to thrive in another way. I began this book by noting that we think of being right as essential to our survival and happiness, but in one key respect, nothing could be further from the truth. Countless studies have shown that people who suffer from depression have more accurate worldviews than nondepressed people. Depressed people do not nurture the cheering illusion that they can control the course of their lives. They rarely possess the conviction, so common in the rest of us, that they are above average in virtually every respect. And they understand, all too acutely, the basic conditions of existence: that their lifespan is just a brief blip in the cold sweep of history, that suffering is real and ongoing, that they and all the people they love are going to die. That outlook is known as depressive realism. Depressed people might be unhappy, but­ when it comes to these big-picture, existential matters-they are generally more right than the rest of us. It scarcely requires saying that this kind of rightness is not fun. ""To see the world as it really is is devastating and terrifying,"" wrote the philosopher Ernest Becker. "" . . . It makes thoughtless living in the world of men an im­possibility. It places a trembling animal at the mercy of the entire cosmos and the problem of the meaning of it."" As that indicates, the correlation between accuracy and depression runs both ways: people who are depressed tend to perceive the harsher realities of life more clearly, and people who clearly perceive those harsh realities tend to be (or to get) depressed. In an odd reversal of the usual state of affairs, when it comes to these existential issues, the bigger and more important the belief, the less it pays to be right. That's why, as I've said, the goal of therapy isn't necessarily to make our beliefs more accurate; it is to make them more functional. Ronnie Janoff­ Bulman, the psychologist, has even argued that ""a key to the good life might well be illusions at our deepest, most generalized level of assump­ tions and accuracy at the most specific, least abstract levels."" (Fortunately for us, these two perspectives are compatible: research suggests that people who possess a generally positive outlook are better at acknowledging their everyday errors and changing their minds.) If excessive accuracy in our self-image and worldview is correlated with depression, the opposite is true, too. Sometimes, being wrong makes us happy. Think of Don Quixote, that exemplary knight errant, who lent his name to the condition of being pleasantly deluded. "

It very much is, but just saying that is a bit of a cop-out. The book is a brilliantly written examination of the concept of error from every perspective imaginable. Schulz explores wrongness as an outside observer, a philosopher, a victim and a compassionate friend. By so fully embracing the idea on every level, she synthesizes a unified thesis from many disparate parts and supports every conclusion she draws with the best in logic and anecdote.At the core of Being Wrong is a suggestion. Not advice, so much as a recommendation for people interested in living a little better. Embrace your mistakes. It’s not about making mistakes and not feeling bad about it. Schulz wants us all to live with our errors a little more and not shove them away in a flurry of denial and justification. She goes on to examine the reasons why we are so adverse to being wrong, from the biological, (it doesn’t make evolutionary sense to be uncertain about anything) to the social, (our culture rejects leader figures who are indecisive) to the psychological. (depressed people have much more accurate worldviews than balanced personalties)Schulz is at her strongest when she is telling a story. The highlights of the books are the anecdotes she uses to set up each of her chapters. The stories include everything from Alan Greenspan’s unwavering faith in the economy proved wrong, to the touching story of an Exalted Cyclops of the KKK becoming one of the frontline fighters in the war for desegregated schools. Schulz has a deft hand for splicing these stories with the philosophical and scientific meat that connect them back to the reader’s everyday experience. She does tend to get bogged down in some of the dense history of the topic, but the frequent footnotes and witty asides help to break these thick sections up a little.The text itself induces stumbling, at least for me. It’s probably because the subject matter makes me paranoid that I’ve missed something, or misinterpreted a critical conclusion. To that end, I’d really recommend reading this book in chapters, rather than tackling the entire thing all at once. The writing lends it self to easy sectioning and while reading order is important, the ideas are all pretty sticky, which makes it easier to spread over time.Close to the end of the third section, Schulz examines the story of Penny Beerntsen, a woman who was raped and ended up falsely accusing another man of the crime. He was eventually proved innocent, but in the interim the woman had struggled to get closure in other ways. She wanted to understand the reasons people did horrible things to each other. To do this, she volunteered in prisons and really got to know the realities of being a convicted criminal in the United States. When the verdict came down proving that she had identified the wrong man, she was horrified, but she instantly accepted her mistake and wanted to somehow make up for it. Rather than try to deny her fault, she only sought to improve the life of the man she had thrown into prison unjustly.While this is an extreme example, I can’t think of a better example of being a truly human person. It would be an exaggeration to say I want be like Penny, but her example is one that I can value as someone who can be wrong and can be stupid about it. And really, we all fall into that category sometimes. Anyone who has ever been a critic of any kind knows the giddy thrill of being unquestionably right. (you cannot successfully argue against opinion) It is never a bad thing to gain a little perspective on that feeling, and that’s just what this book has allowed me to do."

The Latin, in turn, gave us the English word “erratic,” used to describe movement that is unpredictable or aimless.

It is a neglected and deeply human attribute: being wrong, feeling wrong, discovering one's wrongness, changing as a result—or, more usually, denying it, ducking and running from the acknowledgement of error. I was fascinated, particularly so once I got through the first chapters. The writing is a curious mix of academic rigour and convivial, almost conversational, English. I found the book deeply engrossing, and it gave me perspective about my own error-filled journey. I finished the book a few days ago, and I am still turning it over in my mind. Highly recommend."
285,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2011274-brian,5,"Have you ever been wrong? Of course you have. Everybody makes mistakes and many people talk like that is all they do, ""Oh I am always messing up"" they might say. Now try reflecting on the moment when you realized that you were wrong about something. Don't reflect on your past beliefs, whether trivial or not, but rather think of that moment where you shifted from knowing that you were right to knowing that you were not. How did that moment feel when you realized that you were wrong, not when you were actually wrong but when you realized you were wrong?There isn't an external force that can inform us of the correctness or incorrectness of our beliefs a priori and therefore prevent us from making minor or grave mistakes. We have to force ourselves to reckon our beliefs with the external world and when we find our beliefs at odds with the world, it hurts. When we are wrong we feel alone, the moment we recognize our errors is "". . . a moment of alienation, both from ourselves and from [our] previously convincing vision of the world.""This profound and well grounded skepticism about things that feel so right and natural to us is deeply troubling to me. Schulz's prose is very good and is a joy to read and quote* but I have to admit that reflecting on our tendency to err, often in disastrous ways, is unsettling. I think it is disturbing because it goes against our nature not only to know but also to be known. In the current american culture the sexual attraction to others is pretty overt and therefore almost ever present in our minds. But I think we forget about the attractions we have to others than have nothing to do with sex or physical appearances at all. A meeting of the minds is a truly rewarding experience wherein our views of the world are validated and shared. We are in agreement with others about being correct and that is deeply satisfying. Again, Schulz says it a bit better:“Think about how distressing it is to feel misunderstood, and how frustrating it is when someone believes something about you—that you’re irresponsible or can’t handle commitment or don’t pull your weight at work—that you think is untrue. Conversely, there are few things more gratifying than the feeling that someone deeply understands us. In fact, as we are about to see, this feeling of being of being “gotten” is the sine qua non of our most important relationships, and the very hallmark of being in love.”[4]Full review here:http://wp.me/p6r7eE-2P"
286,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8744761-william,5,"This is an impressive and surprisingly enjoyable book. While Schulz is a journalist, the work seems closer to scholarly than journalistic, though it has a lighter touch than scholarship typically achieves. In reading it, don't skip the foot- and endnotes. There is often good stuff there.I experienced ""Being Wrong"" on three levels, and it works exceptionally well on two of them. To begin with, Schulz makes a compelling case that being wrong is by and large more a constructive thing than a negative one. Emotion, creativity and humor, she points out, draw heavily on error to be compelling. While it is explicitly not her intention, there is a self-help aspect to the book which works well. It was impossible for me to read it and not say to myself: ""Hey, lighten up. You don;t have to get everything right the first -- or second, or third -- time.The second level on which i found the book effective is just as good reading. Schultz writes well and with impressive wit. This book would be a good read if you even skipped the message and just read the stories which appear so frequently. My guess is I remember some of the stories better -- and will do so longer -- than the main purpose of the book.Where I find the book a little less satisfying is in the central argument. It's meticulous, sometimes to the point of tediousness. Who knew there was so much to write on this subject? And there are occasional generalizations with which I disagree. (1) We all disdain undecided voters. (177) Huh? (2) ""We almost never find ourselves between theories"" (186). Maybe it's just me, but there are frequently issues on which I have not made up my mind. (3) [quoting LaRochefoucauld] ""Everyone complains about their memory; no one complains about their judgment."" It seems to me all of us have had long talks with friends upset because they keep making the same mistake over and over, and we can often feel that way about ourselves as well.But regardless of my discomfort with some of the logic and a case which seems occasionally overstated, I found the book personally useful, certainly interesting and most of all both educational and entertaining."
287,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1034550-doug-cheever,5,"From within the design and advertising fields you hear a lot about making mistakes (quickly and often) in reference to prototyping and/or rapid iteration within project workflows. That is not what this book is about. It does not try to approve or disapprove of making mistakes during an intentional brain dump (or storm). It does not try to repackage any established wisdom heard at a marketing conference. This book should not be pigeon-holded as ""self-help"" or ""business"" even though it may, by chance, give you the perceptual tools to somehow fix a decision you recently made, or are about to make, or help you stop hating your niece for joining that cult back in the 90s.It DOES research the history of why we feel, or believe, and why the final decision we make is believed to be true. Because this topic is covered from its most simple origin of sensing and belief you may have to read a few chapters before you get to one that changes the way you perceive the world. However you will enjoy the historical, personal and scientific references that are threaded throughout. Its funny and well written while it is smart, clever and funny. Bill Clinton reviewed it for f#ck sake, so you know its got to be pretty good. Albeit he probably spends most of every day trying to figure out why he did most of what he did in the 80s and 90s.Still not convinced? Well, the author did a TED talk that you may enjoy. If nothing else it will get you to experience her insightful fun voice of her writing which I really enjoy. "
288,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2795834-lauren-monsey-nagel,5,"Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of ErrorWhen I first got this book I actually didn't think it was going to be a book that I would enjoy. I'm not even sure why that is because I have just been nothing but fascinated, especially so at all the research this book must have required to write. The amount of work in putting the book together is not lost on me. My guess would be that this is one of those books that a college professor would assign to his class. I read it through once, and then reread each chapter once more if not twice for some. I have never taken any college courses but IO have self educated to a certain (non) degree. There is no doubt that I have really enjoyed this book, for I have penciled in some notes and highlighted sections, something I try to avoid doing usually. I am pretty impressed with the entire book, references and the authors personal references. All of which has really made for an interesting study of Being Wrong. I'm very pleased to add that this is one more of the books I've read that I will being easily entertained by and probably get more out of each time I go through it in the future."
289,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5881280-steve-penner,4,"""Being Wrong"" was a wonderful and fascinating plunge into the world of wrongology. It covers a wide-ranging host of topics on error, how it happens and particularly how we respond to being wrong. Her basic premise is that there are two models of error. One model propounds error as something to be avoided at all costs as it provides no benefits, only embarrassment and shame. The second, which Schulz celebrates, is that error is common and natural. It's benefit is that we can learn, grow and change as a result. It's a very positive spin on a topic that has been dealt with by Plato and other classic writers, Augustine and Aquinas, Enlightenment thinkers, Freud and many other comtemporary writers. Schulz is a wonderful story teller and her stories are the highlight of the book. She can be slightly irritating as a writer when she continually states that the topic ""is something I'll deal with later."" This ""pre-figuring"" happens at least 20 times and becomes wearisome. Hopefully a future editor will do a better job of tightening up this habit. Overall and beyond my pettiness, I heartily recommend this as a wonderful, leisurely read in which you will certainly learn something about history, literature and yourself."
290,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3213557-abdulrahman,4,"so yes.this is NOT a light read, as a start.. considering that I had to translate/comprehend/critic the ideas all at once. It kinda took me 2 hours to finish 30 pages or so.. *english is my 2nd language here*.. The book starts so well into its core concept and it keeps going so thoroughly discussing the ideas and concepts. sometimes it goes all the way to the core of philosophy and logic and all these mind twisting concepts of error and wrong and emotion and perception..At other chapters you feel like the introduction of the chapter never ends and takes so so long it kinda makes you lost and bored into it.. at others, it's like you're in a river of fluid stream of ideas so connected you don't feel yourself in its beauty.. but if there's one thing to notice, it's gonna be the effort the author put in compiling all the MASSIVE information of the different perspectives and sources and fields of knowledge it's admirable..I love this book, it's one of those books you feel sad you finished, and you feel like you've changed your perspective about so many things in life after reading.. This is how I felt, at least.. thank you Kathryn."
291,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9898446-david-teachout,5,"If I'm ever in a position to determine curriculum for psychology and science classes (among others), I'd make this book required reading. Schulz breaks down rather complex philosophical and psychological issues to easily understood concepts with direct practical application. Further, she does this without removing the terminology, making it easy for people to continue studying long after they've finished this book. This is not a work of post-modern woowoo, where being wrong means no truth can ever be determined. Instead this is a nuanced understanding of our human lives, filled as they are with probabilistic knowledge rather than absolutist dogma, and where we can trust our minds to do what they do, create stories, not form perfect encyclopedic recall. Doing so allows Schulz to make a truly delightful and helpful contribution to our existence: that being wrong is not something to attack like some horrid beast but an inevitable aspect of our lives to embrace and seek always to see how our mental tendencies to error can be mitigated through understanding. "
292,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1907832-carlene,3,"I'm sticking this on my ""read"" shelf, even though I didn't finish it.I'm intrigued of the idea of the book, from a completely psychological standpoint. However, I don't know if the book is written above my intelligence, if I'm not understanding some of what I'm reading because I'm in a medicinal fog, or some combination of the two. I've found it really hard to focus on this book, due to the fact that I don't know all of the terms she mentions. Unfortunately it seems to happen so frequently, that i'd have to have a dictionary next to me through the entire book. Honestly, that's just not something I really want to do at this point.Maybe eventually, I'll be able to give the book my full attention, but for now, I'm unable to even get to chapter 2. (this is in no way, me blaming the author. I take full responsibility for not comprehending things)Edit: I had forgotten to add that I received this book free, from Goodreads."
293,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11550691-robert,3,"I nearly gave up several times before making it past the first 50 pages, but I'm glad I kept going, despite a few more languid spots later in the book. A compelling aspect of Being Wrong is a set of arguments for the value of making errors or being wrong. An obsession with eliminating all errors may result in worse outcomes. For example, by taking risks and making some errors, you can learn much more than by sticking with safe decisions.One of the most interesting chapters covered areas of wrongness and criminology, starting off with the story of Steven Avery's 18-year sentence for a crime he didn't commit. That was followed by a note that he was later convicted of a murder, the only setback to date of the Wisconsin Innocence Project. Just two days after I read that chapter, I read an article about the Netflix documentary Making a Murderer that suggests that Avery might also be innocent of that crime, framed once again by the same bad cops."
294,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83526-karina,0,"I won this book in Goodreads First Reads. Odds: 55 copies available, 1006 people requesting.There is something wrong with the table of contents in my copy of the book. I wonder if it's there intentionally, just to see how many people would notice and point out the error. Oh, scratch that! I just noticed on the back it says ""uncorrected proof""; they are probably going to fix it before it's out.Anyway, I'm finding this book very readable, and interesting, and thought-provoking. I have a list of things that I want to quote and this is all just from the first couple of chapters, haha... This is another book that reminds me of Saint Thomas Aquinas: The Dumb Ox; it directly refers to Thomas Aquinas in a few places. "
295,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11297501-anna,5,"Kathryn Schulz argues passionately for the value of error. She shows us that not only is 'being wrong' a given in life, it is also a gift that has the power to transform our worldviews, our relationships, and ourselves. By drawing on philosophy, neuroscience, psycholoanalysts and a bit of common sense, she charts out the intellectual history of the shifting definitions and attitudes ascribed to being wrong and masterfully combines it with relevant & relatable examples from the present day. Schulz is a terrific thinker & and she writes with an elegant clarity and simplicity that make it nearly impossible to believe this is her first book (it seems as though she has done this before). Definitely one of the best things I have read in years. I am kind of in love with her now. Check out her Ted talks. "
296,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826906-laura,4,"I saw the author speak (very entertainingly) at an education conference, which was appropriate since - as she argues persuasively - being wrong is an inextricable part of learning and imagination. Yet in education we can often inadvertently send a message that error is something to fear and avoid. This is an entertaining book which would have been enhanced by some cross-cultural examination - e.g. how is error conceived of in cultures with a very different sense of self? Nevertheless, it's a rare book that really is relevant to everyone - but since we've all been wrong, are currently wrong (though we don't yet know how) and will be wrong at some point in the future, we can all find something to learn and relate to here."
297,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1286095-nate-stearns,4,"Wow, lots of vitriol. It seems that much of the firepower is arraigned towards the writing style, especially the mix of academic language with the more colloquial. I admit I'm a sucker for that mix, so I've enjoyed her style mostly. Also, David seemed to say that the problem was that it got bogged down in semantics and word games, but I actually thought there was more emphasis on neuro-biology with anecdotes thrown in. She wasn't always the most illuminating--do I really need to hear about the old woman/young woman picture one more time?--but I think it helps flesh out the constellation of issues around our own images of ourselves and our rightness. At least, it makes my staff meeting make a whole lot more sense."
298,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3205222-colleen-wu,3,"Not bad, but I was expecting something with a little more hard core science and a little less philosophizing. Still an interesting topic and discussion, although I think I agree with an earlier reviewer that the section on Love was not really related to the rest of the book and not really apropos to the topic. I found the idea of pessimistic versus optimistic views of wrongness intriguing. The author did inject some mild humor throughout the book that made the book more fun to read without being over the top or distracting. This review is based on a review copy received for free through the Goodreads giveaway program."
299,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3761228-adman,4,"Insightful, therapeutic, and hopeful, this book belies its title inasmuch as it surveys error not so much as frontier but heartland, nay, even as a sort of self-sown weed of fate that springs out of any coordinates in any plot of land where we happen to plant our flag of sureness. Schulz crosses all sorts of habitual borders within which we assume we have found safety from error (or accidents, or sin) and shows that we badly overestimate such security (victory, righteousness). She does so with compassion and zeal, and this time stays quite true to her title. It really is an adventure to her to knock down the ego's badly-constructed refuges and blaze a new trail for how we think and act. It is not a sadistic or despairing adventure, though: Schulz believes this eyes-open journey can be better for her and for all of us than how we usually get along in life.Schulz covers a lot of territory. Material and mental subjects are treated in this book, from, say, stepping on a rake to the meta-mistake of rationalizing the mishap (intentional, unavoidable, someone else's fault, or really anything else other than our own error). Schulz hikes around between memory and science, moves from the mundane to the dramatic, sits down to chat with romance, politics, and religion. She does all this with a diplomacy that surprised and gladdened me. Taking a page from her own reflections, I wonder how much her topical environment guided her and her editors to observe even-handedly and deliver cautious judgments. I wish other authors would take note. Any of us, really, who is less blatantly kept in line by whatever happens to be the topic at hand might benefit from Schulz's choice. Far too much intellectual and practical territory, in print or in person, is overrun far too often by refusing to be open and hospitable about error -- in ourselves or others.The trail in this book does not lead to a new shelter where we can rest again from the hard work of living. Instead, how we make and walk our path seems to be Schulz's source of inspiration. How much better off might we be if we acknowledge and respect our seemingly inexhaustible capacity for error? What if we did not retreat in either denial or despair? What if we ventured from time to time out of the refuge of the self into the crowd or, the reverse, from the masses into the self? What if we diverted some of our energy from purging and purifying and celebrated and cultivated the capacity of some institutions -- art, religion, certain forms of government -- to introduce us to our limitations?I was struck by how relationship-oriented this book is. I suppose Schulz might respond, how could it not be? First of all and obviously, the book is not part of me -- not in my traditional sense of self. As with any book, I am contending with a thing outside of me. The book is not Ms. Schulz either, but rather a shadow-her that emerged as she researched and wrote, a page-bound self she may have hoped would reflect her living self. This shadow then introduced me, the reader, to other various, astute shadow-thinkers, -scientists, -theologians, and -philosophers. They all shared with me their experiences of a gap between the self and the world and also shared their ill-begotten efforts to remedy that gap. What a wilderness of joining and separating this is to be lost in! So many glances and so many voices have been cast over so many stone walls that stretch and tangle across an endless, fog-shrouded pasture of human experience.Or, if you prefer Ms. Schulz's own, less striving metaphor, life is like a game of telephone, and we often can't make up our minds how to feel -- or what to do -- about the inevitable degeneration of the initial message (though of course no one alive can lay claim to that first message) and our powerlessness to steer that degeneration.Schulz really gets to the bottom of things when she observes that we are in search of wholeness more than we are in search of rightness. Like small children, we want unity between whatever we understand to be the self and the not-self. Error -- accident, sin, the comical-or-frustrating evolution of the message in telephone, defeat at the hands of one's pen, keyboard, numb fingers or mute tongue to put one's spirit in touch with one's blind and deaf neighbors -- represents our failure (or, as we often like to pretend, the failure of others) to be one.Fortunately, around this point in the book, Schulz made an unexpected digression to identify art with error. I have often been driven to desperation and something in the neighborhood of madness by my inability to write poems or stories that express what I wish to convey in details or intensity. What a welcome, unexpected relief it was to read John Keats (among others) describing imperfection as the necessary and desired product of artistic endeavor. Why? I don't recall the line of reasoning she establishes but in the moment that I am writing this, I take it to mean that artistic error is evidence -- of the self, one's hopes, one's intentions, one's peculiar, unrepeatable humanness. It is evidence precisely in its failure to convey exactly what I want it to -- evidence of difference, disunity, and striving toward something else.Schulz ultimately praises error -- with a bit of hedging and a bashful allusion to the Judeochristian story of the Fall. She is not quite comfortable with blatantly saying bad is good. She simply wishes to offer hope that error is not the harbinger of doom we take it -- and often make it -- to be. Instead, it is a circumstance, a lesson, a challenge, an invitation."
