0,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,5,"I have a very strong memory of the day my youngest was born. I can still summon the piercing scent of puddled broken water in a middle room of the second floor of our house. Problem is that my daughter was born before we moved into that house. Yet I, and hopefully everyone else who comes up short in a quest for perfection, can take solace from this outstanding book. Kathryn Schulz - image from TEDSchulz coins the term “wrongology” as a tag for her view that being wrong can, in the scheme of things, be a pretty good thing, that we learn more from our mistakes than from our successes, that mistakes involve motion while perfect success implies stasis. In terms of the sheer volume of concepts raised in Being Wrong, this is a hefty work. It could have become a bit too heavy, but Schulz presents her case and her research with such puckish good humor that it all goes down very smoothly indeed.First of all, Schulz is a journalist, not a scientist, historian, philosopher or a linguist. Yet, all these viewpoints, and others, are well represented in this impressive work. This is not a fast read. Don’t bring it to the beach looking for a quick diversion. I tend to take notes in books of this sort, marking passages that hold particular appeal. I was kept quite busy while reading Being Wrong, noting, then typing out many, many passages that called my name. One measure for me of how rich a non-fiction read is can be found in how much time I spend typing out marked items. My hunt-and-peck time was considerable here. So many worthwhile observations, so much interesting material to be absorbed. Mother’s milk. You will learn a lot from reading this book, and will be entertained while doing so. I have a few quibbles. I suppose I was hoping for some familiar examples of error. Perhaps adding the Titanic to her trove of error evaluation chestnuts would be asking too much. And the most obvious and germane big-picture example of error, DNA mutation that results in evolution, receives only a passing mention near the end. Yet, not taking Schultz up on this challenge to look into her analysis of error would be…well, a mistake. To err is human but to read Being Wrong is divine.=============================EXTRA STUFFLinks to the author’s personal, Twitter and FB pagesAnd here is her wonderful TED talkA list of Schulz’s articles in  New York Magazine"
1,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,2,"I am not a particularly violent person. But there were so many places in this book where I wanted to sit the author down, smack her briskly and scream at her ""What were you thinking? It started with the very first word in the book, freshly minted for the occasion by the author. You read it and experience an involuntary recoil of revulsion at the sheer tin-eared ugliness of it. For God's sake, Kathryn Schulz, please don't title your opening chapter ""Wrongology"". If the first word in your book already makes my flesh crawl, that's hardly a good sign.I chose this book based on a fawningly positive NY Times review by Dwight Garner, who obviously suffers from some kind of unhealthy crush on Kathryn Schulz. According to Dwight, KS ""flies high in the intellectual skies, leaving beautiful sunlit contrails"". Now, I get off on the ozone rush of huffing a beautiful intellectual contrail as much as the next reader, but I'm afraid in this case Dwight is letting his slobbering fanboy worship cloud his judgement. Kathryn Schulz is not stupid, but she's certainly no intellectual goddess. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem, but given the direction she chose to take her investigation in this book, the reader begins to wonder if her choice was a wise one and (I hate to say it) if she really has the intellectual chops for the task she sets herself. I think it would have been a perfectly straightforward matter to come up with a reasonable working definition of ""being wrong"", one would that cover the great majority (say 95%) of situations that are of practical interest. Had Kathryn Schulz chosen to adopt this kind of pragmatic approach, she would have written a considerably shorter book and, I think, a much better one. Unfortunately, she has chosen instead to wax philosophical about epistemological difficulties in coming up with appropriate definitions of concepts such as ""knowledge"", ""being right"", ""error"", and if one wants to bump it up a meta-level, knowledge of errors (one's own and those of others). Not surprisingly this turns out to be a rabbit hole, and not a particularly interesting one. Schulz's choice to explore these questions has the immediate effect of lengthening the book considerably and burdening whole sections with the kind of jargon only a professional philosopher could love. A case in point: the First Person Constraint on Doxastic Explanation , which is apparently the phrase philosophers use for the phenomenon that anyone pressed to defend his/her beliefs will say that it's because they are true. Flawed logic, conflict of interest, reason clouded by emotion -- these problems may be immediately evident to other people, but we are notoriously bad at detecting them in our own thinking. To her credit, the author acknowledges the clunkiness of the philosphical jargon; I just wish the replacement she proposes - the 'Cuz It's True Constraint didn't set my teeth on edge with the faux-folksiness of that 'cuz. But this reflects a problem with Schulz's style that bothered me throughout the book. Maybe it's a consequence of her time as a reporter for Rolling Stone, but she never seems to find a consistent register. As she flips back and forth from discussing scientific results to illustrations from popular culture, this failure to establish an appropriate register becomes jarring. Whether it's her choice to write ""fuck up"" when ""screw up"" would clearly have been more appropriate, or sentences like this one, about Hamlet: ""It's not as if the prince dillydallies for fourteen scenes over whether to order the BLT or the chicken salad"", I just did not enjoy Schulz's writing style.Which is a shame, really, because buried in there among the superfluous philosophical baggage and the rambling mess of her own prose, she has some genuinely interesting points to make. In particular, her observation that making mistakes is an intrinsic part of human nature, and is an essential component of scientific enquiry, is important, if not particularly novel. However, Schulz is not the first person to have considered the questions in her book. A considerably clearer, more focused, discussion can be found in the excellent ""Mistakes Were Made"" by Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson. The rambling undisciplined character of Schulz's writing prevents me from giving her book more than two stars. The disappointment is that, with some decent editing, she could have written a far better book."
2,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/222151-ed,5,"Absolutely loved this book, which really does uncover the extent to which we deny our mistakes and how much we would gain by admitting them, at least to ourselves. There is also an art to understanding that doubt is good so long as it does not paralyze us.  The author found that when she told people that she was writing about mistakes, they all said: 'Oh I have made tons of mistakes in my life'. She would reply: 'Oh it would really help my research if you could tell me about a few of them.' And people couldn't remember a single example in most cases. :) Given this challenge, and being whom I am, of course, I could not resist then listing 70 major mistakes I had made in my life and sending them in an email to my wife for the record, as she is very kind! The mistakes covered relationships, friendships, financial, subjects I studied, career, housing. My goodness, that was pretty heavy, but I learned a lot. Try it sometime. It is oh so liberating if you can do it honestly, and then ask; 'OK so what might I do differently going forward'. Above all keep saying the Taoist phrase: 'no blame', just learn from the mistakes and don't beat up on yourself."
3,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish,3,"Schultz' review of H is for Hawk in the New Yorker magazine this spring really made me take notice not only of Macdonald's book but also of the art of reviewing. Schultz's review was as gorgeous and thoughtful as Macdonald's book. I set out to see what else Schultz wrote.I really like Schultz' premise on this one: we feel badly when we make mistakes, but everyone does it. As Schultz points out, before Descartes (""I think, therefore I am"") was St. Augustine (""I err, therefore I am"" or ""To err is human""). The thing is, while some errors are small ones, or funny ones (and Schultz gives examples) some folks make big ones (like Bush and his weapons of mass destruction or putting the wrong man in jail for life). What is clear from our own experience is that being wrong is so painful that we often just carry on as though we were right after all. We stick to our guns, as they say, and harden our position. Schultz points out that only with long experience in living do we come to the ""wisdom"" phase...""no one can be right all the time,"" so we should embrace error as the path to perfectibility.This discursive work is filled with anecdotes and case studies, experiments and examples. I think it is for this reason that I leapfrogged through it. Wrong of me, no doubt. I had to go back now and again to pick out useful pieces that encapsulated her thoughts. And this is where I found the problem, at least for me: I like examples pointing to conclusions, but the conclusions were less finely drawn than I would like and the examples perhaps too many and divergent. But we do get conclusions at the end, and it brings to mind Shambhala studies and democracy:""Here, then, are some ways we can try to prevent mistakes. We can foster the ability to listen to one another and the freedom to speak our minds. We can create open and transparent environments instead of cultures of secrecy and concealment. And we can permit and encourage everyone, not just a powerful inner circle, to speak up when they see the potential for error.""Schultz gave two TED talks in the aftermath of her book publication. Both are interesting, but the one on regret rang a bell, or a symphony, more like."
4,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2976142-thomas-edmund,5,"At the time I grabbed it, Being Wrong was just an interest book in my non-fiction wishlist, something that I would little away a few minutes on Kindle when waiting at the bus-stop, for dinner, or for friends to show up.Before I knew it I was jumping into the world of ""Wrongology"" for my daily fix. In her own words Schulz did not want to write an encyclopedia of Wrong, meaning the book isn't simply a long laundry list of different examples or major incidents of wrongness throughout history. Rather Schulz tackles the idea of Wrongness from several different angles, discussing our cognition, culture, and philosophies of error.The result is a piece that gets deep AF. Talking about how error rattles us not just because of our fragile egos, but because being shown to be wrong is to show us that reality is different than we truly though it was. Schulz even dives into humour and art, and the relationship with error.So if you're worried that this book is going to be a dry or sarcastic take on being mistaken, that isn't quite the ride you'll be in for. At times Being Wrong covers such diverse and in depth topics, I found myself getting lost (ironically I suppose) in exactly what subject I was reading about, but I was never bored or disinterested. I actually found Being Wrong to be more helpful than most other self-help or improvement type books by broadening my understanding of myself and others ""Wrongness"" "
5,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/288945-jane,5,"This is really a must-read. Do you realize how little we can trust ourselves to perceive the truth? This is a great analysis of how we get things wrong, why it matters, and why errors can be a good thing in the journey of life. Plus, its analysis of Hamlet is spot on. I mean, if the only evidence of murder you have is a ghost's message, don't you think you'd better try to vet the facts a bit before taking justice in your own hands?-g"
6,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3124054-sarah,1,"Being Wrong. Kathryn Schulz. 2010. Ecco. 400 pages. ISBN 9780061176043.Being Wrong is an exploration of how and why making errors is a crucial, natural and necessary component of being human, and how we must embrace being wrong to grow as people.Falling into the psychology versus scientific realm, Being Wrong provides an interesting history of wrongness using numerous examples of pop-culture incidents; if you can consider an intricate look at being wrong an interesting subject, that is. Schulz's voice is very eccentric, and the book will flood you with a barage of examples on how being wrong has transformed people and generated numerous events and mis-adventures since the beginning of time. Schulz also uses the experiences of past leaders and world-renowned figures as examples in terms of how being wrong has been significant in history.Being Wrong reads very much like a narrative, and we can really hear Schulz's opinions on the matter. Because the book has this particular tone, it tends to be quite long, drawn-out, and somewhat boring in most places. If the book had been written more to cater to the common audience using layman's terms, it would have been infinitely more interesting and appealing. I also noticed there are no definitions to some terms, phrases and words that the majority of readers will fail to understand. It's great when I can learn new words throughout the course of a book, but needing a dictionary several times in one paragraph tends to become more work then enjoyment. You can open Being Wrong to any random page in the book and immediately be able to pinpoint a sentence that requires assistance in some way, shape, or form to understand. To provide an example, I can open the book to a random page in Chapter 4 and find the following sentence,""For us, as for those shoppers, something in the alchemy of the interaction often causes our half-baked hypotheses to congeal on the spot.""What does that MEAN??!! What exactly is a ""half-baked hypothesis""?As it stands, I don't think Being Wrong will be a great experience for someone who isn't a psychologist or even mildly interested in the subject of being wrong. I give kudos to those readers who can interpret and enjoy Being Wrong.For more book reviews by DreamSE22 visit http://dreamworldbooks.com."
7,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1842008-kate,5,"Interesting how polarizing this book is. I think an open mind and a willingness to be wrong are helpful as you read; there's a lot to be gotten from the psychological delving. An excellent examination of the psychological and physiological aspects of ""being wrong."" The first 1/2-2/3 of the book are dedicated to explaning WHY we are wrong, and why we usually think we are right! The rest of the book talks about acknowledging when we are wrong and why being wrong can is a good thing, and indeed an essential element in art and literature. I found the chapters on people accepting areas in their life that they got wrong to be especially moving. A chapter on understanding why our spouse/partner is NOT exactly the person we think (because we of course are right!) they should be is worse the price of the book. When you come to see the 'truths' you take to be self evident are really your beliefs, and could possibly be wrong, or could change, you can be more open and forgiving of others. I thought this was an excellent read and not at all stuffy or too technical or too hard to read."
8,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2160001-jack-hart,5,"This is, to my way of thinking, an extraordinary book about a great topic. Although, if you're not an intellectually ambitious person the book may seem to have, as several Good Reads reviewers opined, too damn many words. But I like Kathryn Schulz's prose. She knows her western canon and cites it deftly. In the course of elaborating her ideas about the experience of wrongness she'll even uncover a novel point here and there about the literature and philosophy she so clearly loves.I also like that she's a reporter. She wants to tell stories about our world now, and finds people whose lives have forced on them deep meditations on wrongness and she gets them to open up to her: A divorce lawyer to the stars, a woman who was raped who's testimony put the wrong man in prison, a young fundamentalist woman who fell in love with an atheist. She draws on their experience and brings their words into her argument with considerable delicacy.The topic itself is fascinating. She explains that ""we don't experience, remember, track, or retain mistakes as a feature of our inner landscape."" As soon as we realize we have a bad theory about something it's like our brain grabs another one so that we can always experience ourselves as in the right. This argument is set out with great fun and skill, and if you buy into it you start to buy into a humanizing fascination with our relations to wrongness. She argues it's inextricably bound with our next best selves, and she makes this argument in a friendly, secular, wide-ranging way that I found myself taking to heart. "
9,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/883725-julianna,4,"Reviewed for THC ReviewsIf not for it being our latest book club read, I’m not sure I would have picked up Being Wrong on my own, not because it didn’t sound interesting (it did and was one of my top picks among the choices we voted for this month), but because I may not have found it without someone else bringing it to my attention. It’s simply not the type of book that probably would have come up in my day-to-day browsing of reading recommendations. But I can’t deny that it ended up being a very interesting read. As a psychology geek, who’s fascinated with the inner workings of the human mind, I was intrigued by all the many different ways in which we can be wrong, and more importantly, how we can delude ourselves into thinking that we’re right even when we aren’t. This was an extremely well-researched and well-written book that engaged my intellect, while also bringing me to the realization that perhaps I need to more closely examine my beliefs and sense of rightness in various areas.One of the main things this book does is delving into the various reasons why we can be so wrong about certain things. Some of it is rooted in a seeming quirk of human nature that drives us to have a need for beliefs. We being theorizing about the world around us as infants and by childhood we’re beginning to develop our beliefs. We all must believe in things, whether it’s as benign as what color of paint looks best in a certain room to something as momentous as the existence of God. And throughout life our beliefs may change, but usually we have trouble letting go of one belief until we have another one to replace it. Otherwise, we might find ourselves in an existential crisis. Whether we realize it or not, we also have a need for certainty in our lives. That’s why when someone seems so certain about something, it can be very appealing and lead us toward a belief in that thing whether it’s true or not. As humans, we additionally tend to have a tribal mentality, the sense that if the majority of the people in our social circle are going along with something, then it must be the right path when sometimes it isn’t. I was also intrigued by the ways in which our memories can be so fickle and faulty. I know that the next time someone insists that something happened a certain way, I’ll be taking it with a grain of salt, even if that someone is me.:-) One of the major strengths of the book for me was all the true stories of people who’ve been wrong in various ways. I think I’m the type of person who learns and understands better when I have concrete examples, so these stories really helped the message of the book come alive for me in a way it might not have without them. The author includes so many stories of ways in which people have been wrong, even phenomenally wrong, throughout the ages, even though they thought they were right. One that stood out was the Millerites in the 18th century, who claimed to have calculated down to the day when Christ was going to return. Many of them didn’t plant crops that year and/or sold off all their worldly possessions, believing they were going to be swept up to heaven on that day. But of course it didn’t happen. Some then left the faith altogether, while others readjusted their beliefs and what they thought they knew into something else, and still others doubled down on their beliefs. This movement later grew into the denomination known as Seventh Day Adventists. Another stand-out story was that of two contrasting rape cases. In both cases, the men convicted of the rapes were misidentified and later exonerated through DNA evidence. In one case, the woman who was raped was very accepting of the results and tried to reconcile with the man she misidentified. In the other case, the prosecutor, apparently unable to come to terms with the fact that he’d tried the wrong man, tied himself up in knots trying to explain away the scientific evidence while insisting the man was still guilty. There were so many of these great stories throughout the book that helped make it a fascinating read.I had a really hard time rating Being Wrong. It truly is very well done. The author is clearly an extremely intelligent, erudite, and articulate writer, who did her research well and organized this book in a way that made sense. I was constantly amazed at how she was able to tie everything together cohesively, and sometimes temporarily drop a thread, only to deftly weave it back in later. The absorbing, tantalizing, and sometime humorous anecdotes made the book more accessible, and there was much that I learned from its pages with regards to the human mind and how we can be wrong, but at the same time, I felt like there were things that I was missing. I freely admit that this may have been a failing of my own brain to grasp what was being said, but I can’t help feeling that if I had trouble with parts of it, others might as well. My book club is a pretty smart group and yet most of them agreed that this was definitely not an easy read. I think this is my main reason for dropping the star, but feel free to take that with a grain of salt. Just know that it will require a sharp mind and good concentration to grasp the contents.I will also leave with this last thought. Despite the author saying that she didn’t set out to write a self-help book, I felt that it did in many ways help me to better understand wrongness. I might have wished for a step-by-step guide for combating the reasons for wrongness, but I was still able to glean some strategies for this from within its pages. At the end of the day, that’s a win for me. If it makes me (and others who read it) look more carefully at my (their) assertions, then IMHO, the book will have done its job. So for that I definitely recommend it. In our current age, when so many people are entrenched in political or other divisive belief systems, I think delving into our wrongness is a great place to start the difficult work of change."

11,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2624836-reese,3,"My copy of BEING WRONG: ADVENTURES IN THE MARGIN OF ERROR was a gift -- a Goodreads giveaway. My being wrong -- occasionally, frequently, perhaps consistently -- is a ""gift"" from our Creator and/or my creators. The ways in which I experience being wrong are probably also ""gifts"" from my creators, teachers, friends, et al. As a parent, I have passed on the ""gift"" of intermittent or perpetual wrongness and promoted certain reactions to being wrong. When my son was a young child, he would respond to ""What time is it?"" with answers such as ""It's approximately 3:27."" If from this anecdote you have concluded that being right is very important in the family that I helped to create, you are -- I believe -- not wrong. Half-jokingly, my son would announce scores in the family's never-ending game of I'm-Right-You're-Wrong. While I used to think that our determination to avoid being wrong was extreme, Schulz's book has enabled me to see that our responses to wrongness are not unusual. For that reason alone, I can say that reading BEING WRONG was not a waste of my time.Nevertheless, I believe that I am not the ""right"" audience for this book. Too much information for an old woman with a fairly narrow range of interests and an old woman already familiar with Schulz's most important points. Other readers, too, if they get as far as the book's midpoint, are likely to decide that the work was not intended for them. If it happens to land in a bookstore's self-help section, heaven help the customer service staff of any bookstore that doesn't give refunds. I can imagine certain chapters of BEING WRONG showing up in rhetoric/readers and anthologies of nonfiction prose. And I can see the title of this book on syllabi for interdisciplinary studies courses. Schulz discusses history, philosophy, psychology, logic, sociology, theology, literature, and various sciences. Even if readers ignore the forty-five pages of endnotes, the number and length of her footnotes may cause some to wonder: ""Am I reading a marketable version of the author's dissertation?"" In many ways, the work is a textbook -- a well-written text, a valuable text. Its greatest value is in its potential to influence students -- young voters -- who need to understand the dangers of absolutism and to recognize that, unlike a rose, ""a truth is not a truth is not a truth."" How different our world would be if most people did not confuse beliefs and interpretations with facts. How different our world would be if most people acknowledged their mistakes and consciously used them to develop a new attitude, a better system, a higher standard of conduct.Suppose that all that I've written about Schulz's book is wrong -- and it may be -- so what? I've only presented beliefs -- I think. Can my beliefs be wrong? I don't know. Do you know? Do you believe that you know? Will you know tomorrow? If I'm wrong, will you laugh?  "
12,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5104201-jim,5,"Think about the last time you were wrong. Can you remember it? I could, after taking some time to think about it. I thought my car had been stolen, and had reported it stolen, before I realized that I'd left it in the parking lot of a nearby Safeway and walked home with my groceries by mistake. I wonder if the police dispatchers still laugh at that one, or if the incident's been replaced in their memories by others like it that happen a dozen times a day.That's one story of my being wrong. I have others. But like most people, I feel as if I'm right about everything I currently think, even though a reasonable percentage of it is probably wrong. But I like feeling as if I'm right. I'm comfortable with it. And I admit that I've not always behaved well when someone's pointed out my mistakes.What's great about Kathryn Schulz's book is that it's made me rethink my fear of being shown I'm wrong.Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margins of Error is an exceptional work that recommends taking an optimistic view of our capacity for wrongness without ignoring the costs of our errors. Being wrong, Schulz says, feels a lot like being right. But realizing we're wrong is often the first step toward a greater empathy with our flawed neighbors and sometimes a transformed sense of ourselves; while our refusal to admit mistakes usually encourages us to be cruel, judgmental, and angry. Our ability to err, Schulz argues, is essential to our ability to change and grow intellectually and morally. It's what allows the world to surprise us and sometimes even teaches us to think more carefully. Those looking for a companion piece to The Believing Brain would do well to buy, beg, borrow, or steal a copy."
13,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/651858-george-musser,3,"A worthwhile read that gives me much to think about in my own life. Schulz's broad point is that the fear of committing an error is often worse than the error itself -- it fills us with a fear of exploration and prevents us from acknowledging, correcting, and learning from our mistakes. The risk of error is often a necessary tradeoff for creativity and growth. I think Schulz convincingly makes her case.  I vow to ease up on screwups, whether mine or others'. To err is human; to forgive, humane.But I think the book would have been more effective as a magazine-length essay that focused on the most novel case studies. It has a winding, repetitive argument, a college-paper style that gets monotonous after 15 chapters, and lots of potted history that seems to have been written from encyclopedia lookups. The book also overstates its case. It claims to advocate error per se, but what it really advocates is an acceptance that we err. It's one thing to take a risk, quite another to actively seek to do wrong -- outside the contexts of comedy, art, and pep talks, that is purely destructive. And although there's utility in seeing the mishaps of daily life on a spectrum with the great errors of history, the latter often do involve more than mere error, but outright malevolence and a pathological neglect of simple prudence. Sometimes, in other words, we *shouldn't* be tolerant of error and just laugh it off as the price of being human. Schulz offers few thoughts on how to cope with these different degrees of error."
14,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/915317-elizabeth-hunter,4,"I found Being Wrong slow going, not because I wasn't enjoying it--although I do think that the first couple of chapters are the most dense--but because I needed to stop and digest and think about how what Schulz says resonates with my own experiences. One of the things I enjoyed most about the book, was Schulz' examination and concise rendering of questions I've often pondered. She looks at why we're wrong so often, why we have trouble admitting that and go to great lengths to stay on the ""right"" side of things, and why the connection between ""wrong"" and ""bad"" is so hard to sever. She relates personal anecdotes, historical events and medical case histories in an intelligent, yet amusing tone that made it feel like a conversation with a very well-informed friend. One interesting thing--not having looked before I started, I was surprised to realize after a couple of chapters that the author is a woman. So I also spent a fair amount of time thinking about why I was wrong about that and what the cues were that gave me that impression.I think I'll be referring back to this one often. Unless I'm wrong. "
15,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10386400-ryan-holiday,3,"I should have liked this more than I did. Having sat on it a bit, I kept going back to thinking how much I like the author. The book's a bit long at times and redundant, and I don't think it's organized well, but it's the right kind of book. There's actually a saying in the The Present Alone is Our Happiness: Interviews with Pierre Hadot -- that real philosophical dialog sets out to form rather than inform. That's what this book does. Most of these psychology books try to teach you a bunch of stuff. They talk about this study and these fallacies and how you must listen to them convince you that your way of thinking about the world is wrong. Schulz, I think, would just be happy if you left with a flicker of doubt. She adds a couple new pikes that might catch and snag you before you barrel down the road of wrongness. It's a rare approach for an author, one worth rewarding"
16,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174565-red,2,I really thought I was going to like this. I guess I was...
17,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/763730-stewart,5,"	 Over many years I have grappled with the related issues of error, ignorance, and uncertainty. When measured against what there is to know, what we humans do in fact know is in the order of zero-point-several zeroes. No matter how well-read, well-traveled, or well-informed we think we are, our ignorance is immense. We have to make decisions – most trivial, many of them life-changing, a few of them life-and-death – based on a trifling amount of information, the vast majority second- or third-hand. Because the amount of information we use to make everyday decisions ranges from minute to microscopic, we often make mistakes and miscalculations. We suffer misunderstandings. Unaware of so much in the universe, we get buffeted and in some cases crushed by its forces. To err is indeed human.	Thus when I found a book on error in a recent Daedalus book catalog, I quickly ordered it. And I wasn’t disappointed. ""Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error"" by Kathryn Shulz is an amazingly insightful, humorous, and quotable book, drawing on philosophy, science, history, politics, literature, and pop culture.	That I hadn’t heard of this 2010 book or seen a review in the many newspapers and magazines I read shows the ignorance in which I am immersed, despite thinking I am a well-read individual. It seems this worthwhile book somehow got lost in the shuffle among the tens of thousands of books published every year in English.	Shulz, a newspaper and magazine journalist and author, looks at error in many of its forms – the personal, political, religious, philosophical – and our efforts to deny our mistakes and deflect blame. She examines the success in lessening error in the life-and-death areas of aviation and hospitals. She spends a lot of time on inductive reasoning, our way of making sense of the world, and its limitations. She looks at error in romantic love and the rare cases of radical shifts of belief that people have made.	There is so much that is wise and quotable in this book that I couldn’t begin to list all the passages.	Although Shulz spends many pages discussing the larger issues people can be wrong about – religion, philosophy, science, world politics – she also spends a lot of time talking about situations closer to home, including relationships. “Our default attitude toward wrongness, then – our distaste for error and our appetite for being right – tends to be rough on relationships. This applies equally to relationships among nations, communities, colleagues, friends, and (as will not be lost on most readers) relatives. Indeed, an old adage of therapists is that you can either be right or be in a relationship: you can remain attached to Team You winning every confrontation, or you can remain attached to friends and family, but good luck trying to do both.	“If insisting on our rightness tends to compromise our relationships, it also reflects poorly on our grasp of probability.” We have thousands, if not tens of thousands of beliefs, ranging from the trivial (Joe’s Pizza Place closes at 9 p.m. on Fridays) to the complex and interlocking system of religious, political, and philosophical beliefs through which we experience the world. That all of these myriad beliefs are correct and reflective of the real world is exceedingly unlikely.	Shulz opines that the world would be a better place if we admitted how commonplace error is, in general and in our specific cases. 	“As a culture, we haven’t even mastered the basic skill of saying ‘I was wrong.’ This is a startling deficiency, given the simplicity of the phrase, the ubiquity of error, and the tremendous public service that acknowledging it can provide.” "
18,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/901342-jacob,5,"Wow! I've read quite a few books about being wrong (e.g. Don't Believe Everything you Think, Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me), How We Know What Isn't So, You Are Not So Smart), now that I look at it, but this one, focusing on the *experience* of being wrong and how it feels, is my favorite so far. Part of it is that I identify closely with the author's description of what being wrong is like, and part is the author's philosophical discussion about why being wrong is human, even essential to being human, and the source of some good (it's dry, but worth the read).The book addresses different reasons people tend to be wrong about things, addressing various personal, social, and other factors that contribute to people not recognizing when they're wrong, or acknowledging it when they do. The first part takes a while to warm up to, but it eventually gets really engrossing, especially when Schulz starts using stories to illustrate her points.The author makes the point in multiple ways that error is inextricably part of being human. Not only are we inherently fallible, and many of our human mechanisms for dealing with reality inherently include seeds of error, but our capacity for error actually provides us with motivation and mechanisms for doing better (like science). She argues it's also the source of our ability to imagine what isn't real, the foundation of art and humor, and our ability to empathize with others through imagining how they feel.And she's right. It's why, among other things, when Philip K. Dick gives a speech entitled ""How To Build A Universe That Doesn't Fall Apart Two Days Later"", his point is that you *do* want to build a universe that falls apart two days later because that's what will make a story interesting (https://urbigenous.net/library/how_to...). It's conflict that makes a story worth reading, and conflict comes from error of one sort or another.I was going to give this 4.5 stars and mention I'd give it a 5 if I ever reread it and still like it, but two thirds of the way through, the author makes a brave choice that pushed it right up into 5-star territory. She includes the story of a woman who was sure she identified the man who assaulted her, only to find out conclusively, years later, that she was wrong. After his exoneration, she made her peace with the man, but then the guy went on to actually commit a violent crime later. It makes the story messy and unclear, and Schulz was going to cut it and use a different story until she realized that's exactly what we do in dealing with error -- we try to ignore the messiness of life and things that don't fit with what we want to think. Her honesty and openness in including the story despite its unresolved issues earned that fifth star.Bonus points for mentions of:- Oregon as the author's ""home away from home""- Phil Tetlock (repeatedly) and his work on the failure of experts to predict things, or even recognize their predictions are wrong- The fact that science can't prove anything, only disprove it, and that it's an approximation of reality, not reality itselfNot everything is fantastic. Most pages are a wall of text, which makes it a little tougher to get through. And while the writing is interesting and the author includes decent amounts of humor, it's not as easily engaging as some other similar writing. Schulz's style is more philosophical, so be prepared to think about what she says and take time to understand it.There's a TED talk (very) short version of Schulz's ideas if you'd like to see it: https://www.ted.com/talks/kathryn_sch..."
19,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237178-carolyn,3,"I consider myself the consummate fuckup. Even when I succeed in accomplishing something difficult, once the warmth of self-congratulatory celebration dissipates I can’t help thinking about every screw up and each way they’ll likely weigh me down during the course of my life the rest of my life and preclude me from divinity and the promises of pennies from heaven. I know a lot of people who think like this while we know that this manner of thinking is stupid and counterproductive, every time we try to mentally put our mistakes into perspective and balance them with our accomplishments, the inner asshole that we all have in our head won’t let us accept them, and gleefully drowns out rationality by reciting a grocery list of all our screw ups. How could we make all those mistakes? Being Wrong provides an absorbing counterpoint to the notion that making a mistake somehow diminishes you as a person. “Twelve hundred years before Rene’ Descartes penned his famous ‘I think, therefore I am,’ the philosopher Augustine wrote ‘fallor ergo sum.’” – I err therefore I am. We shouldn’t fear error; rather, we should embrace it because it’s our capacity for making mistakes that makes us who we are. Schulz explores the nature of error: are big mistakes fundamentally different from small mistakes, or are they all essentially the same? How much does peer pressure, or crowd response, affect our capacity to blunder? Why do we remember relatively insignificant mistakes for the rest of our lives, long after they have ceased to be relevant to anything? And why do we take being wrong so personally. As Molière said, “It infuriates me to be wrong when I know I’m right.” Shultz is a witty and dynamic writer, capable of quoting everyone from Aristotle, to Pliny the Elder, to Hamlet and Beyonce. She argues in “Being Wrong” that, of all the things we’re wrong about, our ideas about error are probably our “meta-mistake: we are wrong about what it means to be wrong.” She continues, “Far from being a sign of intellectual inferiority, the capacity to err is crucial to human cognition.” She is full of stories and anecdotes but avoids turning the book into a “wrongology slide-show”. The stories include everything from Alan Greenspan’s firm faith in the economy proved wrong, a doomsday prophet whose apocalypse wasn’t now, a sexual assault victim whose mistaken testimony jailed an innocent man and a Klansman who became an unlikely advocate for civil rights. Shultz argues that when people are confronted with their wrongness, they can either must accept it, deny it or be transformed by it. However, her book still doesn’t read like a book; more like a collection of essays on the theory of wrongness. The book is fascinating from chapter to chapter, but there isn’t a theory that encapsulates the whole book, except that we shouldn’t worry about making mistakes. At the beginning of the book, she calls the book a study of “wrongology” but never builds the systematic arguments that “¬-ology” requires. Instead we get a “wrongologue” — a series of observations and insights that leave us feeling that we’ve had all the good thoughts one could possibly have about wrongness, but that we still don’t know which ones are . . . well, right. There’s none of the necessary conclusions about being wrong, so the book is a fascinating and compelling read, but not life-changing or groundbreaking. "

One of those ""easy reads"" with regards to how it's written, the way the language flows easily, the sense of humor has me chucking more than once every chapter, and then at the same time, this is not an easy read, not at all.

The science is well-explained, the quotes and anecdotes are perfectly picked, the philosophy is thoughtful and down-to-earth, and the focus on positive sides of error is inspiring.Notes and quotes for future me:p.3 quoting Moliere: ""It infuriates me to be wrong when I know I'm right.""p.4 ""A whole lot of us go through life assuming that we are basically right, basically all the time, about basically everything: about our political and intellectual convictions, our religious and moral beliefs, our assessment of other people, our memories, our grasp of facts. As absurd as it sounds when we stop to think about it, our steady state seems to be one of unconsciously assuming that we are very close to omniscient.""p.71 ""The feeling of knowing something is incredibly convincing and inordinately satisfying, but it is not a very good way to gauge the accuracy of our knowledge. That's the problem with the feeling of knowing: it fills us with the conviction of rightness whether we're right or not."" (This leads to a discussion of scientific studies showing that the vividness of a memory has essentially no correlation to the accuracy of a memory.)p.73 ""None of us capture our memories in perfect, strobe-like detail, but almost all of us believe in them with blinding conviction. ... Even with comparatively trivial matters, we believe in our recollections with touching sincerity and defend them with astounding tenacity.""p.106 ""the Lake Wobegon Effect, that endlessly entertaining statistical debacle whereby we all think that we are above average in every respect - including, amusingly, impartiality.""p.107 ""Ignorance Assumption. Since we think our own beliefs are based on the facts, we conclude that people who disagree with us just haven't been exposed to the right information, and that such exposure would inevitably bring them over to our team. ... The Ignorance Assumption isn't always wrong; sometimes our ideological adversaries don't know the facts. But it isn't always right, either. For starters, ignorance isn't necessarily a vacuum waiting to be filled; just as often, it is a wall, actively maintained.More to the point, though, the Ignorance Assumption can be wrong because we can be wrong.""The Ignorance Assumption is followed by the Idiocy Assumption (""we concede that our opponents know the facts, but deny that they have brains to comprehend them"") and the Evil Assumption (""people who disagree with us are not ignorant of the truth, and not unable to comprehend it, but have willfully turned their backs on it.""p.141 ""The vast majority of our beliefs are really beliefs once removed.

Second, they shield us from the disagreement of outsiders. Third, they cause us to disregard whatever outside disagreement we do encounter. Finally, they quash the development of disagreement from within. These factors create a kind of societal counterpart to cognition's confirmation bias, and they provoke the same problem. Whatever the other virtues of our communities, they are dangerously effective at bolstering our conviction that we are right and shielding us from the possibility that we are wrong.""p.159 Quoting Renouvier: ""Properly speaking, there is no certainty; there are only people who are certain.""p.163 Quoting Bierce: Certainty is ""being mistaken at the top of one's voice"".p.164 ""This is one of the most defining and dangerous characteristics of certainty: it is toxic to a shift in perspective. If imagination is what enables us to conceive of and enjoy stories other than our own, and if empathy is the act of taking other people's stories seriously, certainty deadens or destroys both qualities. When we are caught up in our own convictions, other people's stories ... cease to matter to us.""p.165 Pathological certainty => confabulation. Pathological doubt => obsessive compulsionsp.167 ""It's one thing to doubt the existence of Santa Claus, another thing to doubt the accuracy of a news story, and a third thing to doubt the accuracy of a news story you yourself wrote. How adept we are at these different degrees of doubt depends on a variety of factors, including how emotionally capable we are of tolerating uncertainty ... and how much we have been exposed to and explicitly trained in skeptical inquiry. Doubt, it seems, is a skill - and one that ... needs to be learned and honed. Credulity, by contrast, appears to be something very like an instinct.""p.169 ""Certainty might be a practical, logical, and evolutionary necessity, but the simplest truth about it is that it feels good. It gives us the comforting illusion that our environment is stable and knowable, and that therefore we are safe within it. ... It makes us feel informed, intelligent, and powerful. When we are certain, we are lords of our maps: the outer limits of our knowledge and the outer limits of the world are one and the same.""p. 178 ""We can retain our convictions-and our conviction-while jettisoning the barricade of certainty that surrounds them. Our commitment to an idea, he concluded, 'is healthiest when it is not without doubt, but in spite of doubt.'""p.256 ""Psychological studies have shown that people in shared living situations generally think they do more chores than their housemates, that people in relationships tend to think they try harder than their partner to resolve conjugal issues, and that each of the colleagues collaborating on a project typically thinks he or she is pulling more weight than everyone else. Granted, sometimes there's a genuine disparity between one person's work and another's. But at least as often, the hour I spent ... is just particularly real to me, whereas whatever work you might have done remains an abstraction - at worst unnoticed and at best fleetingly appreciated, but certainly not minutely calibrated in terms of time and energy expended.""p.273 Quoting Vaillant ""It is all too common for caterpillars to become butterflies and then maintain that in their youth they had been little butterflies.""p.281 ""After all, our sense of self, like our sense of everything else in the world, is comprised of a bunch of beliefs - and, like all beliefs, these can be in error.

This is an active, investigative doubt: the kind that inspires us to wander onto shaky limbs or out into left field; the kind that doesn't divide the mind so much as multiply it, like a tree in which there are three blackbirds and the entire Bronx Zoo.

24,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77274539-sanjeev-mishra,4,"I would give this 4.5 stars but it doesn't look like that's an option. Really amazing and insightful, and honestly helped me to breathe a little easier with uncertainty and overpowering wonder of the universe. Life is more pleasant when you lighten your death grip on your little theories and beliefs. Only would take a way a half star because of some weird takes like attributing the ongoing Iraq War to being too mean to war hawks and the part near the end that goes to bat too hard for settler democracy in my opinion. It's obvious that the author and I don't align politically 100% but luckily that isn't a prerequisite for enjoying and learning from her book. "
25,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"This book focused on many of the heuristics detailed in Daniel Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow. Like David McRaney, in his book You Are Not So Smart, Schulz is a bit more relatable than Kahneman, which makes the study of heuristics (fallible thinking), easier to digest. Unlike McRaney, Schulz does a much better job of making arguments that do not fall prey to the very heuristics being argued against. She got tripped up a few times, in that her argument for one thing could just as easily have been used to argue for the opposite position. Despite her succumbing a few times to obvious heuristics, this book was considerably better quality than Raney's You Are Not So Smart. One of my favorite things about it was her unapologetic argument for the value of heuristics. At the end of the day, Schulz views the brain as a probability machine. Instead of the brain being a stupid fallible organ, Schulz sees it as brilliant and right much of the time, and accepts that a percent of the time, it will get things wrong. The wrongness arises not from the fallibility of the brain, but from its absolutely brilliant strategy of calculating the probabilities. I fear I made this part of her argument sound slightly boring. It was not. This argument in particular was the highlight of the book. I probably would have given it 5 stars if not for the last chapter. I felt slightly annoyed, like it was a bit preachy. But, I am not certain if it really was. It might have been a bad fit for me, but could be a great way to end the book for other readers. No matter how much I liked this book, no book on heuristics could be better than Tarvis' Mistakes Were Made But Not By Me. I looked up Tarvis and it appears that she might even be a self help type of writer. This is shocking to me because I loath self help books, unless they have actual studies to back up their claims and those studies have robust methods. For me, most self-help books are the new snake oil. But Tarvis' book was not simply one of the best books I have read on fallible thinking but one of the best books I have ever read period. Somehow she avoids, more so than Schulz and significantly more so than McRaney, tripping over the very fallibility she argues against. To me, that is quite impressive. So, Schulz's book was really good, but not up to par with Travis. If I were to rank books on decision making, the order would be as follows: 1. Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow (it is the seminal work and has myriad studies but a tiny bit dry at times)2. Tarvis' Mistakes Were Made But Not By Me (the writing was fantastic and every page causes the self reflective reader a mini existential crisis)3. Being Wrong by Schulz4. I feel certain there are many books I have not read that are better than the next choiceN. McRaney's You Are Not So Smart. If you are only going to read one book, make it Tarvis' Mistakes were Made. If you are willing to read more than one book (because, let's face it, your brains is super interesting and probably a bit narcissistic and would love it if you gave it multiple books to read about itself), then I highly recommend Schulz book as well. "
26,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2340346-chris-walker,4,"Great stuff. This is what writers are for. To set down in language what you feel but can't necessarily enunciate well yourself. Take this example: ""Fortunately, we don't get stuck in this place of pure wrongness very often. And we don't get stuck there via the collapse of small or medium-size beliefs. We get stuck there when we are really wrong about really big things - beliefs so important and far-reaching that we can neither easily replace them nor easily live without them. If our trivial beliefs sometimes burst as lightly as bubbles - just a pop of surprise and they're gone - these gigantic beliefs collapse like stars, leaving only us and a black hole behind. If you mortgaged your family's future on your faith in Bernie Madoff; if you hitched your whole wagon to a doctrine or a deity you no longer believe in; if you were wrong about someone you loved and the kind of life you thought the two of you would live together; if you have betrayed your own principles in any of the countless dark ways we can surprise ourselves over the course of a lifetime: if any of this or anything like this has happened to you, then you have suffered in the space of pure wrongness."" Yes, the author gets a bit irritating from time to time with her too hip style of writing, meandering tone and personal intrusion in the pages (a bit like, but much more than, Malcolm Gladwell). Yes, there are too many footnotes where she wanders off on tangents (although usually interesting ones). But if you are interested in what the philosophers, psychologists and neuroscientists have to say about error in the many facets of our lives, she's done the work for you. And there's so much good content here to ponder - some of it is revelatory like glimpsing the Matrix - I think I'll have to read it again (and I don't say that lightly, given the pile of books to read beside my bed). This is above all else a comforting book. While she argues that those who are depressed may just be seeing existential matters more clearly than the rest of us, the book concludes that: ""No matter how often we have gotten things wrong in the past, we evince an abiding and touching faith in our own stories and theories. Traditionally, we are anxious to deny that those stories and theories are stories and theories - that we must rely on our own imperfect representations to make sense of the world, and are therefore destined to err. But ...[ultimately these are also]... the hallmark of two of our highest human endeavours, art and science, and through them we can imagine new realities."" "
27,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2321668-cathy,4,"I don't know about you but I'm rarely, if ever, wrong. No, really! I'm almost always right and the same is probably true of you. As Kathryn Schulz, author of Being Wrong; Adventures in the Margin of Error, explains, it's almost hardwired in humans to dislike being mistaken. Being wrong, even about minor things, makes almost everyone so incredibly, throughly uncomfortable that we often can't admit to ourselves that we've made a mistake. Yet, being wrong is also a key to growth and essential to our identity according to Schulz. Although the book gets off to a ponderous start, once it picks up speed, it becomes a thought provoking exploration of every conceivable aspect of being wrong. What if we're wrong about our core belief system? What if, as a witness to a crime, we testify against the wrong person? What about medical mistakes? How do we live with ourselves once monumental errors are revealed?  Ultimately Schulz concludes that our optimism in the face of a lifetime of errors is what allows us to pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off and continue toward the goal despite previous mishaps and mistakes. Ultimately we're stronger for the failures along the way and readers will be better for tackling Schulz's book too."

I had to print them out and cut them up myself to believe that my eyes were lying. The brief mention of autism has not aged well and the author chose to include the racist slurs in quotes which I just felt was unnecessary since we all know what those slurs are in the context of the KKK. I would have been interested to see what this book could have been like if all the conversion stories in it didn't reinforce Americans' and specifically progressive's idea of what is right (evangelical to atheist; racist to anti-racist; Muslim to Christian). That last one I thought was problematic in its representation out of context, because it was the story of a Muslim man in Afghanistan converting to Christianity that treated it as merely a change of belief without examining the colonizing effects of Christian missionaries or the political ramifications of changing religions when the law is based on that religion.Still an excellent read and we could all do with thinking about what wrongness means to each of us."

As it turns out, there's a lot more to be said, and Ms. Schulz says it quite elegantly, entertainingly, and movingly. With examples ranging from the mundane to the tragic, she carefully explains precisely how errors come about and why we feel about them as we do. Along the way, she makes the point that error not only has the capability to embarrass us, but also can have the power to teach, to expand minds and hearts, to make better people.She didn't quote Samuel Beckett, but I will: we can ""fail better.""I throughly enjoyed this read, was fascinated by her anecdotes and theories and delighted by her style.

34,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72842365-ryan-derby-talbot,5,"Book summary: There are two fundamental and unavoidable components to being a human being: one is the need to chase the feeling of being right –– of having solidity and comfort in how we experience and respond to the world. The other is dealing with being wrong: dealing with error, the inevitable (and sometimes devastating) encounters we have when our expectations end up not aligning with reality. This book is about how we cannot escape either of these forces, and what results — negative or positive –– we can get from attempting to navigate this tension.Our need to chase being right –– and the resulting confidence, empowerment and belongingness (proxies for love?) that come with the feeling of rightness –– run up against and try to discount and rule out all the ways we inevitably can get things wrong: through illusions, false or overstated beliefs, skewed understandings of data, biases, social influences that lead us astray, emotional investments in perspectives or communities, the need to feel love, and flat out denial. We have difficulty even seeing wrongness in action in us (thinking we are far more objective and omniscient than we are), partly because it is such a fleeting force –– striking either too quickly or too slowly for us to catch it. Moreover, we struggle with identifying and acknowledging wrongness because of the strong emotional and cognitive forces (the desire for the feeling of certainty, the biases) that protect us, and keep us overwhelmingly invested in particular perspectives at the expense of other perspectives more aligned with reality. However much we may want to insist on the contrary or wish away our propensity to get things wrong (and we do this routinely), if we actually look at it, we invariably, deeply, absurdly, and inevitably get things wrong. Actually facing this truth doesn’t need to doom us, however, to defeated nihilism. The gap between our perspectives and the world make possible our two distinctly powerful human abilities: imagination and empathy. (Both are the result of allowing more than one perspective in a situation, of permitting a bigger notion than just a single “rightness.”) Successful incorporation and integration of our own wrongness –– which requires going through the excruciating emotional pain of admitting and allowing wrongness –– expands our sensitivities and perspectives as human beings. Collectively, our relationship with the gap also makes possible the two best products of human work, art and science. At root, error –– encountering the gap –– contributes to diversity, wonder, and richness of human experience. Alas, however, it will not ever lead us to a refuge of solid objectivity. Alas, there is no magic formula for dealing with the tensions between our desired rightness and inevitable wrongness. We can, however, recognize the growth and wondrous (mystical?) perspectives that are available in confronting their clash within us, the fundamental and inevitable experience of being a human being.

35,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45191284-beth,4,"Kathryn Schulz delves into all the ways we can be wrong, explaining the strange whys and hows or error generation, denial, and results. The fact that the fabric of humanity is interwoven with error and inseparable from the state of being human is something abput which most of us live in denial. Schulz uncovers some of the universal characteristics of being wrong in a way that is more palatable than some of the ways society reminds us we are wrong. We are wired to resist the notion of our own fallibility, so this deft touch is necessary in order to circumvent our natural resistance. At the same time, she highlights the benefits of acknowledging and embracing our error in order to better our communities, our interpersonal relationships, and ourselves. For example:""This is one of the most powerful ways being wrong can transform us. It can help us be more compassionate people. Being right might be fun, but as we've seen, it has a tendency to bring out the worst in us. By contrast, being wrong might is often the furthest thing in the world from fun, and yet, in the end, it has the potential to bring out the best in us. Or, rather, to change us for the better.""This book now is added to 2 others - Tim Nochols' The Death of Expertise and Han Roslings's Factfulness- that I would recommend to any of my acquaintances who are trying to grapple with the perceived and real societal grievances battering for their attention. Schulz can get a little long-winded in places, but this is a deep topic and I found that if I hung with her she eventually led me to her point.One of my favorite passages is what I hope people gain from reading this book:""If you really want to be right, or at least improve the odds of being right, you have to start by acknowledging your fallibility. Deliberately seeking out your mistakes. And figuring out what caused you to make them."""

She explores with wit, charm, and tenacity the ways we go wrong in our thinking and, what's more, the ways we go wrong in our thinking about going wrong. My greatest surprise and pleasure was the deep emotional intelligence present in a book I had expected to be skewed heavily to the cerebral. I highly recommend to anyone who cares about better thinking. "

In all, Schulz does an admirable job of selecting her chosen anecdotes and ends up with a satisfying and thought-provoking read.NotesPerhaps the history of the errors of mankind, all things considered, is more valuable and interesting than that of their discoveries. Truth is uniform and narrow; it constantly exists, and does not seem to require so much an active energy, as a passive aptitude of the soul in order to encounter it. But error is endlessly diversified; it has no reality, but is the pure and simple creation of the mind that invents it. In this field the soul has room enough to expand herself, to display all her boundless faculties, and all her beautiful and interesting extravagancies and absurdities.—Benjamin Franklin______Many of the religious thinkers who tried to understand why we err found their answer at the gates of the Garden of Eden. Thus Thomas Aquinas, the thirteenth-century scholastic, held that we make mistakes because, when we were banished from paradise, we were cut off forever from direct access to divine truth. To Aquinas and many of his fellow theologians, our errors arise from the gap between our own limited and blemished minds and God’s unlimited and perfect omniscience.This same basic idea has received countless secular treatments as well. Plato thought that our primordial soul was at one with the universe, and that we only began to err when we took on our current physical form and forgot those cosmic truths. The Enlightenment philosopher John Locke thought that error seeped into our lives from the gap between the artificiality of words and the reality of the things they name—from the distance between an indescribable essence and the nearest sayable thing. The German philosopher Martin Heidegger thought that error could be explained by the fact that we live in time and space; because we are bound to a particular set of coordinates, we can’t rise above them and see reality as a whole, from a bird’s-eye (or God’s-eye) view. As different as these explanations seem, all these thinkers and many more conceived of error as arising from a gap: sometimes between the particular and the general, sometimes between words and things, sometimes between the present and the primeval, sometimes between the mortal and the divine—but in every case, and fundamentally, between our own mind and the rest of the world.For the most part, we spend our lives blithely ignoring this gap. And with good reason. Who wants to be reminded of the fall from grace, the separation from truth, the particular and limited nature of our existence? ______How can we square this feeling of rightness with the very real possibility that we are wrong? This is a question that haunts all of wrongology, not just errors of memory. The problem is suggested by the very phrase “the feeling of knowing.” In life, as in language, we begin with a psychological state (the “feeling” part) and end up with a claim about the truth (the “knowing” part). In other words, we feel that we are right because we feel that we are right: we take our own certainty as an indicator of accuracy. This isn’t completely foolish of us, since studies show that there is some correlation between confidence and correctness. But it isn’t completely foolproof, either. As the case of flashbulb memories makes clear, our certainty reflects the existence of a particularly vivid inner picture. But nothing in life guarantees that this picture reflects the real state of affairs.This reliance on a vivid inner picture helps explain why memories are particularly apt to trigger the feeling of knowing.______ The philosopher Avishai Marga lit put this nicely. ""It is not the case that I am caught in a web of beliefs,"" he wrote. "" . . . Rather, I am caught in a network of witnesses."" Our relationships to these ""witnesses""-the people and institutions that attest to the truth of various beliefs-predate and determine our reaction to whatever information they supply. As Margalit said, ""my belief in [one of these witnesses] is prior to my belief that (what she says is true)."" Belief in is prior: however far this might be from our sense of how we should form our ideas about the world, it is the first principle of how we actually do so. All of us are caught in Margalit's ""networks of witnesses""­ not just in one but in many, and not just from time to time but all the time, from the moment we are born until the day we die. As countless commen­tators have observed, this lends to our beliefs an element of the arbitrary. Montaigne, for instance, remarked that people ""are swept [into a belief]­ either by the custom of their country or by their parental upbringing, or by chance-as by a tempest, without judgment or choice, indeed most often before the age of discretion.""______These latter­ day zealots have hailed from many different backgrounds and held many different beliefs. At heart, though, and paradoxically, they have all shared a single conviction: that they and they alone are in possession of the truth. (The very word ""zealot"" comes from a Greek root meaning to be jealous of the truth-to guard it as your own.) What zealots have in common, then, is the absolute conviction that they are right. In fact, of all the symbolic ones and zeros that extremists use to write their ideological binary codes­ us/them, same/different, good/evil-the fundamental one is right/wrong. Zealotry demands a complete rejection of the possibility of error. The conviction that we cannot possibly be wrong: this is certainty.______[O]ur be­liefs come in bundles. That makes it hard to remove or replace one without affecting the others-and it gets harder as the belief in question gets more central. In this respect, beliefs are like the beams in a building or the words in a sentence: you can't eliminate one and expect the fundamental sound­ ness or fundamental meaning of the overall system to remain unchanged. As a result, being wrong sometimes triggers a cascade of transformations so extensive that the belief system that emerges afterward bears almost no resemblance to its predecessor. ______You fight your superficiality, your shallowness, so as to try to come at people without unreal expectations, without an overload of bias or hope or arrogance, as untanklike as you can be . . . and yet you never fail to get them wrong. You might as well have the brain of a tank. You get them wrong before you meet them: you get them wrong while you're with them and then you get home to tell somebody else about the meeting and you get them all wrong again. Since the same generally goes for them with you, the whole thing is really a dazzling illusion empty of all perception, an astonishing farce of misperception. And yet what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people, which gets bled of the significance we think it has and takes on a significance that is ludicrous, so ill equipped are we all to envision one another's interior workings and invisible aims? . . . The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway. It's getting them wrong that is living, getting them wrong and wrong and wrong and then, on careful reconsideration, getting them wrong again . That's how we know we are alive: we're wrong. —Phillip Roth, American Pastoral______We go to our jobs, stop by the bar on our way home, hang out with our friends, raise our kids­ because these things are the stuff of life, to be sure, but also because they are strategies for keeping the terror of isolation in check. Soren Kierkeg­aard, that existentialist before there was existentialism, compared us in this respect to those early American pioneers who banged on their pots and pans all night long, hoping to keep the wolves at bay. Keeping wolves at bay is a start. But of all our ways of dealing with this rift, our favorite by far is the one that promises to eliminate it entirely­ to transform our desert island into a tropical paradise, our fundamental separation into ecstatic union. This strategy is our last, best hope for escap­ing the loneliness of existence and giving despair the slip. I am talking, of course, about love.______The idea that we possess a true self serves a hugely important psycho­ logical purpose. If we have an essential and unchanging identity, one we are destined to discover sooner or later, then the beliefs we hold, the choices we make, the person we become-none of this happens by chance. Instead, the entire course of our lives is inevitable, dictated by the certainty that our real self will eventually surface...This narrative is appealing for the same reason that it is problematic: within it, we can do no wrong. Our false beliefs were foreordained, our ap­parent errors occurred strictly in the service of a larger truth. This idea is made explicit in the religious affirmation that ""God makes no mistakes"": even the seeming trials and blunders of our lives are part of a larger plan: As that implies, stories starring a true self are teleological; we end up exactly where we are meant to be. This, too, is both an attraction and a weakness of the idea of an essential self. It suggests that our lives are deterministic, that yesterday's convictions-which we thought we chose based on their intellectual, emotional, or spiritual merits-were merely a trap into which we were lured for the benefit of some predetermined future self. Whatever meaning or worth our past might have had on its own terms is effectively written out of existence. Even more problematically, the idea of a true self suggests that we will never undergo momentous upheaval again. How could we? Having finally discovered who we really are and have always been, there is no further transformation available to us. If the self is constantly changing, then we can constantly feel our way forward, constantly become someone new-but if each of us possesses a fixed essence, then we can only return to it. Accord­ingly, our past departure from that essential self can only be a single and inexplicable aberration, associated as often as not with betrayal, transgres­sion, and sin. (Recall Chambers denouncing Communism, his erstwhile faith, as ""evil, absolute evil."") Singular, aberrational, transgressive, evil: we've seen this constellation of ideas before. This is the pessimistic model of wrongness, in which error is an unwelcome anomaly, a mark of our exile from the sacred realm of truth. Helpfully, this reminds us that we have another model for making sense of wrongness as well-one that casts a different light not only on our errors but also on ourselves. Here, wrongness is a natural and ongoing process, and we are not deformed but transformed by it. ______""The main in­terest in life and work,"" said Foucault, ""is to become someone else that you were not in the beginning."" Such transformations don't only come about through wrongness, of course-but wrongness is always an opportunity for such transformations. ______I was of three minds, Like a tree In which there are three blackbirds. —Wallace Stevens, 13 Ways of Looking at a Blackbird______His desire to banish art is part of a long and often sinister tradition (which we glimpsed earlier) of trying to create ideal societies through eradicating error in all its forms. All of those disgruntled undergraduates, meanwhile, are motivated in part-whether they know it or not-by the optimistic model of wrongness. They recognize, as most of us do, not just the legitimacy but also the poten­tial beauty and power of individual, skewed, inaccurate representations of reality. In this model, the link between error and art i s not a n indictment of art but a defense of error. Cut off from the absolute essence of things-that ideal form that Plato felt existed only in the mind of God-our separate, subjective consciousnesses look around and see, instead, Water Lilies, or Starry Night, or Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Likewise, we can make Beowulf and Star Wars and Horton Hears a Who! for the same reason we can make mistakes: because, as I said earlier, we are capable of conjuring the world not just as it is, but also as it is not. Our capacity to err is inseparable from our imagination.______The most famous formulation of this relationship between art, doubt, and error comes from the Romantic poet John Keats. He had been talking over various matters with a friend, he wrote to his brothers in a letter in 1 817, ""and at once it struck me,"" what quality went to form a Man of Achievement especially in lit­erature & which Shakespeare possessed so enormously-! mean Negative Capability, that is when man is capable of being in un­certainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact & reason.Keats's attitude toward uncertainty-and, for that matter, toward ""fact & reason""-is not the common one. He embraced unknowability and falli­bility, but not for the utilitarian purposes we saw in the last chapter. There, the point of embracing error was to curtail it-a kind of homeopathic rem­ edy for wrongness. But Keats wasn't interested in remedying wrongness. He recognized error and art as conjoined twins, born of the same place and vital to one another's existence. In life as in linguistics, art is joined at the root to artificial-to the not-true, the unreal-just as a fiction is at once a creation and a falsehood. ______But unlike androids, we humans do not nor­ mally self-destruct in the face of our mistakes. On the contrary: we self­ create, and self-recreate. This idea of self-creation suggests something else important about error. Being wrong doesn't just make us human in general; it also helps make each of us the specific person we are. In our inability to get things exactly right, in the idiosyncrasies of our private visions of the world, the outline of selfhood appears. This is what Benjamin Franklin was getting at in the quote I used as an epigraph to this book. Error, he wrote, is ""the pure and simple creation of the mind that invents it,"" a place where ""the soul has room enough to expand herself."" Mistakes, he ·meant, are the evidence and expression of an individual identity. This is an idea with deep and important roots in our intellectual history. It is, in essence, the crucial insight of evolutionary theory. Because of errors in the replication of genetic sequences, we wind up with variation among individual members of a species; and because of that variation, the species as a whole can adapt and survive. Such errors literally keep their hosts alive. A population that is too small or too homogenous to support significant genetic variation is doomed. For every species, then, error is a mechanism of survival and change. For us human organisms, with our richer relation­ ship to wrongness, mistakes enable not only our biological evolution but our social, emotional, and intellectual evolution as well. And wrongness also allows us to thrive in another way. I began this book by noting that we think of being right as essential to our survival and happiness, but in one key respect, nothing could be further from the truth. Countless studies have shown that people who suffer from depression have more accurate worldviews than nondepressed people. Depressed people do not nurture the cheering illusion that they can control the course of their lives. They rarely possess the conviction, so common in the rest of us, that they are above average in virtually every respect. And they understand, all too acutely, the basic conditions of existence: that their lifespan is just a brief blip in the cold sweep of history, that suffering is real and ongoing, that they and all the people they love are going to die. That outlook is known as depressive realism. Depressed people might be unhappy, but­ when it comes to these big-picture, existential matters-they are generally more right than the rest of us. It scarcely requires saying that this kind of rightness is not fun. ""To see the world as it really is is devastating and terrifying,"" wrote the philosopher Ernest Becker. "" . . . It makes thoughtless living in the world of men an im­possibility. It places a trembling animal at the mercy of the entire cosmos and the problem of the meaning of it."" As that indicates, the correlation between accuracy and depression runs both ways: people who are depressed tend to perceive the harsher realities of life more clearly, and people who clearly perceive those harsh realities tend to be (or to get) depressed. In an odd reversal of the usual state of affairs, when it comes to these existential issues, the bigger and more important the belief, the less it pays to be right. That's why, as I've said, the goal of therapy isn't necessarily to make our beliefs more accurate; it is to make them more functional. Ronnie Janoff­ Bulman, the psychologist, has even argued that ""a key to the good life might well be illusions at our deepest, most generalized level of assump­ tions and accuracy at the most specific, least abstract levels."" (Fortunately for us, these two perspectives are compatible: research suggests that people who possess a generally positive outlook are better at acknowledging their everyday errors and changing their minds.) If excessive accuracy in our self-image and worldview is correlated with depression, the opposite is true, too. Sometimes, being wrong makes us happy. Think of Don Quixote, that exemplary knight errant, who lent his name to the condition of being pleasantly deluded. "

It very much is, but just saying that is a bit of a cop-out. The book is a brilliantly written examination of the concept of error from every perspective imaginable. Schulz explores wrongness as an outside observer, a philosopher, a victim and a compassionate friend. By so fully embracing the idea on every level, she synthesizes a unified thesis from many disparate parts and supports every conclusion she draws with the best in logic and anecdote.At the core of Being Wrong is a suggestion. Not advice, so much as a recommendation for people interested in living a little better. Embrace your mistakes. It’s not about making mistakes and not feeling bad about it. Schulz wants us all to live with our errors a little more and not shove them away in a flurry of denial and justification. She goes on to examine the reasons why we are so adverse to being wrong, from the biological, (it doesn’t make evolutionary sense to be uncertain about anything) to the social, (our culture rejects leader figures who are indecisive) to the psychological. (depressed people have much more accurate worldviews than balanced personalties)Schulz is at her strongest when she is telling a story. The highlights of the books are the anecdotes she uses to set up each of her chapters. The stories include everything from Alan Greenspan’s unwavering faith in the economy proved wrong, to the touching story of an Exalted Cyclops of the KKK becoming one of the frontline fighters in the war for desegregated schools. Schulz has a deft hand for splicing these stories with the philosophical and scientific meat that connect them back to the reader’s everyday experience. She does tend to get bogged down in some of the dense history of the topic, but the frequent footnotes and witty asides help to break these thick sections up a little.The text itself induces stumbling, at least for me. It’s probably because the subject matter makes me paranoid that I’ve missed something, or misinterpreted a critical conclusion. To that end, I’d really recommend reading this book in chapters, rather than tackling the entire thing all at once. The writing lends it self to easy sectioning and while reading order is important, the ideas are all pretty sticky, which makes it easier to spread over time.Close to the end of the third section, Schulz examines the story of Penny Beerntsen, a woman who was raped and ended up falsely accusing another man of the crime. He was eventually proved innocent, but in the interim the woman had struggled to get closure in other ways. She wanted to understand the reasons people did horrible things to each other. To do this, she volunteered in prisons and really got to know the realities of being a convicted criminal in the United States. When the verdict came down proving that she had identified the wrong man, she was horrified, but she instantly accepted her mistake and wanted to somehow make up for it. Rather than try to deny her fault, she only sought to improve the life of the man she had thrown into prison unjustly.While this is an extreme example, I can’t think of a better example of being a truly human person. It would be an exaggeration to say I want be like Penny, but her example is one that I can value as someone who can be wrong and can be stupid about it. And really, we all fall into that category sometimes. Anyone who has ever been a critic of any kind knows the giddy thrill of being unquestionably right. (you cannot successfully argue against opinion) It is never a bad thing to gain a little perspective on that feeling, and that’s just what this book has allowed me to do."

It is a neglected and deeply human attribute: being wrong, feeling wrong, discovering one's wrongness, changing as a result—or, more usually, denying it, ducking and running from the acknowledgement of error. I was fascinated, particularly so once I got through the first chapters. The writing is a curious mix of academic rigour and convivial, almost conversational, English. I found the book deeply engrossing, and it gave me perspective about my own error-filled journey. I finished the book a few days ago, and I am still turning it over in my mind. Highly recommend."
45,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2011274-brian,5,"Have you ever been wrong? Of course you have. Everybody makes mistakes and many people talk like that is all they do, ""Oh I am always messing up"" they might say. Now try reflecting on the moment when you realized that you were wrong about something. Don't reflect on your past beliefs, whether trivial or not, but rather think of that moment where you shifted from knowing that you were right to knowing that you were not. How did that moment feel when you realized that you were wrong, not when you were actually wrong but when you realized you were wrong?There isn't an external force that can inform us of the correctness or incorrectness of our beliefs a priori and therefore prevent us from making minor or grave mistakes. We have to force ourselves to reckon our beliefs with the external world and when we find our beliefs at odds with the world, it hurts. When we are wrong we feel alone, the moment we recognize our errors is "". . . a moment of alienation, both from ourselves and from [our] previously convincing vision of the world.""This profound and well grounded skepticism about things that feel so right and natural to us is deeply troubling to me. Schulz's prose is very good and is a joy to read and quote* but I have to admit that reflecting on our tendency to err, often in disastrous ways, is unsettling. I think it is disturbing because it goes against our nature not only to know but also to be known. In the current american culture the sexual attraction to others is pretty overt and therefore almost ever present in our minds. But I think we forget about the attractions we have to others than have nothing to do with sex or physical appearances at all. A meeting of the minds is a truly rewarding experience wherein our views of the world are validated and shared. We are in agreement with others about being correct and that is deeply satisfying. Again, Schulz says it a bit better:“Think about how distressing it is to feel misunderstood, and how frustrating it is when someone believes something about you—that you’re irresponsible or can’t handle commitment or don’t pull your weight at work—that you think is untrue. Conversely, there are few things more gratifying than the feeling that someone deeply understands us. In fact, as we are about to see, this feeling of being of being “gotten” is the sine qua non of our most important relationships, and the very hallmark of being in love.”[4]Full review here:http://wp.me/p6r7eE-2P"
46,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8744761-william,5,"This is an impressive and surprisingly enjoyable book. While Schulz is a journalist, the work seems closer to scholarly than journalistic, though it has a lighter touch than scholarship typically achieves. In reading it, don't skip the foot- and endnotes. There is often good stuff there.I experienced ""Being Wrong"" on three levels, and it works exceptionally well on two of them. To begin with, Schulz makes a compelling case that being wrong is by and large more a constructive thing than a negative one. Emotion, creativity and humor, she points out, draw heavily on error to be compelling. While it is explicitly not her intention, there is a self-help aspect to the book which works well. It was impossible for me to read it and not say to myself: ""Hey, lighten up. You don;t have to get everything right the first -- or second, or third -- time.The second level on which i found the book effective is just as good reading. Schultz writes well and with impressive wit. This book would be a good read if you even skipped the message and just read the stories which appear so frequently. My guess is I remember some of the stories better -- and will do so longer -- than the main purpose of the book.Where I find the book a little less satisfying is in the central argument. It's meticulous, sometimes to the point of tediousness. Who knew there was so much to write on this subject? And there are occasional generalizations with which I disagree. (1) We all disdain undecided voters. (177) Huh? (2) ""We almost never find ourselves between theories"" (186). Maybe it's just me, but there are frequently issues on which I have not made up my mind. (3) [quoting LaRochefoucauld] ""Everyone complains about their memory; no one complains about their judgment."" It seems to me all of us have had long talks with friends upset because they keep making the same mistake over and over, and we can often feel that way about ourselves as well.But regardless of my discomfort with some of the logic and a case which seems occasionally overstated, I found the book personally useful, certainly interesting and most of all both educational and entertaining."

That is not what this book is about. It does not try to approve or disapprove of making mistakes during an intentional brain dump (or storm). It does not try to repackage any established wisdom heard at a marketing conference. This book should not be pigeon-holded as ""self-help"" or ""business"" even though it may, by chance, give you the perceptual tools to somehow fix a decision you recently made, or are about to make, or help you stop hating your niece for joining that cult back in the 90s.It DOES research the history of why we feel, or believe, and why the final decision we make is believed to be true. Because this topic is covered from its most simple origin of sensing and belief you may have to read a few chapters before you get to one that changes the way you perceive the world. However you will enjoy the historical, personal and scientific references that are threaded throughout. Its funny and well written while it is smart, clever and funny. Bill Clinton reviewed it for f#ck sake, so you know its got to be pretty good. Albeit he probably spends most of every day trying to figure out why he did most of what he did in the 80s and 90s.Still not convinced? Well, the author did a TED talk that you may enjoy.

I'm not even sure why that is because I have just been nothing but fascinated, especially so at all the research this book must have required to write. The amount of work in putting the book together is not lost on me. My guess would be that this is one of those books that a college professor would assign to his class. I read it through once, and then reread each chapter once more if not twice for some. I have never taken any college courses but IO have self educated to a certain (non) degree. There is no doubt that I have really enjoyed this book, for I have penciled in some notes and highlighted sections, something I try to avoid doing usually. I am pretty impressed with the entire book, references and the authors personal references. All of which has really made for an interesting study of Being Wrong. I'm very pleased to add that this is one more of the books I've read that I will being easily entertained by and probably get more out of each time I go through it in the future."
49,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5881280-steve-penner,4,"""Being Wrong"" was a wonderful and fascinating plunge into the world of wrongology. It covers a wide-ranging host of topics on error, how it happens and particularly how we respond to being wrong. Her basic premise is that there are two models of error. One model propounds error as something to be avoided at all costs as it provides no benefits, only embarrassment and shame. The second, which Schulz celebrates, is that error is common and natural. It's benefit is that we can learn, grow and change as a result. It's a very positive spin on a topic that has been dealt with by Plato and other classic writers, Augustine and Aquinas, Enlightenment thinkers, Freud and many other comtemporary writers. Schulz is a wonderful story teller and her stories are the highlight of the book. She can be slightly irritating as a writer when she continually states that the topic ""is something I'll deal with later."" This ""pre-figuring"" happens at least 20 times and becomes wearisome. Hopefully a future editor will do a better job of tightening up this habit. Overall and beyond my pettiness, I heartily recommend this as a wonderful, leisurely read in which you will certainly learn something about history, literature and yourself."

It kinda took me 2 hours to finish 30 pages or so.. *english is my 2nd language here*.. The book starts so well into its core concept and it keeps going so thoroughly discussing the ideas and concepts. sometimes it goes all the way to the core of philosophy and logic and all these mind twisting concepts of error and wrong and emotion and perception..At other chapters you feel like the introduction of the chapter never ends and takes so so long it kinda makes you lost and bored into it.. at others, it's like you're in a river of fluid stream of ideas so connected you don't feel yourself in its beauty.. but if there's one thing to notice, it's gonna be the effort the author put in compiling all the MASSIVE information of the different perspectives and sources and fields of knowledge it's admirable..I love this book, it's one of those books you feel sad you finished, and you feel like you've changed your perspective about so many things in life after reading..

Schulz breaks down rather complex philosophical and psychological issues to easily understood concepts with direct practical application. Further, she does this without removing the terminology, making it easy for people to continue studying long after they've finished this book. This is not a work of post-modern woowoo, where being wrong means no truth can ever be determined. Instead this is a nuanced understanding of our human lives, filled as they are with probabilistic knowledge rather than absolutist dogma, and where we can trust our minds to do what they do, create stories, not form perfect encyclopedic recall. Doing so allows Schulz to make a truly delightful and helpful contribution to our existence: that being wrong is not something to attack like some horrid beast but an inevitable aspect of our lives to embrace and seek always to see how our mental tendencies to error can be mitigated through understanding.

I've found it really hard to focus on this book, due to the fact that I don't know all of the terms she mentions. Unfortunately it seems to happen so frequently, that i'd have to have a dictionary next to me through the entire book.

A compelling aspect of Being Wrong is a set of arguments for the value of making errors or being wrong. An obsession with eliminating all errors may result in worse outcomes. For example, by taking risks and making some errors, you can learn much more than by sticking with safe decisions.One of the most interesting chapters covered areas of wrongness and criminology, starting off with the story of Steven Avery's 18-year sentence for a crime he didn't commit. That was followed by a note that he was later convicted of a murder, the only setback to date of the Wisconsin Innocence Project. Just two days after I read that chapter, I read an article about the Netflix documentary Making a Murderer that suggests that Avery might also be innocent of that crime, framed once again by the same bad cops."

55,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11297501-anna,5,"Kathryn Schulz argues passionately for the value of error. She shows us that not only is 'being wrong' a given in life, it is also a gift that has the power to transform our worldviews, our relationships, and ourselves. By drawing on philosophy, neuroscience, psycholoanalysts and a bit of common sense, she charts out the intellectual history of the shifting definitions and attitudes ascribed to being wrong and masterfully combines it with relevant & relatable examples from the present day. Schulz is a terrific thinker & and she writes with an elegant clarity and simplicity that make it nearly impossible to believe this is her first book (it seems as though she has done this before). Definitely one of the best things I have read in years. I am kind of in love with her now. Check out her Ted talks. "
56,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826906-laura,4,"I saw the author speak (very entertainingly) at an education conference, which was appropriate since - as she argues persuasively - being wrong is an inextricable part of learning and imagination. Yet in education we can often inadvertently send a message that error is something to fear and avoid. This is an entertaining book which would have been enhanced by some cross-cultural examination - e.g. how is error conceived of in cultures with a very different sense of self? Nevertheless, it's a rare book that really is relevant to everyone - but since we've all been wrong, are currently wrong (though we don't yet know how) and will be wrong at some point in the future, we can all find something to learn and relate to here."

It seems that much of the firepower is arraigned towards the writing style, especially the mix of academic language with the more colloquial. I admit I'm a sucker for that mix, so I've enjoyed her style mostly. Also, David seemed to say that the problem was that it got bogged down in semantics and word games, but I actually thought there was more emphasis on neuro-biology with anecdotes thrown in. She wasn't always the most illuminating--do I really need to hear about the old woman/young woman picture one more time?--but I think it helps flesh out the constellation of issues around our own images of ourselves and our rightness. At least, it makes my staff meeting make a whole lot more sense."

Still an interesting topic and discussion, although I think I agree with an earlier reviewer that the section on Love was not really related to the rest of the book and not really apropos to the topic. I found the idea of pessimistic versus optimistic views of wrongness intriguing. The author did inject some mild humor throughout the book that made the book more fun to read without being over the top or distracting.

59,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3761228-adman,4,"Insightful, therapeutic, and hopeful, this book belies its title inasmuch as it surveys error not so much as frontier but heartland, nay, even as a sort of self-sown weed of fate that springs out of any coordinates in any plot of land where we happen to plant our flag of sureness. Schulz crosses all sorts of habitual borders within which we assume we have found safety from error (or accidents, or sin) and shows that we badly overestimate such security (victory, righteousness). She does so with compassion and zeal, and this time stays quite true to her title. It really is an adventure to her to knock down the ego's badly-constructed refuges and blaze a new trail for how we think and act. It is not a sadistic or despairing adventure, though: Schulz believes this eyes-open journey can be better for her and for all of us than how we usually get along in life.Schulz covers a lot of territory. Material and mental subjects are treated in this book, from, say, stepping on a rake to the meta-mistake of rationalizing the mishap (intentional, unavoidable, someone else's fault, or really anything else other than our own error). Schulz hikes around between memory and science, moves from the mundane to the dramatic, sits down to chat with romance, politics, and religion. She does all this with a diplomacy that surprised and gladdened me. Taking a page from her own reflections, I wonder how much her topical environment guided her and her editors to observe even-handedly and deliver cautious judgments. I wish other authors would take note. Any of us, really, who is less blatantly kept in line by whatever happens to be the topic at hand might benefit from Schulz's choice. Far too much intellectual and practical territory, in print or in person, is overrun far too often by refusing to be open and hospitable about error -- in ourselves or others.The trail in this book does not lead to a new shelter where we can rest again from the hard work of living. Instead, how we make and walk our path seems to be Schulz's source of inspiration. How much better off might we be if we acknowledge and respect our seemingly inexhaustible capacity for error? What if we did not retreat in either denial or despair? What if we ventured from time to time out of the refuge of the self into the crowd or, the reverse, from the masses into the self? What if we diverted some of our energy from purging and purifying and celebrated and cultivated the capacity of some institutions -- art, religion, certain forms of government -- to introduce us to our limitations?I was struck by how relationship-oriented this book is. I suppose Schulz might respond, how could it not be? First of all and obviously, the book is not part of me -- not in my traditional sense of self. As with any book, I am contending with a thing outside of me. The book is not Ms. Schulz either, but rather a shadow-her that emerged as she researched and wrote, a page-bound self she may have hoped would reflect her living self. This shadow then introduced me, the reader, to other various, astute shadow-thinkers, -scientists, -theologians, and -philosophers. They all shared with me their experiences of a gap between the self and the world and also shared their ill-begotten efforts to remedy that gap. What a wilderness of joining and separating this is to be lost in! So many glances and so many voices have been cast over so many stone walls that stretch and tangle across an endless, fog-shrouded pasture of human experience.Or, if you prefer Ms. Schulz's own, less striving metaphor, life is like a game of telephone, and we often can't make up our minds how to feel -- or what to do -- about the inevitable degeneration of the initial message (though of course no one alive can lay claim to that first message) and our powerlessness to steer that degeneration.Schulz really gets to the bottom of things when she observes that we are in search of wholeness more than we are in search of rightness. Like small children, we want unity between whatever we understand to be the self and the not-self. Error -- accident, sin, the comical-or-frustrating evolution of the message in telephone, defeat at the hands of one's pen, keyboard, numb fingers or mute tongue to put one's spirit in touch with one's blind and deaf neighbors -- represents our failure (or, as we often like to pretend, the failure of others) to be one.Fortunately, around this point in the book, Schulz made an unexpected digression to identify art with error. I have often been driven to desperation and something in the neighborhood of madness by my inability to write poems or stories that express what I wish to convey in details or intensity. What a welcome, unexpected relief it was to read John Keats (among others) describing imperfection as the necessary and desired product of artistic endeavor. Why? I don't recall the line of reasoning she establishes but in the moment that I am writing this, I take it to mean that artistic error is evidence -- of the self, one's hopes, one's intentions, one's peculiar, unrepeatable humanness. It is evidence precisely in its failure to convey exactly what I want it to -- evidence of difference, disunity, and striving toward something else.Schulz ultimately praises error -- with a bit of hedging and a bashful allusion to the Judeochristian story of the Fall. She is not quite comfortable with blatantly saying bad is good. She simply wishes to offer hope that error is not the harbinger of doom we take it -- and often make it -- to be. Instead, it is a circumstance, a lesson, a challenge, an invitation."

Not a self-help book nor an oversimplified psychological model, but a thoughtful and complex overview of what it means to be wrong, how we discern what is true or false, why we are put off by error, how errors and being wrong are intrinsically part of our specialness as humans, why people so seldom change their important beliefs, and so on. "
63,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107962-scott-gilman,4,"The mind-changing realization I took from reading Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error by Kathryn Schulz is how much time, effort and energy we, both as individuals and communally, expend on either not being wrong, convincing ourselves we aren’t wrong or avoiding ways to be wrong. We live in a near-constant fear and anxiety of error, of wanting to get it right and convincing ourselves we can do so. In the process, not only do we delude ourselves, but we potentially set ourselves up not just for more errors in the future, but the toxic feelings of shame, low self-confidence, embarrassment and frustration that come with being wrong.It’s a cliche to state that as humans, we make mistakes. We acknowledge it, recognize it and even are sometimes OK with it. We certainly use that reality as a justification and even a salve when we do err.Still, what Schulz’s book illuminates in ways I’d not thought of before is the level of fear we have of being wrong. From the language we use to describe errors and mistakes (I was in the dark, but now can see; I’m mortified by doing that; I don’t know how I could have done that, etc) to the way perceive our past mistakes and the mistakes of others, we often navigate the world in ways to keep us on the right side of being right.Even though we know we have just as likely a chance of being wrong (about our work, about the nature of God, about how to cook dinner, about what our lover is thinking) we operate on a daily basis that we are right.One of the points Schulz makes is that we are rarely ever experience being wrong in the moment. The transition from believing we are right to realization that we were or are wrong is fast one. We quickly move on and put the state of being wrong into the past tense.This is because the state of being wrong is so uncomfortable to us. It may take us years to realize error (in voting for a particular candidate, in marrying a particular person, in the way we manage our finances) but once we reach the moment of acceptance…we have moved on, recognizing our errant ways, and by doing so, returned to a phase of being right. I was wrong to be in that relationship, but now I am right to be out of it. I was wrong about who won the World Series in 1977, but now I am right. And on and on.The implications are endless, and that is part of the power of this book. How frequently we delude ourselves, how constant is our panic of fear, what a leap of faith our daily existence can be. In relationships, in our jobs, as citizens, we like to think we learn from our mistakes. We can, of course, and often do.But simply look at the trajectory of science and history. We know now that the Sun does not revolve around the Earth. We know about bacterial infections. We know better, in theory at least, about the risks of investing and war and democracy and pre-heating the oven. But, as our financial advisors warn us, past success or error is not a predictor or guarantee of future performance. We recognize, easily, the errors in our past, in what we used to think and believe. But it is much more difficult to apply that same reasoning with a healthy dose of doubt to our daily existence. Schulz explains why.We need to operate in our daily life, and that requires deductive reasoning that can sometimes be faulty, and involves making assumptions that are usually right but not always. There is risk in every action we take, but we become comfortable without that risk because we wouldn’t be able back out of the driveway without it.The book is particularly strong in showing the way infants and children develop — and how their errors are so logical to them but ridiculous to us. There is also compelling material in showing how error impacts our way of understanding others. If we are deluded about ourselves so much, how much more do we misfire on understanding other people? This is where the travails and mystery of life live.The book concludes with two interesting points. The first is the intersection between comedy and error (with an appropriate nod to Shakespeare, who appears often in this book. Speaking of error, where art thou, Romeo?). By showing how much of comedy is rooted on error and mistakes and our perceptions that are frequently absurd and ridiuclous, we see comedy as essentially a relief valve from bathing in error and mistakes all day long.The second is a comforting call for us to acclimate and appreciate error. Schulz isn’t out to change our nature, but by arguing the benefits of changing our perceptions of error, and accepting them and using them, she shows how we can decrease anxiety and increase comfort with ourselves and others. Mistakes help us learn and show us the way. Without them, we literally wouldn’t be where we are today.Being able to admit to being wrong is one of the most important things we can do. Children very much struggle with it, even though their entire world perspective changes on an almost daily basis. Adults are only just a little bit better.Understanding error goes a long way to understanding ourselves and others. I’d encourage anyone to read this book and see for yourselves how abundant error and its impacts are in our world. My guess is that it will change your perspective on everything from love to politics, from religion to education, from planning for vacation to how you approach your job.But then again, I cold be wrong. And if I am, that is OK."

75,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5118691-eva,3,"Gorgeous writing and ideas, but the book didn't really go anywhere. Too bad. Kindle quotes: It infuriates me to be wrong when I know I’m right. —MOLIÈRE - location 71Why is it so fun to be right? As pleasures go, it is, after all, a second-order one at best. Unlike many of life’s other delights—chocolate, surfing, kissing—it does not enjoy any mainline access to our biochemistry: to our appetites, our adrenal glands, our limbic systems, our swoony hearts. And yet, the thrill of being right is undeniable, universal, and (perhaps most oddly) almost entirely undiscriminating. We can’t enjoy kissing just anyone, but we can relish being right about almost anything. The stakes don’t seem to matter much; it’s more important to bet on the right foreign policy than the right racehorse, but we are perfectly capable of gloating over either one. Nor does subject matter; we can be equally pleased about correctly identifying an orange-crowned warbler or the sexual orientation of our coworker. Stranger still, we can enjoy being right even about disagreeable things: the downturn in the stock market, say, or the demise of a friend’s relationship, or the fact that, at our spouse’s insistence, we just spent fifteen minutes schlepping our suitcase in exactly the opposite direction from our hotel. - location 73A whole lot of us go through life assuming that we are basically right, basically all the time, about basically everything: about our political and intellectual convictions, our religious and moral beliefs, our assessment of other people, our memories, our grasp of facts. As absurd as it sounds when we stop to think about it, our steady state seems to be one of unconsciously assuming that we are very close to omniscient. - location 85Paradoxically, we live in a culture that simultaneously despises error and insists that it is central to our lives. We acknowledge that centrality in the very way we talk about ourselves—which is why, when we make mistakes, we shrug and say that we are human. As bats are batty and slugs are sluggish, our own species is synonymous with screwing up. - location 117if fallibility is built into our very name and nature, it is in much the same way the puppet is built into the jack-in-the-box: in theory wholly predictable, in practice always a jarring surprise. - location 125Witness, for instance, the difficulty with which even the well-mannered among us stifle the urge to say “I told you so.” The brilliance of this phrase (or its odiousness, depending on whether you get to say it or must endure hearing it) derives from its admirably compact way of making the point that not only was I right, I was also right about being right. In the instant of uttering it, I become right squared, maybe even right factorial, logarithmically right—at any rate, really, extremely right, and really, extremely delighted about it. It is possible to refrain from this sort of gloating (and consistently choosing to do so might be the final milestone of maturity), but the feeling itself, that triumphant ha!, can seldom be fully banished. - location 149we are usually much more willing to entertain the possibility that we are wrong about insignificant matters than about weighty ones. This has a certain emotional logic, but it is deeply lacking in garden-variety logic. In high-stakes situations, we should want to do everything possible to ensure that we are right—which, as we will see, we can only do by imagining all the ways we could be wrong. That we are able to do this when it hardly matters, yet unable to do so when the stakes are huge, suggests that we might learn something important by comparing these otherwise very different experiences. - location 233Most of the rest of this book—into which I promise to release you very soon—is built around stories of people screwing up. These stories involve, among other things, illusions, magicians, comedians, drug trips, love affairs, misadventures on the high seas, bizarre neurological phenomena, medical catastrophes, legal fiascos, some possible consequences of marrying a prostitute, the lamentable failure of the world to end, and Alan Greenspan. - location 318the whole reason it’s possible to be wrong is that, while it is happening, you are oblivious to it. When you are simply going about your business in a state you will later decide was delusional, you have no idea of it whatsoever. You are like the coyote in the Road Runner cartoons, after he has gone off the cliff but before he has looked down. Literally in his case and figuratively in yours, you are already in trouble when you feel like you’re still on solid ground. So I should revise myself: it does feel like something to be wrong. It feels like being right. - location 326Whatever falsehoods each of us currently believes are necessarily invisible to us. Think about the telling fact that error literally doesn’t exist in the first person present tense: the sentence “I am wrong” describes a logical impossibility. As soon as we know that we are wrong, we aren’t wrong anymore, since to recognize a belief as false is to stop believing it. Thus we can only say “I was wrong.” Call it the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle of Error: we can be wrong, or we can know it, but we can’t do both at the same time. - location 330So too with the errors in our own lives. We file them under a range of headings—“embarrassing moments,” “lessons I’ve learned,” “stuff I used to believe”—but very seldom does an event live inside us with the simple designation “wrong.” This category problem is only one reason why our past mistakes can be so elusive. - location 371Doctors don’t teach medical students the theory of bodily humors, and astronomy professors don’t teach their students to calculate the velocity of the fifty-five concentric spheres Aristotle thought composed the universe. This is practical and efficient pedagogy, but it shores up our tacit assumption that current belief is identical with true belief, and it reinforces our generalized sense of rightness. - location 377Ross was struck by the contrast between the grim predictions [the speaker] was describing and the fact that she was pregnant—that, as he put it, “she had somehow found personal hopefulness in the midst of this really massive gloom and doom.” He saw it as a small grace note, a reminder about the possibility of optimism and renewal in even the hardest of times, and he used it as the kicker to his story. The Voice printed the article on the front page. That would have been nice for Ross—except that Donella Meadows wasn’t pregnant. Certain mistakes can actually kill us, but many, many more of them just make us want to die. - location 448Today, we know these truth-revealing errors as Freudian slips—as the old saw goes, saying one thing and meaning your mother. - location 608In ancient Indo-European, the ancestral language of nearly half of today’s global population, the word er meant “to move,” “to set in motion,” or simply “to go.” (Spanish speakers will recognize it as ir.) That root gave rise to the Latin verb errare, meaning to wander or, more rakishly, to roam. The Latin, in turn, gave us the English word “erratic,” used to describe movement that is unpredictable or aimless. And, of course, it gave us “error.” - location 712In the mid-nineteenth century, France was experiencing difficulty in Algeria. The region’s Islamic holy men were using their status—and supposedly their supernatural powers—to encourage resistance to colonial rule, and the resulting rebellion was proving difficult to quell. Deciding to fight fire with fire, Napoleon III turned to one Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin, an erstwhile watchmaker who had become an extraordinarily inventive and convincing illusionist. (Today Robert-Houdin is recognized as the father of modern magic, an honor that comes complete with a kind of figurative primogeniture. In 1890, an aspiring young magician named Ehrich Weiss, seeking to pay homage to his hero, changed his name to Houdini.) Napoleon sent Robert-Houdin to Algeria with instructions to out-holy the holy men, and so he did. Wielding the full panoply of contemporary illusions—plucking cannon balls from hats, catching bullets between his teeth, causing perfectly incarnate chieftains to vanish without a trace—the magician convinced his audience that the more powerful gods were on the side of the empire, and that the French, accordingly, were not to be trifled with. - location 1009“I know” seems to describe a state of affairs which guarantees what is known, guarantees it as a fact. One always forgets the expression, “I thought I knew.” —LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN, ON CERTAINTY - location 1054The Chicago Public Radio show This American Life once dedicated an entire episode to this kind of mild confabulation, in the course of which they did us all a favor by coining a vastly better term for it. Actually, it’s more accurate to say that they launched an imaginary magazine devoted to covering it—a magazine they called Modern Jackass. Modern Jackass: once you learn the phrase, it’s easy to find yourself using it all the time, which says everything you need to know about the pervasiveness of mild confabulation. One of the producers of the show, Nancy Updike, joked that she herself is a frequent contributor to Modern Jackass: Medical Edition—you know, the one where you bullshit your way through an explanation of the merits of antioxidants or the evils of partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. I introduced the Modern Jackass concept to my family and within a matter of hours they were turning around and congratulating me on my cover story for the magazine. - location 1336one extremely good way to become wedded to a theory you’ve just idly expressed is to have it contradicted by, say, your mother. I myself have gone from noncommittal to evangelical in a matter of milliseconds using this technique. - location 1350In the literal sense, a model of the world is a map, and that’s basically what beliefs are, too: mental representations of our physical, social, emotional, spiritual, and political landscapes. My explicit belief that my father-in-law dislikes me is crucial to my mental representation of my family, just as my implicit belief that my mattress is solid is crucial to my mental representation of my bedroom. Both serve the same maplike function of helping me figure out where I might or might not want to sit when I enter a certain room. - location 1476the instant an implicit assumption is violated, it turns into an explicit one. Imagine for a moment a scene worthy of a Marx Brothers movie. It’s nighttime, I emerge from the bathroom in my pajamas, pick up my book, lie down on my bed—and, wham, fall straight through the mattress onto the floor. Should this exceedingly unlikely scenario somehow transpire, three things will have collapsed. The first is my mattress. The second is my belief in the solidity of that mattress. The third—and here is the point I am trying to make—is the implicitness of that belief. If I find myself sprawled on the floor, all of my previously unconscious convictions about mattresses will suddenly surge into consciousness. - location 1487(The very word “believe” comes from an Old English verb meaning “to hold dear,” which suggests, correctly, that we have a habit of falling in love with our beliefs once we’ve formed them.) - location 1660leaping to conclusions is what we always do in inductive reasoning, but we generally only call it that when the process fails us—that is, when we leap to wrong conclusions. - location 1981Kuhn’s great insight was that preexisting theories are necessary to the kind of inquiry that is the very essence of science. And the history of the field bears this out: science is full of examples of how faith in a theory has led people to the evidence, rather than evidence leading them to the theory. In the early nineteenth century, for instance, astronomers were puzzled by perturbations in the orbit of Uranus that seemed to contradict Newtonian mechanics. Because they weren’t prepared to jettison Newton, they posited the existence of an unknown planet whose gravitational pull was affecting Uranus’s path, and calculated that planet’s necessary orbit around the sun. Guided by this work, later astronomers with better telescopes took a second look at the sky and, sure enough, discovered Neptune—less than one degree away from where the theorists had predicted it would be.* - location 2026In logic, this tendency is known, rather charmingly, as the No True Scotsman fallacy. Let’s say you believe that no Scotsman puts sugar in his porridge. I protest that my uncle, Angus McGregor of Glasgow, puts sugar in his porridge every day. “Aye,” you reply, “but no true Scotsman puts sugar in his porridge.” - location 2057Two of my favorite examples of this form of confirmation bias come from the wonderfully evidence-resistant realm of early anatomy and physiology. The first is the traditional Judeo-Christian belief that women had one more rib than men (Adam having furnished one for the making of Eve). This belief somehow survived until 1543, when the Flemish anatomist Andreas Vesalius finally showed otherwise—by, you know, counting. - location 2076Here is Switzerland—that bastion of political stability, military neutrality, excellent chocolate, and hyper-accurate clocks—and here is a startling fact about it. Although it is one of the world’s oldest and most established democracies, women there were not allowed to vote until 1971. - location 2139Lise Girardin, who became the first female mayor of Geneva in 1968, was allowed to run the nation’s second largest city but not allowed to vote in national elections. - location 2164On average across the globe, the women of any given nation have had to wait forty-seven years longer for the right to vote than their male compatriots. In Switzerland, where male citizens began gathering in town squares for public balloting in 1291, universal suffrage took exactly seven centuries. - location 2180you have to understand something about the cantons in general, which is that their independence is a sacrosanct pillar of Swiss political culture—a kind of state’s rights sentiment on steroids. There’s a joke in Switzerland that illustrates the point: a German kid, an American kid, and a Swiss kid are sitting around talking about how babies are made. The German kid claims that they are brought to their parents by storks. The American kid describes the mechanics of sex. Then the Swiss kid pipes up and says, “In Switzerland, it varies by canton.” - location 2340tergiversator. - location 2809indissolubly—with - location 2843Sometimes in life we find ourselves between jobs, and sometimes we find ourselves between lovers, and sometimes we find ourselves between homes. But we almost never find ourselves between theories. Rather than assess a belief on its own merits, we choose among beliefs, clinging to our current ones until something better comes along. - location 2971The Design of Everyday Things, - location 3357Rather than signaling the Second Coming, Edson concluded, October 22 marked the day that Christ had assumed his place in the holiest compartment of the heavens, from whence he would begin judging conditions on earth in preparation for his return. This doctrine, formulated by Edson more or less on the spot, is known as Investigative Judgment. It was formalized by two other Millerites, Ellen White and her husband James White, who together founded the Seventh-Day Adventists on its basis. - location 3379If you don’t have any direct experience with this kind of trauma-induced denial, it’s easy to assume that it is less a deep psychological reaction and more a surface rhetorical reflex: this can’t be happening to me, you must have the wrong person, there’s got to be some kind of mistake here. In reality, though, the denial reaction to trauma is profound and potent. To take a particularly mind-boggling example: at least 20 percent of seriously ill people who are told that they are near death actually forget the news within a few days—a form of denial so extreme that it involves not simply rejecting but entirely obliterating unwanted information. - location 3656So we have four possibilities: the eight-year-old was sexually active; her eleven-year-old sister was sexually active while wearing her sister’s underpants; a third party was in the room (even though the victim had testified to a single intruder); or the father had deposited the semen in one perverse way or another. Neufeld, clearly somewhat nonplussed, concedes that all these scenarios are hypothetically possible—but, he says: NEUFELD: You have no basis to believe that happened here, do you? MCGRATH: Other than I was a prosecutor for eighteen years, and I’ve been in the criminal justice system for twenty-five years. I think it’s a very definite possibility. NEUFELD: That’s the sole source of it? MCGRATH: Which is a pretty significant source. - location 3790When that kind of comprehension is not forthcoming, we take it hard. Think about how distressing it is to feel misunderstood, and how frustrating it is when someone believes something about you—that you’re irresponsible or can’t handle commitment or don’t pull your weight at work—that you think is untrue. Conversely, there are few things more gratifying than the feeling that someone deeply understands us. In fact, as we are about to see, this feeling of being “gotten” is the sine qua non of our most important relationships, and the very hallmark of being in love. - location 4031This feeling of being utterly absorbed in something, from cover to cover or curtain to curtain, is the primordial pleasure of art, one that kicks in long before a grasp of tradition or an admiration of technique. It is the kid-happiness of disappearing into another world. - location 5331the goal of therapy isn’t necessarily to make our beliefs more accurate; it is to make them more functional. - location 5420[In] Another variant of the Sally-Ann task….the experimenter shows the child a Polaroid camera, explains what it does, takes some sample pictures, and allows the child to play with it until he or she is familiar with how it works. Then the puppet show proceeds as in the original experiment—except that, when Sally puts the candy bar in the basket, the experimenter takes a picture of it there. At the end of the show, after Sally has left the room and Ann has moved the candy bar to the cupboard, the child is asked not where Sally thinks the candy bar is, but where it will appear in the photograph….Healthy children find the Polaroid version of the false-belief task harder than the original one: they continue to fail it for some months after they’ve begun to reason correctly about other people’s beliefs. Autistic children, by contrast, can pass the false-belief test when it involves Polaroid pictures, but not when it involves other people’s minds. - location 7442In theory, the outer limit of wrongness would be the condition of being wrong about absolutely everything….Lee defines fractal wrongness as “being wrong at every conceivable scale of resolution.”….As a condition, fractal wrongness is, thankfully, unattainable. As an insult, however, it is incomparable. - location 7624The oft-reported 50 percent divorce rate in the United States comes from a faulty calculation method and is not correct....it’s still high (usually calculated between 36 and 40 percent), and astronomically so for second and third marriages: 60 percent and 73 percent, respectively. - location 7697thirty-five states have now passed “I’m sorry” laws, which prevent physicians’ apologies from being used against them in malpractice suits. - location 7733"
76,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/417156-jenny,4,"This book was brought to my attention by the New York Times Book Review interview with Drew Gilpin Faust, who recommended it as a book all incoming freshman should read. The book is in four parts:Part I: The Idea of Error (ch. 1-2)Part II: The Origins of Error (ch. 3-8)Part III: The Experience of Error (ch. 9-13)Part IV: Embracing Error (ch. 14-15)In the first part, ""The Idea of Error,"" Schulz makes the point that ""the capacity to err is crucial to human cognition"" and that ""wrongness is a vital part of how we learn and change."" She also begins to examine and unpack our ideas about knowledge, beliefs, and rightness. We tend to view error as negative, but Schultz proposes an optimistic model of wrongness as an alternative: taking the Scientific Method as an example, she writes, ""errors do not lead us away from the truth. Instead, they edge us incrementally toward it.""In Part II, ""The Origins of Error,"" Schulz examines how we go wrong. She uses optical illusions to demonstrate how easily our senses can fail us, as well as how sometimes we can enjoy our own failure; the way we perceive the world is not always the way the world is. She addresses the way that memories are stored and recalled: ""Since we can't sense our minds reconstructing memories from across multiple regions of our brain, we run into the same problem with memory that we had with perception. We can't feel the process, so we can't feel the places in that process where distortions and errors can creep in.""Schulz also addresses the difference between knowledge and belief: ""...the idea of knowledge and the idea of error are fundamentally incompatible. When we claim to know something, we are essentially saying that we can't be wrong. If we want to contend with the possibility that we could be wrong, then the idea of knowledge won't serve us; we need to embrace the idea of belief instead....It is by far the broader, more complex, and more interesting category....If we want to understand how we err, we need to look how we believe."" Beliefs, then, are what we have instead of knowledge, but we also have beliefs in the traditional sense of the word, such as believing in gravity or believing in God. These kinds of beliefs are ""inextricable from our identities,"" which is ""one reason why being wrong can so easily wound our sense of self.""In Chapter Six, ""Evidence,"" Schulz introduces the concept of inductive reasoning (reasoning based on evidence). Inductive reasoning is paradoxical, however, because ""although small amounts of evidence are sufficient to make us draw conclusions, they are seldom sufficient to make us revise them."" In the next chapter, the author shifted the focus from the individual to society and community. ""We often form our beliefs on the basis of our communities,"" she writes. ""We also form our communities on the basis of our beliefs."" Thus, communities are ""dangerously effective at bolstering our conviction that we are right and shielding us from the possibility that we are wrong."" Within our communities - geographic, educational, political, etc. - ""We are underexposed to sources that challenge our ideas....most of us are supremely unmotivated to educate ourselves about beliefs with which we disagree."" (Do you read The New York Times or the Wall Street Journal? Watch MSNBC or Fox?)Thus do our beliefs solidify; our communities reinforce them until they feel so right we say ""I know"" instead of ""I believe."" Certainty, however, ""is toxic to a shift in perspective. If imagination is what enables us to conceive of and enjoy stories other than our own, and if empathy is the act of taking other people's stories seriously, certainty deadens or destroys both qualities."" Certainty that allows no possibility for other beliefs, Schulz points out, ""can be a moral catastrophe waiting to happen."" The flip side of certainty is doubt, although humans tend to be credulous first and skeptical later (""Doubt comes after belief."" -Ludwig Wittgenstein). In order to doubt, we must be emotionally capable of tolerating a degree of uncertainty.Part III, ""The Experience of Error,"" kicks off with chapter nine, ""Being Wrong,"" in which psychoanalyst Irna Gadd reinforces this point: ""Our capacity to tolerate error depends on our capacity to tolerate emotion."" Being wrong, Schulz concludes, ""is fundamentally an emotional experience,"" as we face error, realize we have been wrong, and must question our communities, our beliefs, and ultimately ourselves.Once we have faced up to the fact that we have been mistaken, we begin to assess - to ask, ""How Wrong?"" We might admit that we were wrong, but this admission is rarely a complete statement; more often, we say, ""I was wrong, but..."" This, Schulz writes, ""reflects our urge to explain everything in the world - an urge that extends, emphatically, to our own mistakes. This desire to account for why we were wrong is not a bad thing."" Once we've emotionally faced our mistakes, we can begin to assess how and why we made them.Of course, it's difficult to admit error and face wrongdoing (or wrongness). Denial is a popular strategy, used by everyone from kindergarteners to politicians. Because of the emotional difficulty of facing error, we employ denial: ""Freud defined denial as the refusal to recognize the existence or truth of unwelcome facts, and classified it among the defense mechanisms we unconsciously employ to protect ourselves from anxiety or distress.""Chapter twelve, ""Heartbreak,"" is about when we are wrong in matters of the heart. Schulz writes, ""This is the thing about intimate relationships: we sign up to share our lives with someone else, and sooner or later we realize that we are also living with another person's reality."" Once again, there is a gap between the world as we perceive it (our reality) and the world as another person perceives it (their reality). Schulz puts it rather beautifully: ""We spend our lives trying to overcome this fundamental separation, but we can never entirely surmount it. Try as we might, we can't gain direct access to other people's inner worlds - to their thoughts and feelings, their private histories, their secret desires, their deepest beliefs. Nor can we grant them direct access to our own. As...close as we can be to other people, there always remains, between us and them, an enduring margin of mystery. And, just as the gap between us and everything else means that we can be wrong about facts, memories, convictions, and predictions, it means that we can be wrong about one another."" In a relationship, we must accept someone else's reality alongside our own, which, couples counselor Harville Hendrix says, means ""People have to learn to listen and listen and listen.""Chapter thirteen, ""Transformation,"" is about how error leads to change. Here we come back to the optimistic model of wrongness, where being wrong helps us to formulate new theories about the world, change our minds, and become more compassionate people. Schulz writes, ""For all of us, our own private history - like the history of science, like the history of humankind - is littered with discarded theories."" And she quotes Foucault: ""The main interest in life and work is to become someone else that you were not in the beginning.""In the final chapter of the book, Schulz concentrates on the other good results that can come from error: not just personal transformation, but comedy and art. Artists, she notes, are often more comfortable with wrongness than the rest of us, for ""if error is a kind of accidental stumbling into the gap between representation and reality, art is an intentional journey to the same place."" Comedy, likewise, is also often about the ""gap between the world as it is and the world as we think it is"" - the gap between what is expected and what actually happens.*This is an incredibly rewarding book. Schulz is a gifted writer in the way she weaves together ideas from across several disciplines, provides illustrative examples from many sources, quotes experts from different fields, and builds a cohesive and powerful model - the ""Optimistic Meta-Induction"" (to counter the Pessimistic Meta-Induction). Though the ideas and theories in the book are meaty, the writing is accessible and personable. Highly recommended."
77,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55144042-gaurav-bhati,3,"A very frustrating read - found both ideas and the way they are presented problematic.Both opening and closing of the book were less than satisfactory. Halfway through the first chapter, I had to make a conscious effort to not put the book down. My patience was rewarded with Part 2 ( Origins of error) which I enjoyed a lot. Ideas from Thinking Fast and Slow sprinkled with some philosophical discussion made the section an absolute joy to read. Unfortunately though ride from thereon was all downhill. Chapter 12 (Heartbreak) to me seems like a misfit - I don't have any logical disagreements, but the chapter, at best, deserve a place in the appendix or in one of the many long footnotes that the author has used throughout the book. Chapter 13, is the perfect example (in a nutshell) of things that I found wrong with the book. The author starts the chapter with the idea of self-knowledge - leaves me confused with its definition - if knowledge is my perception of reality then everything is self-knowledge. Then she jumps back and forth between the idea that we hate and love the transformation. I have no problem with the ambiguity, but the author seems to ramble and equivocate. She then touches upon the two model of wrongness and then finishes the chapter by stating that being wrong makes us more compassionate but spends only one page on building this argument. So many questions remain unanswered - do people become more compassionate in general or only with respect to topics or ideas regarding which they were wrong? Does compassion come from being wrong or through the first-hand experience of plight? Can growing up in a poor neighbourhood not make me compassionate towards poor people? Most importantly though only evidence that the authour cites in defence of this idea is anecdotal experiences of her friends. I am still not sure what is the key message of the last chapter. For me, the problem seems to be the way the author chose to define Error. With the definition that author chose, one can almost define everything as an error - comedy, art, science. This was almost too philosophical of an idea for me. The writing style of author further makes the book hard to read. The book is full of long sentences with many ideas jumping at you through the never-ending parenthesis. It makes you wonder who is the intended audience of the book - is it the average Joe, who will likely benefit most from some of the genuinely good ideas in the book or the Pulitzer jury. You can lose almost half of the pages in the book without compromising on the content.Regardless of all the pitfalls, the strength of the book is its originality. Kathyrn deserves the credit for her unique take on the idea of Error. I think in the end part of my disappointment was the book not being able to live up to the ideas that it espoused - it got me intrigued but also left me wanting for more."
78,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6944024-maynard-handley,4,"This is a pretty good first attempt at an important subject: the fact that we are frequently wrong, that we are in denial about this, that we as a society have few, and poorly functioning, mechanisms for admitting we were wrong, and suchlike. It covers a lot of territory, covers it well, and provides genuine opinion and some good analysis (which may not seem like much, but see my rants against most books written by journalists). With all the above positives, why did I not give it five stars; superficially it meets most of my five star criteria. The biggest problem is that this is ultimately a book written from a humanist stance. There's nothing wrong with that; it gets you a long way and gives you a lot of insight, especially in the hands of an intelligent, curious author. BUT it doesn't get you all the way. In particular many explanations end at a ""humanist"" end point: we don't like to be wrong because that reinforces a feeling in our minds that we are, ultimately, separate from the universe and from others, with our feeling of commonality with them somewhat fragile and provisional. That's the sort of answer you get from a humanist -- people are this way because this is the way people are. But we can do better! I want an answer from evolution! Sure we're a long way from that right now. There's a substantial gap between EO Wilson (evolution of social species) and Rene Girard (mimesis, which I suspect gives us many things, from language to enforcement of conformity). Maybe some of that is mediated by mirror neurons ala Ramachandran? Point is, that's what I would consider to be an explanation of these issues like we don't want to admit that we were wrong, not the poetic sentiments of ""it makes us feel cut-off from the universe"". After all -why should feeling cutoff from the universe feel bad? Stating a near-universal truth is art, but it's ""dormitive principle"", not an explanation. "
79,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55184519-rachel-c,5,"Choose people over arguments.This book taught me that being wrong is not only probable, but also very likely. Since I have a proven track record of wrongness, I have to conclude that I will likely be wrong again. What good is it to win a fight, if I have lost a friend or someone dear to me in my grabs at ""The Truth"". Not only will I alienate people I love from my self, but I could also find myself wrong and embarrassed. Surrounding myself with people who differ in opinion is a very healthy alternative to choosing only to surround myself with people and ideas that confirm my beliefs (confirmation bias). This was very good for my personal growth, and has made me more comfortable with erring, which in turn makes me more curious to explore the world in which I live. I hope it reminds me that being ""right"" is not nearly as valuable as having relationships, especially when I may be wrong anyway :) I highly recommend.Favorite quote: ""No matter how psychologically resilient we may be, facing up to our own errors time and again is tough. And sometimes we just can’t. Sometimes we are too exhausted or too sad or too far out of our element to risk feeling worse (or even just feeling more), and so instead we wax stubborn, or defensive, or downright mean. The irony, of course, is that none of these feelings are all that great, either- and nor do they engender particularly comforting interactions with others. True, we will have succeeded in pulling up the drawbridge, manning the battlements, and skirting a confrontation with our fallibility. But we will also have succeeded (if that is the word) at creating conflict with another person-not infrequently, with someone we love. And, too, we will have succeeded in stranding ourselves inside the particular and unpleasant kind of loneliness occasioned by one’s own poor behaviour."" (p. 199)"

Thanks to error, we can revise our understanding of ourselves and amend our ideas about the world.[Y]ou can either be right or be in a relationship: you can remain attached to Team You winning every confrontation, or you can remain attached to your friends and family, but good luck trying to do both.[R]ecognizing our mistakes can be shocking, confusing, funny, embarrassing, traumatic, pleasurable, illuminating, and life-altering, sometimes for ill and sometimes for good.[I]n literature, it is always the fools (those who never had any sense in the first place) and the madmen (those who lost it) who speak truth to power.To err is to wander, and wandering is the way we discover the world; and, lost in thought, it is also the way we discover discover ourselves. Being right might be gratifying, but in the end it is static, a mere statement. Being wrong is hard and humbling, and sometimes even dangerous, but in the end it is a journey, and a story. Who really wants to stay home and be right when you can don your armor, spring up on your steed and go forth to explore the world? True, you might get lost along the way, get stranded in a swamp, have a scare at the edge of a cliff; thieves might steal your gold, brigands might imprison you in a cave, sorcerers might turn you into a toad but what of that? To fuck up is to find adventure.[W]e feel that we are right because we feel that we are right: we take our own certainty as an indicator of accuracy. This isn't completely foolish of us, since studies show that there is some correlation between confidence and correctness.[S]o many of our strongest beliefs are determined by mere accidents of fate: where we were born, what our parents believed, what other information shaped us from our earliest days. Once that initial evidence takes hold, we are off and running. No matter how skewed or scanty it may be, it will form the basis for all our future beliefs. Inductive reasoning guarantees as much. And it guarantees, too, that we will find plenty of data to support us, and precious little to contradict us. And that, in turn, all but guarantees that our theories will be very, very difficult to fell.[T]he glorification of independent thought can easily become a refuge for holders of utterly oddball beliefs.Our faith that we are right is faith that someone else is right.[C]ertainty and zealotry are not far removed from each other at all.When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do?If we rely on our political leaders to make important decisions every day, we rely on our fellow voters to make a particularly important decision at the polls.Part of what gets us riled up, then, is the sense that the entire electoral process, and our own political future, is held hostage by the tiny fraction of voters...People have to learn to listen and listen and listen and listen until they finally get it that their partner has their own inner world that you like apples and your partner likes oranges and that it's okay to like oranges. One of my axioms is that if you want to be in a relationship, you have to get it that you live with another person. That person isn't you. She's not merged with you. She's not your picture of who she is. She doesn't live inside your mind. She doesn't know what you're thinking, and you don't know what she's thinking. So you have to back off and move from reactivity to curiosity. You have to ask questions. You have to listen.Our attachment to our own sense of rightness runs deep, and our capacity to protect it from assault is cunning and fierce. It is hard, excruciatingly hard, to let go of the conviction that our own ideas, attitudes, and ways of living are the best ones. And yet, ironically, it's mainly relinquishing this attachment to rightness that is difficult and uncomfortable not, generally speaking, what happens afterward. This provides a crucial clue about the origins of our desire to be right. It isn't that we care so fiercely about the substance of our claims. It is that we care about feeling affirmed, respected, and loved.""I cannot say I changed."" Instead, he [Whittaker Chambers, Communist who witnessed against Alger Hiss] continued: ""There tore through me a transformation with the force of a river which, dammed up and diverted for a lifetime, bursts its way back to its true channel. I became what I was. I ceased to be what I was not."" Instead of changing, Chambers felt, he had simply resumed his true identity. This claim is a common feature of conversion narratives. Indeed, the very word conversion comes from a Latin verb that means not to change but to return.[W]e are transformed by error through accepting it. To be judgmental, we must feel sure that we know right from wrong, and that we ourselves would never confuse the two. But the experience of erring shows us otherwise. It reminds us that, having been wrong in the past, we could easily be wrong again and not just in the abstract but right now, here in the middle of this argument about pickles or constellations or crumb cake. At the same time, it reminds us to treat other people with compassion, to honor them in their possible rightness as well as their inevitable, occasional wrongness. Instead of taking their errors as a sign that they are ignorant or idiotic or evil, we can look to our own lives and reach the opposite conclusion: that they are, like us, just human.According to the Institute of Medicine, between 690,000 and 748,000 patients are affected by medical errors in the United States every year, and between 44,000 and 98,000 die from them. Even the lowball estimate makes medical mistakes the eighth leading cause of death in the nation worse than breast cancer, AIDS, and motor vehicle accidents.[T]he existence of political parties goes hand-in-hand with the existence of free speech. Governments that refuse to acknowledge their fallibility have no need of (and in fact must destroy) dissent. But those that recognize their potential to err and hope to curtail or correct their mistakes must permit open expression even if whatever is expressed seems odious, unpatriotic, or simply untrue.A truly open government must recognize that it (like each of us as individuals) can always stumble into error, and that (again like each of us), it will not always know when it has done so. For that, it must rely on its dissidents and whistleblowers, which means it must permit them to speak out without fear of reprisal."
81,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/612636-beth,3,"An interesting mix of psychology, philosophy, and medical science, exploring some of the ways we are wrong and the benefits of wrongness. As a recovering perfectionist who still hates to make mistakes, I appreciated the topic and learned a lot. Here are some of the things that resonated with me:- our senses, minds, and communities can deceive us into being wrong. Sometimes, we see things that aren't there (mirages -- I learned about exterior mirages, which is seeing things that are there but not where they should be, like a mountain range that appears closer than it is). We rely on our memories to affirm validity of events, but unfortunately our memories are actually very faulty -- even if it's a ""vivid"" memory. And we often end up in echo chambers, with whole groups of us being wrong together.- Doubt is a cognitive luxury. Have you ever met a skeptical mollusk??- Wrongness can feel humorous, imaginative, or playful. We enjoy art and literature often explore wrongness, such as A Comedy of Errors or Pride and Prejudice.- Wrongness is optimism. Though error feels like despair, we should look at it as hope -- that there is something more out there than ourselves. It is a sign that we are independent thinkers, capable of being right and wrong.There were some arguments I didn't follow, and -- clean readers, beware -- there was some profanity (including a half-dozen f-bombs) as well as some references to rape and violence. But overall I thought this was an interesting book that made me think."
82,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51505757-mark-valentine,5,"I may be wrong but that is the best book I have read all year. I know it is March, but I am certain of this--the best book for me to have read anyway. She explores science, psychology, religion, relationships, and art. Schulz gives me permission to be imaginative, creative, adventurous and diverse. She writes (p. 330), ""Art is an invitation to enjoy ourselves in the land of wrongness."" In relationships (she has two incredible chapters of love), she has clarified and corrected much that I had misunderstood or misapplied. In religion, she counsels for spirituality over the lethal effects of religiosity. Her psychological chapters cite key social scientists on optical illusions, memory lapse, perception falsifications, confabulations. I highly recommend it either as a textbook, as a book group discussion text, or a book to grow up by. I expect it will be one that I re-read in order to take in more. I mean, ponder this piece of wisdom: ""Constantly reckoning with the possibility that we are wrong requires remaining aware of the chasm between us and the universe"" (p. 265). As much as I have been wrong in my life (and expect to still be wrong), I am learning to value my failings because it shows me that I am still alive, that I can still learn, that I can still help others to learn, that I still have something to give back to the universe with creativity, imagination, and grace.

83,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92857691-sergio,4,"This is one of those books that you either love or hate because of the way is written. For sure, Kathryn Schulz has something special about how she transmits her ideas.I read ""Being Wrong"" a few months ago due to the recommendation of the best professor I ever had, and I don´t regret doing it. This book gave me a huge and complex framework about how to think about the conception of error, the human being and life itself. It is a quite thorough book, but if you get to continue until the end, you won´t be the same person that started reading.I am confident when I say this book is not for everyone. Here you are not going to find straightforward tools to improve your life, neither a simple vision about mistakes. This book is for people who like thinking about thinking, and get into the intellectual root of an abstract concept such as ""error"".If you are unsure or are interested in the topic but prefer something much less theoretical, I strongly recommend Black Box Thinking: Why Some People Never Learn from Their Mistakes - But Some Do by Matthew Syed. In this book you have a far more enjoyable and practical research about mistakes full of catching examples, but with a yet deep research and valuable learnings. Start with this book and if you want more, move to Kathryn´s one."
84,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1378061-lyle,4,"""Crusoe named his small island Despair, and the choice was apt. Despair—the deep, existential kind—stems from the awareness that we are each marooned on the island of our self, that we will live and die there alone. We are cut off from all the other islands, no matter how numerous and nearby they appear; we cannot swim across the straits, or swap our island for a different one, or even know for sure that the other ones exist outside the spell of our own senses. Certainly we cannot know the particulars of life on those islands—the full inner experience of our mother or our best friend or our sweetheart or our child. There is, between us and them—between us and everything—an irremediable rift.We have met this rift over and over in this book. It is the same one that keeps us separated from and fated only to speculate about the rest of the universe; the same one whose existence leaves us vulnerable to error. I've said that the sudden recognition of this rift is the essence fo the experience of wrongness. But now it turns out that recognizing this rift can also be the essence of the experience of despair. Encountering it, we are reminded that we are alone on our islands, cut off from one another and from the essential truths of the world. Our errors and our existential angst spring from a common source."""
85,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3213863-christopher,2,"I had a hard time reading this book... the first chapter was interesting and grabbed my attention but it was more or less down hill from there. I don't think I really learned anything about the subject that I didn't already know or think about before. Good things I took from this book were that she made some good points about how we think about being wrong and about others. We often tend to think others are less informed when they dont agree with us and it was enlightening to ponder over that pointA lot of case studies and examples in each chapter to reinforce her point, but her writing style was irritating. She explained too much, the whole book is filled with brackets with scentances like (this is what I mean by brackets). The amount of explaining with brackets felt condescending. She had a terrible tenancy to write off in tangents from the initial point, and by the time you came back around, the initial point she was trying to make was lost on me. I'm giving this book to a charity shop and I feel sorry for the person who kindly buys it and has to read through that amount of tripe. The book has some good reviews and this is only my opinion but I'm not sorry that I'm finished."
86,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3677821-pete,3,"Being Wrong : Adventures in the Margin of Error (2010) by Kathryn Schulz is a reasonably interesting look at how people change their minds and are 'wrong' and how we mentally deal with this. If, like me, you have many acquaintances who are wrong about many things, this book will help you understand them better.Actually, the book does look at the interesting process of how we are all constantly wrong and how we correct ourselves all the time. This process is genuinely interesting. Schulz points out how we have to formulate hypotheses about the world in order to act and that many of these will be wrong. She also points out that what we believe becomes a part of who we are. Believing or not believing in religion is something many people say defines them. Our political beliefs also, to an extent, define us.However the book goes on too long. Many readers will find themselves enjoying it to a point and then find the laboring over similar points to be tedious.Being Wrong is definitely worth a look, but perhaps not a read all the way through. "
87,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10859374-richp,4,"This was pretty good overall. The subject is an important one to all, but is poorly understood by all but a few. This dragged at times with overly long explanations, and frustrated me at times with Schulz' apparent lack of understanding of some things, but the good stuff more than makes up for the mediocre stuff.One weakness was the minimization of the role of deliberate lying in politics, the military, and law, among other fields. Not everyone who propagates obvious lies has convinced themselves those lies are true. In many cases, those in authority know they are lying (eg WMD in Iraq, where the generals would not have risked losing 50K or more US troops in a day or two if Iraq really had WMDs, whereas USA brought WMDs to Iraq and used them against the civilian population).Another (but lesser) weakness was in dealing with statistical process control in industrial processes. SPC has a long history, and what Motorola did was jump on the bandwagon late in terms of using it, and then packaged a methodology under its own brand and sold the methodology as a product. "
88,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28534403-sarah,4,"“Even if you can’t be brought to believe that error itself is a good thing, I hope to convince you by the end of this book that it is inseparably linked to other good things, things we definitely do not want to illuminate – like, say, our intelligence.” Making a mistake might not feel good, but error is akin in spirit to hope. When viewed with a positive attitude, error represents a false view of reality, and therefore opportunity for growth and improvement. “To fuck up is to find adventure: it is in that spirit that this book is written.”Why is it that we have so much trouble accepting our own fallibility? This book explores that theme and more in finer detail than you’d ever think would be interesting. There are so many aspects of our lives in which we are wrong, and yet we can’t seem to understand that to err is human, let alone accept it. This aptly-named book teaches us not how to avoid making mistakes but how to keep an open mind and embrace our imperfections."
89,0061176044,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49793595-thomas-s,3,"Each member of our group initially began reading Being Wrong because it was the assigned material for our Seminar in Composition class at the University of Pittsburgh. At the start, as was the same for our classmates, we had mixed emotions about it. Kathryn Schulz centralized her book about the idea of error, a concept that anybody who reads the book can relate to, and this captured our attention. Although this book started as assigned reading, the members in our group wanted to continue on with Being Wrong despite many of our peers opting to read other books. We had already dedicated a lot of time to the text and had become comfortable in recognizing and appreciating Schulz’s style of writing. We also pushed on with the text in hopes of an ending that made all of her points and all of her assumptions on error come together into practical advice or ideas that could be applicable to our lives. Each of us formed a slightly different opinion of Being Wrong, but, after some compromise, we decided on our most important issues.One of the main concerns we had with the text was the overall length of the book. We believe that Schulz could be equally or possibly even more effective if she would have been more concise. She certainly makes some interesting points in her book, but she tends to very wordy and, at times, excessively repetitive. Some repetition is fine; a reference to an anecdote earlier in the book is a great way to tie a new point into a previous one. However, Schulz tends to expand an idea that could easily be covered in a single page, maybe two, into three or four. This was a problem that some of our classmates could not forgive and therefore stopped reading Being Wrong in favor of something different.In fairness, Schulz’s repetition is worse in the earlier chapters. In them, her examples and the ideas she derives from them all seem to be slightly different versions of the same thing. Much of the first two parts leaves you with the thought of “All right! I know we make errors. Must we go through every single way that we do?” At least in her later chapters (starting approximately with chapter 7), she studies different aspects of our reactions to and interactions with error. It still can become fairly rote at times, but it never again gets to be excruciatingly so.In addition to the excessive length of the book, we noticed that Being Wrong did not include any ideas or advice about making errors that we could incorporate into our everyday lives. The book is very theoretical and academic in nature. There’s nothing wrong with that necessarily, but you should know what you’re getting into before investing your time and money in the book. If your primary goal is to learn more about the concept of being wrong and immerse yourself in studies and theories about human psychology, then you might enjoy Schulz’s work. Although every now and then Schulz gives quality analogies that are tailored towards the “average Joe,” we feel that her primary audience is highly academic individuals with a strong interest in philosophy and psychology.Schulz’s Amazon product description for Being Wrong promises that her book “will change the way you perceive screw-ups, both the mammoth and daily variety, forever.” Also featured prominently on the backmatter of the book is a claim that Being Wrong is “the one book that Harvard University president Drew Gilpin Faust wishes all incoming freshmen would read.” Contrary to those two statements suggesting you’ll get practical knowledge that will help shape your future decisions and outlook on life, we don’t feel like that’s the case, and we certainly don’t see it as “required reading” material for college freshmen. Long story short, if you’re looking for this book to give you any sort of actionable advice or ideas to incorporate into your own life, it’s probably not worth your investment.With all of this being said, we believe that there were many good aspects of the book and Schulz’s writing as well. These aspects outweighed whatever negative feelings we held and pushed us to keep reading. As said in a New York Times book review, “Schulz remains good company-- a warm, witty and welcome presence … Being Wrong is smart and lovely.” Schulz is an expert in elaborating her argument in a cogent yet unoffending way. She opens a necessary inquiry and a broad discussion to the humanity of error that we neglect all the time. Reading a book which tries to convince you that mistakes are inevitable in nature and that we should embrace errors as we embrace art and literature is not a particularly pleasant and comfortable experience, but Schulz with her writing style and sharp wit somehow makes this topic interesting. She is not the kind of condescending writer who goes deep into exploring an example in a certain field without bothering to explain the basic principles or background of that topic before digging deeper. In Being Wrong, Schulz incorporates science, psychology, history and literature to examine her argument but she never assumes that her readers are knowledgeable in all the fields she mentions. Just as the NYT review says, she always remains a warm and welcome presence. After finishing the last chapter, our group felt that reading Being Wrong may be the right thing to do. Overall, our group gave Being Wrong a total rating of three stars. Although Schulz might’ve been too repetitive in some of the earlier chapters when explaining her points and never gave any direct actionable advice, we believe that she was able to redeem herself in other areas. Undeniably Schulz succeeds in starting a luminous and thorough investigation on why and how we are designed to err, even in our deepest beliefs. The moments when Being Wrong makes us think deeper about the hidden truth behind our mistakes is definitely worth three stars."
