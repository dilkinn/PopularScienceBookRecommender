0,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957217-laurel,5,"I read this book for the first time during my senior year in high school. The year prior, I had gone to Germany for spring break with some fellow classmates. During the trip, we spent a day visiting a former WWII concentration camp in Dachau. As one might expect, this visit had a profound effect on me. I had of course read and knew about the atrocities that occurred under the Nazi regime, but to actually see the gas chambers in person is a deeply haunting and disturbing experience. Perhaps for this reason, Frankl's book affected me even more deeply than it otherwise might have. The book is divided into two parts. The first section recounts in vivid detail Frankl's horrifying experiences as a prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp. Frankl, a former psychiatrist, also describes his observations of other prisoners and what he felt to be the main way in which people tried to cope with the insurmountable obstacles they faced. He found that those who could find meaning or purpose in their suffering were the ones who also seemed better able to find the strength to go on. As I recall, Frankl personally found his purpose in the hope of someday being able to see his wife again - a hope that was strong enough to get him through the daily horrors he faced.The second half of this book is devoted to the therapy he developed based on the search for meaning, which he calls logotherapy. The basic premise is that those who can find meaning in their suffering are better able to cope with what would otherwise be a struggle too hard to bear. As one who majored in psychology, I found this section as fascinating as the first.I have read this book at least three times now, and it is one of the few books I can say truly changed my life. I am ever grateful that I have the wisdom of this book to fall back upon when needed. Several years ago, at a very young age (in my 20s), I became ill with a disease that left me bedridden and barely able to speak above a whisper. Now 36, I am still bedridden and fighting the same battle. It is Frankl's reminder to find meaning and purpose in suffering (which I found in the love of my fiancé and my hope of recovery) that has helped me to get through each difficult day. As Frankl tells us, ""Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.""I highly recommend this book!!"
1,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/140090-frank,5,"After I read this book, which I finished many, many years ago, I had become self-critical of any future endeavours which would take up a lot of my time. I would ask myself ""is this or will this be meaningful to me?"", and if the answer was ""no"", I wouldn't do it. It was this book that influenced me to consciously live as meaningful a life as possible, to place a great value on the journey and not just the destination, while knowing that ""meaningful"" doesn't always mean ""enjoyable"". ""Meaningful"" should be equated with ""fulfilling"". So I studied Physics instead of Engineering. I went to York U instead of U of T. I went to Europe instead of immediately entering the workforce after graduation. I want to recommend this book to all of my grade 12 students. "
2,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"How is it possible to write dispassionately of life in a concentration camp in such a way as to engender great feeling in the reader? This is how Frankl dealt with his experience of those terrible years. The dispassionate writing makes the horrors of the camp extremely distressing, more so than writing that is more emotionally involved. It is almost reportage. The first half of the book is equal in its telling to The Diary of a Young Girl in furthering our understanding of those dreadful times.There are occasional glimmers of humanity from the Germans. These are so small that rather than illuminate any basic goodness, they cast further into the shadows the terror of living in a place and time where death might be a beating or a shot to the head at any moment. There are also stories of the depths that some of the Jewish victims would sink to in what they would do to stay alive themselves. It made me think that rather than condemn these people for becoming tools of the Nazis, what would I do faced with death or the chance to stay alive a little longer and maybe save family or friends. 7 stars, golden stars for this half of the book.The second half is about Frankl's psychotherapeutic methods and lost me in boredom. I did read this in its entirety but it wouldn't have spoiled the book, or my appreciation of the genius retelling and brilliant writing of the first half, if I hadn't."
3,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,4,The original part one was the strongest I think because the rest started to go into the typical psychobabble inherent to books trying to contribute to the academic side of psychology or psychiatry but the first part really grounded the idea of giving meaning to one existence into personal experience and I found it very poignant about the mental state of people in very stressful and hopeless situations. It's a very empowering and important idea that no matter the situation a person can control their behavior and influence their own feelings of the situation. This idea of a person having so much control over their own selves and survival is one I whole heartedly agree with. Anyone having trouble figuring out life or what the point is could benefit from reading this I think.
4,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,3,"For most of the book, I felt as dumbfounded as I would have been if I were browsing through a psychiatric journal. Filled with references and technical terms and statistics, it was mostly a book-long affirmation of the then innovative technique called 'logo-therapy'. I do not understand how this book is still relevant and found in most popular book stores. It might have been that the book was popular in the sixties and seventies as it offered a powerful and logical argument against the reductionist approach that leads inevitably to existential nihilism, but is that still relevant today? It also attempts to free psychiatry from the belief that 'eros' was the cause of all neurosis and turns the flashlight on repressed 'logos' - which forms the premise of the book and the title. But, while the basic premises are powerful and moving, the breadth and scale of repetition of the same ideas and the technical jargon and the constant Freud-bashing ensured that I did not enjoy the book as much as I had hoped. Furthermore, the whole chapter dedicated to the theory that ultimately our basic necessity of 'search for logos' can also be explained as a 'repressed religious drive' and his exhortation to religious people to not look down on irreligious ones (read atheists and agnostics) just because they have achieved a stage that the atheists/agnostics are still aspiring (unconsciously of course) towards rang patently false and too much in line with his argument of psychiatry being a sister to theology.I wish Frankl had stuck to his original title of 'The Unconscious God' - it would have been more representative of the book as his 'logos' argument directly derives from his postulation of a transcendent unconscious super-ego that trumps Freud's 'Super Ego' and a spiritual cum instinctual subconscious that trumps Freud's 'id'.Unless you are looking for a historical perspective on the technical aspects of psychiatry and about the origins of 'logo-therapy', I would not recommend this book, especially for general reading. If you pick up this book, like I did, in the hope that it is about Frankl's personal quest for meaning amidst the horrors of Auschwitz with a strong scientific perspective, you will be disappointed to find that you have picked up a medical journal that is pedantic and repetitive, with hardly any reference to Frankl's personal journey or about how he evolved his theory and practices (that did transform many lives) based on his experiences."
5,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20906165-jv-semi-hiatus,5,"What is it that makes life worth living? Is it the pursuit of happiness? Attaining success? As human beings living in a vast and endless universe (or multiverse for that matter), what are we actually living for? I, for one, cannot answer those particular questions for you but know that I am also one of those who is searching for answers, trying to look for ways to make sense out of life, the numerous paths we've all trodden as well as the roads we haven't taken. We look backwards rummaging through our past examining our own mistakes, failures, and losses and what we could've done to correct those that which cannot be changed. We yearn for the truth about our own existence where pain, suffering, loss, and even death is inevitable, but amidst those darkest moments, we rise above those conditions and grow beyond them as Frankl puts it, ""'Et lux in tenebris lucet' — and the light shineth in the darkness."" What is the meaning of life — ""a naïve query which understands life as the attaining of some aim through the active creation of something of value."" Or perchance, we've been asking the wrong question after all?
""Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible. Thus, logotherapy sees in responsibleness the very essence of human existence.""
Man's Search for Meaning was a transformative and life-affirming read. Brimming with illuminating insights, Frankl explores, analyses, and shares his harrowing experiences in a concentration camp during Hitler's reign. More than that, he delves into numerous ways in how he sees suffering and pain as a part of life. By employing logotherapy, he offers us ways to discover meaning in our lives by creating a work or doing a deed; by experiencing something or encountering someone; and by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.
""If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete. [...] It is one of the basic tenets of logotherapy that man’s main concern is not to gain pleasure or to avoid pain but rather to see a meaning in his life. That is why man is even ready to suffer, on the condition, to be sure, that his suffering has a meaning. But let me make it perfectly clear that in no way is suffering necessary to find meaning. I only insist that meaning is possible even in spite of suffering—provided, certainly, that the suffering is unavoidable.""
These philosophical truths and therapeutic method hit close to home. For someone who has been wandering and wondering about ""meaning"", this gave me a better understanding about life, offered me a glimmer of hope, and provided an enormous relief. Being diagnosed with depression a year ago, I asked my psychiatrist what was the meaning of life. He provided a rather straightforward answer, ""It is up to you to search for it as it will be a lifelong journey of exploration."" After reading this book, I realised my doctor was correct after all, but I was hoping that he could elucidate more than that.
""For the meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person’s life at a given moment.""
Frankl also affirmed my belief that my condition stems from having an existential crisis, haunted by having an existential frustration and a void within that represents my inner emptiness, to which I say that in cases such as mine, logotherapy would be perfect, but I'm not discrediting psychotherapy for it has its own uses and benefits too.
""Such widespread phenomena as depression, aggression and addiction are not understandable unless we recognize the existential vacuum underlying them. This is also true of the crises of pensioners and aging people.""
I couldn't recommend this book highly enough for philosophical thinkers and readers, those who are struggling with their mental health that deeply stems from having an existential crisis, those who feel hopeless due to a fate that cannot be changed, and for those who want to have a meaningful life.
""He who has a Why to live for can bear almost any How.""

6,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl,5,"This is a short but extremely intense book, first published in 1946. It begins with the author's experiences in four (!!) different German concentration camps in WWII, including Auschwitz, and how he coped with those experiences -- and saw others cope with them, or not. He continues in the second half of this book with a discussion of his approach to psychiatry, called logotherapy, based on the belief that each person needs to find something in his or her life, something particular and personal to them, to give their life meaning. We need to look outside ourselves. There is nothing in the world, I venture to say, that would so effectively help one to survive even the worst conditions as the knowledge that there is meaning in one's life. There is much wisdom in the words of Nietzsche: ""He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.""The first half of the book is completely absorbing, fascinating reading. When I tried to read the second, more academic part of it years ago, I floundered (I don't think I ever got through to the end). But I stuck with it this time and found it truly rewarding.The second part did sometimes challenge my brain cells with concepts like this:I never tire of saying that the only really transitory aspects of life are the potentialities; but as soon as they are actualized, they are rendered realities at that very moment; they are saved and delivered into the past, wherein they are rescued and preserved from transitoriness. For, in the past, nothing is irretrievably lost but everything is irrevocably stored.I had to read that one two or three times before I felt like I really grasped what Frankl was saying. And this one:Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!I assume it's to help give us motivation to avoid making a wrong choice, by thinking through the likely consequences of what we are about to do. But there are so many nuggets of wisdom in this short volume. A few things that really impacted me:We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us.One should not search for an abstract meaning of life. Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated.It is one of the basic tenets of logotherapy that man's main concern is not to gain pleasure or to avoid pain but rather to see a meaning in his life. ... In accepting this challenge to suffer bravely, life has a meaning up to the last moment, and it retains this meaning literally to the end.Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment. By the same token, every human being has the freedom to change at any instant.Inspiring words; inspiring life.Bonus material: Here is an interview with Viktor Frankl when he was 90 years old. He died just a couple of years later."

8,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2986010-francisco,5,"This book stands out as one of the most helpful tools I've found in my life-long search for the way to live and be useful to others despite depression. As opposed to Freud, who believed that the primary drive in man, the most urgent motivation, was pleasure, Frankl believes that it is meaning. Now meaning for Frankl is not something abstract and airy and noble but rather something very concrete and specific to your life - what is the task that life asks of you that only you can do? Look at the circumstances of your life, look at your talents and the people that surround you. Where is the need that is calling for you to respond? For Frankl, the hope that kept him trudging on day by day in the concentration camps was the need to re-write the manuscript (taken away when first imprisoned) where he could present to the world his theory of Logotherapy. Why I found this book so helpful in my struggles with depression is because one of the rock-bottom places where depression can take you is despair. Despair is the absence of hope. The search for meaning, for a response to something life is asking of you, is the place where hope is born. Frankl states that hope, like genuine laughter or like faith or love is not something that we can will into being. We cannot make hope appear willy nilly in our lives because hope is more than a nice thought, it is, like true love something that involves your whole being. I find this to be true but there are things that we can do to prepare the way for hope's arrival and hope will come, it will always come. We can search for meaning because searching and looking and asking and expecting are acts and attitudes that we can will. Meaning, according to Frankl is found in three different forms. Meaning is found in creating or doing. Meaning is found in experiencing something greater than ourselves and in encountering another being through love. And finally, meaning can be found in the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering. The important thing here is that in all of these instances the value of the thing that gives meaning is subjective. There is no scale out there that says that writing a novel gives more meaning than helping your spouse with the dishes. When it comes to meaning, the small, the hidden, the unsaid is as important as the great acts of genius and you alone are the judge. Orienting yourself to responding in some way to what life is asking of you may not be the sole cure to depression but it is for me a necessary part of any healing process, of learning to live and be useful, despite the illness."
9,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/758916-emily,5,"After the Book of Mormon, this would be my second recommendation to anyone looking for purpose in life. Here's a poignant excerpt from one of my favorite parts of the book when Frankl has been in Auschwitz and other camps for several years and doesn't know the war is only weeks away from ending. He had decided to escape his camp near Dachau with a friend and was visiting some of his patients for the last time.""I came to my only countryman, who was almost dying, and whose life it had been my ambition to save in spite of myself, but my comrade seemed to guess that something was wrong (perhaps I showed a little nervousness). In a tired voice he asked me, 'You too, are getting out?' I denied it, but I found it difficult to avoid his sad look. After my round I returned to him. Again a hopeless look greeted me and somehow I felt it to be an accusation. The unpleasant feeling that had gripped me as soon as I had told my friend I would escape with him became more intense. Suddenly I decided to take fate into my own hands for once. I ran out of the hut and told my friend that I could not go with him. As soon as I had told him with finality that I had made up my mind to stay with my patients, the unhappy feeling left me. I did not know what the following days would bring, but I had gained an inward peace that I had never experienced before. I returned to the hut, sat down on the boards at my countryman's feet and tried to comfort him...""I found such strength and wisdom in this book--strength and advice for me as a mother of six young children. While potty training, bending over to clean up a handful of toys for the the thousandth time that day, scraping Play Dough off of a filthy kitchen floor on hands and knees, and preparing the fifth snack of the day for several hungry mouths (directly after doing the dishes from the previous snack) I find the text of this book to give profound meaning to small and simple acts of selflessness, patience, and service. What a profound reminder that ""The immediate influence of behavior is always more effective than that of words."" I desperately needed to read this book, if only to remember to be calm and kind to my little ones so that they will pass on the favor to their own next generation. Bravo to Viktor Frankl for bringing human frailty and greatness into perspective.""Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms--to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."" -Frankl"
10,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5796167-anarki,5,"Have you ever been in a situation wherein unreasonable suffering seems the only task left in your life that suicide seems to be a very reasonable option? Have you ever thought that living only extends the misery and torment you've already took? Have you felt the vacuum of meaningless suffering sucking the life out of you like a black hole? Have you ever thought that breathing is a disease only death can cure? If yes, then you haven't read this book.The meaning of life … Many people already died trying to find it or died before even finding it. We, human beings, have this need to fill the void. “What's the meaning of life?” is a very famous question. A question that is a widespread epidemic around the world. In this book, Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl, he shares his experiences in the concentration camp. Horrifying. It makes your gut feel sick. It makes you grind your teeth and clench your fists and punch the wall. Or whatever. It makes you stop reading and reflect. If you're not familiar with the history of Hitler, The Nazis, or watched movies like “A Beautiful Life” or “Schinder's List”, you will be in a state of shock reading this autobiographical account.Frankl discussed in the first part of the book the Psychological Reaction or Phases of a prisoner in the concentration camp. First phase is Shock. You are welcomed by the horror and brutality. This is the moment when everything from you is taken off. Every possession that you have. Every strand of hair in your body is shaved off. Even your name is replaced by a number. You are no longer a human being. Inside the camp, you are nothing but a number. 119, 104 was Frankl's.. It's only you and your naked existence –even minus the hair. During this phase, everyday life in the camp is hell. There was even a night that someone was a having a delirium while he was sleeping. At first, Frankl wanted to wake him up, but after a few second he decided not to. Fact is: The reality he's gonna be waking up to is a lot worse than the nightmare he was having. This is the moment when you'll realized that nightmares are better than reality. Every minute in the camp, the thought of death doesn't escape your thoughts. Every day, someone dies. Or decides to kill himself. The death toll increases, and you are nothing but a statistic that won't even be recorded. You could be next.Later, this day to day camp experience will take your capacity to feel pain itself. The next phase is Apathy. In this phase, you are accustomed to the camp environment. It was once said that man can adapt to any situations, only he thinks he can't. The blows in the head no longer hurt you. It's the mental agony that will make you suffer –the injustice. You can even drag the dead body out of the way and steal his belongings for your own betterment. You only bother to take care of your survival. Survival of the fittest.Frankl discovered that they already proved Science wrong. If Science were right, then they should have been dead meat. There’s something inside the human body that is more than itself. Something beyond their own anatomy. Pause. Let me ask you a question. Have you ever wondered why there were some people who got the guts to escort the prisoners to the Gas Chambers? The Schutzstaffel, a.k.a in abbreviated form: the SS, and the Capos. How did they get the nerve of doing that? And how do they even find tyranny pleasurable? Here, we come to the last phase of a prisoner’s Psychological Reaction. It’s Depersonalization. The person is depersonalized. It’s no longer a person, but a thing. The morals are distorted. The person inside, dies. The person has become nothing but a number. A prisoner a prisoner. An SS an SS. A Capo a Capo. They killed the spiritual life inside them, thus resorting to such evil acts making the people around them suffer instead of themselves. When liberation had come, at first thought, they expected themselves to be happy and free. They were wrong. Being happy was something they've unlearned. After years of meaningless suffering as prisoners of war, they forgot how it feels like to be free again –how to be free –how to be a human being. A human being who became a number. Then a number finding its way back to be a human being. I apologize for the attempt to summarize. Frankl's experience in the concentration camp put Sigmund Freud into shame. It's not really pleasure that drives people to live his life. It disputes the Pleasure Principle and Adler's Will to Power. After reading this book and know the immeasurable meaningless suffering a prisoner had went through, you would wonder how were these people able to survive. .... It's the Will to Meaning. Quoting from from a famous philosopher “He who has a why to live can bear with almost any how.” No matter how much suffering one is going through. If he finds a reason to live through it. His soul will speak with pride. Looking back, shouting to the world “I went through it all!” The suffering had become an inspiration. It had become a trophy. It had become an achievement that no one can ever steal.“That which does not kill me makes me stronger.” Again, from that famous philosopher. Because of this theory, the suffering impregnated Viktor Frankl and later gave birth to Logotherapy or Existential Therapy which is going to be discussed in the 2nd half of the book. It's more than being logical. Logos is deeper than Logic. It is self-transcendence. A form of Psychotherapy that focuses on meaning. The psychotherapist plays the role of an Ophthalmologist. He makes the patient see what he doesn't see. Everything, no matter how miserable it is, has a meaning. No matter how much suffering one is going through, it doesn't take away the internal freedom to deal cope with the situation. ""Everything can be taken away from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms —to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way."" and, “When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.” And what happens to a man after going through hell? Simple. He is no longer afraid of anything.To end this, I want to share a story. After the liberation, some personnel visited the concentration camps. They took a look around the ruins of war. And as they were roaming, one personnel noticed something etched on the wall, ""Vielen Dank, Mein Lieber Gott! Sie haben mir die Gelegenheit geben, denen vergeben, die unverzeihlich!"" Translated in English it says,""Thank you, my dear God! For you have given me the opportunity to forgive the unforgivable!""And by the way, I have a blog: www.pagexero.wordpress.com."
11,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely,3,"The sun is slowly rising up ushering the dawning of a new day. The mother and the father are sipping their first cups of coffee. Their schooling children are rising up from their bed. The mother attends to her children’s daily routine. She bathes, feeds them their breakfast and makes sure that their things are all in their individual school bags. Para Kanino Ka Bumabangon? (translation: Whom Do You Wake Up For?) is heard as a voice over. This is Nestle’s TV ad for Nescafe coffee but it sends a very clear message: 
that each of us has our own reason for living and this reason is the meaning of our life, our existence.
 In a nutshell, this is what Viktor Emil Frankl (1905-1997) an Austrian Jew, neurologist, psychiatrist and a Holocaust survivor, is saying in this 1946 originally-published book, Man’s Search for Meaning. He says that the life of each one of us has its own meaning. That meaning cannot be generalized. His theory of logotherapy which is a form of Existential Analysis, can be used to determine one’s meaning for living or even suffering. Using his horrendous experiences at Auschwitz concentration camp, which he narrated in the first part of this book, he said that he and the other survivors kept themselves alive by imaging and looking forward to their lives after the war. Those who felt hopeless and they could not picture themselves reuniting with their families after the war, perished. As if they had no longer any reason for living and thus they chose to die rather than to survive.He also said that we should not ask for the meaning of our life. Rather, we should ask what life wants from us.I have read several books about the holocaust. I have seen and liked Steven Spielberg’s Schindler’s List and read and liked Thomas Keneally’s Schindler’s Ark, Imre Kertesz’s Fatelessness, Elie Wiesel’s Night, Victor Klemperer’s I Will Bear Witness and of course Anne Frank’s Diary of the Young Girl. That’s why the first part of this book did not shock me anymore. However, there are some parts here that were new to me like Frankl’s heavy interactions with the Gapos, co-inmates but they have leadership positions and also he, as a doctor, had a chance to escape from the Auschwitz concentration camp together with another doctor. This was the first time I heard that a prisoner could well, almost successfully escape the camp.The second part of the book is more on clinical analysis and theories about logotheraphy which Frankl pioneered. It is similar to psychotherapy but this one is more forward-looking. It is a type of existentialist analysis that focuses on a will to meaning as opposed to Adler’s Nietzchean doctrine of will to power or Freud’s will to pleasure. Rather than power or pleasure, logotherapy is founded upon the belief that it is the striving to find a meaning in one's life that is the primary, most powerful motivating and driving force in humans. (Source: Wikipedia). And this striving to find a meaning is the reason why we wake up each morning. Ikaw, para kanino ka bumabangon?"

It's really difficult not to find stories of the holocaust incredibly gripping, and the way in which Frankl speaks of his experience is inspiring and yet still maintains that gravity you'd expect from such a narrative.However, the latter half of the book delves much more into a psychological, and less personal, examination of 'logotherapy' (that is, the author's personal psychological theory). Once it became more of a text book with small sections reflecting on specific terms and theories, it was difficult to stay engaged. I also felt it lacked the cohesiveness that the first part of the book had with a more linear narrative structure.Nonetheless, the nuggets of wisdom I gleaned from this book were worth the reading. And I can only commend Frankl on his 'tragic optimism' in such a horrific environment as a Nazi concentration camp."
13,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3675162-j-l-sutton,4,"In Man's Search for Meaning, Victor Frankl begins his description of life in Nazi concentration camps (including Auschwitz) with the premise that life in the camps represents a provisional existence. In what must have seemed hopeless circumstances, is there any point in searching for meaning for one's life? Frankl does not dwell on the atrocities, but he does detail the mindset of his fellow prisoners facing what most of them knew was their death (as well as the death of their loved ones). Using his experiences as a guide, he outlines his ideas about logotherapy while finding reason to hold to a 'tragic optimism.' There are other essential books detailing life in concentration camps (I'm thinking especially of Primo Levi's Life in Auschwitz), but Frankl's is an important work which should be read by those who seek to understand how concentration camp prisoners faced their ordeal. "
14,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,5,"This is a fascinating book by a psychiatrist who survived the Holocaust. The first part, which I loved, is the author's story about how he endured the concentration camps. Frankl's purpose in describing his time in Auschwitz and other camps was not to dwell on the horrors -- though there were plenty of those -- but instead to focus on how prisoners found meaning in their lives and how they chose to survive. The book's foreword has a good summary of the ideas to come: ""Terrible as it was, his experience in Auschwitz reinforced what was already one of his key ideas: Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning. The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life. Frankl saw three possible sources for meaning: in work (doing something significant), in love (caring for another person), and in courage during difficult times. Suffering in and of itself is meaningless; we give suffering meaning by the way in which we respond to it."" I have read Elie Wiesel's Night and Art Spiegelman's Maus books, both of which provide searing images of the horrors of the camps, but Frankl's description of Auschwitz is noteworthy because he was able to view his ordeal philosophically. In the midst of hell on earth, he had the brilliant focus of a scholar who was trying to see beyond the present and into greater human truths. At spare moments in his work at doctoring sick patients in the camp, he would jot down ideas for a manuscript. And one night when prisoners were forced to march in the bitter cold, Frankl was wondering if his wife was still alive when he had a realization: ""A thought transfixed me: for the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth -- that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is through love and in love. I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved.""Frankl described the different attitudes of prisoners, and how some people gave up hope of living and they soon died. Those who focused on their reasons for living had a better chance of survival. ""We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.""The second part of the book focuses on Frankl's system of logotherapy, which is about finding someone's primary meaning in life, and this section is more difficult to read and seems to be geared toward graduate students in psychology.The 2006 edition that I read had a lovely afterword giving more details about Frankl's life and the impact of his work. One story was about a young Israeli soldier who had lost both his legs in battle and who was depressed and suicidal. Then the soldier became more serene after reading Man's Search for Meaning. ""When he was told about the soldier, Frankl wondered whether 'there may be such a thing as autobibliotherapy -- healing through reading.'"" (As someone who frequently finds comfort in books, I say yes, autobibliotherapy is real.)When Frankl's camp was finally liberated by the Red Cross in 1945, he moved to Vienna. He discovered that he was all alone -- his wife, parents and brother had all died in the camps. Frankl chose to resume his career as a psychiatrist, wrote several books and gave innumerable lectures. In one of his classes he was asked to express the meaning of his own life in one sentence. He wrote it down and asked his students to guess what had been written:""After some moments of quiet reflection, a student surprised Frankl by saying, 'The meaning of your life is to help others find the meaning of theirs.' ""'That was it exactly,' Frankl said. 'Those are the very words I had written.'""Note: Originally I gave this book 4 stars, having docked a star because of the denseness of the second part. But the first part of this book is so powerful and memorable that I've raised it back up to a 5."
15,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88967-ben,4,"Reading about the holocaust awakens me to the varying sides and degrees of human nature.""Life in a concentration camp tore open the human soul and exposed its depths. Is it surprising that in those depths we again found only human qualities which in there very nature were a mixture of good and evil? The rift dividing good from evil, which goes through all human beings, reaches into the lowest depths and becomes apparent even on the bottom of the abyss which is laid open by the concentration camp."" It is easier than we may think to get controlled by the barbaric aspects that exist within us. It’s almost incomprehensible that the holocaust took place in such recent history, at a time -- by relative, historic standards -- that contained comfortable living situations, educational access, and plenty of opportunity. Reading about the holocaust reminds me that we are simple and easily manipulated; that we can easily shut off our conscience and our ability to empathize, and do unimaginably horrible things to fellow, innocent, human beings. This is not a positive testament to human nature.""From all this we may learn that there are two races of men in this world, but only these two - the ""race"" of the decent man and the ""race"" of the indecent man. Both are found everywhere; they penetrate into all groups of society. No group consists entirely of decent or indecent people. In this sense, no group is of ""pure race"" - therefore one occasionally found a decent fellow among the camp guards.But then I see that goodness can still exist, even when one has every reason not to act on empathy; even when a simple, helpful act for another can threaten one's own life. Nazi's that showed compassion for prisoners were often killed, yet some men were brave and caring enough to help his fellow man. This gives me hope.Here's a specific story from the book that highlights this:""I remember how one day a foreman secretly gave me a piece of bread which I knew he must have saved from his breakfast ration. It was far more than the small piece of bread which moved me to tears at that time. It was the human ""something"" which this man also gave to me - the word and look which accompanied the gift.” This kind of act was not unusual for this specific SS commander, and was not forgotten by the prisoners, either. In fact, the kindness was returned: When Frankl’s camp was being liberated, 3 young Hungarian Jews hid this commander in the Bavarian woods as the other SS commanders were being gathered by U.S. troops. The 3 men would only give up the SS commander under the condition that no harm come to him. And, not only was he taken in unharmed, but he was later given the role of supervising the collection and distribution of clothing among the villages. Had this man not acted on compassion, he would have been caught and suffered a difficult fate. But sometimes -- no, not enough -- but sometimes, the good do win out. This is a positive testament to human nature.Frankl gives an honest, modest account of his holocaust experience. But he helped a lot of people make it through -- he gave people hope through his psychiatric knowledge, insights, and wisdom. Through the process he became a firm believer in logotherapy, which he explains in detail in the second half of the book.According to logotherapy, one must find meaning in life, and if one finds meaning, he or she can make it through anything. Or, as the Nietzsche quote (which Frankl was fond of), says, ""He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how."" In regards to logotherapy, Frankl states, ""It is one of the basic tenets of logotherapy that man's main concern is not to gain pleasure or to avoid pain but rather to see a meaning in his life. That is why man is even ready to suffer, on the condition, to be sure, that his suffering has a meaning."" Again and again those that had meaning were more likely to survive. Frankl was reminded of this at the start of every New Year, when the deaths in the camp drastically increased. According to Frankl, there was one main variable involved with this: loss of meaning. A number of prisoners kept themselves going by imagining themselves out of the camp in time for the holidays, which they hoped to spend with their loved ones. They pictured it in their minds and it kept them going through many grueling days. When the holidays came and went, they no longer had that image to strive for and were crushed. They gave up hope. They gave up meaning. They gave up life. Reading this book helped give me perspective into my own life, and insight into the power that exists within us all. While reading, I tried my best to fathom the great pain and suffering that those in camps went through, and I tried to understand how they endured it. Starvation, unrelenting work, freezing conditions in the winter, dehydration in the summer; and not just physical pain, but imagine watching neighbors, friends, and family members die. What happens to someone's mind, body, and heart as he or she goes through such drastic, painful, hopeless, and desperate situations? How does one continue to go on? What kind of strength does one tap into and where does it come from? It seems impossible, yet many people survived and went on to live enriching lives. Reading about, and gaining a grasp of this awesome power within us is inspiring: the capabilities of the human; the depths of our courage and perseverance. “We must never forget that we may also find meaning in life even when confronted with a hopeless situation, when facing a fate that cannot be changed. For what then matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one's predicament into a human achievement. When we are no longer able to change a situation - just think of an incurable disease such as inoperable cancer - we are challenged to change ourselves."" Human potential at its best, indeed. "

18,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45248887-greta-g,4,"Dr. Frankl didn't invent it, ""The Meaning of Life"". But he invented Logotherapy, that is based on it. The book consists of two parts. The first is a short autobiography of his time in the concentration camps, as he experienced it as a logotherapist. The second part of the book is an introduction to his therapeutic doctrine of Logotherapy. He added this chapter to his book because there was a great demand for it by readers. The second chapter therefore will only appeal to readers who want to know more about his therapy, and about mental health in general, or how he came to write his experiences in the camp the way he did. “ Logos is a Greek word which denotes “meaning.” Logotherapy, or, as it has been called by some authors, “The Third Viennese School of Psychotherapy,” focuses on the meaning of human existence as well as on man’s search for such a meaning. According to logotherapy, this striving to find a meaning in one’s life is the primary motivational force in man. ”According to his doctrine, the feeling of meaninglessness must be treated in assisting the patient to find meaning in his life :“By declaring that man is responsible and must actualize the potential meaning of his life, I wish to stress that the true meaning of life is to be discovered in the world rather than within man or his own psyche, as though it were a closed system. I have termed this constitutive characteristic “the self-transcendence of human existence.” It denotes the fact that being human always points, and is directed, to something, or someone, other than oneself—be it a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets himself—by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love—the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself.”“According to logotherapy, we can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.”It is his doctrine about the meaning of life that can be found in the attitude toward suffering, that Dr. Frankl applies to his experiences in the camp. Therefore, the first section of the book, is more a study of his experiences, based on this premise, rather than an autobiography. He observed the way how both he and others in Auschwitz coped (or didn’t) with the experience. To me, it's the ultimate testing of his doctrine, based on the universal search for a meaning in one's life. Can there really be found some good in an experience so abysmally bad ? Can there really be given a higher meaning to suffering, in order to survive the suffering ? This is what this book is all about. Dr. Frankl tries to explain how everyday life in a concentration camp was reflected in the mind of the average prisoner ; his book (first chapter) aims to be a psychology of a concentration camp. He describes three phases of the inmate’s mental reactions to camp life : the period following his admission ; the period when he is well entrenched in camp routine ; and the period following his release and liberation. The symptom that characterizes the first phase is shock and the 'delusion of reprieve'. The second phase is the phase of relative apathy, in which the inmate achieves a kind of emotional death. Apathy, the main symptom of the second phase, was a necessary mechanism of self-defense. It is in this part of the book, that Dr. Frankl implements his theories. He is convinced that ""the way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity—even under the most difficult circumstances—to add a deeper meaning to his life. It may remain brave, dignified and unselfish.“Any attempt at fighting the camp’s psychopathological influence on the prisoner by psychotherapeutic or psychohygienic methods had to aim at giving him inner strength by pointing out to him a future goal to which he could look forward. Instinctively some of the prisoners attempted to find one on their own. It is a peculiarity of man that he can only live by looking to the future—sub specie aeternitatis. And this is his salvation in the most difficult moments of his existence, although he sometimes has to force his mind to the task.”The last phase is the psychology of the prisoner who has been released. For most, it was a “disillusionment”, ""“there could be no earthly happiness which could compensate for all we had suffered.”This is definitely a book that make you think, about meaning in life in general, and about the meaning of suffering in particular. It helps to understand the experiences and the sufferings of the inmates, and above all their behaviors in response to these experiences, which for someone who has not been there, may seem inconceivable. To me, it was very useful to better understand the biographies of Holocaust survivors that I have read so far. Imre Kertèsz's nostalgic memories of camp's life after his release ; the importance of religion in the camp, as described by Eli Wiesel ; the strong will to survive by Olga Lengyel, in order to testify about what she and others endured ... And so much more. One thing that I missed in Dr. Frankl's psychology of the prisoner who has been released, was the feeling of guilt that he and not others had survived. Apparently, many survivors struggled with this guilt. I would have liked it to be handled in the book. I also think that the small part of prisoners who were able to find a higher meaning in their suffering, had been given some opportunity, by mere luck, to find a meaning. Dr. Frankl himself believed that his wife was still alive ; he was given the opportunity to work as a doctor in the camp, which he accepted, because :“ I knew that in a working party I would die in a short time. But if I had to die there might at least be some sense in my death. I thought that it would doubtless be more to the purpose to try and help my comrades as a doctor than to vegetate or finally lose my life as the unproductive laborer that I was then.”To me, the question arises, what he would have written if he hadn't had these circumstances which enabled him to see a meaning, a purpose in the suffering. For a great deal of the prisoners, who had been taken everything - their house and everything in it ; their family, friends and neighborhood - and who had to do unproductive labor in extremely harsh conditions every day, and who didn't met kindness but only cruelty, what was left to them to live for ? What meaning was there to be found in their world ? No therapy in the world could help these poor poor creatures, who were completely dehumanized. In reading this book you will ask yourself these kind of questions, and many others, which in itself is a great achievement by Dr. Frankl. For Dr. Frankl, writing his book probably also was a form of self-therapy to cope with his experiences, in finding a meaning in it. 7/10"

An abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is normal behavior.
Viktor Frankl, at the age of 39, was sent to a concentration camp to endure dehumanizing conditions while being used for slave labor. While there, he lost his brother, mother, and wife. Upon his release, he re-commenced developing and teaching his own brand of therapy: logotherapy. This book is a rather strange hybrid. In the first part, Frankl gives an overview of his time in the camps, paying special attention to the psychological repercussions of being so inhumanely treated. This leads to a general overview of his psychological theories, in part two, in which he argues that the search for meaning is of fundamental importance to the human psyche. I feel odd saying this, but the book left me feeling a bit cold. I found his descriptions of the concentration camp to be, however gruesome and depressing, somewhat detached in tone, which prevented me from being deeply affected. I do think he did a skillful job in conveying the day-to-day horrors of the experience; but the fact that this description is simply the foreground to a therapeutic theory somewhat detracts from its force, in my opinion. Maybe I only think this because I wasn’t too impressed with logotherapy, Frankl’s system of psychology. This therapeutic technique relies on helping patients to find a meaning in their lives. But I don’t think Frankl defines what “meaning” is very well, nor does he give much practical advice in the way of finding it. The theory all just seemed like a bunch of vague talk to me. I couldn’t see any usefulness or theoretical insight in Frankl’s system. I found it to be little more than a collection of platitudes.  Perhaps I am unimpressed because we have already absorbed much of this existentialist-tinged psychotherapy into our culture? Perhaps my lack of excitement is a sign of this book’s enormous influence? I can’t say. But if you're curious, I recommend you read the book. It is short enough to be read in a day, and yet packs an impressive amount of narration and thought into its pages. "
20,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3604115-david-lentz,5,"I followed Viktor Frankl diligently in his journey from the gas ovens of Auschwitz into the hospitals of Vienna after he beats the 1 in 20 odds of his surviving a German concentration camp. He writes that the single most important self-determinant in his survival was his deep inherent conviction under the worst of all possible conditions that life has meaning: even here under constant risk of typhus, wearing the recycled prison garb of those who had been sacrificed to the ovens, starving, freezing, beaten, demonized and dehumanized. If one can still find meaning here and survive because of it, then under better conditions meaning should be possible to find. Frankl believes that there are three sources of meaning: 1) one's work 2) other people whom you love 3) rising with dignity and integrity from a hopelessly tragic diminishment. He found that in the camps the survivors had a positive attitude, which reinforced their search for meaning and gave them hope in a hopeless situation. In Vienna hospitals he debunked theories of Freud and Adler with ""logotherapy"" which helps others to find the meaning in their lives and heal from thoughts of suicide, psychoses and neurotic behavior. ""Logos"" is Greek for ""meaning"" and if you can find it in your own life, then essentially it seems you are as invincible as Frankl, who not only survived Auschwitz but also lived into his 90's, is the living proof of his own thesis. Ultimately, when asked what was the meaning of his life, he wrote that the meaning of his life was to help other people find the meaning in their lives. He is an existentialist but he has a positive outlook on life unlike, for example, Camus or Sartre or the usual champions of this dark philosophy, which sprang out of the widespread, bombed-out wreckage of WWII. He writes that the Nazis proved what man was capable of and Hiroshima proved how high the stakes are. So the search for meaning is important therapy not only as it heals individuals but also because it has a healing and uplifting effect upon humanity as a whole and may well be one approach to saving the human race from its own self-destruction. Frankl had a visa and train ticket out of Vienna before the Nazis rose into power but decided to stay there to help his aging parents who had no such respite. Like Frankl, his pregnant wife and parents were taken to the camps and on the first day after he came home to Vienna he learned that all three had been lost there. He wrote ""The Search for Meaning"" in only nine days and described how his positive attitude and search for meaning enabled him to survive. He describes how this process of autobiography helped him to begin his own healing, a term which he describes as ""autobibliotherapy."" By virtue of writing down one's findings in the search for meaning, one serves to find meaning in one's own life and to help others find it in their lives. He prescribes no formulas and believes that every individual must find his or her own meaning in life despite diminishments and suffering and death which accompany every life. With incredible, calm clarity he writes that for everyone ""suffering and death are necessary to complete life."" He believes that suffering clarifies the meaning of life and, while he doesn't believe we need to bring it upon ourselves, the average life generally provides sufficient circumstances for us to know that suffering is an inevitable aspect of life. So why not learn from it? As Nietzsche wrote: ""Suffering is the origin of consciousness."" He is not advising us to bring it upon ourselves as a form of sadomasochism but to rise above it with heroic integrity and see it as an opportunity to learn from it. He believes that such life lessons ultimately hold the keys for understanding and overcoming the diminishments of life itself. He writes that man always has a choice of action in reacting to the circumstances no matter how dire they may be. So it seems that readers, when they read great books, are searching for meaning and this search has healing powers for them. Further, it seems that when writers search for meaning in creating their work, they have an opportunity to experience the same healing benefits of autobibliotherapy. So keep reading and writing the good stuff for all the good it can do to you and by all means, read this brief, brilliant book by an Auschwitz survivor as it has life altering implications for you: this book will change your outlook on life and may well, thereby, save it through mastery of the art of living."
21,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"I’ve been meaning to read this for a very long time, but have to admit that the idea of reading a book by someone who survived the Holocaust with long descriptions of that part of their life included with graphic detail didn’t really make me want to jump at the chance. And this book is harrowing – particularly the first half or so – the pain is infinite. I was also keen to find out what he felt he learnt from this experience about how to live a good life. I have to say that I found this part of the book quite unsatisfying. His discussion of ‘logotherapy’ left me cold, I’m afraid. I don’t really like books that say things that amount to – this guy came to see me about some problem that had plagued his life for decades, I said three sentences to him and he went away with a skip and a spring in his step. There are bits of this that are worthwhile – you know, suffering isn’t an ‘and also’ in life, but often learning how to live with (rather than overcome) suffering is our key task. Yes, I think the Buddha said something similar. That life is better with a meaning is also hardly novel either, although, I guess not something the Buddha said, so much. Psychology is a subject that inevitably stresses the position of the individual, and the psychology of a man who has lived through an experience where those with power held his life in utter contempt and enjoyed making it clear to him that his ongoing existence was completely at their discretion would hardly encourage him to seek meaning in ‘grand projects’ and such. But I don’t really like psychology and worry it gazes wistfully down the wrong end of the telescope. I feel awful writing this review, by the way. It feels disrespectful to criticise a book written by someone who lived through something so utterly unimaginable and disgusting. But this is a book providing advice on how one should live one’s life – and even though people tend to think that having lived through the unspeakable is qualification enough to write such a book, I find I can’t really agree. As he makes too clear, sometimes we can look into the abyss and learn nothing from it at all. What he has learnt is better than what some of his fellow prisoners learnt, but if anything this book should be a reminder that someone forced to live through the banality of evil isn’t really under obligations to learn cuddly and life-affirming lessons from that experience. All to the good if that is what you do learn – but it does seem to compound the punishment of such an experience if such ‘lessons’ become mandatory. "

By his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he see that which is potential in him, which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized. Furthermore, by his love, the loving person enables the beloved person to actualize these potentialities. By making him aware of what he can be and of what he should become, he makes these potentialities come true."""
23,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma,4,"In the film Ikiru (""To Live""), master filmmaker Akira Kurosawa tells the story of Kanji Watanabe, a Japanese bureaucrat with stomach cancer. Finding that he has only one year left to live, he initially slides into depression and then into riotous night-life. All that is changed, however, when he meets Toyo, a young girl who takes pleasure in making toys for young children - it gives her a purpose in life. This wakes Watanabe up to what he is missing in his life: and he makes it his purpose to build a playground in the city, cutting across all the bureaucratic tangles. The most haunting image in the movie is of him sitting on a swing in the playground, singing, immediately prior to his death.I was thinking of this movie all the time I was reading this book.-----------------------------------I had heard a lot about it before I actually got around to reading it - and to tell the truth, I was a bit underwhelmed, especially by the second part. Yet I will give it four stars, because I think Viktor Frankl has astutely identified the main reason for existential angst - the lack of meaning in one's life in modern times.It seems that Dr. Frankl has been engaged in what he calls ""logotherapy"", where the patient is asked to concentrate outward rather than inward. As opposed to Freud who wanted people to dig deep into their psyches to locate childhood neuroses, Frankl asks them look into the world they live in to find the root of their existential crisis. The root of his philosophy is that most of man’s existential crisis rises from a search for meaning in life. In this, it is opposed to two other famous theories from the Viennese school of psychotherapy – Freud’s, based on the quest for pleasure and Adler’s based on the quest for power.Frankl has his gruelling experiences in Nazi concentration camps to prove his theory. This comprises more than half of the book, and is really a torture to get through – not because of bad writing, but because he convinces us to accompany him on that nightmare journey. There is no hope, no mercy and no shred of human dignity in these hells on earth. The inmates are stripped of all their possessions including clothes, underfed to the level of starvation and overworked to the extent that many fall down dead from sheer exhaustion. Apart from this, they live in constant fear of being selected for the gas chambers.What happens to people in this situation? They lose hope, and many of them give up on life. Others become cruel exploiters themselves (the Capos, the guards who are chosen from the ranks of prisoners themselves). Some try to survive by being smarter than others: and yet others find that extra something to pull them through – a meaning for their suffering, something to look forward to in life even in the midst endless misery. They become the rare beacons of light in the pitch darkness. Most of them don’t survive, because of their altruism – as Dr. Frankl says, “the best of us didn’t come back”.The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity—even under the most difficult circumstances—to add a deeper meaning to his life. It may remain brave, dignified and unselfish. Or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal.For Frankl, it was the image of his young wife and his love for her which suddenly gave him a purpose in life.A thought transfixed me: for the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth—that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is through love and in love.He kept on having conversations with her in his mind; even though he knew that she may be dead (she was, in fact). This gave him conviction to go ahead even when death stared him in the face. Dr. Frankl genuinely believes that it is this which helped carry him through, and on the whole, I find myself agreeing with him.Such a purpose does not necessarily mean salvation – but it does give one the power to endure it until it all ends. Viktor Frankl tells us the story of a young woman, whose vision of a tree branch through the window of the hut in which she lay dying, gave her sustenance. This young woman knew that she would die in the next few days. But when I talked to her she was cheerful in spite of this knowledge. “I am grateful that fate has hit me so hard,” she told me. “In my former life I was spoiled and did not take spiritual accomplishments seriously.” Pointing through the window of the hut, she said, “This tree here is the only friend I have in my loneliness.” Through that window she could see just one branch of a chestnut tree, and on the branch were two blossoms. “I often talk to this tree,” she said to me. I was startled and didn’t quite know how to take her words. Was she delirious? Did she have occasional hallucinations? Anxiously I asked her if the tree replied. “Yes.” What did it say to her? She answered, “It said to me, ‘I am here—I am here—I am life, eternal life.’”-----------------------------------One curious fact I noticed was that Frankl’s concept of ‘self-transcendence’, which seemed remarkably close to Joseph Campbell’s concept of the ‘Hero’s Journey’. Also, the three paths which he mentions - through achievement, through selfless love and through cathartic suffering (when unavoidable, not masochistically cjosen) – are applicable to the godhead from three different religions. The path of achievement of the Greek hero: selfless love to the level of dissolution of one’s self in god, that of Radha and Mira Bai for Krishna: and the suffering which cleanses, the way of the cross, the passion of Jesus Christ."
24,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,5,"While reading Man's Search for Meaning, I could not stop thinking: why can't I be a psychologist now? By the time I reached page 103, I wanted to highlight passage after passage, or at least add them to my favorite quotes on Goodreads to preserve their impact forever.Frankl divides his inspiring book into two parts. The first describes his experience living in Nazi death camps and how he dealt with the doom and decay that always surrounded him. He laces his story with astute, dispassionate observations about his emotions and the suffering of those around him. The second section explores a type of therapy that arose from his time in the death camps: logotherapy. Logotherapy focuses on helping people find meaning in their lives, to give them a greater sense of purpose and to push them past the obstacles they face. He writes that people can discover meaning in three different ways: 1) by creating a work or doing a deed, 2) by experiencing something or encountering someone, and 3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering (this last option is only meaningful when the first two are unavailable).Overall, I would recommend this book to those interested in psychology, or those who want to read an inspiring tale by someone who survived the Nazi death camps and used his experience to transcend himself. Frankl veers into the spiritual side in the second portion of the book, which might perturb a few people, but for the most part he keeps his ideas open to everyone. For the rest of the review I'm just going to write down all of the book because it was so good a few of the quotes about logotherapy that stood out to me, so I can reference them later on. Feel free to read or skip.(about man and meaning) ""As each situation in life represents a challenge to man and presents a problem for him to solve, the question of the meaning of life may actually be reversed. Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by becoming responsible. Thus, logotherapy sees in responsibleness the very essence of human existence.""(about transcending the self) ""By declaring that man is responsible and must actualize the potential meaning of his life, I wish to stress that the true meaning of life is to be discovered in the world rather than within man or his own psyche, as though it were a closed system. I have termed this constitutive characteristic 'the self-transcendence of human existence.' It denotes the fact that being human always points, and is directed, to something or someone, other than oneself - be it a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets himself - by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love - the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself. What is self-actualization is not an attainable aim at all, for the simple reason that the more one would strive for it, the more he would miss it. In other words, self-actualization is possible only as a side-effect of self-transcendence.""(about how we mistakenly use money and sex to replicate meaning) ""Moreover, there are various masks and guises under which the existential vacuum appears. Sometimes the frustrated will to meaning is vicariously compensated for by a will to power, including the most primitive form of the will to power, the will to money. In other cases, the place of frustrated will is meaning is taken by the will to pleasure. That is why existential frustration often eventuates in sexual compensation. We can observe in such cases that the sexual libido becomes rampant in the existential vacuum.""Of course I would love to include a few more passages, but I want to avoid writing down the entire book. Perhaps I will purchase a copy, then."

Stresses the meaning of life, shows people how to overcome challenges and suffering in life, urges human beings to find their questions. I was going through a dark time while reading it.

27,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34207574-miquel-reina,5,"I started reading ""Man's Search for Meaning"" thanks to a recommendation that appear on another book called 30 Days- Change your habits, Change your life: A couple of simple steps every day to create the life you want. Despite being one of the most influential books of the twentieth century, I had never heard about it but after reading the first pages, I quickly understood the reason for its fame. Man's Search for Meaning isn't a common story, is a true story. A collage of experiences, thoughts, and theories of a psychologist who survived in one of Nazi concentration camps. Although there are hundreds of books about the Holocaust, this story is really different; it isn't a dramatized story but a lucid and almost impartial story filtered through the eyes of psychology and neurology. It might seem a dark and miserable book but on the contrary, it's more a flame in the darkness that bright strong, a song of hope and strength. I recommend this book to all readers, without exception, I think it's a book that everyone should read and re-read to understand the true meaning of our lives.Spanish version:Empecé a leer ""El hombre en busca de sentido"" gracias a la recomendación del libro ""30 días"". Pese a ser uno de los libros más influyentes del sigo XX nunca había oído a hablar de él pero al empezar a avanzar a través de sus páginas rápidamente entendí el porqué de su fama. El hombre en busca de sentido no se trata de un relato común, sino más bien una agrupación de vivencias, reflexiones y teorías de un psicólogo superviviente de la masacre de los campos de concentración nazi. Pese a que hay cientos de libros que tratan el tema del holocausto, este relato es francamente diferente, no dramatiza en las situaciones penosas sino más bien las desgrana, las analiza y las filtra a través de los ojos de la psicología y la neurología. Lo más brillante del libro es la esperanza y las enseñanzas que hay en él, podría parecer un libro oscuro y miserable pero es todo lo contrario, es una llama en medio de la oscuridad, un canto al crecimiento interior y a la fortaleza de espíritu. Creo que no puedo evitar recomendar este libro a todos los lectores, sin excepción del género literario que os guste, es uno de esos libros que todos deberíamos leer y releer para comprender el verdadero significado de nuestras vidas."
28,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,4,"“A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life. He knows the ""why"" for his existence, and will be able to bear almost any 'how'.”  - Viktor E FranklI read an interesting article in the NYTimes a couple weeks ago that lead me to finally pick this book up. Actually, a couple good articles. The first was titled 'Love People, Not Pleasure' and it was about how ""this search for fame, the lust for material things and the objectification of others — that is, the cycle of grasping and craving — follows a formula that is elegant, simple and deadly: Love things, use people."" The author uses an inversion of this formula that DOES lead to happiness: Use things, Love People (also quoted by Spencer W. Kimball). This article + another recent one from the Atlantic titled 'There's More to Life Than Being Happy' made it clearly evident to me that I needed to finally dust off my yellowed, Goodwill copy of Man's Search for Meaning, plug in my earbuds and experience this book that the Universe clearly wanted me to read this week.  So, imagine a renowned Jewish therapist writes in 1946 (in 9 days) about his experiences at and survival in Auschwitz, and then adds his own psychotherapeutic method (Logotherapy), finding happiness by finding a meaning, a responsibility, a love, and ultimately self-determining. Perhaps it is a consequence of Frankl's work surrounding me in other writings, in popular psychotherapy, in various internet Memes and articles OR perhaps it is just a consequence of my own resilience to my own suffering that this book wasn't much of a revelation. I was like ... yup, makes a lot of sense. Good job. I think it is a great book for what it is. I just don't always get super-excited by self-help psychology books. This one is on the better end of the bell curve for this type, but I guess my problem is with the type. Other than that (minus 1-star for my type bias) it was a great book."

Like end?!I was so enjoying the concepts and the writing.Loved the later half of the book more. Actually O should not compare as it is almost like the author is trying to present those days at concentration camps in the first part and in the second part, how his concept of logotherapy/various mental disorders/physiological health issues should be dealt with.This book is so informative and insightful from a very practical point of view, historically relevant and quite helpful from a medical point of view.It helps that the author is from the said field and he just wrote everything important in such a concise manner that you just cannot afford to skip a word.I have less information about concentration camps or the history behind it. But yes, this book is like 80 percent more than that.This is not a story of survival or a description of how the author suffered during those days. Of course, suffering was there. And oh, how the author described suffering in a new light attached to the meaning of life!I really loved the writing.This book is going to help me in both my personal as well as my profession.This book will remain next to me. If I were to annotate this book, I would have to just highlight each and every sentence of part two of the book.I will definitely reread this book. Because life's meaning isn't constant. And yes, I need that motivation and life's understanding as discussed in this short book.Amazing!*There's so much more to this book regarding the camp inmates; discussion on the psychology of prisoners; it not only handles about life issues on just all the issues mentioned before but also about life in general - family and various human needs and emotions.*Love the parts where he talked about his wife. Loved it so much!Thanks to my Instagram buddies who recommended this book at one of my recent posts.Definitely loving taking recommendations ❤️"

Now, when I find myself searching for meaning in the universe, I call off the search and get to the business of creating it, thanks in large part to this powerful little book."
34,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"This book is split into two parts. The content, style and purpose of each are not the same. The first part I liked a lot, the second I found OK. Depending upon what you are looking for, your preference may may differ from mine. I will describe both parts, in the hope that you can determine if you wish to read the first, the second or both parts of the book.The first part speaks of that which Viktor E. Frankl (1905-1997) learned from his own experiences as prisoner of four Nazi concentration camps during the Second World War—Auschwitz, Dachau, Theresienstadt and Turheim. What is offered is not a day by day account of his experiences but rather a description of “…everyday life in a concentration camp reflected in the mind of an average prisoner.” He speaks of the shock on arrival, the apathy that arises as time passes and finally the psychological reaction of prisoners after liberation. The psychological patterns of behavior are distinct. Frankl was Austrian by birth and a neurologist and psychiatrist before entering the camps. He dispassionately relates what he saw and the subsequent psychological conclusions he drew. The book was first published in 1946, thus very soon after the war. This, the first section, is very good because of its simple honesty, clarity and dispassionate presentation. Here is how the most ordinary prisoners behaved and reacted to the camps. He looks at the behavior of kapos too, i.e. the prisoners in Nazi concentration camps who were assigned by the SS guards to carry out administrative tasks. They had more power and cannot be viewed as ordinary prisoners.Frankl points out that there are two types of people, those who are decent and those who are not. Both types are found to exist in all groupings of people. One’s rank, religion or creed is insignificant in determining an individual’s decency. The first section is riveting. It is clear and well formulated. It underlines the need for an individual to feel there is a meaning to one’s life, even in the direst of situations. The importance of hope is paramount.Frankl goes deeper and deeper into an explanation of the particular form of existential psychology he propones--logotherapy. Logo is based on the Greek word logos, which means to strive to find a meaning in one’s life. It is one type of existential analysis, a form of humanistic psychology. Spinoza and Nietzsche and other famed existential philosophers are quoted, as is Thomas Mann too.It is not necessary to read the second part to understand Frankl's philosophy or how he treated patients.The second part of the book is entitled Logotherapy in a Nutshell. This section has been rewritten, if I remember correctly, sometime in the 1980s. It focuses on the theory of logotherapy—as a science and as a medical treatment. It begins at a simple level, explaining how logotherapy differs from Adlerian and Freudian theories of analysis. These three different psychological theories’ focus respectively on the search for the meaning of life, the search for power and the search for pleasure. Then Frankl goes into more and more detail, specifying the terminology of his theory. If you are looking for an in-depth, very specific and detailed explanation of logotherapy you will be pleased. I instead became confused by the excessive redefinition of terms. He takes an idea, a concept that is simple to understand at the start, gives it a new name and then using all these complicated, newly defined names for simple ideas, propones the principles of logotherapy. He is selling his way of thinking, his point of view; this annoyed me too. This section becomes more and more convoluted as one proceeds.A controversy has arisen both about the author and his books, the result being that none of his works are sold in the bookstore of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. None of this is discussed in the book. It can be read about in the second paragraph here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_...Simon Vance narrates the audiobook. The first section he reads very well. The speed is perfect, and he reads in a tone that matches the subject’s seriousness, neither exaggerating nor minimizing the text’s content. I would have preferred that he read the second part more slowly; many logotherapeutical terms are employed, and those not previously acquainted with the terminology of this science need more time to absorb what is said. With four stars for the narration of the first half and two stars for the second, I have given the narration three stars, just as I have for the book’s content.I have read Man's Search for Meaning because Edith Eger, the author of The Choice: Embrace the Possible, which I gave five stars, built her own theory of psychology and psychiatric treatment on Viktor E. Frankl’s ideas."
35,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350218-booklady,5,"Throughout history humanity has always been in search of purpose and meaning to our existence on this earth. One of the oldest jokes in the world is the young person asking the ancient one, “What is the meaning of life?” and receiving some sort of reply like, “If you find out, you let me know, okay?!”Viktor Frankl’s classic work was originally published in 1946. I own a 1984 paperback edition of the book which had already been through seventy-three editions in English alone, not to mention nineteen other languages. I mention this because all other facts I quote will come from my copy of the book, unless stated otherwise; for more recent information, the reader is encouraged to look up Dr. Frankl and this seminal work in psychiatry on-line and see all the further developments which have occurred in subsequent years. It is truly staggering the influence this book has had.The first half of the book is devoted to the good doctor’s life-transforming experiences as a ‘guest’ in a Nazi concentration camp. Perhaps I should not jest—even lightly—about such a serious matter and yet I suspect our author would not mind. He was a man of incredible insight and wisdom. Humor was a resource he well-appreciated; encouraging his patients to use it as a part of therapy.Prior to this I had never read past the first half of the book; I was only interested in the autobiographical portion of the book. As I have mentioned in previous posts, a surfeit of psychology books in college, both undergraduate and graduate level, left me with no taste for further reading on the subject. More is the pity because Dr. Frankl’s book is as much philosophy and religion as it is dry scientific studies and theories on human behavior patterns. His extraordinary experiences coupled with a brilliant mind would not allow his thinking to be pigeon-holed as many contemporary books on the subject seem to be.Without further rhetoric on my part, here are some of my favorite parts and quotes from Man’s Search For Meaning:‘I think it was Lessing who once said, “There are things which must cause you to lose your reason or you have none to lose.” An abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is normal behavior.’ (p32)‘Strangely enough, a blow which does not even find its mark can, under certain circumstances, hurt more than one that finds its mark.’ (p36)‘Some men lost all hope, but it was the incorrigible optimists who were the most irritating companions.’ (p46)‘In spite of all the enforced physical and mental primitiveness of the life in the concentration camp, it was possible for a rich spiritual life to deepen. Sensitive people who were used to a rich intellectual life may have suffered much pain (they were often of a delicate constitution), but the damage to their inner selves was less. They were able to retreat from their terrible surroundings to a life of inner riches and spiritual freedom. Only in this way can one explain the apparent paradox that some prisoners of a less hardy make-up often seemed to survive camp life better than did those of a more robust nature.’ (p47)‘I understood how a man who has nothing left in the world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved. In a position of utter desolation, when man cannot express himself in positive action, when his only achievement may consist in enduring his sufferings in the right way—an honorable way—in such a position a man can, through loving contemplation of the image he carries of his beloved, achieve fulfillment.’ (p49)(Dr. Frankl lost his entire family to the gas chambers. In the above quote, he is describing how he used the image of his wife—already dead, although he did not know it—to inspire, uplift and keep him alive through the long days of his captivity.)‘To draw an analogy: a man’s suffering is similar to the behavior of a gas . . . Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore the “size” of the human suffering is absolutely relative.’ (p55)‘Does this not bring to mind the story of Death in Teheran? A rich and mighty Persian once walked in his garden with one of his servants. The servant cried that he had just encountered Death who threatened him. He begged his master to give him the fastest horse so he could make haste and flee to Teheran, which he could reach that same evening. The master consented and the servant galloped off on the horse. On returning to his house the master himself met Death, and questioned him, “Why did you terrify and threaten my servant?” “I did not threaten him; I only showed surprise in still finding him here when I planned to meet him tonight in Teheran,” said Death.’‘Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.’ (p75)‘If there is meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death.’¹ (p76)‘(What you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you.) Not only our experiences, but all we have done, whatever great thoughts we may have had, and all we have suffered, all this is not lost, though it is past; we have brought it into being. Having been is also a kind of being, and perhaps the surest kind.’ (p90)‘A man’s concern, even his despair, over the worthwhileness of life is an existential distress but by no means a mental disease. (His) suffering may well be a human achievement, especially if the suffering grows out of existential frustration. . . . Logotherapy regards its assignment as that of assisting the patient to find meaning in his life.’ (p108)One of the most interesting treatment techniques which Dr. Frankl offers his patients is something he calls “paradoxical intention” based on, ‘the twofold fact that fear brings about that which one is afraid of, and that hyper-intention makes impossible what one wishes.’ (p126) He goes on to describe a man he cured of profuse sweating by instructing the man to imagine increasing his output of sweat under stressful situations.While our author believes in responsibility for one’s actions (he advocates a Statue of Responsibility on the West Coast) he also believes in every person’s free will to determine their own future at all times. He cites a case of a well-known Nazi mass-murderer who made a stunning turn-around later in life; he has no sympathy for pre-determinism. ‘How can we dare to predict the behavior of man?’ (p134)Whether we are aware of it or not and regardless of our willingness to admit to it, we all have agendas in our reading. For myself, in the past I was often unaware and/or dishonest about my own reasons for selecting this or that book. However, what I find most enlightening now is when I begin a book for one purpose and finish it for quite another.In the case of Man’s Search For Meaning I began the book in search of arguments to refute George Orwell’s conclusion of the novel 1984 and finished this present work in total fascination with Logotherapy and its associated theories and treatments.Dec 21, 2017: Edited for errors"
36,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96868145-sandeep,3,"The book is divided in two parts; the first being a personal account of Viktor Frankl's experiences of being a prisoner and doctor in a concentration camp during WWII, and the second being an introduction into the main principles of logotherapy.Don't be fooled by the length of the book and mistake it for a one-sitting read, rather I found this to be the type of book that needs to be digested in small chunks. The first part of the book was excellent (and my favorite), although it was very chilling to read as Frankl describes the horrors that went on in Auschwitz. It gets overwhelming at times and you need to put it down and take a breather. This book was a lot more philosophical than I had expected and I believe it would require me a reread or two to full grasp and comprehend it. The reason I gave this book two stars is primarily because I struggled to want to read it. In my rating system, all books start out at three stars and either gain or lose stars based on my interest level and engagement in the book. I think it is wrong to rate someone's personal experiences, and therefore my rating does not in any way invalidate Frankl's experiences that he wrote about; it is merely a reflection of my personal interest while reading his book. I do want to say, though, that I think this was a meaningful and powerful book that many will benefit from.The book is literally filled with them and here are some of my favorite quotes from the book :
“When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.”“But there was no need to be ashamed of tears, for tears bore witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer.”“An abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is normal behavior.”“No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same.”“Suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore the ‘size’ of human suffering is absolutely relative.”

37,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22409011-brendan-monroe,2,"This is the kind of book that demands a five-star review. The thing is called ""Man's Search for Meaning"" for crying out loud. And it's written by a guy who survived four Nazi concentration camps. FOUR! What kind of philistine would give this anything less than five stars or, at the very least, four? Ahem, well, this does indeed put me in an uncomfortable spot. I didn't read Viktor Frankl's book with the intention of only giving it two stars, I promise. I would have loved to have given it five. In fact, if we're being honest with ourselves, I think we all know that this book has accumulated plenty of five star reviews it didn't deserve simply due to the trials of its author and because we like the fact that a survivor of infamous Nazi camps like Auschwitz and Dachau comes off as a surprisingly cheerful fellow. While I greatly admire the author and the optimism which clearly played a part in keeping him alive, I also can't help but find his book a rehashing of things that I thought were already pretty well-established.People need to feel some sense of meaning in order not to get depressed? The unemployed and those on welfare are more likely to view themselves as relatively insignificant and their actions as meaningless? Giving yourself some purpose helps you get through the day? I couldn't agree more. But didn't we all know that already?Perhaps these things are widely understood today because of the influence Viktor Frankl's book has had, but the reality is that Frankl was far from the first to suggest that one's meaning serves as a primary motivating factor. At times, Frankl comes off as disingenuous or even just plain wrong. Nihilism, he tells us, is dangerous, and bound to lead to despair and suicide. If a person is religious, we have a duty to use their religion to instill in them a sense of meaning and importance. In short, we must use whatever means are necessary to give people hope.But why? Frankl seems to think that the worst possible outcome for a human being is the desire to end their life, or the realization that they themselves really don't matter much in the overall scheme of things. At such times, Frankl seems to be espousing the gospel of ignorance. Lie to people, deceive them, do whatever is necessary to make them think that they matter.Surely suicide hotlines employ the same tactics. And I am all for potential suicides reading this book. This book changed your life? Great.Frankl misses no opportunity to attack Freud and his philosophy that the search for pleasure is humanity's ultimate drive. Frankl posits that it is meaning, not pleasure, that drives us. I think Dr. Frankl's own life experience proves the opposite. We're clearly living in a world that sees people largely driven not by meaning, but by an attempt to achieve pleasure for themselves. And that's a pity. I wish I lived in Dr. Frankl's world. It must be lovely. But such a world would never have allowed for the concentration camps to begin with.But the world Frankl describes is also rather at odds with the optimism he's selling. Is it really as bright and cheerful as it seems?Frankl at times comes off as Mother Theresa once did, as buying into the rather absurd idea that there is something noble and good in suffering. Frankl looks at the concentration camps and points to examples of goodness there. There's even room for a good Nazi or two. I couldn't help at this point but recall Ruth Klüger who wrote in her ""Still Alive: A Holocaust Girlhood Remembered"" of an encounter with some German advanced PhD candidates.""One reports how in Jerusalem he made the acquaintance of an old Hungarian Jew who was a survivor of Auschwitz, and yet this man cursed the Arabs and held them all in contempt. How can someone who comes from Auschwitz talk like that? the German asks. I get into the act and argue, perhaps more hotly than need be. What did he expect? Auschwitz was no instructional institution ... You learned nothing there, and least of all humanity and tolerance. Absolutely nothing good came out of the concentration camps, I hear myself saying, with my voice rising, and he expects catharsis, purgation, the sort of thing you go to the theatre for? They were the most useless, pointless establishments imaginable.""Nothing good came out of the concentration camps? It seems that Frankl couldn't disagree more. On nearly every other page he is hailing the suffering of its victims. If one follows his thesis through, Frankl in fact seems to be arguing that the concentration camps did its victims a favor. It allowed them to suffer, nobly, and to gain some sense of their own meaning.It's nice to think so. I myself wanted to get carried away in this bubble of naively optimistic thinking, but if one thinks too hard about it the bubble bursts. When Frankl says that meaning is of the utmost importance, akin to the highest good, his examples seem to betray that meaning for him is synonymous with the will to survive. Death, the realization of one's own insignificance, is the greatest evil. It's the same Catholic, Teresian doctrine that hails the value of suffering over the comfort that death may offer. Frankl would, I am sure, argue that euthanasia is never permissible. He even cites a rather macabre example of a suffering invalid who holds onto life because, against science and all odds, he just might recover. To fuel this man's ignorance, and the ignorance of others like him, Frankl cites the fact that he himself managed to survive the concentration camps despite all the odds. While there is much in ""Man's Search for Meaning"" that I agree with, Frankl's essential doctrine believes a life of pain and hardship to be greater, more honorable, and, for sure, more moral than one lived in pursuit of pleasure.But is such a life worth living?"

40,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6132231-owlseyes,4,"NEW EDITION: June 28th 2013. Today (in fact, it’s the second time) I read/watch this wonderful story about V. Frankl. So, maybe it’s MEANINFUL, and it’s better to tell about. My source, I won’t disclose on. Let’s say that in the nineteen eighties V. Frankl was donating for a Jewish Chassidic group in Austria. Why? Some may wonder. History first.Before publishing “Man's Search for Meaning ” Viktor Frankl had some success in his lectures in Vienna. Nevertheless, he went through a very rough period because some thought his ideas were ridicule. He felt crushed. Frankl had his immigration papers ready to leave Vienna… to Australia. It happens that by that time he received the visit of a lady in his home: Marguerite Chajes. She had a message from Rabbi Schneerson, of Brooklyn, New York. Basically the message said in German: keep on in your work: “you’ll have a breakthrough” . It’s said that Frankl “broke out in bitter tears”….and decided to stay in Austria. Success came.When Frankl was in his nineties, he received a phone call from Rabbi Yaakov Biderman. Frankl was impatient; but when he heard the Rebbe's name (SCHNEERSON), he immediately changed his mood: he became patient…and said:”I OWE HIM A GREAT DEAL…I RESPECT THE REBBE GREATLY, HE HELPED ME IN A VERY CRITICAL MOMENT”. 

 I’ve been recently struck by this oratory piece by David F. Wallace*; a commencement speech given at Kenyon College. In it, he differentiated two very different attitudes towards life, two ways on how we can derive MEANING: (1) the “default setting” one, the unconscious automatic way,… the worship of power, money or beauty; and (2) the aware way: finding, deep down, love and the mystical union of all things.Why this digressing from Frankl’s? Because they both agree, in some way, I think. Frankl’s book is about explaining this view: that life is about a search for MEANING; not a search for pleasure (Freud) or power (Adler). Frankl proves his main assertion with his own life experience in the concentration camp of Auschwitz. How could he possibly have survived? How was it possible? Why other prisoners died,… giving up on hope? 

 Frankl wrote that what kept him alive was the hope for reunion with his wife and the dream of teaching about his experience. Only the devotion to a superior cause (superior to us), or love, can lead to success and happiness. So the writing is very useful for desperate people. It was written in 1945, on nine consecutive days, and anonymously published, initially. The book opens with a preface by Rabbi Kushner: “this is a book about survival, like in Zachariah 3:2”**; a “deeply religious” book.The 1962 edition preface was penned by psychologist Gordon Allport.Viktor Frankl wrote the 1992 preface. He had had an invitation to go to the US. He had a dilemma: to leave parents or to stay with them. Then he saw the marble stone with a Hebrew letter. Father explained it was a relic from Vienna’s biggest synagogue, destroyed by the Nazis. The piece was about a commandment: honor your father and mother…; so he chose to stay in Austria; and let his visa expire.Logotherapy is about that “démarche”: finding/discovering MEANING. “Outside forces cannot take our FREEDOM to choose how we respond to a certain situation”.

Frank, Man's Search for Meaning🌼Based on psychiatrist's Viktor Frankl description of his life in a Nazi death camp, the book narrates the psyche of a prisoner struck between life and death and how the idea of survival changes in dire situations.🌼The author argues that we can be caught in a life that we didn't choose, that brings us suffering every single day, that things can turn grim any day, but how we choose to cope with it depends on us. 🌼How we find meaning in a life we feel is not worth living, is entirely on us and rather than underestimating the will power of the human soul, one can always attempt to find light in adversity. Sure the meaning and values will change but life will still be life and it is not something to give up on.🌼What makes the book impactful is the author's real-life experiences of living in a concentration camp, of being surrounded by death everywhere, still trying to find a trace of humanity even when fate fails him.I recommend it to anyone who is confused as to what is the true meaning of life. The book doesn't answer the question entirely but sure will help one see how so many things in life are to be grateful for.🌼Genre: #non-fiction, #psychology, #philosophy, #history, #memoirRating:⭐⭐⭐⭐/5Reading difficulty: ⭐⭐⭐/5"
43,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52942400-jingga,5,"Now I understand why some people said ""If you could only read one book for the rest of the year, this book should be it."" After reading this, I've found myself questioning everything about my normal thought patterns and my responses to everything that happens in my life from day-to-day. This one is the passage from this book that has impact for me:""What was really needed was a fundamental change in our attitude toward life. We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life – daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfil the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual."""
44,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,2,"I have to confess: I am a born optimist; for me the glass is always half full and in addition – through nature or nurture - I am also very activist and voluntaristic. So you will rarely or never catch me in a melancholic mood or with a fatalistic attitude. Thus, it does not come as a surprise that I can recognize myself in a booklet that has as essential message: ""do not remain idle, take your life in your hands, overcome negative situations by focusing on the future and give meaning to it all by yourself"". And that is what Victor Frankl advocates. He even worked out a whole psychological approach around this view, called ""logotherapy"".To illustrate the effectiveness of his therapy, Frankl goes back to the worst possible experience that people in history have had to undergo: the Holocaust. And Frankl knows what he is talking about: he himself was in 4 concentration and/or extermination camps (like Auschwitz). The first part of this booklet shows what he has experienced and how he has survived. There was a considerable portion of luck involved, but according to him also the attitude to give meaning to his life, and in his concrete situation, to the unprecedented, beastly suffering that he and many others had to undergo.As a psychologist he already was on that track before the war: he published about the enormous impact that the mental attitude of a person has on his psychological and physical health. And in the camps he tried to apply those insights. Afterwards he worked out his logotherapy, from Vienna (among colleagues who had collaborated with the Nazi regime or had not dared to oppose it), and after the American translation of his work (late 1950s) also from the United States. It goes without saying that this booklet was extremely successful, and is still being read and lauded in cultures that are very focused on the future.Personally, I recognize in Frankl much of what was also discussed in post-war existentialism: the responsibility of each individual for his own happiness. But it must be said that Frankl has always explicitly distanced himself from the existentialist philosophy that departs from a nihilistic basis or at least from the ascertainment of the absurdity of life; his approach is much more agnostic, but in essence both views really are very pragmatic. Also characteristic for his message is his distancing from reductionist and anti-humanist movements, between which he also counts other movements in psychiatry such as those of Freud or Adler.As far as this book is concerned: the concentration camp story in the first part as always remains shocking and startling, even after you have already read several such testimonies. But the second part, in which he explains what his logotherapy actually is, did disappoint me a bit. In addition to the general principle (""look to the future, give meaning to your life""), Frankl barely elaborates on exactly what this therapy consists of. He gives some incentives (like the principle of the paradoxical intention), but you do not have the impression that there is a systematic approach behind it. The rather chaotic build-up of his argument and the use of quite a bit of technical jargon does lessen the value of this book. And that's a pity. Nevertheless, from the abundance of reviews on this and other sites it is clear that his optimistic message still comforts and inspires a lot of people.(2.5 stars)"
45,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30248594-aj-the-ravenous-reader,3,"Reading this book was against my will and nature because one, I only read this as part of my research for my thesis and two, the book is a non-fiction about suffering which involves the Nazis, concentration camps and slavery and other horrible subjects you could think of. It was kind of depressing reading this but enlightening at the same time because it gave me a new perspective about suffering. I definitely would not want to derive the meaning of life out of suffering which is kind of the theme of this book, but at least, there are some good things that can be gained from suffering. "
46,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/275498-jim,5,"This book was written before I was born and I can't believe that it has escaped my notice for sixty-some odd years! For those who don't know (as I did not), Frankl was a psychologist in Vienna prior to the outbreak of WWII. Although he could have escaped, he chose to stay behind to be with his parents. The result was predictable...he ended up enduring the privations of several concentration/extermination camps.The first two-thirds of this book had me entranced. I was so impressed by his refusal to descend into hatred and uplifted by the author's tendency to look for something positive in the direst circumstances. He doesn't buy into the concept of collective guilt so popular today, and acknowledges that there were times when his guards were kind while his fellow inmates were beastly. As Frankl writes on Page 86:""From all this we may learn that there are two races of men in this world, but only these two - the ""race"" of the decent man and the ""race"" of the indecent man. Both are found everywhere: they penetrate into all groups of society. No group consists entirely of decent or indecent people. In this sense, no group is of ""pure race"" - and therefore one occasionally found a decent fellow among camp guards.""I'll be honest, about three-quarters of the way through the book I started to tread water, maybe a bit in over my head, when Frankl started tossing around some high-toned psychiatric terms like ""logotherapy"" and ""noogenic neuroses"" (that second ""o"" needs an umlaut but I don't have one), but after a couple of pages he settled down and got back to talking in terms an old cracker like me can understand. Over all, a wonderful and uplifting book written by a truly inspired (and inspirational) human being. I'll read this one again."
47,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5685790-charles,1,"Huge disappointment. It's one of those ever present books on everyone's ""20 must-read books"" list and it seems (perhaps because of these types of lists) to be more readily available in bookshops. I can only think it's gained notoriety for being on everyone's must-read lists rather than for being a great book, because great book it isn't.I can summarise the book in one sentence: ""people need to have a purpose in life."" This may have been new in the 1940s. If I were reviewing the book in 1946 I would have given the book 5 stars. If I were reviewing the book as a classic of psychology, 4 stars. But reviewing it, as I am, from the perspective of self help literature in 2016, and in light of the huge hype this book gets, it's a 1 star simply because today, for me, it adds nothing new.The Holocaust descriptions are very interesting if quite emotionless, but I didn't read the book for that. (I would have been better off reading Elie Wiesel for that.) The remainder of the book is a pretty dull quite repetitive academic text about logotherapy. I fail to understand the hype around this book, and the endless 5 star reviews it gets on Goodreads...I suspect the 5 star reviews are simply because people THINK they should love it, because everybody else says they love it. A sorry case of groupthink."
48,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3035194-lubinka-dimitrova,5,"This is one of the few books that I truly intend to reread, again and again. Frankl's writing is straight forward, well balanced and totally relatable. For some reason, it made me think of Reich's Listen, Little Man, and honestly, I'd rather reread this one a thousand times that read the other to the end (yes, I dnf it). Frankl's approach is much more to my taste: “No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same.”We live in an age when the feeling that one's life is meaningless is rampant even compared to the recent past. Many compensate by drowning themselves in their career, others escape into religion, alcohol and/or drugs etc as a response to a sense of life's meaninglessness or futility.Frankl writes that our struggle -even our despair -over finding meaning in our lives is not an psychiatric illness, or even a precursor to one. Potential readers of this book will not find ""The Meaning of Life"". What they will find is the story of a man who was compelled to develop the tools to find his own meaning, his 'why'. His method, logotherapy, manages an incredible balance. It does not put man himself at the center of the universe, thus avoiding the kind of narcissistic self-reflection common to much of the therapeutic literature today. Yet, it does not sweep man aside as irrelevant. Instead, Frankl argues that we have an incredible power to shape our attitudes and responses to the challenges life presents us and that we inevitably grow thanks to these challenges. ""Every freedom may be taken away from a man but one; the freedom to choose what attitude he will take towards his conditions.""The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity — even under the most difficult circumstances — to add a deeper meaning to his life. He may remain brave, dignified and unselfish. Or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal. Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may afford him. Is suffering indispensable to the discovery of meaning? In no way. I only insist meaning is available in spite of - nay, even through suffering, provided . . . that the suffering is unavoidable. If it is avoidable, the meaningful thing to do is to remove its cause, for unnecessary suffering is masochistic rather than heroic. If, on the other hand, one cannot change a situation that causes his suffering, he can still choose his attitude.I loved the analogy towards the end of the book. Think of your life as a movie consisting of thousands upon thousands of pictures, each one carrying a meaning. In order to understand the whole film, you first have to take into account each of those individual pictures. Frankl encourages us to deal with our lives in the same way."

If there is meaning in life at all, then there must be meaning in suffering.
This seemed like a fitting book to read on the Remembrance Day weekend, especially since I recently read Anne Frank’s Diaries. It is a harrowing reading experience, but also strangely comforting. Frankl details his concentration camp history in order to show us the how and why of survival.I think it was Frankel’s even-handedness that impressed me the most. He sees evil when it presents itself, in the form of sadistic guards and other prisoners who lord it over their peers, but he also acknowledges the presence of good people in difficult situations—the server in the food line who always scoops from the bottom of the soup pot, giving everyone a chance at one of those longed-for peas, the guard who nudges the weaker prisoner towards lighter duties, the fellow marcher who offers a hand.Survival is often a matter of luck—choosing the right work assignment or choosing a favourable move to another camp, but each person was also responsible for their own luck by paying attention and helping others when they were able or stroking the ego of a guard when the chance arose. Frankl points out that most of those who survived had a bigger goal—a loved one to be reunited with or a project to be finished. He credits his half-finished book with getting him through a bout of typhus during his imprisonment.A tale of grim survival, leading to a sympathetic psychiatric theory. Have you identified your purpose?"

He was also the 32 books which were published in 32 languages-After three horrific years at Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps , Dr Frankl gained his freedom only to learn that his entire family had been murdered. But during , the terrible suffering and degradation of those grim years , he developed his theory of logotherapy.The first half of the book delves into his experiences in the concentration camps.The author analyses the character of the Capo-prisoners chosen to be trustees and guards of the other inmates- usually because of their brutality and meanness.Frankl observes that 'the best of us did not return'from the concentration camps.He examines three phases of the inmates mental reaction to concentration camp life-the period following his admission ; the period when he is well entrenched in camp routine; and the period following his release and liberation"".Ultimately in recounting the horrors and dehuminization of concentration camp existance , of being continually stalked by death , , Frankl explains how he survived , and kept his humanity at the same time. The author explains how every moment in the camps offered the opportunity to make decisions about whether or not to submit to the powers which ""threatened to rob you of your inner self , your inner freedom.""The point made was that ultimately the type of person the prisoner would become , was the result of an inner decision , and not of camp influences alone.Frankl refers to the martyrs whose behaviour in the camp , whose suffering and death , demonstrated the fact that their last inner freedom could not be lost.""It can be said that they where worthy of their suffering ; the way they bore their suffering was a genuine inner achievment. It is this spiritual freedom which cannot be taken away- that makes life meaningful and purposeful.""Frabkl speaks of the dream which kept him alive in the camp , of lecturing and practising psychiatry- that is essentially G-D's commission to Frankl. The prisoner who lost faith in his future was doomed.The prisoners said to each other that no earthly happyness could alleviate the suffering they had experienced in the camps , but Frankl writes that ""The crowning experience of all , for the homecoming man is the wonderful feeling that , afetr all he has suffered , there is nothing he need fear anymore-except for G-D"".The second part of the book explains Frankl's theory of psychology known as logotherapy.""According to logotherapy , the striving to find a meaning in one's life is the primary motivational force in man"".Frankl deals with the universality of values. He notes that in the Nazi concentration camps those who knew that their was a task waiting for them to be fulfilled where more likely to survive"".On the meaning of life one cannot live for some general goal alone. That goal must be meaningfully present in every moment to make the moment alive in terms of it's destination and future.The meaning of life is that G-d asks every person to answer for his or her life i.e ""What will you make of your life , my child"".Only personal choices are authentic choices . Life in it's ultimate meaning confronts us with other people whose lives we influence by the way we are towards them.""A human being is not one thing among others , things determine each other , but man is ultimately self-determining""."
52,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4114763-michelle,5,"I had heard about this book for years prior to stumbling upon it at a local bookstores but despite the wonderful reviews it received, I had always dismissed it as your typical ""holocaust"" story. In ""Man's Search for Meaning"", Frankl recounts his years in the concentration camp but he also focuses on the collective experience of the prisoners rather than only on his own tale. Told in an honest and surprisingly courageous tone, this book not only captures the extent/depth of human suffering but the vastness of human resolve. I appreciated Frankl's almost detached manner in explaining behavior and his description of surprise at the psychological/moral shifts of those around him (and his own) Frankl never tries to place the blame (or praise) on anyone but decides to focus more on the complexity of each individual (he even recounts the acts of kindness that was sometimes offered by the SS guards) I find his story of his years in Auschwitz to be an incredibly humbling story. In the later chapters, Frankl details the psychological shifts of the prisoners and categorizes them into three phases:1. Period following immediate admission2. Period well-entrenched in camp life3. Period after liberationEach of these period brings with it an array of psychological tension and inner turmoil and Dr. Frankl delves into each phase with a deep professionalism. He merely describes and explains; others would have embellished to no end but he refrains from excess cliches and self-pity and I believe that therein lies the genius of this book. An extremely emotional event was able to be dealt with in an objective and straight-forward manner, focusing more the psychological results and what could be derived from the whole experience. Others would have just dwelled on the horror of it all. Dr. Frankl supports the belief that man is not just fate's plaything, he believes that their suffering is not empty but a sort of challenge unique to each individual; it is up to him/her to ""rise to the occasion"". In such difficult moments, we are jolted from our daily trance and really value even the most menial of things. We are faced with the opportunity to be moral and dignified--for if we aren't ever tested how would we know just how moral and dignified we really are? During these exceptionally difficult moments, we are granted the opportunity to grow spiritually, we are free from trifling things and are able to focus on our bodies and our minds. What I believe Frankl is trying to say is that if we view those difficult moments as a time of trial and not eternal punishment, we shall be able to develop into mature, strong, and loving people; a person who accepts difficulties with grace and strength and sincerely appreciates the moments of peace. If we are able to pass this ""life test"", we become more secure in our personal worth and inner strength, thus allowing the present situation to seem completely surmountable--and future ones as well. One could make a victory out of those experiences, turning life into an inner triumph. Frankl proposes a new alternative to therapy, logotherapy (logos being the greek word for meaning). In such a therapy, the client is guided into finding their own personal goal, their reason to withstand the current suffering. In contrast with the theory of ""will to pleasure"" (Freud's theory) and ""will to power"" (Adler's) Logotherapy posits that a man is driven to live by finding a meaning in his life, in being driven toward this goal, he will try and ""solve"" any issues preventing him from reaching it. Instead of conflicts between desires and instincts and hidden motives (which do contribute to neuroses) Logotherapy focuses on the conflicts that arise from existential frustration, what a man feels when he is wasting his life or is living his life in direct opposition to his ideals and values.Logotherapy deviates from psychanalysis in that it considers man a being whose main concern consists in fulfilling a meaning, rather than in the mere gratification and satisfaction of drives or in reconciling the conflicts of id, ego, and superego, or in the mere adaptation and adjustment to society's demands. In the Nazi concentration camps, the ones who felt they had a meaning in their lives were more apt to survive and overcome the trauma, albeit slowly. This holds true for most people who are experiencing difficult situations or attempting to recover from post-traumatic stress disorder.In psychoanalysis, the focus is on symbols and hidden associations which are often found annoying and unhelpful to the client about the conflict at hand. These are then faced with more issues and more neuroses can surface. In logotherapy, this is skipped-in a sense-and the focus is not the cause of the neuroses inasmuch as it is on the possible solutions or alternatives. "

I remember really liking the man the very first time that I listened to him, thinking of him as being very kind, but his class was boring, at least to me back then. I didn’t know the worth of his knowledge, so I dropped out, thinking we were not being graded I didn’t bother to report it to the office. Then one day I received an A for taking the class. I didn’t complain as I figured that we had all received an A, but it was an A that I didn't deserve. I had only read Anne Frank, and I had just stepped out of a cultish religion that kept me ignorant to world news, not that I was ignorant of the Holocaust, but I knew so little. I remember my friend Julie would always ask me where I had been all my life since I knew so little about things. I had a lot of catching up, and I realize now that by being in various religions and leaving, I continued to have to catch up. I reread this book in the last year or two, but for some reason I deleted my review on Goodreads, so not having saved it, it is gone. I remember writing that I didn’t think that there was any “meaning of the moment,” which was a philosophy that I believed he held in this book. What meaning can you get out of being in a concentration camp? I saw none. But his philosophy pulled him through those nightmarish years, and when he was released from the prison camp he became a psychologist and treated other survivors with his methods. And since then I have read so much about the Holocaust that it sickens me. The best book that I have read on it was “Night” by Elie Wiesel. The list on books about the Holocaust goes on forever, and the movies do as well. I have heard people say that the Jewish people should just get over it, not realzing that there are just some things that you never get over, and this is one of them. And perhaps they say this because, like me, they had never read anything about the Holocaust, and perhaps I had said it too back then.And last night I dreamed about Victor Frankl and that I was looking up quotes by him to add to my review when I came across these two powerful quotes that I am adding today. And when I read them I realize that Frankl had so much to tell us, so much that we needed to learn and I had really missed it all by leaving his class and even when rereading his book. I think I got bogged down in his psychology instead of his words of wisdom, but I also remember that somewhere along the line of my learning I had come to these conclusions as well. And perhaps these quotes came from his other book, Man's Search for Ultimate Meaning:“For the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth - that Love is the ultimate and highest goal to which man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is through love and in love.” “It did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life—daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.”"

The big idea of the book is that anyone can choose to make meaning out of any situation, no matter how bad thing are. He uses his personal experiences and observations from Auschwitz as an example.My favorite quotes from the books are: ""Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation. You cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will feel and do about what happens to you.""The second one I really like was ""Happiness is like a butterfly; The more you chase it, the more it will elude you. But if you turn your attention to other things, It will come and softly sit on your shoulder.""Author's experience taught him that our main drive or motivation in life is neither pleasure nor power, but meaning. And according to Frankl, meaning can be found through:- Creativity or giving something to the world through self- expression,- Experiencing the world by interacting authentically with our environment and with others, and- Changing our attitude when we are faced with a situation or circumstance that we cannot change.This book is incredible rich with ideas and when you read you'll have a lot of your own epiphanies. I would highly recommend checking it out, you won't be disappointed."

Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning..Victor E. Frankl’s “Man's Search for Meaning” is a memoir that should be read by everyone at least once, it’s a classic must-read, and one of the most influential books written in America. With its descriptions of life in Nazi death camps, it’s certainly a difficult & painful read; but the lessons for spiritual survival are deeply profound which you can apply to your life..Between 1942 and 1945 Frankl labored in four different camps, including Auschwitz, while losing everything he had, including his loved ones. There were many times when he wanted to give up, and Frankl and his fellow prisoners had to endure atrocities that many of us cannot even imagine. But throughout the book, Frankl speaks deeply about his own “why” and pursuit of meaning which helped him endure his difficult circumstances. Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. Frankl's theory known as logotherapy, from the Greek word logos (""meaning""), holds that our primary drive in life is not pleasure, but the discovery and pursuit of what we personally find meaningful. ..I find this book extremely hopeful, that as human beings, we have the ability to rise above all sufferings, to find our own individual meaning to our existence and in that way make sense of why we are in this world, and why we should continue in it, doing our very best. I know we’re going through a dark period in our country, I know many of us are suffering. I know many of us want to give up. If you’re going through tough time, please remember that, it may take time to realize it, but you’re loved, worthy, and a fighter. God put all of us on this earth because he loves us, he gave you a gift to use, and purpose to live for. Importantly, take care of yourself, mentally, physically, and spiritually. We live in a hyper-connected, busy society where it’s easy to get lost, overwhelmed, and compare yourself to others constantly. It’s all about you, you have to put yourself before others. Live the life that that makes you happy, not to impress others. Don’t let the petty, little, vain things get in your way. ...."

58,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5465546-catherine-stormblessed,5,"I can’t believe I didn’t read this sooner. I know it is well beloved but this book speaks to me more deeply than I can even express. Here’s a video review I made for any of you interested: https://youtu.be/gfTBowbyhcUObviously I had to take notes and I’ll have some of my favorite quotes down below. In summary, everyone should read this book, particularly individuals who live in the US. There is this increasing culture to complain and promote nihilistic thinking. And it is so aggravating. Society has never and will never be perfect. And we have improved far more than we can even comprehend. So give in to suffering is to be ignorant of the true meaning that exists for us to take. Viktor E. Frankl’s story is a manifesting of how meaning is available even in the worst of circumstances. It is up to us to take it and cope with our circumstances to find meaning.Now for the amazing quotes:* “...life holds a potential meaning under any conditions, even the most miserable ones” (pg 16).* “Don’t aim at success—the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one’s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself” (pg 17).* “I was struggling to find the reason for my sufferings, my slow dying. In a last violent protest against the hopelessness of imminent death, I sensed my spirit piercing through the enveloping gloom. I felt it transcend that hopeless, meaningless world, and from somewhere I heard of victorious “Yes” an answer to my question of the existence of an ultimate purpose” (pg 60).* “...everything can be taken for a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way” (pg 86).* “If there’s a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning and suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete” (pg 88).* “Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as they form a clear and precise picture of it” (pg 95).* ”But there was no need to be ashamed of tears, for tears for witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer” (pg 100).* “...no one has the right to do wrong, not even if wrong has been done to them” (pg 112).* “...mental health is based on a certain degree of tension, the tension between what one has already achieved and what one still out to accomplish, or the gap between what one is and what one should become. Such attention is inherent in the human being and therefore is indispensable to mental well-being. We should not, then, be hesitant about challenging man with a potential meaning for him to fulfill” (pg 127).* “The more one forgets himself—by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love—the more human he is and the more he actualize himself” (pg 133).* “According to logotherapy, we can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering” (pg 133).* “No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him” (pg 134).* ”Sex is justified, even sanctified, as soon as, but only as long as, it is a vehicle of love” (134).* “In some way, suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice” (pg 135).* “‘The wish is father to the thought’ to The fear is mother of the event’” (pg 145).* “ pleasure is, and must remain, a side-effect or by-product, and is destroyed and spoiled to the degree to which it is made a goal in itself” (pg 145).* “...freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness” (pg 156).* “Live as if you were living for the second time and it acted as wrongly the first time as you were about to act now” (pg 175).* “Just as life remains potentially meaningful under any conditions, even those which are most miserable, so too does the value of each and every person stay with him or her, and it does so because it is based on the values that he or she has realized in the past, and it is not contingent on the usefulness that here she may or may not retain in the present” (pg 176)."

I still mesmerized by this author's way of thinking. I thought I could breeze through reading this 'thin' book, but not so. The nuance in this book make me pause frequently and think deeply while reassess what's the meaning of life--for me. In the past, I've read several books that addressed 'what's the meaning of life' theme but none had gave me a satisfactory answer, But after reading this book, I realized that those books had addressed the topic from the wrong angle. The question should be turn to oneself in the context of one's life.What so profound about the author's testimony as a Holocaust survivor was how he viewed those involved in the war as his fellow human beings, first and foremost. And he simply categorized people as: 1) decent human beings; and 2) indecent human beings. In which decent human beings were and will always be in minority. The choice one's make is what determines it because it is we who make that choices; to be decent human being or otherwise regardless of the circumstances and/or external pressures that may influence one's decision.With easy access to drugs to lull the pain and sufferings of everyday challenges in life, there's a wisdom we can take from this book about how much we can learn about ourselves by allowing ourselves to experience sufferings as it appears at the door (when the sufferings are unavoidable.) I think the biggest challenge of all is how to learn to forgive unforgivable acts done by others therefore to freed ourselves from hatred."
60,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7747793-rahul,3,"The holocaust part of the book is as expected moving and heart wrenching. I kept thinking, how I would have perished. What line of fate would have carried me to death. How much belief, hope and in what would have helped me see myself through and for what. And then the part dealing with ""logotherapy"" , [the belief that it is the striving to find a meaning in one's life that is the primary, most powerful motivating and driving force in humans], following lines of Jiddu Krishnamurti I could not shake off from my head.If I were foolish enough to give you a system and if you were foolish enough to follow it, you would merely be copying, imitating, conforming, accepting, and when you do that you have set up in yourself the authority of another and hence there is conflict between you and that authority. You feel you must do such and such a thing because you have been told to do it and yet you are incapable of doing it. You have your own particular inclinations, tendencies and pressures which conflict with the system you think you ought to follow and therefore there is a contradiction. So you will lead a double life between the ideology of the system and the actuality of your daily existence. In trying to conform to the ideology, you suppress yourself - whereas what is actually true is not the ideology but what you are. If you try to study yourself according to another you will always remain a secondhand human being. 3.5 stars."

Being a new, and small, department, eager to attract students, they were quite liberal in allowing interdisciplinary independent study credits. Consequently, beyond the required courses I took a great number of independents, some from their own faculty, but others from faculty hailing from the psychology and philosophy departments. I may have read Man's Search for Meaning in the context of such an independent or possibly as a reading in a survey seminar about Humanistic Psychology which the program offered.This book attempts--successfully, I think--to describe the existential foundations of Frankl's logotherapy by detailing his experiences as a Jew in Hitler's Germany and concentration camp system. It is therefore both an autobiography of his early years and a description of his psychological theory.The autobiographical portion of the book was, for me, the most powerful. Indeed, it is the best description I've yet read of what it was like, subjectively speaking, to attempt to survive in the camps. The strength of the theory stems from the exposure of its roots in his experience."

Said it has helped her a lot through rough times.It's hard to review this book. First of all, it's not fiction. Second of all, how can you evaluate someone's thoughts when they've been to a concentration camp and back, and come up with all of this through experience? I can just say that the author must have been a really exceptional person, to have such strength in the face of such hardship.And to all of you who think this is just another book about concentration camps? Well, in a way it is, but really - it isn't. It's a surprisingly professional and objective account of what a human psyche goes through, when dealing with extreme conditions.

65,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575806-kressel-housman,5,"Because this book seems to be the most oft-quoted secular book amongst rabbis, I’ve known about it for years. What prompted me to finally read it was that it seemed the perfect follow-up to the last two books I read. I went from the “soul liberty” of Roger Williams to the unintended consequences of that liberty back to a defense of letting everyone find his or her own meaning in life. The book is basically divided into three parts: Viktor Frankl’s memories of his imprisonment in a concentration camp, a summary of logotherapy, which he founded, and a post-script, which is basically the transcript of a speech he gave in the 1980’s. Unlike Freud, Frankl did not believe that the driving force of humanity is physical desire, and unlike the existentialists, he certainly did not believe that life is meaningless. What he discovered as a result of being in a concentration camp is that when people are stripped of everything, what remaids is their mind and will, and even though the camps were designed to crush that, too, the people who successfully resisted were the ones who found meaning in their daily lives, usually in service to another. To some, it was keeping a family member alive. To others, it was fulfilling G-d’s commandments whenever possible. To Viktor Frankl himself, it was his position as doctor, able to tend to the needs of the sick and dying. I think it’s a very positive outlook, and I’m glad that at least one philosophy professor I know teaches it in his class. I learned about way too much existentialism when I was in college.As Kurt Andersen made clear in his own book, if everyone can find his own meaning, we have to be on guard for charlatans offering meaning. But Roger Williams and Viktor Frankl are right, too. The liberty to find and live by what’s meaningful to us is the only way to achieve true faith and psychological health."

En pocas palabras trata de un psiquiatra que elige de cierta forma afrontar junto con su familia de origen judío, un campo de concentración. Lo más apasionante del asunto es la narrativa pues no solo muestra experiencias introspectivas de su vivencia, sino que también, narra el panorama y el día a día de un prisionero, pero siempre desde su base psiquiátrica de los estadios emocionales o donde los divide en etapas que se vivan dentro de estas condiciones. A mi forma de ver es una lectura necesaria no le di las cinco estrellas porque en la parte de la logoterapia siento que quiso abarcar muchas más cosas y por esta razón le fue difícil concluir ideas, aunque haya conceptos interesantes. I really liked this book, not only because of the story but the way of telling it. In short, it is a psychiatrist who chooses, in a certain way, to confront, together with his family of Jewish origin, a concentration camp. The most fascinating thing about the subject is the narrative because it not only shows introspective experiences of his experience, but also, it narrates the panorama and the day by day of a prisoner, but always from its psychiatric base of the emotional stages or where it divides in stages of how people live within these conditions. To my way of seeing is a most to read but, I did not give the five stars because in the part of logotherapy I feel that I wanted to cover many more things and for this reason it was difficult to conclude ideas, even if there are interesting concepts."

I think this book is one of the most worthwhile books I've ever read, and maybe will ever read.In this memoir, Viktor Frankl explores meaning, and its invaluable importance in our lives.He does that in two ways, the first is through an account of his experiences in 4 Nazi concentration camps. While the second is through introducing his psychology of logotherapy.It cannot be emphasized enough how strong this book is, it basically opens up with a survivor of Auschwitz telling you that his imprisonment was meaningful and he made the best of it. It did not break him. Seeing the experience through his eyes is nothing short of fascinating.Logotherapy is a very interesting take on, or rather alernative of Psychoanalysis. In contrast to Freud's depth psychology, Frankl identifies his as a ""height psychology"", shifting the focus from the past to the future. Logotherapy is also concerned with puting more emphasis on the role of meaning in our lives, and the danger of its absence.This memoir is definitely a must-read in my estimate.
“When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.”

“Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”

68,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48011083-steve,5,"This is a short, yet important, work on managing life's sufferings, reflecting Frankl's experience as a concentration camp survivor and psychiatrist. Frankl summarizes three ways to find meaning in life: ""(1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering."" I fundamentally agree with Frankl's conclusion, however, I'm still left at a loss. What are we to do if we have experienced those three mechanisms only to now find ourselves bereft of purpose? As for attitude, I'm reminded of that quip, ""The beatings will continue until morale improves."" As an acquaintance once put it, if all that's required to find happiness and meaning is an attitude adjustment, ""don't you think I would have done it by now?"" No, recognizing meaning in an environment we were not genetically adapted to live in is a tall order, I suspect. Still, Mr. Frankl's work is notable and among that short list of ""should reads."""

What brought this book into my life at this time is that one of my friends from high school recently committed suicide. I resonated very strongly with this passage:""The tender beginnings of a psychotherapy...were they possible at all in the (concentration) camp, (were) either individual or collective in nature. The individual psychotherapeutic attempts were often a kind of ""life-saving procedure."" These efforts were usually concerned with the prevention of suicides. A very strict camp ruling forbade any efforts to save a man who attempted suicide. It was forbidden, for example, to cut down a man who was trying to hang himself. Therefore, it was all important to prevent these attempts from occurring.I remember two cases of would-be suicide, which bore a striking similarity to each other. Both men had talked of their intentions to commit suicide. Both used the typical argument- they had nothing more to expect from life. In both cases it was a question of getting them to realize that life was still expecting something from them; something in the future was expected of them...Th(e) uniqueness and singleness which distinguishes each individual and gives a meaning to his existence has a bearing on creative work as much as it does on human love. When the impossibility of replacing a person is realized, it allows the responsibility which a man has for his existence and its continuance to appear in its magnitude... He knows the ""why"" for his existence, and will be able to bear almost any ""how"".""  pgs 100-101If only someone had given my friend this book. If only I had known she was in such pain.

They were forced to work even when they were sick. The mental torture, the hunger, the pain and agony, it pained to just read about such dreadful experiences.

Ahem.This is one of those books for me. It blew my mind about six years ago when it was first recommended to me by a guy who I soon thereafter moved in with and here we are, still together (not solely because of this book, but it didn't hurt when we realized the kinds of conversations we could have). I recommended it recently as the next book for our book club because it's been on my mind a lot lately and I wanted a good reason to re-read it, since lately I've been finding it hard to want to re-read anything (too many books, too little time).Viktor Frankl spent three years in concentration camps during World War II. During his time in the camps he was able to pull from the nightmare the principles behind what he later called logotherapy. In simple terms it's the concept that having meaning in one's life, a goal to work towards, is essential to be able to survive the harshest suffering. It seems like an easy enough concept, but so few people actually practice it; reading this a second time has revitalized the idea in my own mind.I think it's nicely summed up in a footnote:Logotherapy is not imposed on those who are interested in psychotherapy. It is not comparable to an Oriental bazaar but rather to a supermarket. In the former, the customer is talked into buying something. In the latter, he is shown, and offered, various things from which he may pick what he deems usable and valuable.So the real question is: Did Frankl blow my mind in this second reading? Yes."

I never heard of logotherapy before, but there was a lot of interesting and identifiable concepts that clicked with me. Then again, is that not the case with most psychological texts, that there is a truth to the analysis we can say ‘aha’ to? So what makes logotherapy interesting is the simplicity and intuitive aspect of it, at least with my first foray into it with its source creator (I’m sure it has developed into its own by now). I am at a phase in life where I realize the importance of having a sense of purpose in order to be fulfilled, whereby money is involved (to pay the bills) but is not the purpose in itself (corporate leaders: are you listening?), and logotherapy is in part about the meaning of life:For the meaning of life differs from life to life to man, from day to day, from hour to hour. What matters therefore is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person’s life at a specific moment ... One should not search for a specific meaning of life. Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. Thus, everyone’s life is unique as is his specific opportunity to implement it.This is what, for now, resonates with me from logotherapy. But caution is warranted, a quick google search also divulges criticism of Frankl’s theories and also of his collaboration with the Nazi regime and manipulation of his linguistic use about his experiences in the camps in order to be more dramatic. I have no idea about the truth of these and their impact, but logotherapy in itself is certainly interesting."

78,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60916027-saumya,4,"This is a remarkable book about hope even in the most tragic circumstances. No matter what your external situation is, your spiritual and mental freedom cannot be taken away from you. Viktor E. Frankl has shared about his experiences as he survived the Holocaust and the mental and emotional strength that this book talks about is inspiring and moving."
79,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/259402-sebastien,4,"Utterly gut-wrenching and powerful. Frankl talks about his experience in concentration camps and the suffering he and others experienced in a very clear, honest style. There is a lack of vindictiveness within his spirit that I truly admire. He is incredibly honest, both in talking about himself and others. At least he strikes me as honest, his prose is direct and he doesn't dress anything up (i.e. no fluffy prose, grand sentimentality, etc). He doesn't lionize himself or present himself in a good or bad light, he just presents himself. You don't feel there is an ulterior motive which sometimes happens in autobiographies where the writer ends up crafting a narrative that is self-serving and self-aggrandizing. Nope. None of that here. Increases the power of the story imo. Boom boom boom. He lays things out in a naked sparse way that hit me hard. There is a lot of truth in his analysis on suffering and the nature and necessity of hope. And also the nature of people, the complexity of people. We are not binary, we are not either good or bad. With these insights, he shows himself to be astonishingly nonjudgemental. I really do wish the section of the book about his experiences in the concentration camps was more comprehensive, longer. It was just so powerful, and touching, and sad/devastating and yet beautiful at the same time.But I have to recommend this book to everyone, solely for the man's insights on human suffering. Suffering is a nuanced and difficult subject. It is a universal human experience and it is difficult to find meaning from it, especially from traumatic chronic suffering that seems senselessly cruel and meaningless. Such suffering can shatter our life's narratives, our hope, our faith, our humanity. But sometimes we can transcend our suffering, and find meaning from it. I will have to reread this book, there are so many truths and wonderful insights on suffering, what it means, what it can mean, how it can break us, how it can help us ""see"" more deeply into our spirits. How it can help us find meaning... lots to chew on, lots of nuances I probably missed hence the need to reread his book. The latter part of the book was much less interesting to me, focused on his practice and methodology of the psychotherapy he developed called logotherapy. Honestly that was sort of ugh, I did kind of mentally check out in this part of the book, although there were some brilliant points interspersed throughout this section. "
80,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/365163-elyssa,5,"I have read this book many, many times. These are the words I live by. If I was told that I could only own one book for the rest of my life, this would be it. Viktor Frankl's harrowing testimony of surviving in a concentration camp seems incomprehensible. Even more unbelievable is the attitude he adopts during his struggle as he remains apart from his family, starving, cold, and forced to perform hard labor with no relief in sight. Through it all, he decides that even though his body is being held captive, he is still free to control his mind and his attitude. When he is ultimately liberated from the concentration camp, rather than be bitter and remorseful, he uses his tragic experiences as a basis for logotherapy, a counseling theory that helps people to find meaning in their adversity. He also influences a generation of existential psychotherapists including another favorite writer of mine, Irvin Yalom.This is an incredible book that significantly altered my life and way of thinking. I recommend it to everyone."
81,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20984873-freshta,5,"Absolutely love this book. Coming from a war torn country and being associated with many people who face different types of sufferings on daily basis, I can understand and and see this how important idea of logo therapy and existential analysis can become. Choosing not be a victim is a choice and I am a big believer of this. In this book, Frankl pretty much delivers similar message and how to cope with it by finding a purpose and meaning despite darkness and lack of hope. Sharing his story and drawing conclusions, it is easy to connect with the author as you know what he is talking about and is speaking from inside; he has endured unimaginable loss, torture....One of those books that I need to to not only listen but also read! Started with audiobook but know reading a physical copy!"
82,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90786-lee-klein,4,"The opening autobiographical account about survival in the concentration camps is as good as this genre gets. (Sounds wrong to call it a ""genre"" but you know what I mean.) Applicable to anyone with an office job or needing to endure an open-ended situation. Focus on love, on the future, on ongoing tasks, on others. Asking what's the meaning of life is like asking what's the best chess move -- it depends on the situation, the player, the opponent. Puts everything in perspective. Fours stars only because the other sections (""Logotherapy in a Nutshell"" etc) didn't engage or affect me to the same degree as the account. But the first section is probably required reading for all."

Read part one of the book & it was absolutely amazing, eye-opening & life-changing. I have so many quotes I love from this book <3 “But there was no need to be ashamed of tears, for tears bore witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer.”"
84,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6091773-cole,1,I seem to be in the minority with my opinion but I have no desire to read about a particular school of psychiatric thought even if it was conceived in the Nazi concentration camps. Reading this book felt like work and I didn't enjoy it.

There's not much I can add to all the praises for this book, but I understand why thousands of people have been moved by it to the point to change their lives. It is this strong.

86,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19736308-susan-s-reviews,5,One of the first of Viktor Frankl's books that transformed my thinking and my world view. Everyone should read this book. 
87,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10049704-joey,3,"I was imagining if I were one of those people imprisoned in Auschwitz, what would have I done? Would have I been able to survive the suffering I could have endured, especially the nerve-racking fear of the gas chamber? I think I wouldn’t have because I would have been chosen to be ushered into the right path;they would have found me physically and politically useless, inferior , or undesirable (unless they would have taken into consideration my passion for epistemology) : I am a wee bit skinny-boned and hard-hearing. The SS, a unit of Nazis in charge of the mass extermination, would have given me a distaste look and hit in my flat abdomen. Ugh, what a miserable life species I would have been! But lo and behold, Victor Frankl said that the meaning of life is found in every moment of living; life never ceases to have meaning, even in suffering and death. So, my death would not have been nothing; it would have been meaningful. Not that I know of.Victor Frankl , a Viennese psychiatrist and neurologist, recounted the heart-twitching memories he had experienced in Auschwitz. Therein lied the indelibly abject miseries he went through with other inmates under the SS, of how he suffered a lot in the camp with a meager of food and water, of how he brought himself to sleep with other inmates in one bed that was inhabited by mites aplenty, soaked with pee and dung, in a shirt that was almost tattered and rugged. And the throat-slashing one was the uncertainty, having no idea of when an inmate could be locked up and immolated in the gas chamber… Indeed, a person like me living in this generation does not have the atom of imagination of how Frankl’ s life was a total hell.From the beginning to the end of his historical accounts, the leitmotif that bore down on me is the gas chamber.( As a matter of fact, I dreamed about it before after reading Anne Frank’s Diary , of how she ended up in that place.) Whenever Frankl described the story and explained the idiosyncratic behavioral patterns of his inmates, I could not take off my mind the chamber which every inmate at that time feared most. I didn’t mind the imaginary descriptions and illustrations of how those inmates were starved to death, malnourished and thirsty for clean water, pica for nonnutritious food, living with gangrenes as long as the chamber would not be mentioned. Like Frankl’s fellow inmates, I also tended to be paranoid about it imagining how people found inferior died inside that big room. What a hair-raising and heartbreaking scene it could have been!Aside from his experiences in a concentration camp , Frankl also included in this book his discussion about logotherapy in a nutshell and the case for a tragic optimism.When Frankl was in the different concentration camps, he observed not only himself but also his inmates how they would react to such a hellhole. Most of them became hopeless, apathetic, bitter, disillusioned. Some were suicidal. Eventually, using his background in medicine, he came up with logotherapy to help some of them survive. In this therapy, a patient is helped to find the meaning of his/ her life as the primary motivational force. It focuses on the future, on the meanings a patient wants to fulfill in the future.Before I just had the idea that life is a question of existentialism, but logotherapy dawned upon me that we can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: (1)by creating a work or doing a deed; (2)by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward un avoidable suffering.( p.133)What caught my interest was the real meaning of existentialism which I took to when I studied psychology. I was enlightened when Frankl clearly discussed that the term “ existential” may be used in three ways to refer to : (1) existence itself; (2) the meaning of existence; and (3)the striving to find the concrete meaning in personal existence, that is to say, the will to meaning. ( p.123)The last part discusses the real meaning of a “ tragic optimism”. In brief it means that one is, and remains, optimistic in spite of the “ tragic triad,” such as pain , guilt, and death.The most important thing that I have learned , proved in effect, is that LOVE indeed is the most powerful emotional element in the universe. This is the last resort a man in dire can turn to , aside from God he/she believes in ( but I don’t ) , in order to survive.Since it is a memoir that focusing on the concept of logotherapy, the book is not that as ambitious as other famous ones. I wonder if it could be a hit should it have been written like a novel.For the third time, I have failed to catch my dream: to study in graduate school. I missed it due to some personal reasons. I have been so depressed that I might never be interested in it anymore.To protect my ego from this soul-devastating frustration, I thought that I might just spend my life reading the books I have been storing for a long time or writing short stories I have always wanted to do . However, I still can’t get over this ambitious fiasco. Sometimes, I blame myself for not being a risk taker. Nevertheless, this book has reminded me of my favorite philosophy that life is a matter of choice; I am responsible for the life I want to choose.” He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.” - Friedrich Nietzsche-"
88,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22849115-brian-yahn,4,"Most stories ultimately have one goal: to make the reader feel something.Man's Search for Meaning takes a subtle twist. In telling his story of life in a concentration camp, Victor Frankl doesn't try to get you to feel a certain way. As the pivotal events transpire, he examines how they made him feel, and how the feelings of him and those around him were often times much different than you'd expect.He also takes some time to get into the heads of the guards who tortured them. It's easy to demonize the guards, but Frankl shows that some of them weren't so bad, and a lot of his fellow prisoners were much worse.Finally, and most intriguing for me, he talks about how life after the camps was wildly different than you'd probably expect. Instead of feeling instantly relieved and an overwhelming happiness, most prisoners felt nothing. They had already died on the inside, and it would take them years to come back to life.Further, most of the prisoners didn't leave camp and come back to the happy lives that they'd left. For one, it was easy in camp to forget that they weren't living in a constant state of happiness before they were imprisoned. While in camp, it was easy to think they'd give anything to have their old lives back. But, in their old lives, they had plenty of unhappiness, too!Further, for the few that did survive the camp, most of their families had either died or they weren't able to find. And for the fortunate few who were able to reunite with family, their families had also endured much suffering. Their families didn't feel sorry for them and let them relax and take it easy for the rest of life. No, they had to find new jobs, often a huge step down from where they were before the war.The only thing keeping most of the prisoners going was the thought that one day they would be free again. And, for the few who lived to see that day, it felt like a dream. They had become so used to prison life, that normal life didn't seem real. And life outside the camp wasn't what it seemed like from inside.The point of the book is that every person needs something to live for. In a lot of ways, it's ironic. Frankl says that the meaning he found in his life was to help people find meaning in their lives. But if that's all he could find in life, how could it be worth it for him to help others? It's a classic Ponzi scheme!As someone who is constantly focused on my goals and the future, this book had the opposite effect on me. I read that the prisoners were so anxious to one day be free, and then when they were free, they weren't any happier than before. It makes me question whether all the work I put into making my dreams come true is worth it. If they ever do come true, will I be happy? If chasing after dreams is what makes me happy, do I need to rethink my priorities?Man's Search For Meaning is about finding meaning in your life, namely what you live for. It's very future oriented. It's about climbing to new heights.But for me, it made me think, maybe I've climbed high enough and I should just enjoy the view -- at least for a short while."
89,080701429X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/426277-james,5,"“The one thing you can’t take away from me is the way I choose to respond to what you do to me. The last of one’s freedoms is to choose ones attitude in any given circumstance.” - Victor FranklI first encountered Frankl's book as a reading assignment for a seminar led by Stephen Covey. I will never forget the first time I read it. It was exciting for its lessons and its inspiration. It was and continues to be one of the most inspirational books that I have ever read. That first reading led to subsequent readings which cemented its place in my own personal reading pantheon. Along with the works of Aristotle, Plato, Thoreau and others I have drawn support for my personal philosophy for living. It is an unlikely combination of one part personal memoir and one part psychology. But the two parts complement each other, producing an impressive argument for living your life with freedom through strength of mind and character. I was impressed with the ability of Frankl to describe his experience in the concentration camps as one in which he was free. That is his mind was free because the guards could not control his thoughts and in that sense he saw himself with more freedom than they had. He concluded from these experiences “When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.” He goes on to say:""We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life--daily and hourly. Our talk must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual."" (p 85)This is a deeply important paragraph with many lessons for Victor and his fellow prisoners as well as his readers. One aspect reminded me of the lessons I learned studying Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics where he also emphasized the importance of right action, right conduct, and taking individual responsibility. In Book Two he discusses the nature of virtue as it is concerned with feelings and actions. For Aristotle it is necessary to have the right feelings at the right times for the right things and for the right purposes. He goes on to discuss the actions of individuals and the nature of virtue but through all of this there is an aim towards the good and as Frankl says ""the responsibility to find the right answer to life's problems.Victor Frankl's personal experience through all the difficulties of immurement and physical deprivation make his story all the more powerful. He subsequently developed logotherapy (considered the ""Third Viennese School of Psychotherapy"" after Freud's psychoanalysis and Adler's individual psychology) which suggests an approach to life that is both positive and life-enhancing. I would recommend this book to all who are looking for guidance in finding direction in life. "
