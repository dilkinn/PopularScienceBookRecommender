0,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick,2,"This is a book with a simple argument to make: that the scientific revolution was a real thing, it definitely happened, and it happened at a specific point in time, namely, ‘between 1572, when Tycho Brahe saw a nova, and 1704, when Newton published his Opticks’. In that century and a half, a staggering number of new truths about reality became understood – we went from living at the centre of a universe of celestial spheres, reading manuscripts to glean the lessons of the ancient Greeks, to living on a terraqueous globe orbiting the sun, and studying printed books from a new breed of modern experimental scientists. And it was all driven by advances in instruments, a new awareness of the potential for discovery, and a growing conviction that empirical experience was more important than philosophical dogma or classical authority.The simplicity of Wootton's premise is, in a way, a clue to his defensiveness. He is explicitly arguing against the claims of ‘postmodernist’ historians, who have suggested that successful scientific theories are, in terms of historical description, not fundamentally different from unsuccessful ones, and that anyway scientific ‘truths’ are culturally dependent and enforced by political authority. Wootton is having none of this.More power to him; but unless you have gone through life with a steely conviction of the right-mindedness of Bloor's strong programme, Wootton's intramural aggression may quickly become tiresome. His arguments are aimed at his historiographical opponents, not at the general reader. And he is not above frequent asides to make this point explicit (‘It should be obvious that he was not right about this’; ‘the notion…seems to escape Boghossian’). Time and again he interrupts his narrative to bring the evil relativists on stage behind him, so we can shout at them like a pantomime audience. Look out, it's Simon Schaffer! It's Michel Foucault, with waxed moustaches and a black cape! Boo! Hiss! They're behind you (for a given local value of ‘behind’)!I imagine that fifty or sixty years ago, histories of the scientific revolution presented a standard timeline of Great Men And Their Discoveries. Happily, things have moved on a bit since then; and yet, reading Wootton, I found myself yearning for some basic facts and figures about what actually happened and who did what. In the end, this is not (as its subtitle claims) a ‘history of the scientific revolution’ at all, but rather a history of the attitudes and thought processes that contributed to or grew out of it. Instead of looking at a steady progress of breakthroughs and developments, Wootton concerns himself with changes in the era's conceptual tools; he analyses texts in great detail, focusing on specific items of vocabulary as markers of changing attitudes – indeed, some chapters seem to consist of little more than a timeline of neologisms – and he lavishes much more time and attention on the coining of such terms as ‘discovery’, ‘fact’ or ‘experiment’ than he does on actual discoveries, facts or experiments.I have a very high tolerance of this kind of semantic approach, but even I found it a bit exhausting after a while. Finally hitting a chapter on Newton, you rub your hands with anticipation, only to read: ‘My first goal in this chapter, then, is to establish why Newton was hostile to the word “hypothesis”…’ and your heart just sinks. Wootton's arguments about how language reflects mental attitudes are well-made and convincing, but what you don't get in this book is much sense of the grubby reality of early-modern science – the long nights, the sweating over furnaces, the trial and error of different practical approaches.Combined with his combative stance vis-à-vis other historical treatments, it all serves to make his undoubted learning sound uncomfortably like pedantry in places. (This is not helped by a somewhat finicky approach to notation: Wootton uses Latin numerals for endnotes and Roman numerals for footnotes, so that many sentences end in a superscripted mishmash of characters: ‘…even then it was at first confined to political revolutionsˣˣˣⁱᵛ⁴¹’.)Overall, I'm unsure how much I'd recommend this. On the one hand, it really has changed the way I think about the long seventeenth century, especially in terms of how I interpret the language of all these early scientists. And fundamentally I share Wootton's impatience with a lot of relativist history. All the same, the sad truth is that I'm just left craving a plainer, more chronological description of the key breakthroughs of the period. Doubtless many such histories exist, but this one, which positions itself as a new standard, feels too polemical to be in a position to fully replace them."
1,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25942645-mark-hebwood,3,"I was so looking forward to liking this book. But in the end, I did not really warm to it. I do not say this lightly, and it even takes me some courage to admit it. Why so? Because the history of ideas is a subject close to my heart, and I wrote a longish essay at university about the development of historiography in the 17th century. That does not mean I am an expert on this subject - far from it - but it does mean that I researched some of the dynamics this book explores in quite some depth, and that I was hoping to re-discover the joy I had at university through reading the book. But for the most part, I did not, and here is why:This book is a proper work of scholarly researchNow, this of course would rather speak in favour of it than against it. But after decades spent outside the world of academia, I had forgotten what academic research can be like. The part I had forgotten is that many scholars find it necessary to define the scope of their topic clinically, aiming to make clear precisely where they stand relative to other scholars, how they differ from other research, and who they regard as their intellectual influence.And again, there is not necessarily anything wrong with this. But, come on, David, was it really necessary to spend 50 pages on whether the term ""scientific revolution"" is appropriate or not to describe the three centuries since the discovery of America? The term was invented by Thomas Kuhn, a key scholar in the field, whose book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions was met with so much acclaim that the key term from its title re-surfaced in the research of other eminent thinkers (notably Alexandre Koyre, The Astronomical Revolution: Copernicus, Kepler, Borelli. Now, apparently, the term ""revolution"" is so ingrained in the scholarly psyche that we need a tedious chapter discussing whether naming conventions established by contemporary scholars are appropriate or not. I was hoping this book would deepen my insights into a crucial development in the history of ideas. Certainly, one or two pages on this would have sufficed? So I was off to a disappointing start. In fact, I would have preferred it if David had discussed his research methodology to put his analysis onto a sound footing. Surprisingly, David chose not to talk about that at all. That is surprising in a work of scholarly research. But worse than being merely surprising, in the case of this monograph, it is also disappointing. It is disappointing because it omits a necessary building block without which much of what David says lacks rigour. Well, I thought so, anyway. Methodology: What's in a word?The methodology that I am quibbling with is a linguistic approach to historical analysis. Frequently, David traces the usage of a certain expression back through the ages, and identifies a time when the expression was not widely used. He then concludes that the concept the expression denotes cannot have existed in the time period before it was coined, and by extension concludes that the concept behind the expression developed first with the emergence of the word.The issue I have with this method is subtle. I do not deny that language reflects 'reality', and that speakers (users of the technology 'language') define words through usage and consensus of what they stand for. The expression 'internet' did not exist in ancient Greece, the word 'gay' meant something entirely different in 1730 than it does now, and there is rarely ever the need today to use the word 'abacus', for example.So yes, I agree that language reflects society, and that 'linguistic archaeology' can be a useful and appropriate tool to infer the state of mind of past societies or communities. But I wonder how this method needs to be applied, and what the conclusions are that it allows.How to apply the toolThe problem with ""linguistic archaeology"" is that it requires a statistician, not a historian, to use it properly. The first time David uses the linguistic method is in his discussion of the term ""discovery"". Basically, he says that prior to the discovery of America there was no term in the European languages that expressed the concept of ""first finding evidence for something hitherto unknown"". David argues that the absence of the term also denotes the absence of the concept, and highlights the dominance of the Aristotelian, anti-empirical, method. I actually find David's idea convincing, and brilliantly insightful in principle. But I do not trust myself to accept if fully. And the reason is that David has not shown me evidence that frequency of usage actually jumped after 1492 from near-zero to something significantly non-zero. Actually, he never even defines what metric he uses to identify an increase in usage. It is number of occurrences per text per year? If so, where are the numbers? I want to see a bar chart. And this introduces another problem - how long does the time series have to be before I can conclude that the word 'discovery' really did not exist pre-Columbus? 100 years? 200? If I apply the benchmark of modern science, I could not accept the hypothesis as 'true' unless I can show that the frequency of usage increased to a significant level within a clearly defined confidence interval. And that is a problem unless I count words in all relevant texts on a given subject since antiquity.To be fair to David, he does mention EEBO and ECCO (Early English Books Online; Eighteenth Century Collections Online) and comments on the efficiency of search algorithms these facilities offer (p592), so there is evidence that he applied some form of structured statistical anaysis. But he never goes into his methodology, he never shows us the results, and he most certainly does not publish the numerical evidence. None of this invalidates his insights. But what I would see as lack of rigour in this regard diminishes the confidence I have in David's results. And this is a problem because his methodology of linguistic archaeology permeates the book. I suspect David is far more gifted linguist than he is a statistician. What conclusions can we draw when applying the tool?To make things worse, I did often not agree entirely with the conclusions he drew. To stay with the example of ""discovery"", David concludes that prior to the discovery of America, the concept of 'discovery' did not exist, because the word did not exist. But I wonder. To me, it is more plausible to suggest that discoveries were happening so rarely in pre-'Americodiscovery' times that people had not coined a word for it. So after Columbus, the Aristotelian stranglehold on natural philosophy weakened sufficiently to allow 'findings that had hitherto not been made' to occur at an ever-increasing rate, and because of this a catchy expression had to be coined. This interpretation changes the gist of David's argument only subtly, but I think the difference in viewpoint is still important enough to mention. It is different to say ""the frequency of discoveries increased materially"" from ""discoveries did not exist pre-Columbus"". But it is a beautiful bookSo I must admit, what I see as vagueness in the key methodology David employs did not allow me to trust his findings as much as I would have needed to for a truly satisfactory learning experience. But there are chapters in the book in which it did live up to my expectations. These are chapters 4 to 6, in which David brilliantly lays out the interplay between discoveries and the impact they have on the way we view the world. The discovery of America was to be the ultimate death-knell for the Aristotelian 4-sphere model of the world, which in turn paved the way for the development of perspective painting and a commensurate re-interpretation of the position of 'man' in the world, and of the world in the cosmos. The book is full of beautifully reproduced paintings, drawings, and woodcuts. At one point, I was so excited by the illustrations that I thought I'd buy a first-edition copy of Robert Hooke's Micrographia. I even found one on Abe Books for £80,000, plus £12 shipping. Twelve pounds shipping? The cheek of it...Ok so I didn't buy it. But I did buy a facsimile copy. And I bought some other books from the time, like Johannes Kepler's Somnium, or Francis Godwin's Man in the Moone, arguably the first ever science fiction novel.So in the end, I did have a fun time with the book, and you can see I did get excited about the time. But since it is a proper scholarly treatise, and not pop-science, I could not get past what I saw as a methodological weakness. But if your opinion on this differs, or you are able to overlook the issue, you will probably gain interesting insights reading it. So in the end, I would still recommend the book, even though I did not get the rich intellectual experience I was hoping for."

An exploration of how science developed, what tools and cultural conditions made it possible, and how and why it has progressed. It is also presents a very clear understanding of what science is and why it works for explicating nature and making progress in prediction. I teach History and Philosophy of Biology at my university and this has been a treasure trove in detailing the nuances of how and why science is what it is today. A book rich in historical details that I will return to again and again I'm sure. "

In other words it was the foundation of the mindset of modern people and a clear break from all traditional societies which came before it. It deserves the name revolution. The author looks at many of the strands of this epochal change from causes to long lasting effects. very good."
5,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2184529-justin-evans,2,"This is probably a very important book to read if you're a philosopher of science who thinks that the theories of phlogiston and evolution are of equal validity. Of course, those people do not exist. This is clearly a failure of editing, agenting, and a triumph of misleading marketing. This book is not at all a general reader's book about the scientific revolution, and certainly not about the invention of science. it is, instead, scholarly articles embedded in a polemic against postmodernists (the book was apparently conceived in 1982). Others have written about the book's many structural flaws; I will just note two intellectual flaws. First, Wootton opposes the sociology of science, because they approach science sociologically, without any regard for the truth claims of scientific theories. Does he feel the same way about the sociology of religion, I wonder? To make my point clear: sociologists study human interactions. They do not care what those interactions are *about*, and if they did, they would be betraying the point of sociology. Second, Wootton's positive arguments are horrific. To take the most obvious: he claims that Columbus' discovery* of the Americas made science possible, by introducing the very concept of discovery. It was not possible to 'discover' gravity, in other words, without the concept of discovery; without that concept, one could just go on adjusting already existing theories, rather than taking account of new facts (he also covers the invention of the idea of the fact). Slight problem here: Columbus' 'discovery' of the Americas was also the Americans' 'discovery' of Europe. And yet, science did not develop in the Americas until after the Europeans had really, really, really 'discovered' it. Why not? Because concepts are useless in the absence of economic development, political support, and so on. Science may rely on the concept of discovery *grammatically* (Wootton loves him some Wittgenstein, and is at pains to show that Wittgenstein was not a relativist), but not *historically*. There is nothing here about the importance of economic development for the development of science, which is no failing in an academic article about the concept of 'discovery,' but a rather glaring one in a book about the scientific revolution. A true disappointment. *: Columbus did not, of course, 'discover' the Americas. They'd been discovered for some time by, you know, the many civilizations spread out over the continent for a millenium or more. Wootton does not care. "
6,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,5,"This is no lightweight book - both literally and metaphorically. It packs in nearly 600 pages of decidedly small print, and manages to assign about 10 per cent of these simply to deciding what is meant by a 'scientific revolution' (the subtitle is 'a new history of the scientific revolution'). While warning of the importance of being aware of the change in meaning of some terms, the author successfully demolishes the arguments of those who argue that terms like science, scientist and revolution can't be applied to the seventeenth century because they're anachronistic. (He doesn't say it, but this is a bit like saying you shouldn't call a dinosaur a dinosaur because the word wasn't in use when they were around.)What's also very apparent in a section on history and philosophy of science is why so many scientists are dubious of philosophers and historians of science. When an adult can seriously suggest that we can't say that current science is better than that of the Romans - all we can say, suggest these philosophers and historians of science, is that our science is different - it makes it very clear that some academics have spent far too much time in ivory towers examining their philosophical navels and really haven't got a clue about the real world.We then get into the main content of the gradual process of science, in the current sense of the word, coming into being. It's certainly interesting in a dry way to see this analytically dissected, though the slightly tedious nature of the exposition makes it clear why popular science has to simplify and concentrate on the narrative if readers are to be kept on track. I appreciate that an academic like David Wootton wants to ensure that every i is dotted and t crossed, but I think that all the arguments of this book could have been made in half the length by cutting back on some of the detail and repetition.This book, then, is not popular science in the usual sense, but neither is it a textbook. If you are prepared to put the effort in, you will receive huge insights into what lies beneath: one view of the true history of science. That's why the book gets 5 stars. I've learned more about the history of science from this one book than any other five I can think of that I have read in the past. I have to emphasise that 'one view' part, though. History is - well, not an exact science. As far as I can see (I'm not equipped to criticise the content) this is a superbly well researched piece of scientific history, but in the end, the conclusions drawn are down to Wootton and he enjoys making it clear where he is strongly contradicting other historians of science.There's a huge amount to appreciate here. Wootton convincingly demolishes Kuhn's idea that scientific revolutions require heavy disagreements among scientists, showing how exposure to experience (often thanks to new technology, such as the telescope) can swing the argument surprisingly painlessly. And he shows what a remarkable influence words have on the development of science (music to the ear of a writer). Perhaps most remarkable of all is Wootton's careful, very detailed exposition of the idea that the real trigger for 'modern' scientific thought was Columbus's discovery of America, which demolished the existing model of the Earth and made it possible to see how experience can triumph over the philosophical quagmire of authority.If you've a fair amount of time to spare and really want to dig into the way that the scientific revolution came about, I would heartily recommend giving this title a try."
7,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180643-jim-coughenour,4,"This book will look, I trust, realist to relativists and relativist to realists: that is how it is meant to look.The Invention of Science isn't an easy book to read. Neither is it particularly difficult, thanks to Wootten's felicitous prose. But it does require a high degree of concentration as Wootten ranges both far and deep in his exploration of how ""science"" got its start. His argument is intentionally provocative, precise, plainly stated and copiously supported. The writing is lively, witty, even barbed – qualities generally absent in scholarly texts. I also appreciated Wootten's approach to the footnote/endnote conundrum: references are saved for the endnotes to accommodate readers who want to hunt down sources; but comments that amplify the argument are placed at the bottom of the page, to keep the reader in the flow. In addition, he's placed a series of ""longer notes"" at the end of the book, where his basic arguments are outlined with brio (and more ancillary texts).In Wootten's account, science is essentially ""the triumph of experience over philosophy."" All the standard characters are there – Galileo, Kepler, Boyle, Newton – but also an entertaining, anarchic host of lesser-known scientists, mathematicians, theologians and philosophes, doctors and clergymen. Wootten gives the standard accounts an interesting spin, looking as much at the tools of thought as at the tools of discovery and invention (telescopes, prisms, air pumps). He investigates the history and meaning of words such as discovery, invention, facts, experiments, laws, hypotheses, and even more ordinary and apparently obvious terms such as progress and common sense. Another excellent review on this page found this procedure a problem. I didn't. I was fascinated – although, as I said at the start, one needs a strong cup of coffee and plenty of quiet concentration to make it through a few of these chapters.This is a book that fully lives up to its title. I read it after reading Noam Chomsky's recent lectures – as a kind of luxuriant, deeply satisfying postscript – but that was just to amuse myself."

The book is great interest for people that are into the debate of Realism vs. Relativism in the field of understanding 'history of science'. The author is neither realist nor relativist he is some what between and calls himself constructivist. He criticised relativists a lot more than realists in this book."

This is clearly a scholarly work, however I only felt that about 10% of it was above my head (e.g. using historian/philosophy jargon that I needed to either look up or just skip over. Having had one college course discussing Kuhn helped me.) It is a long book, and having made the effort to read it I now regret not having taken a few notes, as there were many ""hmmm, very interesting!"" moments that changed my basic understanding of an aspect of history. (The whole thing about beliefs about the shape of the Earth was way more fascinating than the cartoonish impression I think many people retain after school.) Wootton's basic thesis is that a series of inventions, discoveries, and new ideas mostly within the 16th-17th centuries were necessary game-changers for real science as we know it to develop. He makes quite a thorough case for each point, though I have seen other published reviews aren't quite convinced these developments aren't just part of a more continuous arc of history. Despite wishing it was a bit shorter, I'm glad I read this. Whether or not his thesis is important to the average person, all the discussions were worthwhile updates to my understanding of western history.- An added note: Wootton's thesis was way more convincing to me than that of ""The Swerve"" by Greenblatt. That (shorter) book was definitely an enjoyable read, but, again, as an amateur, I was not convinced by its grand claims about Lucretius."

These included more efficient ways to disseminate information, such as the printing press, which also aided in building a scientific community; the turn toward both practical experiment and mathematics; the development of the very ideas of progress and discovery; and the way changes in scientific theories, and modern science itself, often required new concepts and language. The author offers prime examples such as the development of the concepts of fact, theory, progress, experiment, law, discovery, etc. This volume is steeped in meticulous historical detail of the scientific figures and times of the 16th and 17th century.

If you’re interested in increasing your awareness of many of the important concepts which have shaped our modern science and thought, this book is for you.

13,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4828849-michael-burnam-fink,4,"The workings of science are almost entirely naturalized. For us, it seems natural that scientists discover facts about the natural universe, and that they do so by formulating hypotheses and designing experiments to test those hypotheses. But to someone in the in the 15th century, this process was entirely alien. Wootton aims to discuss the scientific revolution, the period between Tycho's Nova of 1572 and the publication of Newton's Principia in 1687, where science became an accepted mode of knowledge. But the real objective is a broadside against a school of scholarship which has wrecked proper history of science, namely David Bloor's Strong Programme, and an undue relativism in history of science, with it's origins in Thomas Kuhn's paradigm shift theory of scientific revolutions. This book is at its best in discussing the world of knowledge prior to the scientific revolution. I was entirely unaware of the controversy about the location of the sphere of land and the sphere of water in Aristotelian physics, or the belief that the oceans were literally above dry land, as preserved in the phrase 'high seas'. There's a lot of good linguistic explanation of the origins and usages of words like experiment, fact, and discovery. Wootton's argument is that the discovery and exploitation of the New World provided the initial crack in the armor of scholastic Aristotelian knowledge, since the Americas were so obviously there and the ancients had said nothing about them. An interesting graph of sales of a popular Ptolemaic astronomy textbook shows a dip in sales in the 1570s, since a nova cannot be explained in a universe of divine spheres, and then a collapse with Galileo's discover of the moons of Jupiter and phases of Venus around 1608. The old knowledge was dead.But how did the new knowledge arise? Here, Wootton is sadly less detailed, talking a little about the various uses of Torricelli's experiment. And of course, the printing press played a key role in bringing down the price of books and allowing precise copies of complex technical diagrams, something scribes were hopeless at reproducing accurately. But where there should be evidence, there is mostly invective against postmodern relativists.Now I'll admit that I'm part of the science and technology studies tradition Wootton rails against. He's right that the Strong Programme is often poorly used, and that relativism misses the key ability of science to accurately describe the natural world. Yet, even a sophisticated realism has trouble getting out of the recursive trap that 'successful science accurately describes the natural world, which we know because of successful science, which has been shown to accurately describe the natural world, etc"". There were experimenters prior to Galileo, but as Wootton discusses, their discoveries died, because they did not exist in a social context which allowed for scientific discovery."

16,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5469227-d-l-morrese,5,"Wootton claims there are two major philosophical camps among those who write about the history of science. He calls them the 'realists' and the 'relativists'. The realists regard science as essentially a formalized application of human common sense. To them, science is a systematic method of asking questions about the natural world, which leads to reasonably accurate answers. As these answers build upon one another, collective human understanding grows. It's almost inevitable. Relativists, on the other hand, see science as an aspect of human culture. Both the questions it asks and the answers it finds are culturally dependent, so it never obtains any objective knowledge and consequently cannot progress in the sense that it gets us closer to a true understanding of what the world actually is or how it works. Instead, it creates stories about the world that work for a particular culture at a particular time. Relativism, he claims, ""has been the dominant position in the history of science"" for some time (Pg. 117). (This seems odd to me since, of the two extremes, relativism seems the most absurd, but that's what he says. Since he's the expert and I'm not, I'm sadly willing to entertain the idea that he may be right about this.)Wootton sees some merit in both of these perspectives, and this book is his attempt to reconcile them. His self-appointed task can be summarized in these quotes that appear near the end of the book:The task, in other words, is to understand how reliable knowledge and scientific progress can and do result from a flawed, profoundly contingent, culturally relative, all-too-human process. (pg. 541)Hence the need for an historical epistemology which allows us to make sense of the ways in which we interact with the physical world (and each other) in the pursuit of knowledge. The central task of such an epistemology is not to explain why we have been successful in our pursuit of scientific knowledge; there is no good answer to that question. Rather it is to track the evolutionary process by which success has been built upon success; that way we can come to understand that science works, and how it works. (Pg. 543)And this is what he does in an extensively researched and exhaustively documented account of the development and evolution of science. The way of thinking, which we now call science, truly was new and revolutionary. It emerged primarily in Western Europe between the times of Columbus and Newton. Wootton doesn't claim a single igniting spark, but he gives Columbus's voyage in 1492 credit for providing a powerful challenge to the prevailing belief that the ancients had known everything worth knowing. Although Columbus himself never accepted that the land he found by traveling west from Spain was a previously unknown continent, others soon came to this realization, and it showed that the authority of Ptolemy, Aristotle, and Holy Scripture were not as absolute as people believed. Here was an entirely new world, with strange animals, plants, and people, which the respected and authoritative ancients had known nothing about. Possibly just as significant was that the existence of these two huge continents was not found through philosophical reflection or by divine revelation. This new land was 'discovered' by a bunch of scruffy sailors—commoners!From here, he explains that these emerging ideas added new words and new (and modern) definitions to old words, such as 'discovery', 'fact', 'experiment', 'objectivity', and 'evidence'. These all have their current meanings because of the scientific way of viewing the world that emerged between the 16th and 18th centuries. (Personally, I think his discussion of the word 'evidence' goes into more detail and greater length than needed to make his point, but for those in academia, it may be helpful).He also shows how culture influenced the development of scientific thinking. More often than not, the culture of this time hindered rather than helped. Prior to the scientific revolution, philosophical disputes were decided through clever rhetoric, creative verbal arguments, and appeals to tradition and authority. Because of this, early practitioners of science felt it necessary to justify themselves by citing the works of long-dead philosophers like Epicurus, Democritus, and Lucretius. Although none had the authority of Aristotle, they were ancient, which implied a certain respectability. The new scientific way of thinking, on the other hand, ""sought to resolve intellectual disputes through experimentation."" (pg. 562)I am more of an interested observer of science than I am a practitioner, but I have to admit that the realist view seems far closer to the truth to me than does the relativist concept. It is undeniable that science is done by scientists, that scientists are people, and that people are shaped by the cultures in which they live. But modern science originally began by challenging the assumptions of the culture in which it first emerged, and it retains that aspect of cultural skepticism to this day. I suspect that many current scientists are motivated, at least in part, by the dream of possibly overturning a prevailing theory or showing that it is somehow flawed or incomplete. In the 17th century, challenging cultural assumptions could bring a long, uncomfortable visit with inquisitors followed by a short, hot time tied to a stake. Today, it can bring a scientist fame and fortune.Scientific progress isn't inevitable, but it can and does reveal culturally independent facts. Scientists are products of their cultures, but the process of science intentionally strives to put those cultural assumptions aside. It may be the only human activity that does so. "
17,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4401570-skjam,3,"At the beginning of the Fifteenth Century, there were no scientists as we understand the term, and no science. Received wisdom from Aristotle and Galen ruled knowledge and philosophy. Then a series of changes in technology and the way people investigated nature brought a new way of thinking. By the end of the Seventeenth Century there were scientists, an intellectual community of people who had created a process we call “science.”This book covers the history of those centuries, and how the Scientific Revolution began. David Wootton is a professor of Intellectual History at the University of London and an Anniversary Professor at the University of York, and the Sixteenth to Eighteenth Centuries are part of his focus.There were, according to this book, several contributing factors to the Scientific Revolution. The printing press allowed ideas to be widely spread and preserved for long times. Perspective drawing allowed more accurate pictures to be published–you could build something from plans! The telescope and microscope opened up new worlds to human vision. Readily available compasses improved navigation.Plus of course, the “discovery” of America showing there were entire landmasses unknown to the ancient philosophers, and a nova in 1572 that revealed the heavens were not fixed and unchangeable as Aristotle had decreed. The old answers no longer satisfied, and people began methodically testing to see what actually happened when, for example, you floated ice in water.It wasn’t an overnight change; several of the pieces took a while before their true significance or usefulness was understood. At first, much of it was simply mathematicians applying their skills to astronomy or ballistics. But over time, the changes accelerated, so that by the time of Isaac Newton, what he did with refraction of light was clearly the scientific method.This is a college level text, with copious footnotes and end notes, bibliography and index. Professor Wootton spends a great deal of time tracking down earliest uses of various words used for science in a science-related context, like “fact” and “hypothesis.” This can get tedious, but he’s trying to show how the new way of thinking had to adapt and invent vocabulary for ideas that simply didn’t exist in that form before. Thankfully, there are also illustrations throughout, and a center section of color plates.The author also has a section devoted to calling out historians he disagrees with, primarily relativists. Apparently, there is a school of thought that science is effectively a group delusion, with more socially prominent or connected scientists imposing their views on their colleagues. Creationism is just as good science as evolution, it would seem. The author claims that there are such things as theories that don’t stand up to facts. I am not educated enough to evaluate his conclusions or his description of other historical philosophies; he may have misrepresented them.Recommended primarily for history students and science buffs. The casual reader would probably be better off with biographies of the various individual people involved, many of whom led interesting lives that are barely touched on in this volume. (Women and non-Europeans who helped advance the cause of science are barely mentioned, mostly to say they existed.)"
18,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,5,"Good book on the science revolution of the 17 and 18 centuries…the ground is pretty well covered on that topic, but this book does bring some fresh perspective. The writing is good for the most part, though it sometimes goes into a mass od detail when it could have been more concise. The arguments about what the revolution was are clearly laid out by topic and section and are free from repetition. In short, this book exceeded my expectations quite a bit. So, I give this one a 5. The book makes an interesting argument and is well written for the most part. The argument is easy to follow and the material streamlined. Well worth the read if you’re interested in the history of science. "
19,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,2,"Early errors bring book's reliability into questionOne clear early error? The claim that Newton himself couldn't have used the word ""revolution"" in talking about his science.Erm, I didn't need Google to tell me about the ""Glorious Revolution"" in 1688 in Newton's Britain — so-called **at that time.** (Google did tell me that this was apparently the first use of the word ""revolution"" in English.) And, the author is himself British — he definitely should know that.But, but ... that was after Newton's annus mirabilis of 1666, right? Well, there was no such ""annus mirabilis"" for Newton, first. Second, even if there were, the Glorious Revolution was well before the publishing of his Opticks.Speaking of myths, yes, authors don't write the material on dust jackets. That said, the dust jacket repeats the old chestnuts about Bruno and Galileo being martyrs to science. The story is more complicated than that, at best, for Galileo, and totally untrue for Bruno, who was executed as a theological heretic. (This dust cover had me approaching the book skeptically even before I cracked the spine.Add in that the author takes a seemingly simplistic view of Wittgenstein and post-Wittgensteinian schools of philosophical thought and their relation to Continental philosophy, and then its relation to modern science, and Wootton's writing has other questions raised.Add in what others say about dense style and other things, and per the comments above and more, some of the density being fluff, and no, this is not an earthshaking book. The sound basic ideas in this book could have been written in a more direct style in at least 100 fewer pages."
20,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,2,"I had hopes this book was about the invention of science, in part because I was trained and worked as a scientist. Alas, the book turned out to be about the philosophy of the history of the history of science. Most of the book was about the origin of words needed to understand science. For example the author spent about 75 pages on the word ""fact."" He pointed out that before 1650 there was no such word because the western world had no such concept of a scientific fact. With the beginning of experiments in the 17th century, which was the invention of science, they finally needed a word to refer to a scientific fact established by an experiment. OK, interesting, but 75 pages: give me a break.The reason the invention didn't occur until the 17th century is that there was no need. Aristotle had explained every thing. For example Aristotle opined the obvious that heavy bodies fall faster than light bodies. Do you think Aristotle could have taken 5 minutes to see if that was true, which of course it wasn't. So for almost 2,000 years the world was perfectly happy with Aristotle's reams of nonsense.Bottom line, not recommended for anyone except philosophers of the history of science."
21,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/848432-rebecca-grace,3,"There was some really good stuff in here, most notably discussion about how the language of science evolved (evidence, proof, theory, hypothesis, experiential and then experimental, etc.) and developed along with the new ways of thinking and looking at the world. However, this is SUCH a dry, academic read that I could only take it in small doses. A convoluted and tortuous writing style plus constant bickering with the views of rival science historians reminded me of a crazy professor out mowing his lawn, rehashing arguments with his adversaries except THIS time he bests them every time... I wish he had just told the story of the invention of science, as promised by the book title. A more accurate title for what actually lies between the covers of this book would be ""My Fellow Historians Are All Stupid: An Attack On Other Scholars' Views of Science History."""

25,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1816538-maggie-roessler,0,"There's a zombie haunting this book, a dead horse made of straw. Its name is Relativist and it thinks that ""reality does not constrain the beliefs we can hold about the real world"" (p. 517). The only problem is, no human, flesh n blood relativist actually defines relativism in this (sloppy, nonsensical) way. Wootton's arguments are tediously uncharitable - to kill a straw man, all you need's a dull sword. The purported triumph of his daringly reasonable stance between naïve realism and relativism is as boring as it is superficial. To take one example in a smidgin more depth: the Strong Programme's method of investigating the causes of false and true beliefs in the same way doesn't stop you from noticing when evidence plays a role in why we accept true beliefs. According to the symmetry principal, we can recognize that reality does constrain true beliefs, as long as we are ready to see that it constrains false beliefs too. Which Wootton must accept, since he considers the triumph of modern science to be its recognition that most of its theories are probably false. ""Science offers reliable knowledge (that is, reliable prediction and control), not truth"" (p. 570). Ergo knowledge needn't be true! ""We make progress, but unlike those who go hawking and hunting, we may never catch our prey"" (p. 398).So what is scientific progress, if not a piling up of truths? Progress, for Wootton, is ever greater powers of prediction and control. The real relativist question here, I'd contend, is whether prediction and control is good per se, or just good relative to the culture of science. But piercing that thicket would require peering beyond the world of white European men for half a sec, which is something Wootton is not prepared to do. Although! He does speak of ""Women"" four whole times, according to the index. In the final instance he goes so far as to admit that some books written to explain science to women (""the seeming obsession with the education of ladies"") were actually read by women - ""the female audience was more than fictional"" (p. 474). Gee. Oh and ""the true length of human history"" starts with written records, which means an awful lot of tribes were languishing in pre-history until colonialists were kind enough to swing by and discover them.But this is just garden-variety, racist, patriarchal bullshit. What's interesting and worthwhile in Wootton doesn't concern the transition of pre-history to history, but rather the move from ""cyclical time"" to ""linear time"" with the scientific revolution as the decisive split. In cyclical time:- there is no discovery, only exploration or interpretation - knowledge is deductive and Aristotle is the ultimate authority- Scientists (including Newton) assume everything big was known by ancients - Plants and animals have symbolic meanings- Land is named after saints and kings- Curiosity is a viceIn linear time:- DISCOVERY! is a whole thing- Knowledge is empirical and experience is the ultimate authority- Scientists fight over priority and name things after themselves- New plants and animals are just new (ant eater, opossum have no symbolic meaning)- Land is named after common sailors- Curiosity is a virtueOnce upon a time, not so long ago, we thought the universe was nested spheres. Earth surrounded by water, water surrounded by air, and air surrounded by fire. The center of the earth was the center of the universe.It wasn't that simple. God is not sterile. God gathered the water to make dry land, where all the elements interact. But then where was the center of water? Had the earth distorted its shape, growing or shriveling its geometrical center away from the center of gravity? How did these two spheres, of water and of earth, interact? Columbus thought that water protruded from earth like a breast and that the nipple held terrestrial paradise. No, it must have been aquatic paradise.Then, in 1503, Vespucci published Mundus Novus. The women of the antipodes have no scales. They light fires and feed their children meat. Alas, our planet is a single globe, terraqueous, a theatrum orbis terrarium, there's no diving off this stage. ""The new facts were killer facts"" (p. 136). New, sexy, avant garde, the ancients never heard of this.Now Copernicus was ready, in 1543, to calculate the earth spinning round the center. In 1576 Thomas Digges was the first to print the stars not in a sphere, but ""scattered over the outer margins of the page until they disappeared"" (p. 155). Giordano Bruno dreamed of other worlds, of ""creatures on the sun, quite different from ourselves, who thrive on heat"" (p. 147). In 1592 he was subject to eight full years of solitary confinement and burned alive on 17 of February, 1600 in a square in Rome. He said our planet shone from afar like a moon.So our enlightenment proceeds. So our flames consume us. We have no more nested spheres. No center. Infinite, cornerless, shining.***Another precondition for science, besides the invention of discovery and the discovery of America was double-entry bookkeeping. ""Bookkeeping turns everything into a notional cash value"" (p. 164). When a partnership's dissolved, there's no endless back n forth of spats and slaps and tears and slaughtered pigs. There's a split of cash and basta, see ya at the pub next week asshole.We have turned the world into math. It started with merchants, then seeped into visual art. The invention of perspective painting (early 1400s) placed the painter's eye at the centric point. ""Even when art is at its most objective (or rather especially when art is at its most objective), we make it and we find ourselves in it"" (p. 166). Precision spurns the group. A firm grasp of what is true needs one firm hand to grasp it. This is why NGOs love youth. We snatch boys and girls at their peak of haughty individualism, too old to fear their parents, too young to love their kids. They are ready to jilt the system and draw their own lives, aiming towards the infinite point on the horizon that only they can see.***Math infects. There are the shapes you see, and then there is geometry. A 17th century chair is frilly and swoopy and lush. But Father Niceron's demonstration on how to draw a chair in his 1652 Curious Perspective is Bauhaus pur. The artist does not see the chair before him. He sees an abstraction. Labelled, clean, unfit for any ass. It is an ideal chair. It is not a chair.You: Finite nested spheresMe: The vanishing point""often hidden by a seemingly casually placed foot or a bit of drapery - the lurking presence of the infinite"" (p. 177)The new vision doesn't stop at bookkeeping and art. We want POWER. Brahe illustrates instruments that tell us how to read the sky in 1602. Vesalius employs Venetians to engrave dissected body parts - On the Fabric of the Human Body, 1543. Before Vesalius, they'd cut cadavers open while reading Galen aloud (p. 183). Now they print and distribute their idealized man-bit pics. Progress. Anatomy becomes a progressive science as thirsty up-and-comings kill their fathers(' theories). Hip hip hooray. To fully conquer and colonize the world, you have to prove dominion of the body. The body is a landscape seething with native bafflement and scorn. The dead white men see it, scale it, draw it, print it, use it to launch their careers. Like Falloppio and Colombo fighting over which of them discovered the clitoris in 1561.What Wootton's most jazzed about is how the new vision helped Regio Montanus work out how to measure parallaxes, which show how far a ""heavenly body"" is from earth. His instrument was promptly wrongly used to show that comets are sublunary. But then the nova appeared in 1572 and a comet in 1577 and Brahe's measurements placed them farther than the moon, indisputably refuting Aristotle's doctrine that nothing supralunary can change. Except for all those who disputed it. Brahe miscalculated the thickness of sunlight and concluded that the sun revolves around the earth. Galileo argued that comets were reflections or refractions, like rainbows. Other astronomers measured differently, in ways that vindicated the nested spheres, not his new ""sun, moon, and stars float freely like fish in the sea"" hypothesis. But no matter, we got there in the end, even if Wootton's killer fact was more of a slow-acting poison than a flung dagger. It doesn't really affect his argument, just dampens his hollow polemic. Onward!*** 1608 - invention of the telescope and the microscopeThe Scaling Revolution happened in one direction only. Enter the telescope and lo, we are very small and fuck our eyes are bad and this world was not made for us not even a little not at all. Galileo saw that Venus had phases from crescent to full and poof Ptolemy is done. ""The Mother of Love imitates Cynthia."" She orbits the sun. Odo van Maelcote announced it at a party on 18 May 1610 and boom, killer fact, no one can dare to doubt that the planets, sun, and moon revolve around the earth. Textbook men stop printing Sacrobosco's Sphere. Everyone starts writing and devouring science fiction to trigger that disorienting vertigo of insignificance.Meanwhile, no one's really bothered by the microscope. It launches no analogous uproar. Wootton says it's because this other new world was ""previously unknown; it was hard to establish how the new information it produced related to established knowledge"" (p. 216). If your game's too new, no one wants to play it. They like a couple bent rules, extensions, reversals. Genuine novelty is boring. Killer facts need victims. So Antonie van Leewenhock is not a hero for being the first, in 1676, to see a living creature invisible to the naked eye. No one writes the biography of the man who explored the genitalia of a louse, discovering its sperm.There may be other reasons too, why the microscope ignited little passion. The very vast inspires awe, the miniscule disgust. We cultivate noble hatred for the squirming, the repetitive, the senseless suck of life. We'd rather be infants again than gods.Or my pet theory - that the true revolution of the small-to-infinite, the shock of snowflakes turned to stars, cannot be won through the eyes. There are other forces - other vectors of change - playing out in the subsubsubcomponents of a fraction of an atom. They evade light, too little to be splashed by waves of color. So little they evade time and space, they flit and play in utterly unknown dramas, tiny tiny, all in and around our gallumphing scale. There are pantheons within my pinky toe.My pets. With them I duck, I flee these facts and their establishment - found, made, and decreed. Before facts, we only had Aristotle's endoxa, which are mere phenomena, or else logic. So goes Wootton's tale. His facts are true statements describing empirical reality, not metaphysically necessary truths of logic. I can't buy that this concept was invented during the 1600s. What about Socrates' orthos doxa for which one can provide a logos? Our ancestors said they knew things about the material world, save the odd skeptic or solipsist, so why shouldn't those be facts? What changed is their quantification and distribution. A mob can be summoned, called The Facts, and deployed against spongier ideas. Wootton's trying to be cool & radical, but it flops. Latour gets closer in talking of hardness and softness. The book made experience a fixture of polite society. The untold story here is - facts were new for who? When a meteorite fell at Lucé, Pays de la Loire in 1758, only peasants saw it. The members of the Royal Academy of Science, including Lavoisier, concluded that they were ridiculous. But in 1794 a meteorite explodes over academics and noblemen in Siena and it is less ""strange"" to imagine they fell from the sky. The softness of unreplicated facts is the softness of a woman's waist. Strange facts aspire to be plain and plainness is won through public replication. But who has the money and time to replicate and whose eyes count as public?***Now we have a new revolution. We've gone from pre-print to print to post-print. From the 14 to 16 hundreds ""the increase in the sheer quantity of available information [was] sufficient to generate a cultural revolution"" (p. 306). Testimony became the respectable foundation of science. For the first time, living white men of leisure could communicate in immutable, non-degrading units with other white men of leisure. Authority cracked and tumbled. The living overcame the dead. The living white men of leisure used this power to quantify the skies, to label body parts, to add up deaths per year and price life insurance. And we?***Wootton's point about experiments is that they're not new to modern science. Men proofed their theories before, but their findings didn't rattle anyone's frames. The axel that spun the revolution was the critical groups of men who read and replicated one another's observations. A scientific network, publishing, writing semi-public letters, using urine bottles and teams of horses to pump nature for information, torture her till she speaks. The inquisition lends itself to battle. A merry chap strikes the heart of his brother's theory, the death knell sounds, the enemy defeated, and voila, scientific progress.I have no close-knit community of experts. My friends do not ""vex nature,"" they extend her, play with her, chug her bounty, bind their wrists and swing from the hook of her. Our experiences do not qualify as experiments. Our artifices do not blindly mimic or expose. We do not lasso rainbows and fling them through urine bottles. We do not master; we do not win.***Laws. Descartes made 'em trendy, though his version didn't stick. For him, a law is universal, no, polyuniversal, it has to hold for any universe whatever. Because laws are God's and there's just the one God for all our teeming variety. We loosened up since then, and take any absolute regularity as a proper law. Though the God question remains unsolved. Does God will every single lawful instance? That's occasionalism, tied to voluntarism, which is that God chose the laws. One alternative is rationalism - the laws are necessary, even to God. But no one's buyin any of that in today's market. So? What is a law? This is history, not philosophy, so I still don't know. ""Quantum in se est,"" Lucretius wrote. As much as in it lies. My laws are unfurled from divine essences, but there's no divine will guiding the ropes. We co-create by playing the notes of existence like a song. The melody is the law, we riff and modulate. There's no hard breaks. Each change is music only in relation to its harmony or dissonance with what came before. Quantum in se est."

The book sometimes comes across as a bit all over the shop as the book treats with different subjects. It is not as the cover of the book states A new History Of The Scientific Revolution, which what I was actually looking for. It is obvious the author knows his stuff and is widely read, but I expected something different. "
27,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6934307-sam-eccleston,5,"The most apposite description of this work is encapsulated in one word: 'thorough'. Like most thoroughly researched works it is lengthy, but not, in this case, at the detriment of readability. Throughout the work Wooton presents the results of an extremely detailed historical investigation into seemingly every salient aspect of the cultural, linguistic, institutional, conceptual, and technological changes which facilitated and inspired the scientific revolution. The combination of his exhaustive knowledge of the minutiae of the relevant texts, periods and personalities, and his lucid and powerful conceptual analysis make his occasional broadsides against rival historical theories pretty convincing, particularly those directed against post-modernists and their fellow travelers. What is most convincing about the narrative is how it moves away from the abstract spaces in which academic discussions often occur (even in history) and locates the changes associated with the birth of science in the mess of the world they occurred in- lost texts, false starts, conceptual confusions, forgeries, plagiarism and all. This, above all, lends the 'ring of truth' to Wooton's account which is occasionally lacking in others."
28,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2579781-paul,5,"I thought this book was great, but I should start by saying that it's probably not for everyone. Wootton goes into excruciating detail about the history and philosophy of science and even traces the etymology of many scientific words to try and put the attitudes and statements of the early scienticians (scientographers?) into context.I will likely need to re-read this book some time in the future to really understand all the points he is making, because his reasoning is really quite thorough and deserves additional attention. I think I did not fully understand the compromise position he was staking out between the realists and the relativists - despite the fact that he says that the book will come off as realist to the relativists and relativist to the realists, as an armchair realist I didn't really see much evidence of strong relativist tendancies in his thinking. Either way, it was a measured and reasonable argument (and I am often suspicious of ""compromise"" positions, since very frequently I find that they are semantic wordgames used to make the person taking the position look more reasonable)."

Newton was one of the greatest scientists, physicists, and mathematicians of all time but only gets passing mention. Too much of the book is taken up by the evolution of words to describe the scientific revolution and not enough about the people who made it happen. Well researched but too academic for me. I finished the book but it was a slog."
31,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9498305-william-adams,4,"This monster book is actually an easy read because the concepts are not difficult. It is a history of the scientific revolution, which took place in Europe in the decades around 1600. The so-called revolution was a change in world-view among the intelligentsia that developed incrementally, not analogously to a sudden political revolution. The scientific revolution was stealthy and few people recognized it was even happening.Wootton identifies several events that led to the enormous change in thinking from the middle ages to the modern age. It started in 1572, he says, when astronomer Tycho Brahe observed a supernova. A new star had appeared in the sky, but that was simply not possible. According to Aristotle and everyone since him, the heavens were fixed and eternal. If heaven changed, then religion was called into question, and if you do that, where does it leave us mortal sinners? So a new star in the sky was not conceivable, yet there it was.Other events that shook up the status quo were the invention of the printing press with movable type, which created communities of like-minded intellectuals faster, and more broadly, than had ever before been possible. Ideas moved quickly and built upon each other rapidly. Today we would call it the network effect. After book printing, individuals who would be the future scientists were known to each other. Before books there were only a few scattered philosophers and crackpots.The invention of the telescope was huge, of course. Galileo didn’t invent the telescope but he perfected the lenses well enough to be useful for astronomy, and we know how that worked out when he discovered the moons of Jupiter in 1610.Wootton points out that the microscope was invented at the same time, since if you look into a telescope the wrong way it is essentially a microscope. But the microscope had virtually no influence on the development of scientific thinking at the time because there was no theoretical framework to enclose what was seen. You found incredible, squirming animals in pond water? How charming. It didn’t make any sense because it didn’t fit into any philosophy or theory of the world, so the microscope was ignored as a mere toy until much later. Science is not, and never was, only about observing the world. It has always been about trying to make sense of the world, and if something doesn’t make sense, it just doesn’t count.Also on the topic of Galileo’s discovery, Wootton makes the interesting point that the churchmen who refused to ‘look for themselves’ through Galileo’s telescope were not being self-defensively stubborn. They did not have our modern conception of what ‘observation’ means. For them, observation meant something like ‘evidence’ and that comes from testimony, as it does in a courtroom. Therefore Aristotle’s and Ptolemy’s evidence that all heavenly bodies revolve around Earth overwhelmed any nonsense a pipsqueak like Galileo might have to say, telescope or no.Wootton provides many unexpected insights into the history of science, such as revolutionary thinking provoked by the discovery of the perspective effect in painting, the invention of gunpowder, the practice of rubbing garlic on magnets. The pages turn themselves.One criticism of the book is that it seems to be structured around the discredited Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, that you can’t think about something you have no words for. Wootton goes to great etymological lengths to show that common modern terms, like ‘observation’ and ‘experiment’ had to be invented and defined, true enough, but he attaches a lot more significance to linguistic development than I think is warranted and may even get cause and effect reversed at times.Along those lines, Wootton does not himself distinguish between observed phenomena and propositions about those phenomena. He seems to think they are the same thing, and he calls phenomena in the natural world “facts,” which is wrong and confusing. A proposition can be true or false, but a rock is just a rock.Wootton also makes much of the ‘progress’ of science but never defines what that is, a remarkable oversight given his other linguistic obsessions. I infer he means that scientific measurement has become more precise over time and consequently prediction has become more accurate. That is a convincing definition of progress offered near the very end, but throughout the book he writes as though there were more at stake. He repeatedly refers to something called ‘irreversible knowledge’ without defining it, suggesting science progresses in knowledge or truth, which is disputable.The book is totally Euro-centric. There is little mention of the development of scientific thinking in China, the Arab world, among the Incas, and so on. Maybe there wasn’t any. I doubt that.The last few chapters concern historiography rather than history and seem tacked on. They are much less satisfying for being cursory, and should have been developed into a separate book.In the hardback volume there is an entire signature of beautiful color plates, and monochrome figures are presented throughout the book, some of them helpful. The bibliography is extensive (up to about 2004) and the book is well-indexed. Recommended."

33,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10562281-roger-smitter,5,"The first sentence of a 768 page is a surprise: “The world we live in is much younger than you might expect.” (p. 3)Soon we are reading stories about the work of the early (very early) scientists; Wootton does a powerful job of bringing the early “scientists” who changed the world. He gives us a very different view of science that we may have heard in high school and college courses—especially for those of us who took the required number of courses and never read a book about science again. At the same time, this book shows that non-scientists can find interest and knowledge about the people (almost 100% males in this book) who made science emerge. The author makes some difficult ideas about the growth of science a topic that most of us can understand. For example, “The word “scientist” was very slow to become established for the straightforward that it was (like the word ‘television’) an illegitimate from Latin and Greek.” (28) Another “new idea” showed up in 155, 4 “Discovery is not in itself a scientific idea but rather an idea that is fundamental form science.” (101)He also tells us that math in any form of work built the ability to understand the world. (203). There’s a great storey about Johannes Kepler in 1610 that launches chapter 6, There’s a reference to Christian thinking in the Middle Ages that God had created the world to be a place for humans (233)Chapter 7 tells us that “Facts alone are what are lived in life” according to what Dickens made a character in Hard Times in 1854. Our author tells us on the same page that Thomas Kuhn said “...the so-called facts proved never to be mere facts, independence of existing belief and theory.” The big change in the history is the change from religious faith to science: “The new science was, compared to what had gone before, based on distrust, not trust.” 299 This is central of what he says in the book. And then reminds us that the printing press made it possible to have information for all persons. It raised the question about what it the use of the “fact” (309)In Chapter 8 “Experiments” we read about what was the first “proper” experiment? (311) In that time of new knowledge for more people, there were two types of knowledge: Plato and Euclid (322)“the first major field for experiment enquiry in the early modern period was the magnet 327 “It would be difficult to overestimate the impact of Gilder’s On the Magnet….because for the first time the experiment method had been presented ...”  (331) and it was a series accident. (336)“Experiments produce new knowledge, but if that knowledge does not circulate there is little opportunity for further progress.” (340) The author uses Newton’s famous statement: “If I have seen farther it is by standing of the shoulders of giants” to show the change in how people began to think. (341)A big change began around 1660 when English words experimental philosophy in meaning (347) Also, science work and progress came about from the exchange of ideas among scientists using a sociological interaction. (348) Previously there had been only 4 laws of science: the lever, the optical law of reflection, the law of buoyancy and the parallelogram law of velocities (368) Also, scientists began to work on the basis of hypotheses and theories (387) and how science began to define its own language, including the word theory (394). Part Four is for the Birth of the Modern, beginning with machines (Chapter 12). (However, the word modern goes back to the 6th century. (451) We get a quick paragraph about what the Church did in this time and a very short reference to the way women could participate in science. (470) Probably the most powerful chapter comes in Chapter 14, Knowledge is Power. “The first great, practical achievement …was Newcomen’s steam engine in 1712.” (490) The book ends two ways of looking at the development of science:  “…..once you set out to answer a question that answer you will arrive at is entirely predetermined—just like Columbus’s discover of America.” (527) Of course there’s the question about the native people. "
34,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67945187-richard-carter,4,"David Wootton states his thesis right at the start of The Invention of Science:Modern science was invented between 1572, when Tycho Brahe saw a nova, or new star, and 1704, when Newton published his Opticks…I'm no historian, but my keen amateur interest in the history of science tells me that this will be seen as something of a controversial claim. Modern historians of science can be pretty scathing of what they see as ‘Whiggish’ interpretations of history: pretty much every ‘new’ scientific discovery is built on what went before; to describe some (male) scientist or other as ‘the first to [do/discover X]’ or ‘the Father of [insert discipline]’, is to naively ignore the work of a multitude of predecessors; science does not advance through the ‘Eureka Moments’ of Great Men. Towards the extreme end of this argument, it is also sometimes claimed that there is no such thing as a scientific hero. At the ridiculous, postmodern extreme, which can safely be ignored, it is even sometimes argued that our knowledge of the universe hasn't so much improved over time as changed.As a non-expert, I must confess general bafflement. Accusations of ‘Whiggism’ might be useful shorthand to describe a naively simplistic view of the history of science, but they often sound to me like straw-man arguments. Is anyone really that naive? (Answer: Quite often, yes, it turns out; but the existence of certain Whiggish hallmarks doesn't necessarily invalidate a thesis.)Wootton's argument in this long and entertaining book is that something really big happened in the scientific world during the seventeenth century. It was a step-change; a genuine revolution. The people who studied science before then weren't really doing ‘science’ in any modern sense of the word.A large part of Wootton's thesis is based on language. His central message, which seems pretty convincing to this non-expert, is that:the language we use when thinking about scientific questions is almost entirely a construction of the seventeenth century. This language reflected the revolution that science was undergoing, but it also made that revolution possible.Wootton spends the lion's share of this book exploring the seventeenth-century construction of modern scientific terminology and concepts. For example, he makes a compelling argument that Columbus's (re)discovery of America in 1492 was central to the realisation that it was possible to discover new knowledge that was unknown to the ancients, rather than simply recovering knowledge held by them that had since been lost. In later chapters, Wootton goes on to examine the seventeenth-century development of other new words/concepts, such as: facts, experiments, laws, hypotheses, and theories.But The Invention of Science isn't all about language. There is some pretty interesting science history in there too. I was particularly fascinated by the early sections about the various competing models for Earth's place in the universe, and how they were eventually discredited. Anyone with a passing interest in the history of science will already be familiar with some of these models, but Wootton does an excellent job in describing them, making you appreciate that they weren't nearly as bonkers as they might appear with twenty-first-century hindsight.The Invention of Science strikes me as an important and entertaining book. I look forward to reading what Wootton's historian colleagues have to say about it."
35,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66067948-ronald,4,"Despite some of the valid negative comments from other reviewers (overly academic, jumps around in time, lots of repetition, heavy going), this book provides significant insights on the scientific revolution that I have not seen elsewhere, and I suspect much of the author's insights are new. For this reason I would highly recommend it to anyone with a serious interest in this subject. Here is a summary of what I took away from the book, which provides much more detail.The scientific revolution took place from 1572 (Tycho Brahe’s observation of a supernova) to 1704 based on some of Newton’s findings. Prior to the revolution, the universe was seen as static and unchanging, and explained by authoritative opinions from ancient sources such as Aristotle that were based on logic and philosophy, not on evidence. The scientific revolution changed this view of the universe among educated people. Most importantly, the revolution placed the importance of experience (through evidence and experimentation) over the traditionally predominant logic-based authoritative opinion.This transformation in thinking came about at this particular time because of (1) new information that contradicted the previously dominant authoritative opinions about the nature of the universe, from voyages of exploration, the introduction of experimental methodology, and new scientific instruments, and (2) rapid sharing of the new information and new methods of investigation through the new technology of printing. Key new information that upset existing beliefs included the discovery of America by Columbus and findings from other voyages of discovery; astronomical observations by Tycho Brahe and Galileo that contradicted the supposed fixity of the heavens; and establishment of experimentally based laws of nature by Galileo (law of fall), Newton (light, motion) and others. Important for producing the new contradictory evidence were newly invented instruments and devices, including the telescope, microscope, barometer, thermometer and prism. Also important was the introduction of systematic experimentation and replication of experimental results, first applied to magnetism. There was no ancient/classical commentary on magnetism to oppose these experimental results, so the technical findings were quickly accepted, as well as the novel methods of investigation. About the same time, the new technology of printing brought about widespread sharing of all past knowledge, as well as of the new findings and methods of investigation, creating sizable communities of experts in communication with each other, and stimulating further discoveries.Finally, the scientific revolution started in Europe, where fragmented societies provided space for intellectual competition and diversity of thought, in contrast to other more centralized cultures (Ottoman, China). "
36,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"The Invention of Science, a scholarly work, is written for a purpose quite different from the understanding it provides to most readers who are not experts in the field.The author is a master of the field. Many of his arguments are counterpoints to positions taken by other renowned experts. These may be critical but subtleties are going to be beyond the comprehension of the rest. The enormous amount of details provided could be important for those in the field, but lay readers do not have the advantage of the supporting evidence or criticisms used by those being countered. As a result, the details get overwhelming every so often through the book. Yet, the book is a fascinating work. To explain its unintended utility, let me use the example of an era our generation knows - information revolution. The similarities are definitely not precise - for example, meaningful developments were over a span of decades and centuries during what is later defined as the scientific revolution era while for us major innovation leaps happened in months and years. Still, such an example would help. Say, a later day historian is writing a book called The Invention of Digitization, language of the time - which could freely include the words like apps, browsing/search, GPUs or cloud - can fully explain the the zig-zag path through which 8084 processors, floppy disks, FTPs, GUIs, modems etc this world evolved. What Galileo, Columbus and all the discoverers of those eras did was quite different not only from their viewpoints but also from ours. Of course, they told us about gravity and showed the way to America but they discovered ""discovery"". They started multiple new paths of inquiry and processes that have shaped our sciences, learning and technology ever since. What constitutes a theory or a hypothesis, the roles played by evidences, the importance of facts, the falsifiability and accumulation of rational knowledge - these are some of a large number of topics discussed in a fascinating way in this book.This is not an easy book. So many arguments would appear overly pedantic for non-experts. Or simply a gibberish intended for another expert in the field who is not in agreement. Yet, for the patient, the book throws flashlight on the times that sparked something immense for the humanity, and mostly in the language or methods of that time rather than those of the later days."
37,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15078897-ryan-young,3,"Author argues (and argues and argues) that the scientific revolution changed forever the way knowledge is acquired, built upon, and even defined. I am completely on board with his thesis, but i found him repetitive and boring. I think the two centuries between the discovery of the American continents by Europeans and the explanation of the solar system by Newton can be a very exciting subject. But here it was not.Here we see the emergence of scientific language (hypothesis, fact, experiment, even discovery) and how it fed into a culture that was shaking off its dependence on and faith in the classical world. The concept of progress (a continual improvement in man's lot) allows people to think in new ways, have new expectations, and forge a new world. Follow the landmark people: Brahe, Boyle, Newton, Copernicus, Galileo, DesCartes, and other more obscure characters as they upend the established order.While science creates theories that help humankind explain and manipulate nature, it is fallible and always open to revision. The author argues that science itself, as we now understand it, is not fallible, and will remain in place because of its incredible success over the past 300 years. Since this book is intended to persuade, it often gets bogged down in the endless repetition and source citing. It would have been useful to have a courtroom agreement on some 'stipulations of fact'. YES, Mr Wooten, we can all agree that Galileo did not embrace the larger paradigm of experimentation. Can we drop it now? and so on and so forth. lots of great info, a real bitch to get through."
38,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26684625-marcin-milkowski,5,"Although the read is a bit tedious, it does great job in dismissing the armchair theorizing of radically conventionalist historians of science who dismiss the very idea of scientific progress or scientific revolution. For example, it shows clearly how Shapin has misrepresented the air pump and made Hobbes look like Wittgenstein. Overall, the book defends a reasonable account of history of science, and of science, while dismissing armchair theorizing, both of Popperian and Wittgensteinian kind. Sometimes, the criticism gets a bit crude: the last chapters criticize scientific realists and Wootton claims that Laudan has 'demolished' Putnams no miracle argument (NMA), whereas pessimistic induction vs. NMA can be seen in a much more nuanced fashion. In essence, Wootton would say that science gets more reliable in prediction and control but not in getting closer to truth. But without mentioning non-observable entities (he does not), you cannot say that on pain on contradiction: predictions are more reliable when they are not only stable but also true, viz. are evidenced by measurement values.The most interesting point, repeated multiple times, is that scientific change is frequently not at all revolutionary: it comes swiftly because everyone agrees. Disputes and disagreement can happen but he cites a number of cases when a position was abandoned immediately because of a new experiment. This is totally neglected by Kuhn and his more radical followers.Overall, a nice read for all interested in the entry-level history of science. But it's also quite lengthy and conceptually advanced."
39,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107869478-tabitha,2,"I did not enjoy the book.Before reading the book, I thought it was going to be about the inventions and discoveries made, about the changes in how 'science' was conducted, all in a particular time frame. The expectation was that Wootton would present this as a story, as a historical account of science was revolutionised in a given time frame. There are details about inventions, discoveries, and changes in 'science'. Yet the attention is primarily on the introduction of new words into the language used to describe phenomena. Wootton elaborates on the etymology of these new words, the semantics behind the words (the meaning of these words as contemporaries would have understood them), the change in the semantics of the new words, and who can the change in meaning, or the introduction of the word, be attributed to. If I remember correctly, sometimes what was discovered or invented contributed to the introduction of these new words. These words include: discovery, fact, invention, evidence, hypotheses/theories etc. The aforementioned focus on language does not mean that it made the book, or the arguments bad. It just was not what was expected or what I am necessarily interested in. Wootton's account of the Scientific Revolution is rich in detail not only in the body of the text, but also is rich in detail because of the inclusion of footnotes. The thesis is that between 1572 to 1704 the Scientific Revolution began. He evidences this by the words (as aforementioned) introduced during this time frame. "
40,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1063665-silvio,5,"Science can be traced and has a clear impact on the world“Science works” a massive book to finish with these two words that should not need too much explanation, or nothing at all. From a historian perspective and between discussions if it is possible to do history and more specifically history of science, the author writes passionately against the different movements and views that support today an anti science discourse. It is clear a book to read calmly and with a lot of time. For someone totally layman in the area of history of science, difficult. I would not recommend it. However the prose is clear and straightforward and the message clear so you can read and understand it. The book is based on the concept that objective reality exists, and explains with great detail why also science, the process, is a social and human activity bounded by reality or nature: that’s the difference with other activities that are not limited by nature. Science and mathematics is the common denominator for individuals that can hold different beliefs and come form different cultures, simply because the science process as it is today self corrects. For anyone interested in the science of history, or having curiosity on the topic highly recommended. I would love to read it in a group..."
41,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81175911-cerebralcortext,3,"This book is less a history of the Scientific Revolution than it is a linguistic archaeology of the concept of the Scientific Revolution. Nevertheless it was very informative and in true Foucaldian fashion, it enabled me to free my thoughts “from what it silently thinks, and so enable it to think differently.” Wootton’s explications of the intellectual tools we take for granted today, from “discovery” to “fact” to “theory” are remarkable, and yet there is a tendency to the formulaic whereby he first traces the etymology of a word, follows it with the use of Google and the OED to trace its explosive use in our modern sense, then quotes authors contextually to try to show what is different. The problem with this approach is that he never truly takes time to work out the ancient concept of, say, “evidence”. Yes, he tells us that the meaning changes over the course of the 15th and 16th centuries, so that what the ancients meant by evidence was subverted into a new ideology of scientific rigour. While that by itself is useful, it tells only half the story. Of equal value would be knowing whether the ancients had another term that was conceptually equivalent with evidence today: if so, how did its application change; if not, why was this new concept necessary? I am not content accepting that a concept was new just because a word acquired a new meaning—a history of ideas would have complemented well a history of language. This is a very fine distinction against what Wootton did and what he could have done, but I submit it would make the transformative case more pellucid. Another quibble would be with his methodology. There are no references, even in the endnotes, to just what exactly he would term a statistical deviation from the norm, such that he can claim such and such a word proliferated from such and such dates. Perhaps a simple addition of an appendix would satisfy. Finally, for the lay reader like myself, it was bruising to be suddenly thrust into a world of intense debates such as that against/for the Kuhnians. This is not really a complaint, but more of a warning for readers who may have expected a somewhat more narrative history and less a philosophical inquiry into what actually is science. But I think overall Wootton is convincing in advancing his claim that the Scientific Revolution was a shift from a bedrock of absolute knowledge to a provisional and progressive one. And in a day of scientific denial, where the temptation to push back to the opposite extreme is very real, his understanding of a science that offers not truth but reliable knowledge is a valid one indeed."
42,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5989914-tony,3,"""But first, we require some context.""Wootton kept me dangling for most of this lengthy (and fairly dry) book. Each time he summarized a chapter or three, I felt relieved and invariably felt that I would absorb his arguments more thoroughly if I went back and re-read them.This was repeated in grand form in the last part, where he summarized his arguments. Why did he make me struggle to find his arguments through hundreds of pages, with no map? If he had told me up front where we were going, I would have enjoyed the journey more and would have gotten more from it.That (very large) niggle aside, he is convincing and insightful in his arguments, and I don't recall any instances of thinking he must have it wrong. My only other complaint about his style of argumentation is the density: I occasionally found his reasoning hard to follow, as he made several points in close proximity, or sometimes assumed I had gotten a fine point where I hadn't.If I ever desire minute facts related to the development of science, I'll have a ready reference."
43,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4688721-mark,5,"I say this with the caveat that I have no background in the history of science. That said: this is essential reading. I fully grant some of the criticisms I've seen in other reviews. Wootton does rely overmuch on linguistic analyses, and he tends to hammer away at them for much longer than any reader is likely to want him to. He has a few too many axes to grind with other historians, and, if this can be leveled as a criticism, it took a while to be able to read the text because it is so densely foot- and endnoted that it can be distracting.So why five stars, in spite of those issues? Simply put, Wootton made me think of science, history, and progress in a way that I never had before. Even if one can dispute certain sections, his theses are solid, his points well-argued, and his overall project admirable."

It's a system of analyzing infrmation that was really only invented about 500 years ago and which has led to all the progress that we've made sincd then. Philosophers and theologians tried to understand the universe through human understanding, which is fallible and and itself the product of evolution which has it's own ""motivations."" When science is done right it uncovers truths that are often uncomfortable and inconvenient but which often crazier than anything our imaginations could have cooked up. I can certainly be done wrong, too - look at all the pseudoscience on the internet - and that's something we should always guard against."

On top of that, it's horribly disorganized. The author has 2-3 hobbyhorses he returns to in almost every single chapter, regardless of relevance or context. Sometimes he'll do half a treatment of a topic, then do the rest 100 pages later in a completely different chapter.Even if we were to overlook these weaknesses, the book is still extremely weak in terms of its substance. It's almost 800 pages long, yet the author dedicates just a single paragraph on the key question of why the scientific revolution took hold in Europe but not Islam or China.

It’s not just that it has a ponderous approach to the topic, but the writing is somewhere between 19th century prose and high academic that deters from any actual pleasure that one might otherwise have had. I kept thinking that if I had been assigned this in a college course setting and been asked to parse out the author’s view of defining a “fact” that it would have been left me despairing.

The author is very enthusiastic, however, you may need to have a PhD in the history of science to follow it, which I something I most certainly don't have.It is an interesting book but it isn't popular science.

Perhaps it is meant to lightened up a subject thought to heavy. Wootton needn't worry about that though; the delight for the reader is not in cheeky phrases but the fascinating journey though the eyes of natural philosophers, on their way to become scientists. "

68,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill,4,"David Wootton is a professor of history at the University of York.  In The Invention of Science he proposes a new view of the definition, the significance, and the timing of the “Scientific Revolution.”  Most historians would point to Copernicus as the initiator of the revolution with his publication in 1543 of a heliocentric vision of the universe.   But Wootton argues that Copernicus was not really a scientist in that he did not attempt to gather new data - he relied on the observations of the ancients.  Nor was he as revolutionary as once thought.  He envisioned the earth and the planets as located in solid crystalline spheres that rotated around and within each other.  He was concerned with preserving Aristotle’s concept of celestial circular motion.  Indeed, one did not contradict Aristotle lightly; from the end of the eleventh century until the middle of the eighteenth Aristotle’s take on natural phenomena was taught in the universities across Europe; his influence was profound.Adding to the ossification of knowledge was an unquestioning belief in the literal truth of the Bible.  Between the teachings of Aristotle and the Bible, most European thinkers concluded “there was no such thing as new knowledge.”The epistemological issues Wootton discusses are fascinating.  He observes, for example, that the notion of “discovery” was a relatively modern concept.  When Columbus “discovered” the New World, this was a game-changer; before this, the assumption was that there were no “discoveries” to be made.  Pursuant to the texts accepted as authoritative, “the greatest achievements of civilization were believed to lie not in the present or the future but in the past, in ancient Greece and classical Rome.” Wootton also takes on the theory of scientific “revolutions” formulated and popularized by Thomas Kuhn. Kuhn, writing at the peak of the intellectual infatuation with post-modernism, stated that science has undergone several distinct revolutions in the form of paradigm shifts, in which scientists did not so much discover new data, but rather began to view the same data in a different light. No, says Wootton. Kuhn’s analytical lenses were too narrowly constructed; he lost sight, Wootton argues persuasively, of the wider environment within which those shifts took place. Wootton suggests that modern science was invented between 1572, when Tycho Brahe discovered a new star [which we now know was a distant super nova], and 1704, when Isaac Newton published his work on prisms.  What made the difference, according to Wootton, was the notion of “discovery”; a research program; precise measurements; a community of experts; the willingness to question long-established certainties in light of new evidence; and above all, the triumph of experience over philosophy.  Furthermore, the invention of the printing press accelerated the process by transforming access to information and becoming itself an agent of change.  To support his thesis, he presents a detailed history of how science worked before, during, and after this period. “Science” itself was until recently known as “natural philosophy,” and the word “scientist” was not used until the 19th Century!  Wootton analyzes language closely, because, as he stresses, “[a]ll history involves translation from the source language.”  But understanding the words originally used also can indicate how the words signified for a particular place and time.  In fact, one of Wootton’s key premises is that “a revolution in ideas requires a revolution in language.”Thus, Wootton argues that the scientific revolution was not merely a collection of new discoveries, but rather a cultural transformation.  The printing press, in addition to its benefits mentioned above, was instrumental in the intellectual revolution because it fostered the dissemination and criticism (“peer review”) of new ideas.  New instruments (telescopes, microscopes, barometers, prisms) allowed the discovery of new facts.  Finally, the new science was given a distinctive identity by a new language that stressed facts, theories, hypotheses, and laws. Evaluation: Wootton has mastered a truly enormous corpus of scholarly work.   His bibliography runs to 68 pages.  His writing is lucid and interesting, even when he is discussing arcane issues of historiography, and in comparison to most other books on epistemology.  This book is well worth the effort.  "
69,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4443481-sarah-beth,3,"I received an uncorrected proof copy of this book from HarperCollins. As indicated by the title, this is a history of what we recognize today as ""science."" Science as we know it was invented between 1572 and 1704. Modern science is so deeply ingrained in our society and culture that it's difficult to imagine a world before scientific facts. While there were systems of knowledge we call sciences before this time period, few of them functioned like a modern science aside from astronomy. Wootton further argues that between 1600 and 1733, ""the intellectual world of the educated elite changed more rapidly than at any time in previous history, and perhaps than at any time before the twentieth century"" (11). The compass, surface tension, the geography of our planet, microscopes, telescopes, and more advanced knowledge of stars and celestial bodies all emerged during this time period. Interestingly, a main focus of the book is on the evolution in terminology and concepts related to modern day science. For instance, ""before Columbus discovered America in 1492 there was no clear-cut and well-established idea of discovery; the idea of discovery is [...] a precondition for the invention of science"" (55). In other words, before Columbus, intellectuals concerned themselves with recovering lost knowledge of the past, not in establishing new knowledge. Modern day science, which seeks to discover or uncover new knowledge had to evolve as a concept before experimentation and scientific exploration could evolve. Similarly, the very word 'science', 'hypothesis,' 'experiment,' and 'fact' as we know them today did not exist before the Scientific Revolution. A world without facts is difficult to comprehend to readers who live in a culture so wholly dependent on facts, but in the past there was only truth, opinion, knowledge, experience, or persuasion - ""facts"" did not exist. I also learned some interesting background on multiple well known historical figures including Galileo. The section detailing the emergence of many mathematical theories through the work of artists was fascinating. Additionally, the book is quite literally littered with interesting tidbits of facts. For instance, through as late as 1320, it was thought that ""ships sail uphill as they sail out on the ocean (we still acknowledge this traditional view when we use the term 'the high sea' or 'the high seas')"" (113). In the spirit of full disclosure, I must confess that aside from the few specifics I shared above, I struggled making it through this book. For someone whose only knowledge of science's history comes from high school history and science classes, this book felt far too in-depth and way over my head. On top of that, the book is immense and sprawling and I felt bogged down by its hundreds of pages of minutiae related to hundreds of individuals and amazingly diverse scientific developments. I would not recommend this history for a novice. That being said, it was obviously incredibly well researched and made many valid points that have relevance for everyone who lives in the modern world. "
70,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5937558-lynn,1,"Today's post is on The Invention of Science: A New History of the Scientific Revolution by David Wootton. It is 768 pages long and is published by HarperCollins. The cover is an art print of a hand and a compass. The intended reader is someone who is interested in scientific history. There is no language, no sex, and no violence in this book. There Be Spoilers Ahead.From the back of the book- A companion to such acclaimed works as The Age of Wonder, A Clockwork Universe, and Darwin’s Ghosts—a groundbreaking examination of the greatest event in history, the Scientific Revolution, and how it came to change the way we understand ourselves and our world.We live in a world transformed by scientific discovery. Yet today, science and its practitioners have come under political attack. In this fascinating history spanning continents and centuries, historian David Wootton offers a lively defense of science, revealing why the Scientific Revolution was truly the greatest event in our history.The Invention of Science goes back five hundred years in time to chronicle this crucial transformation, exploring the factors that led to its birth and the people who made it happen. Wootton argues that the Scientific Revolution was actually five separate yet concurrent events that developed independently, but came to intersect and create a new worldview. Here are the brilliant iconoclasts—Galileo, Copernicus, Brahe, Newton, and many more curious minds from across Europe—whose studies of the natural world challenged centuries of religious orthodoxy and ingrained superstition.From gunpowder technology, the discovery of the new world, movable type printing, perspective painting, and the telescope to the practice of conducting experiments, the laws of nature, and the concept of the fact, Wotton shows how these discoveries codified into a social construct and a system of knowledge. Ultimately, he makes clear the link between scientific discovery and the rise of industrialization—and the birth of the modern world we know.Review- I wanted to like and enjoy this book so much but it was so bogged down by too many details and tangents that I could not. At times, too few and far between, Wootton would talk about something really interesting like how scientists came to the ideas they are famous for or how they did not come to them alone. But most of the this book is some kind of tangent. Wootton has so much that he is trying to do that he does none of them. I was mostly bored doing this book. I had to use the graduate student skim to read this book. I hate using the graduate student skim. I guess if too detailed books about any subject are your thing, you should try this. If you are looking for an interesting book about science came to be as we know it today then skip this one.I give this book a One out of Five stars. I was given a copy of this book by HarperCollins in exchange for an honest review. "

72,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1409618-mattr76,4,"This excellent, comprehensive, astonishingly well-researched, and above all enthralling book seeks to establish an inflection point in history indicating the birth of science, much like Stephen Greenblatt's The Swerve. But rather than focusing on the rediscovery of Lucretius, Wootton looks to the discovery of America and the nova observed by Tycho Brahe as the moments that shattered the crystal spheres of Aristotle and ushered in the new science with its basis in experiment. Additionally, he tracks the emergence of science linguistically, by identifying when the modern contexts (which we take for granted) of scientific words, such as ""fact,"" ""evidence,"" ""experiment,"" ""hypothesis,"" and ""theory,"" come into use. I found this a compelling method, as well as an interesting counterpoint to my limited experience with Aristotle (his ""Physics""), in which I got frustrated with his deduction from etymology (not a real example, but something like, ""rainbows are beams of light curved into bows by the rain, and that is why we call them rainbows""). I am a big fan of the ancient Greeks and Platonic philosophy, but as far as I am concerned, Aristotle got what he deserved.This book makes clear that we are still living through an intellectual revolution, one that touches on all aspects of our lives, and is still meeting with resistance while deepening our understanding of the Universe, half a millennium later. May the revolution continue."
73,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1060231-todd,5,"A tour de force of science, history, philosophy, language, cartography and sociology. Without some prior background regarding folks like Galileo, Newton, Boyle, Bacon, Popper, Kuhn, etc., this densely packed reading may not digest easily. For those ready for the ride, there is much on offer here. Wootton makes two arguments regarding the Scientific Revolution. First, contrary to post-modern attempts to wipe it away, a revolution in thought with essential antecedents and radical consequences occurred. Second, that it was mostly a 17th century happening (following from Brahe's observation of a supernova and culminating with Newton's publication of ""Opticks"") and not, as many would have it, a mid/late 16th century transformation with the publication of Copernicus's ""On the Revolutions..."" as the pivotal moment. The most complete and enjoyable history of science book I've read in quite some time. "
74,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7633688-les,4,"This a very comprehensive, detailed history of the scientific revolution. The author lays out, in extensive detail, both the events and environment which led to the development of science as we know it today. The book is extremely thorough. As a result, it is also quite dense and requires reading of the extensive footnotes as you go to completely understand many of the observations/conclusions of the author. In some cases, it seemed as if significant parts of the analysis were relegated to footnotes when the reader would be better served having the information included in the text. On more than one occasion, an event the author described reminded me of something in Neal Stevenson's Baroque Cycle, which I found enjoyable.This is a challenging book that requires perseverance. It is well worth the effort if you have a real interest in history and science."
75,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8670076-john-doyle,3,"For millennia before the 16th Century the notions of discovery, experiments, and facts had not been invented and tools for the collection and preservation of knowledge (i.e. telescopes, microscopes, and books) did not exist. Ironically, during the same period humanity also reached the apex of its omniscience. This thanks to priests, philosophers, and others who earnestly sought to help their fellow travelers find firm ground in an uncertain world. The Invention of Science has within it all of the content amateur historians need to frame the arc of human knowledge and its links to the inception of the industrial revolution and our modern world. Unfortunately, as in our DNA, the gaps between the genes are long and seemingly unnecessary."

It was experience that marked the difference between the new sciences and the old."" Well worth the read if you're into science, philosophy, or linguistics."

But if there is only one truth then it should be provable. Philosophers are tying to fulfill this demand but they are soon joined by proto-scientists and the resulting clash changes the public's understanding of reality. Now we take science for granted.The change is chronicled and explained in this book. My two complaints are that the book is a repetitive at times and the introduction was too long. I recommend it for people who like scholarly research and debates on the evolution of methodology."
78,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55425271-arasibo-campeche,3,"This was an interesting book that gives great insight into the development of science as we think about it today. Organizing the history of science as this book does seems a daunting task, but more of an effort should have made in decreasing chronological back and forth leaping. It is hard to grasp which details are more important than others and what events came before others. Similarly, Many concepts were explained extensively when a much shorter description would have sufficed. These two weaknesses make the book hard to follow and stick to. "

80,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34264503-jeremy-pike,5,"The content of the book is superb, priceless. It traces the intellectual achievements directly preceding or causing the Scientific Revolution and natural philosophers/early scientists realization that Aristotelian philosophy was not a reliable lens through which to look at the cosmos and that the authority of Aristotle ultimately needed to be completely abandoned on the grounds of newly contrived observation-based science, which would come to displace the ancient Greeks."

Wootton is full of interesting facts and observations about critical events (perspective painting, the discovery of America, Tycho Brahe's observations of the supernova of 1572, and many more),""killer facts"" that made earlier theories almost immediately untenable, and changes in ways of thinking. Way too long, but it's easy to skim the tedious parts. "

Sudden changes of direction, an overabundance of linguistic minutiae, and more than a few cheap shots against the academic opposition yield a volume that is more tome than tale; unnecessarily arcane and less-than-approachable.I look forward to writing a hearty recommendation for an abridged edition, but in its present form I'll leave it at this: The Invention of Science will reward the intrepid reader with a great many interesting things.Edit: this review captures the sentiment far more eloquently (and patiently) than I can manage. Still three stars."
128,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill,4,"David Wootton is a professor of history at the University of York.  In The Invention of Science he proposes a new view of the definition, the significance, and the timing of the “Scientific Revolution.”  Most historians would point to Copernicus as the initiator of the revolution with his publication in 1543 of a heliocentric vision of the universe.   But Wootton argues that Copernicus was not really a scientist in that he did not attempt to gather new data - he relied on the observations of the ancients.  Nor was he as revolutionary as once thought.  He envisioned the earth and the planets as located in solid crystalline spheres that rotated around and within each other.  He was concerned with preserving Aristotle’s concept of celestial circular motion.  Indeed, one did not contradict Aristotle lightly; from the end of the eleventh century until the middle of the eighteenth Aristotle’s take on natural phenomena was taught in the universities across Europe; his influence was profound.Adding to the ossification of knowledge was an unquestioning belief in the literal truth of the Bible.  Between the teachings of Aristotle and the Bible, most European thinkers concluded “there was no such thing as new knowledge.”The epistemological issues Wootton discusses are fascinating.  He observes, for example, that the notion of “discovery” was a relatively modern concept.  When Columbus “discovered” the New World, this was a game-changer; before this, the assumption was that there were no “discoveries” to be made.  Pursuant to the texts accepted as authoritative, “the greatest achievements of civilization were believed to lie not in the present or the future but in the past, in ancient Greece and classical Rome.” Wootton also takes on the theory of scientific “revolutions” formulated and popularized by Thomas Kuhn. Kuhn, writing at the peak of the intellectual infatuation with post-modernism, stated that science has undergone several distinct revolutions in the form of paradigm shifts, in which scientists did not so much discover new data, but rather began to view the same data in a different light. No, says Wootton. Kuhn’s analytical lenses were too narrowly constructed; he lost sight, Wootton argues persuasively, of the wider environment within which those shifts took place. Wootton suggests that modern science was invented between 1572, when Tycho Brahe discovered a new star [which we now know was a distant super nova], and 1704, when Isaac Newton published his work on prisms.  What made the difference, according to Wootton, was the notion of “discovery”; a research program; precise measurements; a community of experts; the willingness to question long-established certainties in light of new evidence; and above all, the triumph of experience over philosophy.  Furthermore, the invention of the printing press accelerated the process by transforming access to information and becoming itself an agent of change.  To support his thesis, he presents a detailed history of how science worked before, during, and after this period. “Science” itself was until recently known as “natural philosophy,” and the word “scientist” was not used until the 19th Century!  Wootton analyzes language closely, because, as he stresses, “[a]ll history involves translation from the source language.”  But understanding the words originally used also can indicate how the words signified for a particular place and time.  In fact, one of Wootton’s key premises is that “a revolution in ideas requires a revolution in language.”Thus, Wootton argues that the scientific revolution was not merely a collection of new discoveries, but rather a cultural transformation.  The printing press, in addition to its benefits mentioned above, was instrumental in the intellectual revolution because it fostered the dissemination and criticism (“peer review”) of new ideas.  New instruments (telescopes, microscopes, barometers, prisms) allowed the discovery of new facts.  Finally, the new science was given a distinctive identity by a new language that stressed facts, theories, hypotheses, and laws. Evaluation: Wootton has mastered a truly enormous corpus of scholarly work.   His bibliography runs to 68 pages.  His writing is lucid and interesting, even when he is discussing arcane issues of historiography, and in comparison to most other books on epistemology.  This book is well worth the effort.  "
129,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4443481-sarah-beth,3,"I received an uncorrected proof copy of this book from HarperCollins. As indicated by the title, this is a history of what we recognize today as ""science."" Science as we know it was invented between 1572 and 1704. Modern science is so deeply ingrained in our society and culture that it's difficult to imagine a world before scientific facts. While there were systems of knowledge we call sciences before this time period, few of them functioned like a modern science aside from astronomy. Wootton further argues that between 1600 and 1733, ""the intellectual world of the educated elite changed more rapidly than at any time in previous history, and perhaps than at any time before the twentieth century"" (11). The compass, surface tension, the geography of our planet, microscopes, telescopes, and more advanced knowledge of stars and celestial bodies all emerged during this time period. Interestingly, a main focus of the book is on the evolution in terminology and concepts related to modern day science. For instance, ""before Columbus discovered America in 1492 there was no clear-cut and well-established idea of discovery; the idea of discovery is [...] a precondition for the invention of science"" (55). In other words, before Columbus, intellectuals concerned themselves with recovering lost knowledge of the past, not in establishing new knowledge. Modern day science, which seeks to discover or uncover new knowledge had to evolve as a concept before experimentation and scientific exploration could evolve. Similarly, the very word 'science', 'hypothesis,' 'experiment,' and 'fact' as we know them today did not exist before the Scientific Revolution. A world without facts is difficult to comprehend to readers who live in a culture so wholly dependent on facts, but in the past there was only truth, opinion, knowledge, experience, or persuasion - ""facts"" did not exist. I also learned some interesting background on multiple well known historical figures including Galileo. The section detailing the emergence of many mathematical theories through the work of artists was fascinating. Additionally, the book is quite literally littered with interesting tidbits of facts. For instance, through as late as 1320, it was thought that ""ships sail uphill as they sail out on the ocean (we still acknowledge this traditional view when we use the term 'the high sea' or 'the high seas')"" (113).

158,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill,4,"David Wootton is a professor of history at the University of York.  In The Invention of Science he proposes a new view of the definition, the significance, and the timing of the “Scientific Revolution.”  Most historians would point to Copernicus as the initiator of the revolution with his publication in 1543 of a heliocentric vision of the universe.   But Wootton argues that Copernicus was not really a scientist in that he did not attempt to gather new data - he relied on the observations of the ancients.  Nor was he as revolutionary as once thought.  He envisioned the earth and the planets as located in solid crystalline spheres that rotated around and within each other.  He was concerned with preserving Aristotle’s concept of celestial circular motion.  Indeed, one did not contradict Aristotle lightly; from the end of the eleventh century until the middle of the eighteenth Aristotle’s take on natural phenomena was taught in the universities across Europe; his influence was profound.Adding to the ossification of knowledge was an unquestioning belief in the literal truth of the Bible.  Between the teachings of Aristotle and the Bible, most European thinkers concluded “there was no such thing as new knowledge.”The epistemological issues Wootton discusses are fascinating.  He observes, for example, that the notion of “discovery” was a relatively modern concept.  When Columbus “discovered” the New World, this was a game-changer; before this, the assumption was that there were no “discoveries” to be made.  Pursuant to the texts accepted as authoritative, “the greatest achievements of civilization were believed to lie not in the present or the future but in the past, in ancient Greece and classical Rome.” Wootton also takes on the theory of scientific “revolutions” formulated and popularized by Thomas Kuhn. Kuhn, writing at the peak of the intellectual infatuation with post-modernism, stated that science has undergone several distinct revolutions in the form of paradigm shifts, in which scientists did not so much discover new data, but rather began to view the same data in a different light. No, says Wootton. Kuhn’s analytical lenses were too narrowly constructed; he lost sight, Wootton argues persuasively, of the wider environment within which those shifts took place. Wootton suggests that modern science was invented between 1572, when Tycho Brahe discovered a new star [which we now know was a distant super nova], and 1704, when Isaac Newton published his work on prisms.  What made the difference, according to Wootton, was the notion of “discovery”; a research program; precise measurements; a community of experts; the willingness to question long-established certainties in light of new evidence; and above all, the triumph of experience over philosophy.  Furthermore, the invention of the printing press accelerated the process by transforming access to information and becoming itself an agent of change.  To support his thesis, he presents a detailed history of how science worked before, during, and after this period. “Science” itself was until recently known as “natural philosophy,” and the word “scientist” was not used until the 19th Century!  Wootton analyzes language closely, because, as he stresses, “[a]ll history involves translation from the source language.”  But understanding the words originally used also can indicate how the words signified for a particular place and time.  In fact, one of Wootton’s key premises is that “a revolution in ideas requires a revolution in language.”Thus, Wootton argues that the scientific revolution was not merely a collection of new discoveries, but rather a cultural transformation.  The printing press, in addition to its benefits mentioned above, was instrumental in the intellectual revolution because it fostered the dissemination and criticism (“peer review”) of new ideas.  New instruments (telescopes, microscopes, barometers, prisms) allowed the discovery of new facts.  Finally, the new science was given a distinctive identity by a new language that stressed facts, theories, hypotheses, and laws. Evaluation: Wootton has mastered a truly enormous corpus of scholarly work.   His bibliography runs to 68 pages.  His writing is lucid and interesting, even when he is discussing arcane issues of historiography, and in comparison to most other books on epistemology.  This book is well worth the effort.  "
159,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4443481-sarah-beth,3,"I received an uncorrected proof copy of this book from HarperCollins. As indicated by the title, this is a history of what we recognize today as ""science."" Science as we know it was invented between 1572 and 1704. Modern science is so deeply ingrained in our society and culture that it's difficult to imagine a world before scientific facts. While there were systems of knowledge we call sciences before this time period, few of them functioned like a modern science aside from astronomy. Wootton further argues that between 1600 and 1733, ""the intellectual world of the educated elite changed more rapidly than at any time in previous history, and perhaps than at any time before the twentieth century"" (11). The compass, surface tension, the geography of our planet, microscopes, telescopes, and more advanced knowledge of stars and celestial bodies all emerged during this time period. Interestingly, a main focus of the book is on the evolution in terminology and concepts related to modern day science. For instance, ""before Columbus discovered America in 1492 there was no clear-cut and well-established idea of discovery; the idea of discovery is [...] a precondition for the invention of science"" (55). In other words, before Columbus, intellectuals concerned themselves with recovering lost knowledge of the past, not in establishing new knowledge. Modern day science, which seeks to discover or uncover new knowledge had to evolve as a concept before experimentation and scientific exploration could evolve. Similarly, the very word 'science', 'hypothesis,' 'experiment,' and 'fact' as we know them today did not exist before the Scientific Revolution. A world without facts is difficult to comprehend to readers who live in a culture so wholly dependent on facts, but in the past there was only truth, opinion, knowledge, experience, or persuasion - ""facts"" did not exist. I also learned some interesting background on multiple well known historical figures including Galileo. The section detailing the emergence of many mathematical theories through the work of artists was fascinating. Additionally, the book is quite literally littered with interesting tidbits of facts. For instance, through as late as 1320, it was thought that ""ships sail uphill as they sail out on the ocean (we still acknowledge this traditional view when we use the term 'the high sea' or 'the high seas')"" (113). In the spirit of full disclosure, I must confess that aside from the few specifics I shared above, I struggled making it through this book. For someone whose only knowledge of science's history comes from high school history and science classes, this book felt far too in-depth and way over my head. On top of that, the book is immense and sprawling and I felt bogged down by its hundreds of pages of minutiae related to hundreds of individuals and amazingly diverse scientific developments. I would not recommend this history for a novice. That being said, it was obviously incredibly well researched and made many valid points that have relevance for everyone who lives in the modern world. "
160,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5937558-lynn,1,"Today's post is on The Invention of Science: A New History of the Scientific Revolution by David Wootton. It is 768 pages long and is published by HarperCollins. The cover is an art print of a hand and a compass. The intended reader is someone who is interested in scientific history. There is no language, no sex, and no violence in this book. There Be Spoilers Ahead.From the back of the book- A companion to such acclaimed works as The Age of Wonder, A Clockwork Universe, and Darwin’s Ghosts—a groundbreaking examination of the greatest event in history, the Scientific Revolution, and how it came to change the way we understand ourselves and our world.We live in a world transformed by scientific discovery. Yet today, science and its practitioners have come under political attack. In this fascinating history spanning continents and centuries, historian David Wootton offers a lively defense of science, revealing why the Scientific Revolution was truly the greatest event in our history.The Invention of Science goes back five hundred years in time to chronicle this crucial transformation, exploring the factors that led to its birth and the people who made it happen. Wootton argues that the Scientific Revolution was actually five separate yet concurrent events that developed independently, but came to intersect and create a new worldview. Here are the brilliant iconoclasts—Galileo, Copernicus, Brahe, Newton, and many more curious minds from across Europe—whose studies of the natural world challenged centuries of religious orthodoxy and ingrained superstition.From gunpowder technology, the discovery of the new world, movable type printing, perspective painting, and the telescope to the practice of conducting experiments, the laws of nature, and the concept of the fact, Wotton shows how these discoveries codified into a social construct and a system of knowledge. Ultimately, he makes clear the link between scientific discovery and the rise of industrialization—and the birth of the modern world we know.Review- I wanted to like and enjoy this book so much but it was so bogged down by too many details and tangents that I could not. At times, too few and far between, Wootton would talk about something really interesting like how scientists came to the ideas they are famous for or how they did not come to them alone. But most of the this book is some kind of tangent. Wootton has so much that he is trying to do that he does none of them. I was mostly bored doing this book. I had to use the graduate student skim to read this book. I hate using the graduate student skim. I guess if too detailed books about any subject are your thing, you should try this. If you are looking for an interesting book about science came to be as we know it today then skip this one.I give this book a One out of Five stars. I was given a copy of this book by HarperCollins in exchange for an honest review. "

162,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1409618-mattr76,4,"This excellent, comprehensive, astonishingly well-researched, and above all enthralling book seeks to establish an inflection point in history indicating the birth of science, much like Stephen Greenblatt's The Swerve. But rather than focusing on the rediscovery of Lucretius, Wootton looks to the discovery of America and the nova observed by Tycho Brahe as the moments that shattered the crystal spheres of Aristotle and ushered in the new science with its basis in experiment. Additionally, he tracks the emergence of science linguistically, by identifying when the modern contexts (which we take for granted) of scientific words, such as ""fact,"" ""evidence,"" ""experiment,"" ""hypothesis,"" and ""theory,"" come into use. I found this a compelling method, as well as an interesting counterpoint to my limited experience with Aristotle (his ""Physics""), in which I got frustrated with his deduction from etymology (not a real example, but something like, ""rainbows are beams of light curved into bows by the rain, and that is why we call them rainbows""). I am a big fan of the ancient Greeks and Platonic philosophy, but as far as I am concerned, Aristotle got what he deserved.This book makes clear that we are still living through an intellectual revolution, one that touches on all aspects of our lives, and is still meeting with resistance while deepening our understanding of the Universe, half a millennium later. May the revolution continue."
163,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1060231-todd,5,"A tour de force of science, history, philosophy, language, cartography and sociology. Without some prior background regarding folks like Galileo, Newton, Boyle, Bacon, Popper, Kuhn, etc., this densely packed reading may not digest easily. For those ready for the ride, there is much on offer here. Wootton makes two arguments regarding the Scientific Revolution. First, contrary to post-modern attempts to wipe it away, a revolution in thought with essential antecedents and radical consequences occurred. Second, that it was mostly a 17th century happening (following from Brahe's observation of a supernova and culminating with Newton's publication of ""Opticks"") and not, as many would have it, a mid/late 16th century transformation with the publication of Copernicus's ""On the Revolutions..."" as the pivotal moment. The most complete and enjoyable history of science book I've read in quite some time. "
164,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7633688-les,4,"This a very comprehensive, detailed history of the scientific revolution. The author lays out, in extensive detail, both the events and environment which led to the development of science as we know it today. The book is extremely thorough. As a result, it is also quite dense and requires reading of the extensive footnotes as you go to completely understand many of the observations/conclusions of the author. In some cases, it seemed as if significant parts of the analysis were relegated to footnotes when the reader would be better served having the information included in the text. On more than one occasion, an event the author described reminded me of something in Neal Stevenson's Baroque Cycle, which I found enjoyable.This is a challenging book that requires perseverance. It is well worth the effort if you have a real interest in history and science."
165,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8670076-john-doyle,3,"For millennia before the 16th Century the notions of discovery, experiments, and facts had not been invented and tools for the collection and preservation of knowledge (i.e. telescopes, microscopes, and books) did not exist. Ironically, during the same period humanity also reached the apex of its omniscience. This thanks to priests, philosophers, and others who earnestly sought to help their fellow travelers find firm ground in an uncertain world. The Invention of Science has within it all of the content amateur historians need to frame the arc of human knowledge and its links to the inception of the industrial revolution and our modern world. Unfortunately, as in our DNA, the gaps between the genes are long and seemingly unnecessary."
166,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6490411-nick,4,"Tl;dr of ~800 pages: ""The new instruments and the oceans of printed books opened up new experiences and destroyed old authorities...new ideas depended upon conflict and competition within and between communities of thinkers...What held this community together was not just the new language, but a set of competitive and cooperative values which were expressed in the language used to describe the scientific enterprise, expressed in terms of discovery and progress. It was experience that marked the difference between the new sciences and the old."" Well worth the read if you're into science, philosophy, or linguistics."

But if there is only one truth then it should be provable. Philosophers are tying to fulfill this demand but they are soon joined by proto-scientists and the resulting clash changes the public's understanding of reality. Now we take science for granted.The change is chronicled and explained in this book. My two complaints are that the book is a repetitive at times and the introduction was too long. I recommend it for people who like scholarly research and debates on the evolution of methodology."

Wootton suggests that modern science was invented between 1572, when Tycho Brahe discovered a new star [which we now know was a distant super nova], and 1704, when Isaac Newton published his work on prisms.  What made the difference, according to Wootton, was the notion of “discovery”; a research program; precise measurements; a community of experts; the willingness to question long-established certainties in light of new evidence; and above all, the triumph of experience over philosophy.  Furthermore, the invention of the printing press accelerated the process by transforming access to information and becoming itself an agent of change.  To support his thesis, he presents a detailed history of how science worked before, during, and after this period. “Science” itself was until recently known as “natural philosophy,” and the word “scientist” was not used until the 19th Century!  Wootton analyzes language closely, because, as he stresses, “[a]ll history involves translation from the source language.”  But understanding the words originally used also can indicate how the words signified for a particular place and time.  In fact, one of Wootton’s key premises is that “a revolution in ideas requires a revolution in language.”Thus, Wootton argues that the scientific revolution was not merely a collection of new discoveries, but rather a cultural transformation.  The printing press, in addition to its benefits mentioned above, was instrumental in the intellectual revolution because it fostered the dissemination and criticism (“peer review”) of new ideas.  New instruments (telescopes, microscopes, barometers, prisms) allowed the discovery of new facts.  Finally, the new science was given a distinctive identity by a new language that stressed facts, theories, hypotheses, and laws. Evaluation: Wootton has mastered a truly enormous corpus of scholarly work.   His bibliography runs to 68 pages.  His writing is lucid and interesting, even when he is discussing arcane issues of historiography, and in comparison to most other books on epistemology.  This book is well worth the effort.  "

While there were systems of knowledge we call sciences before this time period, few of them functioned like a modern science aside from astronomy.

In other words, before Columbus, intellectuals concerned themselves with recovering lost knowledge of the past, not in establishing new knowledge.

The author lays out, in extensive detail, both the events and environment which led to the development of science as we know it today. The book is extremely thorough. As a result, it is also quite dense and requires reading of the extensive footnotes as you go to completely understand many of the observations/conclusions of the author. In some cases, it seemed as if significant parts of the analysis were relegated to footnotes when the reader would be better served having the information included in the text. On more than one occasion, an event the author described reminded me of something in Neal Stevenson's Baroque Cycle, which I found enjoyable.This is a challenging book that requires perseverance.

Ironically, during the same period humanity also reached the apex of its omniscience. This thanks to priests, philosophers, and others who earnestly sought to help their fellow travelers find firm ground in an uncertain world. The Invention of Science has within it all of the content amateur historians need to frame the arc of human knowledge and its links to the inception of the industrial revolution and our modern world.

Philosophers are tying to fulfill this demand but they are soon joined by proto-scientists and the resulting clash changes the public's understanding of reality. Now we take science for granted.The change is chronicled and explained in this book. My two complaints are that the book is a repetitive at times and the introduction was too long. I recommend it for people who like scholarly research and debates on the evolution of methodology."

Organizing the history of science as this book does seems a daunting task, but more of an effort should have made in decreasing chronological back and forth leaping. It is hard to grasp which details are more important than others and what events came before others. Similarly, Many concepts were explained extensively when a much shorter description would have sufficed. These two weaknesses make the book hard to follow and stick to. "

It traces the intellectual achievements directly preceding or causing the Scientific Revolution and natural philosophers/early scientists realization that Aristotelian philosophy was not a reliable lens through which to look at the cosmos and that the authority of Aristotle ultimately needed to be completely abandoned on the grounds of newly contrived observation-based science, which would come to displace the ancient Greeks."

Sudden changes of direction, an overabundance of linguistic minutiae, and more than a few cheap shots against the academic opposition yield a volume that is more tome than tale; unnecessarily arcane and less-than-approachable.I look forward to writing a hearty recommendation for an abridged edition, but in its present form I'll leave it at this: The Invention of Science will reward the intrepid reader with a great many interesting things.Edit: this review captures the sentiment far more eloquently (and patiently) than I can manage.

218,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill,4,"David Wootton is a professor of history at the University of York.  In The Invention of Science he proposes a new view of the definition, the significance, and the timing of the “Scientific Revolution.”  Most historians would point to Copernicus as the initiator of the revolution with his publication in 1543 of a heliocentric vision of the universe.   But Wootton argues that Copernicus was not really a scientist in that he did not attempt to gather new data - he relied on the observations of the ancients.  Nor was he as revolutionary as once thought.  He envisioned the earth and the planets as located in solid crystalline spheres that rotated around and within each other.  He was concerned with preserving Aristotle’s concept of celestial circular motion.  Indeed, one did not contradict Aristotle lightly; from the end of the eleventh century until the middle of the eighteenth Aristotle’s take on natural phenomena was taught in the universities across Europe; his influence was profound.Adding to the ossification of knowledge was an unquestioning belief in the literal truth of the Bible.  Between the teachings of Aristotle and the Bible, most European thinkers concluded “there was no such thing as new knowledge.”The epistemological issues Wootton discusses are fascinating.  He observes, for example, that the notion of “discovery” was a relatively modern concept.  When Columbus “discovered” the New World, this was a game-changer; before this, the assumption was that there were no “discoveries” to be made.  Pursuant to the texts accepted as authoritative, “the greatest achievements of civilization were believed to lie not in the present or the future but in the past, in ancient Greece and classical Rome.” Wootton also takes on the theory of scientific “revolutions” formulated and popularized by Thomas Kuhn. Kuhn, writing at the peak of the intellectual infatuation with post-modernism, stated that science has undergone several distinct revolutions in the form of paradigm shifts, in which scientists did not so much discover new data, but rather began to view the same data in a different light. No, says Wootton. Kuhn’s analytical lenses were too narrowly constructed; he lost sight, Wootton argues persuasively, of the wider environment within which those shifts took place.

Sudden changes of direction, an overabundance of linguistic minutiae, and more than a few cheap shots against the academic opposition yield a volume that is more tome than tale; unnecessarily arcane and less-than-approachable.I look forward to writing a hearty recommendation for an abridged edition, but in its present form I'll leave it at this: The Invention of Science will reward the intrepid reader with a great many interesting things.Edit: this review captures the sentiment far more eloquently (and patiently) than I can manage. Still three stars."
248,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill,4,"David Wootton is a professor of history at the University of York.  In The Invention of Science he proposes a new view of the definition, the significance, and the timing of the “Scientific Revolution.”  Most historians would point to Copernicus as the initiator of the revolution with his publication in 1543 of a heliocentric vision of the universe.   But Wootton argues that Copernicus was not really a scientist in that he did not attempt to gather new data - he relied on the observations of the ancients.  Nor was he as revolutionary as once thought.  He envisioned the earth and the planets as located in solid crystalline spheres that rotated around and within each other.  He was concerned with preserving Aristotle’s concept of celestial circular motion.  Indeed, one did not contradict Aristotle lightly; from the end of the eleventh century until the middle of the eighteenth Aristotle’s take on natural phenomena was taught in the universities across Europe; his influence was profound.Adding to the ossification of knowledge was an unquestioning belief in the literal truth of the Bible.  Between the teachings of Aristotle and the Bible, most European thinkers concluded “there was no such thing as new knowledge.”The epistemological issues Wootton discusses are fascinating.  He observes, for example, that the notion of “discovery” was a relatively modern concept.  When Columbus “discovered” the New World, this was a game-changer; before this, the assumption was that there were no “discoveries” to be made.  Pursuant to the texts accepted as authoritative, “the greatest achievements of civilization were believed to lie not in the present or the future but in the past, in ancient Greece and classical Rome.” Wootton also takes on the theory of scientific “revolutions” formulated and popularized by Thomas Kuhn. Kuhn, writing at the peak of the intellectual infatuation with post-modernism, stated that science has undergone several distinct revolutions in the form of paradigm shifts, in which scientists did not so much discover new data, but rather began to view the same data in a different light. No, says Wootton. Kuhn’s analytical lenses were too narrowly constructed; he lost sight, Wootton argues persuasively, of the wider environment within which those shifts took place. Wootton suggests that modern science was invented between 1572, when Tycho Brahe discovered a new star [which we now know was a distant super nova], and 1704, when Isaac Newton published his work on prisms.  What made the difference, according to Wootton, was the notion of “discovery”; a research program; precise measurements; a community of experts; the willingness to question long-established certainties in light of new evidence; and above all, the triumph of experience over philosophy.  Furthermore, the invention of the printing press accelerated the process by transforming access to information and becoming itself an agent of change.  To support his thesis, he presents a detailed history of how science worked before, during, and after this period. “Science” itself was until recently known as “natural philosophy,” and the word “scientist” was not used until the 19th Century!  Wootton analyzes language closely, because, as he stresses, “[a]ll history involves translation from the source language.”  But understanding the words originally used also can indicate how the words signified for a particular place and time.  In fact, one of Wootton’s key premises is that “a revolution in ideas requires a revolution in language.”Thus, Wootton argues that the scientific revolution was not merely a collection of new discoveries, but rather a cultural transformation.  The printing press, in addition to its benefits mentioned above, was instrumental in the intellectual revolution because it fostered the dissemination and criticism (“peer review”) of new ideas.  New instruments (telescopes, microscopes, barometers, prisms) allowed the discovery of new facts.  Finally, the new science was given a distinctive identity by a new language that stressed facts, theories, hypotheses, and laws. Evaluation: Wootton has mastered a truly enormous corpus of scholarly work.   His bibliography runs to 68 pages.  His writing is lucid and interesting, even when he is discussing arcane issues of historiography, and in comparison to most other books on epistemology.  This book is well worth the effort.  "
249,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4443481-sarah-beth,3,"I received an uncorrected proof copy of this book from HarperCollins. As indicated by the title, this is a history of what we recognize today as ""science."" Science as we know it was invented between 1572 and 1704. Modern science is so deeply ingrained in our society and culture that it's difficult to imagine a world before scientific facts. While there were systems of knowledge we call sciences before this time period, few of them functioned like a modern science aside from astronomy. Wootton further argues that between 1600 and 1733, ""the intellectual world of the educated elite changed more rapidly than at any time in previous history, and perhaps than at any time before the twentieth century"" (11). The compass, surface tension, the geography of our planet, microscopes, telescopes, and more advanced knowledge of stars and celestial bodies all emerged during this time period. Interestingly, a main focus of the book is on the evolution in terminology and concepts related to modern day science. For instance, ""before Columbus discovered America in 1492 there was no clear-cut and well-established idea of discovery; the idea of discovery is [...] a precondition for the invention of science"" (55). In other words, before Columbus, intellectuals concerned themselves with recovering lost knowledge of the past, not in establishing new knowledge. Modern day science, which seeks to discover or uncover new knowledge had to evolve as a concept before experimentation and scientific exploration could evolve. Similarly, the very word 'science', 'hypothesis,' 'experiment,' and 'fact' as we know them today did not exist before the Scientific Revolution. A world without facts is difficult to comprehend to readers who live in a culture so wholly dependent on facts, but in the past there was only truth, opinion, knowledge, experience, or persuasion - ""facts"" did not exist. I also learned some interesting background on multiple well known historical figures including Galileo. The section detailing the emergence of many mathematical theories through the work of artists was fascinating. Additionally, the book is quite literally littered with interesting tidbits of facts. For instance, through as late as 1320, it was thought that ""ships sail uphill as they sail out on the ocean (we still acknowledge this traditional view when we use the term 'the high sea' or 'the high seas')"" (113). In the spirit of full disclosure, I must confess that aside from the few specifics I shared above, I struggled making it through this book. For someone whose only knowledge of science's history comes from high school history and science classes, this book felt far too in-depth and way over my head. On top of that, the book is immense and sprawling and I felt bogged down by its hundreds of pages of minutiae related to hundreds of individuals and amazingly diverse scientific developments. I would not recommend this history for a novice. That being said, it was obviously incredibly well researched and made many valid points that have relevance for everyone who lives in the modern world. "
250,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5937558-lynn,1,"Today's post is on The Invention of Science: A New History of the Scientific Revolution by David Wootton. It is 768 pages long and is published by HarperCollins. The cover is an art print of a hand and a compass. The intended reader is someone who is interested in scientific history. There is no language, no sex, and no violence in this book. There Be Spoilers Ahead.From the back of the book- A companion to such acclaimed works as The Age of Wonder, A Clockwork Universe, and Darwin’s Ghosts—a groundbreaking examination of the greatest event in history, the Scientific Revolution, and how it came to change the way we understand ourselves and our world.We live in a world transformed by scientific discovery. Yet today, science and its practitioners have come under political attack. In this fascinating history spanning continents and centuries, historian David Wootton offers a lively defense of science, revealing why the Scientific Revolution was truly the greatest event in our history.The Invention of Science goes back five hundred years in time to chronicle this crucial transformation, exploring the factors that led to its birth and the people who made it happen. Wootton argues that the Scientific Revolution was actually five separate yet concurrent events that developed independently, but came to intersect and create a new worldview. Here are the brilliant iconoclasts—Galileo, Copernicus, Brahe, Newton, and many more curious minds from across Europe—whose studies of the natural world challenged centuries of religious orthodoxy and ingrained superstition.From gunpowder technology, the discovery of the new world, movable type printing, perspective painting, and the telescope to the practice of conducting experiments, the laws of nature, and the concept of the fact, Wotton shows how these discoveries codified into a social construct and a system of knowledge. Ultimately, he makes clear the link between scientific discovery and the rise of industrialization—and the birth of the modern world we know.Review- I wanted to like and enjoy this book so much but it was so bogged down by too many details and tangents that I could not. At times, too few and far between, Wootton would talk about something really interesting like how scientists came to the ideas they are famous for or how they did not come to them alone. But most of the this book is some kind of tangent. Wootton has so much that he is trying to do that he does none of them. I was mostly bored doing this book. I had to use the graduate student skim to read this book. I hate using the graduate student skim. I guess if too detailed books about any subject are your thing, you should try this. If you are looking for an interesting book about science came to be as we know it today then skip this one.I give this book a One out of Five stars. I was given a copy of this book by HarperCollins in exchange for an honest review. "

252,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1409618-mattr76,4,"This excellent, comprehensive, astonishingly well-researched, and above all enthralling book seeks to establish an inflection point in history indicating the birth of science, much like Stephen Greenblatt's The Swerve. But rather than focusing on the rediscovery of Lucretius, Wootton looks to the discovery of America and the nova observed by Tycho Brahe as the moments that shattered the crystal spheres of Aristotle and ushered in the new science with its basis in experiment. Additionally, he tracks the emergence of science linguistically, by identifying when the modern contexts (which we take for granted) of scientific words, such as ""fact,"" ""evidence,"" ""experiment,"" ""hypothesis,"" and ""theory,"" come into use. I found this a compelling method, as well as an interesting counterpoint to my limited experience with Aristotle (his ""Physics""), in which I got frustrated with his deduction from etymology (not a real example, but something like, ""rainbows are beams of light curved into bows by the rain, and that is why we call them rainbows""). I am a big fan of the ancient Greeks and Platonic philosophy, but as far as I am concerned, Aristotle got what he deserved.This book makes clear that we are still living through an intellectual revolution, one that touches on all aspects of our lives, and is still meeting with resistance while deepening our understanding of the Universe, half a millennium later. May the revolution continue."

277,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57971999-rj,3,"This book landed on my shelf accompanied with the observation that, ""it contains a great many interesting things.""With that in mind, I tagged along with Wootton through the lurching technological and social changes that replaced the almost-unimaginable medieval worldview with the foundation of our own.As fascinating (and timely) as the story may be, it's dragged down by details and stalls well short of its promise. Sudden changes of direction, an overabundance of linguistic minutiae, and more than a few cheap shots against the academic opposition yield a volume that is more tome than tale; unnecessarily arcane and less-than-approachable.I look forward to writing a hearty recommendation for an abridged edition, but in its present form I'll leave it at this: The Invention of Science will reward the intrepid reader with a great many interesting things.Edit: this review captures the sentiment far more eloquently (and patiently) than I can manage. Still three stars."
278,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill,4,"David Wootton is a professor of history at the University of York.  In The Invention of Science he proposes a new view of the definition, the significance, and the timing of the “Scientific Revolution.”  Most historians would point to Copernicus as the initiator of the revolution with his publication in 1543 of a heliocentric vision of the universe.   But Wootton argues that Copernicus was not really a scientist in that he did not attempt to gather new data - he relied on the observations of the ancients.  Nor was he as revolutionary as once thought.  He envisioned the earth and the planets as located in solid crystalline spheres that rotated around and within each other.  He was concerned with preserving Aristotle’s concept of celestial circular motion.  Indeed, one did not contradict Aristotle lightly; from the end of the eleventh century until the middle of the eighteenth Aristotle’s take on natural phenomena was taught in the universities across Europe; his influence was profound.Adding to the ossification of knowledge was an unquestioning belief in the literal truth of the Bible.  Between the teachings of Aristotle and the Bible, most European thinkers concluded “there was no such thing as new knowledge.”The epistemological issues Wootton discusses are fascinating.  He observes, for example, that the notion of “discovery” was a relatively modern concept.  When Columbus “discovered” the New World, this was a game-changer; before this, the assumption was that there were no “discoveries” to be made.  Pursuant to the texts accepted as authoritative, “the greatest achievements of civilization were believed to lie not in the present or the future but in the past, in ancient Greece and classical Rome.” Wootton also takes on the theory of scientific “revolutions” formulated and popularized by Thomas Kuhn. Kuhn, writing at the peak of the intellectual infatuation with post-modernism, stated that science has undergone several distinct revolutions in the form of paradigm shifts, in which scientists did not so much discover new data, but rather began to view the same data in a different light. No, says Wootton. Kuhn’s analytical lenses were too narrowly constructed; he lost sight, Wootton argues persuasively, of the wider environment within which those shifts took place. Wootton suggests that modern science was invented between 1572, when Tycho Brahe discovered a new star [which we now know was a distant super nova], and 1704, when Isaac Newton published his work on prisms.  What made the difference, according to Wootton, was the notion of “discovery”; a research program; precise measurements; a community of experts; the willingness to question long-established certainties in light of new evidence; and above all, the triumph of experience over philosophy.  Furthermore, the invention of the printing press accelerated the process by transforming access to information and becoming itself an agent of change.  To support his thesis, he presents a detailed history of how science worked before, during, and after this period. “Science” itself was until recently known as “natural philosophy,” and the word “scientist” was not used until the 19th Century!  Wootton analyzes language closely, because, as he stresses, “[a]ll history involves translation from the source language.”  But understanding the words originally used also can indicate how the words signified for a particular place and time.  In fact, one of Wootton’s key premises is that “a revolution in ideas requires a revolution in language.”Thus, Wootton argues that the scientific revolution was not merely a collection of new discoveries, but rather a cultural transformation.  The printing press, in addition to its benefits mentioned above, was instrumental in the intellectual revolution because it fostered the dissemination and criticism (“peer review”) of new ideas.  New instruments (telescopes, microscopes, barometers, prisms) allowed the discovery of new facts.  Finally, the new science was given a distinctive identity by a new language that stressed facts, theories, hypotheses, and laws. Evaluation: Wootton has mastered a truly enormous corpus of scholarly work.   His bibliography runs to 68 pages.  His writing is lucid and interesting, even when he is discussing arcane issues of historiography, and in comparison to most other books on epistemology.  This book is well worth the effort.  "
279,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4443481-sarah-beth,3,"I received an uncorrected proof copy of this book from HarperCollins. As indicated by the title, this is a history of what we recognize today as ""science."" Science as we know it was invented between 1572 and 1704. Modern science is so deeply ingrained in our society and culture that it's difficult to imagine a world before scientific facts. While there were systems of knowledge we call sciences before this time period, few of them functioned like a modern science aside from astronomy. Wootton further argues that between 1600 and 1733, ""the intellectual world of the educated elite changed more rapidly than at any time in previous history, and perhaps than at any time before the twentieth century"" (11). The compass, surface tension, the geography of our planet, microscopes, telescopes, and more advanced knowledge of stars and celestial bodies all emerged during this time period. Interestingly, a main focus of the book is on the evolution in terminology and concepts related to modern day science. For instance, ""before Columbus discovered America in 1492 there was no clear-cut and well-established idea of discovery; the idea of discovery is [...] a precondition for the invention of science"" (55). In other words, before Columbus, intellectuals concerned themselves with recovering lost knowledge of the past, not in establishing new knowledge. Modern day science, which seeks to discover or uncover new knowledge had to evolve as a concept before experimentation and scientific exploration could evolve. Similarly, the very word 'science', 'hypothesis,' 'experiment,' and 'fact' as we know them today did not exist before the Scientific Revolution. A world without facts is difficult to comprehend to readers who live in a culture so wholly dependent on facts, but in the past there was only truth, opinion, knowledge, experience, or persuasion - ""facts"" did not exist. I also learned some interesting background on multiple well known historical figures including Galileo. The section detailing the emergence of many mathematical theories through the work of artists was fascinating. Additionally, the book is quite literally littered with interesting tidbits of facts. For instance, through as late as 1320, it was thought that ""ships sail uphill as they sail out on the ocean (we still acknowledge this traditional view when we use the term 'the high sea' or 'the high seas')"" (113). In the spirit of full disclosure, I must confess that aside from the few specifics I shared above, I struggled making it through this book. For someone whose only knowledge of science's history comes from high school history and science classes, this book felt far too in-depth and way over my head. On top of that, the book is immense and sprawling and I felt bogged down by its hundreds of pages of minutiae related to hundreds of individuals and amazingly diverse scientific developments. I would not recommend this history for a novice. That being said, it was obviously incredibly well researched and made many valid points that have relevance for everyone who lives in the modern world. "
280,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5937558-lynn,1,"Today's post is on The Invention of Science: A New History of the Scientific Revolution by David Wootton. It is 768 pages long and is published by HarperCollins. The cover is an art print of a hand and a compass. The intended reader is someone who is interested in scientific history. There is no language, no sex, and no violence in this book. There Be Spoilers Ahead.From the back of the book- A companion to such acclaimed works as The Age of Wonder, A Clockwork Universe, and Darwin’s Ghosts—a groundbreaking examination of the greatest event in history, the Scientific Revolution, and how it came to change the way we understand ourselves and our world.We live in a world transformed by scientific discovery. Yet today, science and its practitioners have come under political attack. In this fascinating history spanning continents and centuries, historian David Wootton offers a lively defense of science, revealing why the Scientific Revolution was truly the greatest event in our history.The Invention of Science goes back five hundred years in time to chronicle this crucial transformation, exploring the factors that led to its birth and the people who made it happen. Wootton argues that the Scientific Revolution was actually five separate yet concurrent events that developed independently, but came to intersect and create a new worldview. Here are the brilliant iconoclasts—Galileo, Copernicus, Brahe, Newton, and many more curious minds from across Europe—whose studies of the natural world challenged centuries of religious orthodoxy and ingrained superstition.From gunpowder technology, the discovery of the new world, movable type printing, perspective painting, and the telescope to the practice of conducting experiments, the laws of nature, and the concept of the fact, Wotton shows how these discoveries codified into a social construct and a system of knowledge. Ultimately, he makes clear the link between scientific discovery and the rise of industrialization—and the birth of the modern world we know.Review- I wanted to like and enjoy this book so much but it was so bogged down by too many details and tangents that I could not. At times, too few and far between, Wootton would talk about something really interesting like how scientists came to the ideas they are famous for or how they did not come to them alone. But most of the this book is some kind of tangent. Wootton has so much that he is trying to do that he does none of them. I was mostly bored doing this book. I had to use the graduate student skim to read this book. I hate using the graduate student skim. I guess if too detailed books about any subject are your thing, you should try this. If you are looking for an interesting book about science came to be as we know it today then skip this one.I give this book a One out of Five stars. I was given a copy of this book by HarperCollins in exchange for an honest review. "

282,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1409618-mattr76,4,"This excellent, comprehensive, astonishingly well-researched, and above all enthralling book seeks to establish an inflection point in history indicating the birth of science, much like Stephen Greenblatt's The Swerve. But rather than focusing on the rediscovery of Lucretius, Wootton looks to the discovery of America and the nova observed by Tycho Brahe as the moments that shattered the crystal spheres of Aristotle and ushered in the new science with its basis in experiment. Additionally, he tracks the emergence of science linguistically, by identifying when the modern contexts (which we take for granted) of scientific words, such as ""fact,"" ""evidence,"" ""experiment,"" ""hypothesis,"" and ""theory,"" come into use. I found this a compelling method, as well as an interesting counterpoint to my limited experience with Aristotle (his ""Physics""), in which I got frustrated with his deduction from etymology (not a real example, but something like, ""rainbows are beams of light curved into bows by the rain, and that is why we call them rainbows""). I am a big fan of the ancient Greeks and Platonic philosophy, but as far as I am concerned, Aristotle got what he deserved.This book makes clear that we are still living through an intellectual revolution, one that touches on all aspects of our lives, and is still meeting with resistance while deepening our understanding of the Universe, half a millennium later. May the revolution continue."
283,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1060231-todd,5,"A tour de force of science, history, philosophy, language, cartography and sociology. Without some prior background regarding folks like Galileo, Newton, Boyle, Bacon, Popper, Kuhn, etc., this densely packed reading may not digest easily. For those ready for the ride, there is much on offer here. Wootton makes two arguments regarding the Scientific Revolution. First, contrary to post-modern attempts to wipe it away, a revolution in thought with essential antecedents and radical consequences occurred. Second, that it was mostly a 17th century happening (following from Brahe's observation of a supernova and culminating with Newton's publication of ""Opticks"") and not, as many would have it, a mid/late 16th century transformation with the publication of Copernicus's ""On the Revolutions..."" as the pivotal moment. The most complete and enjoyable history of science book I've read in quite some time. "
284,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7633688-les,4,"This a very comprehensive, detailed history of the scientific revolution. The author lays out, in extensive detail, both the events and environment which led to the development of science as we know it today. The book is extremely thorough. As a result, it is also quite dense and requires reading of the extensive footnotes as you go to completely understand many of the observations/conclusions of the author. In some cases, it seemed as if significant parts of the analysis were relegated to footnotes when the reader would be better served having the information included in the text. On more than one occasion, an event the author described reminded me of something in Neal Stevenson's Baroque Cycle, which I found enjoyable.This is a challenging book that requires perseverance. It is well worth the effort if you have a real interest in history and science."
285,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8670076-john-doyle,3,"For millennia before the 16th Century the notions of discovery, experiments, and facts had not been invented and tools for the collection and preservation of knowledge (i.e. telescopes, microscopes, and books) did not exist. Ironically, during the same period humanity also reached the apex of its omniscience. This thanks to priests, philosophers, and others who earnestly sought to help their fellow travelers find firm ground in an uncertain world. The Invention of Science has within it all of the content amateur historians need to frame the arc of human knowledge and its links to the inception of the industrial revolution and our modern world. Unfortunately, as in our DNA, the gaps between the genes are long and seemingly unnecessary."

It was experience that marked the difference between the new sciences and the old."" Well worth the read if you're into science, philosophy, or linguistics."
287,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28781546-ana,3,"If I lived in the Middle Ages, all the world's knowledge is encapsulated in the Bible and the lost knowledge of the ancients. But if there is only one truth then it should be provable. Philosophers are tying to fulfill this demand but they are soon joined by proto-scientists and the resulting clash changes the public's understanding of reality. Now we take science for granted.The change is chronicled and explained in this book. My two complaints are that the book is a repetitive at times and the introduction was too long. I recommend it for people who like scholarly research and debates on the evolution of methodology."
288,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55425271-arasibo-campeche,3,"This was an interesting book that gives great insight into the development of science as we think about it today. Organizing the history of science as this book does seems a daunting task, but more of an effort should have made in decreasing chronological back and forth leaping. It is hard to grasp which details are more important than others and what events came before others. Similarly, Many concepts were explained extensively when a much shorter description would have sufficed. These two weaknesses make the book hard to follow and stick to. "
289,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18408798-polly-ingraham,4,"History of science--- always one of my favorite topics for reading. English major's gotta try to fill in those gaps somehow! This is one BIG book, with lengthy riffs on the meaning of words like, say, ""fact"" or ""experiment."" A little ponderous sometimes, but hey. If , like me, you're always hungry for detailed discussions of Aristotle, Galileo, Newton, Descartes, you get 'em here. Women? Mostly missing, alas. "
290,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34264503-jeremy-pike,5,"The content of the book is superb, priceless. It traces the intellectual achievements directly preceding or causing the Scientific Revolution and natural philosophers/early scientists realization that Aristotelian philosophy was not a reliable lens through which to look at the cosmos and that the authority of Aristotle ultimately needed to be completely abandoned on the grounds of newly contrived observation-based science, which would come to displace the ancient Greeks."
291,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46721552-david,4,"It's good to see a clear counter to postmodern ideas. Wootton is full of interesting facts and observations about critical events (perspective painting, the discovery of America, Tycho Brahe's observations of the supernova of 1572, and many more),""killer facts"" that made earlier theories almost immediately untenable, and changes in ways of thinking. Way too long, but it's easy to skim the tedious parts. "
292,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20607401-nikkia-neil,5,thanks edelweiss for this arc. It's not often you find a science history book that reads so smoothly and fast. I loved how David Wootton broke up the chapters and sections of this book so that it all came together perfectly. The pictures are great also. I hope my kids we read this one day for school. 
293,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10248355-steve,4,"Some very entertaining, interesting , and informative material,in this book. There's also a bit too much etymology for my tastes, and the author seems to dwell extensively on specific terms and where they came from. The scientific history is fascinating, and makes the book a worthwhile read. Heavy footnotes and endnotes sometimes distract."
294,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21825666-m,4,This is a book where I don't feel necessarily qualified to judge its conclusions because the level of detail it presents is more granular than my knowledge of the subject prior to reading. I think it did a fine job of making a case for questioning the dismissals of certain concepts by some relativists while acknowledging the pitfalls of naive realism.I'd like to reread this in a few years.
295,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7882762-ben,4,"Not a beach read, but an interesting book on what I'll call metascience - the science of understanding science, i.e., how in 200 short years, the world went from believing in alchemy and superstition to trusting in facts, evidence, hypotheses, and the scientific method."
296,006175952X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39348787-dr-wadhwa,5,"A history written in a scientific way. The book separates itself from ethnocentric-based historical texts and presents a scientific-based history of past thinkers, their opinions, and their philosophies. "
