0,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6789591-retroj,3,"Why am I reading a twenty year old popular physics book? The title alone would have been enough to make me steer clear — this label, god particle, for the Higgs boson, is just the kind of hype and misrepresentation that science does not need — I can't get behind that. Nevertheless... well, a friend gave me a copy of this book and said that it was one of his favorite books, so, yeah, that's why. Despite initial misgivings, I did eventually come to enjoy it. Despite some slow parts and some theoretical parts where the book is beginning to show its age, I did come away with an overall favorable impression, and would recommend it to others for certain topics that it covered splendidly.The best of them were the detailed explanations of how many important particle physics experiments throughout history were done — how they proved what they proved, and how the apparatus was constructed. One tends to read pop physics by theorists, but this one is by an experimenter, a Nobel Prize winning experimenter at that. It's a different perspective from most of what other physics I have read, and has a nuts and bolts feel to it. You get a hardware-level look at everything from Galileo's inclined planes, to the earliest alpha-particle scattering experiments to the invention and development of cyclotrons and synchrotrons, and the different kinds of detectors used in them. We also learn about how different experimental setups competed for some of the same discoveries, and the relative advantages and disadvantages of, say, electron-positron colliders compared to proton-antiproton colliders.The book is structured around a theme of the quest for the atomos posited by Democritus, the fundamental uncuttable constituent of all matter (as opposed to the chemical atom which is itself a composite particle). This theme is traced all the way from Democritus (what little we know of him) to the physicists of the Enlightenment, the 19th century, and into the modern era. I found the connection to ancient Greek philosophy to be a bit of a stretch, or at least over-emphasized, but it was at least food for thought. There were some whimsical digressions where the author played with this theme — imaginary conversations with Democritus — that I personally found to be the most dull parts of the book. On the other hand, there were also fascinating stories about famous scientists that I had not heard before, and even a few lesser-known scientists that I was introduced to for the first time, like Boscovich. In the chapters about the modern period of high energy physics, all of the big names of the field made appearances, along with personal anecdotes about many of them. The parts written as memoir are some of the most entertaining parts of the book.This book is becoming a little bit dated as far as the physics and cosmology it covers is concerned. Not so much that it's wrong, as that it is incomplete. At the time this was written, the Superconducting Supercollider project had not yet been cancelled, the Large Hadron Collider had not yet been announced, the tau particle had not been discovered, the accelerating expansion of the universe (and dark energy) was unknown, and the age of the universe was only known to be ""about 15 billion years"". For this reason, I did not focus so much on the physics and cosmology in the book, and read more for the history and engineering. This made some parts of the book seem like a very slow read.There was one outright error in the edition that I read that first brought me confusion, then surprise. I can only hope that it was corrected in later editions. On page 278, the time-energy uncertainty principle was described incorrectly: ""borrowed energy times the duration of the loan must be greater than Planck's constant divided by twice pi"". That should read ""uncertainty of ..."" for both terms, and four pi, not two pi. I also wondered about another statement later in the book, but I forget now what it was.To end on a positive note, I did want to mention that Leon Lederman is a very entertaining personality and his personality comes through vividly in his writing. There were definitely some laugh-out-loud moments in this book. I'm glad to have taken time to learn about Leon Lederman's life and work and his contributions to our understanding of the universe. "
1,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/664522-jim,5,"A very lively, funny, and informative book by Nobel Laureate Leon Lederman. The first part of the book is a vivid and hilarious historical survey of ideas and discoveries in Western physics from the Greeks down to the present day. Having brought you as a reader step by step on this journey, Lederman then opens the door to his own utterly fascinating but little-understood speciality, particle physics. Lederman conveys with excitement and humor what it is like to be one of two or three people in the world who are pushing the frontiers of scientific knowledge in a particular specialized area. This book is especially significant right now, in 2008, as we are about to see the Large Hadron Collider, the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator, begin operation. The entire aim of the LHC is to find the elusive Higgs boson, the ""God Particle"" of the book's title, which would largely confirm the Standard Model of physics. Leon Lederman takes you by the hand and walks you through all these ideas with joy and humor. This is one of the sharpest science books for the general reader ever published. "
2,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24511832-nikhil-narain,5,"An extraordinary book. Engrossing without being over simplistic and filled with wit and interesting anecdotes, The God Particle is a chronicle of the human intellectual endeavour to answer some of the Universe's most challenging questions. Lucidly written and inspiring, it is a must read for anyone even remotely interested in Physics. "
3,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"Lederman provides an entertaining history of physics and much of it is accessible to the general reader. Interestingly, he writes that it takes a grad student at least two years ""to develop quantum intuition."" This comment bolsters the confidence of the lay reader. The book leads to the so-called God particle. What gives particles their mass, he asks, and then he answers that ""we suspect a field."" The Higgs field he writes later, generates all mass. As massless particles (light of various wave lengths?) travel across space, they acquire (rest) mass. Provokingly, he states that mass, therefore, may not be a fundamental attribute of matter, ""but a property acquired by the interaction of particles and their environment."" Empty space ""is awash in particles that are temporary,"" he writes. Is the Higgs field the new aether Lederman asks? What is implied here is that space is not merely a metric (measurement of distance by time) but is a ""something"" after all: ""When you next look out at the night sky you should be aware that all of space is filled with this mysterious Higgs influence...."" In contrast to those who state that gravity is only an attractive force, Lederman clarifies that there are two types of mass. There is big mass that pulls and inertial mass that resists being pulled by ""a force."" If that is the case, then how is it said that gravity is only an attractive force between two bodies? And does gravity not exhibit the oscillation between the attractive and repulsive forces that occur on the atomic scale? If there are four forces in nature, might there be two underlying patterns to them as one of the Greeks (Empledocles - love and hate, harmony and discord?) theorized two millenia ago: attraction and resistance? Alternatively, under Einstein geometric theory of gravity, is gravity really a force at all? Is there need for a graviton? Also in support of Einstein and counter to Lederman, John Archibald Wheeler tosses Newton's ""inertial mass"" and ""gravitational mass"" aside, along with his theory of motion. There's motion, but it's created by ""rolling down hill"" so to say, and not by any magical pulling and resistance forces. Interesting stuff. "
4,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81204-ellen,3,"As a history of particle physics, it's pretty good. However, I still had to consult Wikipedia after I read it to find out what the Higgs field is (the point of the book was to tell the story of the quest to prove its existence, upon which all of particle theory rests...), And despite many references to God and Creation, Lederman is still a champion of making science more accessible to the general public. And there's this one great passage where he rips on ""The Tao of Physics"" and other pseudo-science books that are written and sold by people who abuse their credentials (yes!).""The public sees science as some monolithic edifice of unbending rules and beliefs, and-- thanks to the media's portrayal of scientists as uptight nerds in white coats-- sees scientists as stodgy old artery-hardened defenders of the status quo. In truth, science is a much more flexible thing. Science is not about status quo. It's about revolution."""
5,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11921940-almir-olovcic,5,"Great piece of science book, hard to understand in moments, but overall funny, vivid and informing book. Would recommend to everyone interested in world around us and development of atom theory from Greeks to modern days."
6,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93891880-ashot-nazaryan,5,"Perfect physicist and amazing book. The end of the book is the most interesting..when he imagine how science would progress in 2020 (the book was written in 1993), 500 TeV accelerators, super-trains with 2200 mph velocity, etc...and abruptly notice these news: CONGRESSIONAL FUNDING FOR THE SUPER COLLIDER IN DOUBT.I think he would roll over in his coffin if he knows that the only ""progress"" we have in 2020 is the ""Iphone 11 PRO""."
7,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3903826-dallas,4,"This book provides an interesting foray into the deep mechanisms of particle physics. Nicknamed 'The Plumber'(due to his preference for experimentation) by Murray Gell-Mann, it is clear from this book that Lederman's work in the 60s and 70s is nothing short of Nobel calibre. This book is fairly dense in terms of physics technicalities, but one can still appreciate the humorous anecdotes throughout. As generally explained in the book, a neutrino ('little neutral one') is an elementary particle of neutral electric charge and almost 0 mass. Neutrinos are extremely difficult to detect, yet more than 50 trillion of them pass through our bodies every second (via the sun). Leptons (electrons, muons, and the tau) can also be neutrinos with corresponding antineutrinos. These are said to be the ""flavours"" of a neutrino. Lederman's Nobel Prize, in 1988, was awarded ""for the neutrino beam method and the demonstration of the doublet structure of the leptons through the discovery of the muon neutrino"", and it was shared with Schwartz and Steinberger. As an aside, direct evidence for the neutrino related to the tau was announced by Fermilab (a particle accelerator like the LHC, but in Chicago) in July 2000. Current studies indicate that neutrinos have a small but nonzero mass. Travel at light-speed is impossible for objects having mass. Since so many neutrinos are predicted to exist, their combined mass may be sufficient to cause all the matter in the Universe to eventually collapse into a single point, which might then explode and create a completely new Universe."
8,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/306886-pablo,0,"I'm really interested in quantum physics (layman's quantum physics), particularly when using the discipline to try to gain a greater understanding of the very fabric of existence and how that begins to approach spirituality. In theory, God Particle has the recipe to satisy this penchant, but I cannot get past Lederman's hokey methods e.g. fabricating a conversation with a Greek philosopher that is supposed to be funny but is actually as entertaining as watching a silent film without picture. Lederman tries to use humor to engage the layman reader but he ends up obfuscating the message he is trying to deliver. Lederman may be a brilliant scientist but he is a piss poor humorist. "
9,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10378646-alain,4,"It's not an easy reading, but Leon Ledderman is a fabulous and funny story teller. He brings to the layman understanding of rhe profound laws that govern the universe. I can't say I got it all, but I surely feel like I understand a bit more what's going on in the world of the very very very small.30 years ago we thought the atom was the final frontier but today with the quarks and the leptons and the gluons and now Higgs boson the cosmos shows us that there are a lot of strange things going on right in (in fact also inside) our face.The book becomes very actual with the recent discovery in July 2012 of the famous Higgs boson. A must read if you want to get it a bit more. "
10,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7068005-katie,3,"I would not describe Lederman as a Feynman by any means but he is comparable to Simon Singh by way of Brain Green, though I prefer Singh's work simply due to the absence of obnoxious puns and over the top attempts at some form of verb schtick. Overall, it was okay with the amount of information that was easily obtained and ability to comprehend but the writing style was beyond annoying bordering on tedious."
11,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4806836-a,3,"This was an interesting and (mostly) accessible read. I got a bit bogged down in the detailed quark chapters, and it was a bummer to be reading something written in the early 90s, because it (obviously) left out everything from then until the present, which ended the book with a lot of questions. But otherwise it was entertaining and interesting."

It probably wouldn't be so bad if I hadn't read 800 million history of physics books in the past...this one isn't so great stacked up next to _In Search of Schrodinger's Cat_, or _Brief History of Time_, but if you have to read ONE, I guess it'll do."

17,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96942433-basel,5,"Who knew a book about particle physics, with all of its glory of quantum theory, quarks, leptons, some weird things I can’t pronounce and much more, would be actually very funny and hilarious at times! Published in 1993 as the hunt for the Higgs boson was intensifying, “The God Particle. If the universe is the answer, what is the question?” is simply a great book on science by the Noble laureate and particle physicist Leon Lederman (In collaboration with science writer Dick Teresi). Much like what Stephen Hawiking did with A Brief History of Time, letting us voyage on journey through the infinitely massive to learn about the cosmos, here Lederman takes on a voyage through the infinitely tiny throughout human history, searching for the most elementary building blocks of everything, namely, the yet to be discovered elementary particle, the Higgs Boson which he dubbed “The God Particle”. The particle, which was confirmed by CERN in 2013, is so important and crucial in our understanding of the universe and reality that it would be beyond me to express how important it is here. That said, what’s great about this book is how accessible it is. Surely physicists and science enthusiasts will understand more references here, especially the scientific ones. But, I can’t stress this enough, this is a funny and charming book. It’s filled with many different anecdotes, funny metaphors, puns, and different stories. One of my favorite parts of the book is at the beginning where Lederman conducts a humorous, yet very insightful, fictional dialogue between himself and Democritus, the pre-Socratic Greek philosopher who formulated the atomic theory, which states that the universe is made of very small indivisible objects called atomos, that which is “uncuttable”. Then, the journey for the infinitely small begins! I loved this book and Lederman’s writing. He is fully aware that not everything will make sense to the non-specialized leader. Not everything has it. What’s important is to take a step back and wonder at the titanic effort and journey that the human species accomplished throughout millennia. The point of this book, for instance, isn’t to form specialist in quantum mechanics or for people to fully grasp its implications. Not even quantum mechanics specialists fully grasp its implications! The point of this book is for the non-specialist to be amazed of how the universe. The universe isn’t made up to our liking, but we are moving fast to understand it more and more. The culminating discovery for Lederman would have been the Higgs Boson, and he explains beautifully its importance for particle physics and for science in general. Furthermore, through the journey we take, we see how the history of science isn’t just a stream line of successes. It’s not just easy “Eureka!” moments. We observe, we hypothesize, we try, if it succeeds, then great! We learn more. If it fails, ok, why? Let’s see what we can do. To paraphrase him, ugly truths sometimes destroy beautiful theories. That teaches us humility, but, at the same time, it teaches us to be bold. Newtonian mechanics made a revolution. Everyone thought that they were absolute. Then came General Relativity and Quantum Theory and they made revolutions which took over Newton. (Yet remember, science is a building process. It was Newton’s equations that put people on the moon). There is just much to learn and who knows what tomorrow will reveal! This book is a great introduction to the infinitely small, and even though it might not always make sense at times, that’s the beauty of it. I finished reading it with a big smile on my face. "
18,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49575307-rodney-harvill,4,"Based on the title, I had assumed that the book was about the Higgs Boson. In reality, it is more a history of science from Democritus, the Greek philosopher who first proposed the atom, to the modern physics and cosmology that include the theoretical basis for and implications of the Higgs field and particle(s). Democritus and his theory of the atom is used as a unifying theme. Although Aristotelian scholars had abandoned the atomic theory, modern science ultimately gave Democritus the last laugh. The author, the late Dr. Leon Lederman, a winner of the Nobel Prize for physics and a former director of Fermilab, was eminently qualified to discuss the science. One thing I especially appreciate is that he was an experimental physicist. I have read and will continue to read books by theoretical physicists. With such books it can be difficult to tell what concepts have been experimentally verified and what concepts are mere speculation that have yet to survive the hurdle of the “ugly fact that has brought down many an elegant theory.” Dr. Lederman pulled no punches, letting the reader know what had been verified and often explaining how it had been verified. I especially loved his account of using an accelerator to test for weak force parity violation. He realized that the test set-up being used by one of his graduate students to study muons could be modified for a parity violation experiment. Once the changes had been made, he noticed that the target seemed a bit low. What did he use to raise it to an appropriate position? A Maxwell House coffee can, the ultimate low-tech solution for a high-tech problem.Personally, I consider it fortunate that Dr. Lederman did his work when he did. In today’s politically correct environment with a rapidly changing list of what is verboten, would his warped and edgy sense of humor that I so thoroughly enjoyed in this book have gotten him into sufficient trouble to prevent him from accomplishing the Nobel-worthy research for which he is known. Were there aspects of the book that I didn’t like? Yes, but they were more than offset by what I liked."
19,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935560-dan-l-danehy-oakes,4,"There is only one good reason for reading popular science books that are going-on thirty years of age: and that is for entertainment. _The God Particle_, subtitled ""If the Universe is the answer, what's the question?"", entertained me.More: it told me things I didn't know, mostly about the history of science. The book is framed as a search for the indivisible particle, and it begins with Democritus of Abdera, who first came up with the idea that the universe was made of a-toms. Lederman fantasizes a dialogue in which he gives Democritus a tour of Fermilab and we are to be amazed by how amazed he isn't. The book moves through the usual suspects - Galileo, Newton, Maxwell, Einstein - and a number of less-known folks who made their contribution to the search for the underlying structure of matter, with a wealth of amusing anecdotes (and the occasional wretched pun). In the last few chapters he brings the story up to the near-present of 1993, and describing the Standard Model as it was then, including the theoretical and experimental problems with it. The main problem was that, above certain relatively reasonable energies, the Standard Model predicted infinite quantities, which seems an absurdity on the face of it. Higgs proposed his field and its boson as a way of removing those infinities; explaining where mass comes from is a bonus.The Higgs boson would not be confirmed until 2014, twenty-one years after Lederman (and Teresi) gave it its fanciful and misleading nickname. And, as it goes with real science, it didn't so much answer the questions as provide new ones. But for someone just seeking to understand what the Higgs thing is all about, plus a general non-mathematical introduction to the Standard Model, you could do worse than _The God Particle_.(As a side note: Leon Lederman, Nobel laureate for his work with the neutrino, died late last year at the age of 96.)"
20,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2855874-greg,5,"Leon Lederman was one of the most qualified people on earth to write a book on particle physics, and he managed to do so without squeezing out all the fun juice in the process. The subject matter is deeply esoteric, yet Lederman manages to elevate it to a level that's understandable while not oversimplifying important facts and concepts. Most pop-science books are happy to leave particle physics at the tippy tops of the waves. This always leaves me with a ton of questions. Lederman successfully answered so many of my thoughts such as:How do you generate protons?How do you control and collimate a particle beam?Why do colliders have to be so large?How do we detect the particles coming out of a collision?What exactly is sitzfleisch?The big part of the equation that he glosses over is the theoretical side. But that's understandable since he's an experimental physicist - his job is to poke fun at those theoretical guys that get to go home at 5.A lot of the imaginary ""discussion with a Greek philosopher"" I found to be an odd and worthless addition to the content.Though this book is old (the existence of the theoretical particle of the title was confirmed in 2012), the physics are still highly relevant. This story is told with the clarity and zest of one of the most knowledgeable and passionate physicists in the world who grew up alongside the technology. If other science books have gotten you even mildly interested in sub-atomic physics, this is a must-read."
21,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56943009-joshua-r-taylor,4,"An awesome introduction for anybody into particle Physics---especially if you have a phobia of Maths like I do 😅Lederman uses his experience of experimenting in and running particle labs in combination with a down-to-earth attitude to explain why Quantum physics is so weird and the history of how it became so. Things are explained with tons of examples and metaphors to help you grasp ideas without having to toil over terrifying maths. Lederman does continuously say that the metaphors and explanations don't do the mathematical theory justice, but at least gives the reader enough knowledge to continue their learning to the next stage.Mixed throughout the book are also the descriptions of lots of personalities in Physics which I find quite interesting, showing the human side of Physics (personal gripes, competition, late night trips to McDonald's between experiments, etc.). It makes the book more digestible amongst the complex concepts you learn.Lastly, in some of the more creative parts of the book, Lederman makes fictional scenarios (for example when he finds a time traveling Greek philosopher) to help illustrate certain points about why science can be trusted and also its limits."
22,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49927591-williamswift,5,"I gave this book 5 stars because it is such a great teacher of science and written so well, with great humour to boot. I almost took away a star because of the author's dismissive attitude towards philosophy, which is, after all, the science of ideas. But this attitude is so common that I let it go unpunished. I understand that philosophers shouldn't try to argue with scientific data, but they can legitimately have something to say about the interpretation of data. The author seems to think that empirical science is the only science, that philosophy can be dismissed as unworthy of consideration, and that everything existent is governed by the laws of physics, described by mathematics. But it is unscientific to assume that if something is completely immaterial (i.e. truly invisible) it doesn't exist. Take, for instance, an idea. That's why the science of philosophy is necessary, because empirical science cannot study ideas. For instance, logic, necessary for all intelligent activity in time, including that of all scientists, belongs under the heading of philosophy. So why not give philosophy a little respect?"

I found particle physics fascinating—the universe as creative force—but as the book went on I found my lack of foundational science to be a real hindrance in understanding. If anything, this book made me regret my assumption in high school, and later in university, that science was for other people and that, as an artist, I should focus solely on the arts. I regret that I will never quite understand something that is so beautiful, so mysterious in many ways. The older I get, the more I realize that art and science are not divided, but are merely aspects of the same thing. One of these days I will slog through the end, with my brain smoking and understanding sorely tried (and fried) but it will be worth it. The subject is fascinating. I am only giving the book 4 stars because there came a point where I just couldn’t seem to understand it anymore. Prior to that, it was sheer bliss reading about the underpinnings of the universe. "
24,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54903552-colin-russell,3,"After the first two chapters, I really wanted to give this book 5 stars. I loved the humor of the author and the ease with which he explained the concepts. The last few chapters, however, became so dense and nearly unintelligible to the average adult. It didn't feel like Lederman was writing for the armchair physicist; it seemed as though it was written for the Masters student who already has significant education in physics and quantum mechanics. I really had to slog through the last 150 pages and can't really say I retained anything. This book needs to be updated to include more graphics, easier language, and better diagrams. "

This is my first reading about the standard model, quarks, neutrinos, bosons and stuff. This reading motivated me to keep learning, to study harder quantum mechanics. I found annoying the humor in this book, how the author made fun of theoreticals and glorified experimentals. Also the implications of God seemed weird to me, as an agnostic.

Lederman is an experimental physicist so all the book has references to the most important experiments that led to the standard model.

47,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3837733-joan,4,"Lederman is a Physics Nobel prize winner so he is certainly authoritative! Of course, this book came out in 1993, so a fair amount of information is out of date. For example, the Supercollider in Texas was still going to be built when this book went to press but the writing was on the wall as Lederman acknowledged and I doubt he was surprised when the project was cancelled but surely was terribly disappointed. I think he is currently at MIT but won't swear to it. In any case, this book was extremely well written. He leavened it with lots of humor and as little math as he could manage. His excitement at the work being done was obvious and exuberant which made this a pleasure to read even if it took me considerably longer than I thought it would! He started by having a chapter long conversation with Democritus which was a great way to introduce the subject and start on the history leading to modern physics and the Higgs boson. It was actually discovered shortly after the book was published but was still theoretical when it went to press. He had a blast with Democritus and it was a great ice breaker for the subject. If you're wondering WHY some Greek guy, Democritus was the guy who came up with the idea of atoms, indivisible bits of matter. Which of course, as Lederman pointed out, isn't true of OUR atom. As usual, I certainly can't claim I really understood everything but I understand a fair amount better than I did! I can't help but let people know that HE wanted to call the book The Goddamn Particle but the publisher wouldn't let him! He said that was more appropriate since it has been so hard to actually find the Higgs Boson! Of course, the publisher knew a good title when he saw one and went boldly ahead with a different title from what Lederman had suggested! I'm now of course going to have to find more recent books on the subject to try and understand some of this even more! Suggestions for basic more up to date Physics tittles anyone? "
48,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21134714-aiman-faruqi,5,"This is a book I did not go into with any anticipation whatsoever. In fact, I had never heard of Leon Lederman prior to seeing this book, despite the fact he is a Nobel laureate in physics. Despite my ingoing ambivalence, I am glad to say that this book is simply amazing. On the back of my version, a reviewer remarks, ""What Hawking did for cosmology, Lederman does for particle physics."" This sentence in and of itself is a perfect summary of Lederman's book. The book, having been published in the early '90s, is a tad outdated when it comes to particle accelerator capabilities and forthcomings, but it does not suffer from this same problem when it comes to discussing the actual science (the big exception being the discovery of the Higgs). In this work, Lederman takes the reader through a fascinating history for the quest of the ultimate constituent of the universe we reside in—Democritus' a-tom. He outlines early Aristotelian thinking and explains the significance of revolutionaries such as Galileo, Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, and Hertz. He not only describes the role of particle accelerators to continue the quest started by Democritus, but also explains their inner-workings to demystify ""big science"" from something esoteric to something understandable. In the process, he reveals the importance of continuing investment by governments in these massive machines to advance the frontier of human knowledge. All in all, this book is expertly crafted. It's remarkably funny and insightful, while simultaneously accessible and profound. It does not treat the reader as a child but nor does it expect knowledge of advanced calculus. If you are interested in science in general, this is a must read. "
49,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/253428-roger,5,"Far more informational than I had hoped, perhaps even better than all the questions it answered for me was all the new questions it made me think up that weren't answered between its covers; without loading his book down so as to be unwieldy or frightening for the mathophobes, Lederman's managed to get at least this reader enticed to learn more. If only it had a list of other books that are great reads for the couch physicists out there.Anyway, it's a must-read to round out all that your high school and college physics classes left out. Why my classes never even got to relativity, not to mention basic particle physics, is beyond me. :)Also let me note that I'm not really a fan of the title. The book is hardly ""about"" the Higgs field, doesn't pretend that finding the Higgs boson will conclude our quest for knowledge, and only really gets to this and the big Questions about the universe at the very end. It's really just a history of and introduction to particle physics.One happy thing about the book: Lederman repeatedly mentions the hunt for the top quark, and looks like his lab Fermilab found it just a few years after he published this.One sad thing about the book: he pins a lot of hope on the Superconducting Supercollider project in Texas, which theoretically could have been powerful enough to discover the Higgs boson (and plenty other besides) - but the project was killed in the Clinton era and now all that's there is some empty tunnels. More than a decade later, the Large Hadron Collider is still offline, and its operational energies are a fraction of what the SSC could have achieved. I guess this vindicates somewhat his position on science evangelism."
50,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/134097-eric,5,"This book is written in an extremely coherent, informative manner with a touch of intellectual humor and imagination. Not having much of a history with the study of physics, the first time reading through this book, many concepts seem somewhat beyond my grasp of initial comprehension. Although, it touches on nearly every theorist's and experimenter's ideas and results concerning the physical world and it's constituents. I'm still in the process of getting into this book, but for the first few chapters, the author emphasizes on explaining the atomic and sub-atomic particles' actions, composition, charge, mass and influence on one another. Also, he included many of the important and relevant discoveries of mathematical studies (mainly physics and chemistry) and the discoverer of them in, for the most part, a chronological order. So far, it has been a very enjoyable and knowledgeable read. L. Lederman is an intelligent and experienced physicist and very proficient at collaborating data into a easily understood format, also by using a very well educated vocabulary. It definitely shows through his writing. I commend the man for his obsession or love for the profession that he chooses to pursue day in and day out. Personally, I feel as though I have a combination of theorist's and experimenter's blood in me, that way instead of going back and forth between the two seperate individuals, I only change modes when necessary and continue my own pursuit from there!"
51,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18844786-joe-ciola,4,"I love long books that peek my interest, challenge conventional ways of thinking, and sufficiently address / answer the author's main topic; the latter part is where I feel the book comes up short. Despite needing updating since it was originally written, it starts with a well articulated and interesting history of physics (I especially like his sense of humor) however following that, if your intent is to learn quantum physics, be prepared to read disproportionately about supercolliders and the author's experiments, and throughout take notes to try to comprehend the science (also might help if you took an intro to physics course). Among many other terms, he explains and speaks fluently of anti-protons, baryons, bosons, dimensions, electrons, fermions, gluons, hadrons, ions, kaons, leptons, mesons, muons, neutrons, nucleons, photons, pions, protons, selectrons, sleptons, tevetrons, upsilons. Don't get me wrong, I think (as apparently does the author) that he is brilliant, which is why, despite my degree in mathematics, the book makes me feel like a peon (so I do not feel bad about obtaining the book at a significant discount). If I have walked away with any lasting impressions, they are 1. physicists apparently like words that end in ""on"" and 2. I'm now convinced that they will not solve the Higgs Boson God Particle mystery until they have exhausted all the combinations and permutations of such words. ... Anon"
52,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2526106-jason,4,"This was arguably the best popular science book I've read. The titular God Particle, or theoretical Higgs boson, is a recurring character in the book, but the scope is far broader than one yet-to-be-discovered particle. Nobel laureate Lederman tells the story of particle physics from Thales and Democritus up to the as-then-not-yet-aborted Superconducting Supercollider in Waxahachie, TX. He re-envisions the history of physics and chemistry as the quest for the fundamental piece of nature, a quest that has currently described fundamental particles like the fermions (quarks---the building blocks of protons and neutrons and other subatomic particles---and mesons---including electrons, muons, and neutrinos) and bosons (force particles like gluons, photons, and the Ws and Z). Along the way, Lederman shares his fondness for experimental physics and experimentalists, his thoughts on the urgent need for more science education and literacy, his modest philosophical musings on what this stuff all means, and a sense of humor that affirms my sense that he is a born science educator.I'm glad I decided to re-read this (and finish it this time) after so many years. "
53,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/598644-richie-c,5,"First half of the book: 6/5 stars.Second half of the book: 4/5 stars.The first half of the book is a brief (well, brief considering that it covers a couple thousand years) history of particle physics up until the mid-20th century. It's exciting to discover how the knowledge of the ""a-tom"" progressed over time. Lederman's hypothetical conversation with Democritus is especially well-constructed to allow the reader to understand some deep concepts without too much work.Then the second half of the book it turns into something else. Suddenly Lederman feels like he has to go into much more detail about everything and turns some pages into a chore to read. Perhaps he felt this was necessary to accomplish the goal of gaining support for the Superconducting Super Collider that was under construction in Texas, or perhaps once he started explaining the physics that was new during his lifetime, he was unable to take the long view as he did in the first half of the book. It's still fascinating and fun to find out about quarks and mesons and bosons, but it would have been better explained by using the approach in the first half of the book.Overall, an excellent book, especially for someone like me who is somewhat science-oriented but only took a couple Physics classes in college."
54,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64369720-hal-gabow,5,"This is a wonderful introduction to the physics of subatomic particles, not to mention background material that starts at the very beginning (ancient Greeks and Galileo). It is well-written -- Lederman has a wonderful sense of humor -- and as close to a page-turner as you can get, even when progress slows to allow excursions to the Wikipedia or a handy physics text. (Supplementaryreading helps clarify the physics, and also gives more up-to-date information than the book, which was written in 1993. But the book is still topical.) The book also offers insights into the lives and personalities of physicists, as well as entertaining quips about the two cultures of theorists versus experimentalists. I even enjoyed the details of particle accelerators and detectors, which I wasn't interested in beforehand.My only complaint is the Kindle edition is poorly scanned. There are many misspellings --even words that are incomprehensible -- as well as technical terms (e.g. particle names) that are clearly wrong and have to be guessed at."
55,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60974478-andrea-balsara,4,"The first part of the book really helped me to understand some things that had been outside of my education experience. I found particle physics fascinating—the universe as creative force—but as the book went on I found my lack of foundational science to be a real hindrance in understanding. If anything, this book made me regret my assumption in high school, and later in university, that science was for other people and that, as an artist, I should focus solely on the arts. I regret that I will never quite understand something that is so beautiful, so mysterious in many ways. The older I get, the more I realize that art and science are not divided, but are merely aspects of the same thing. One of these days I will slog through the end, with my brain smoking and understanding sorely tried (and fried) but it will be worth it. The subject is fascinating. I am only giving the book 4 stars because there came a point where I just couldn’t seem to understand it anymore. Prior to that, it was sheer bliss reading about the underpinnings of the universe."
56,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33004524-ashar-malik,5,"This book is amazing. To start with the author takes us on a journey through the life of particle physics from almost 500 BC to 1992 AD. Chronicling the greatest moments that led the field to where it is (or was in 1993) made for an amazing time spent reading. I didn't see the publishing date on the book (1993) -- which makes the science a bit outdated now. However in the last chapter the author attempts to envision the future of the field in 2020. While this was a stand-alone instant, other places in the book do predict discoveries in the near future. What, to me, was the most exciting bit was that this is the first book that I have read where based on knowledge of the time predictions were made about discovery of the particles which have now come to pass. So from that point it was a great read. Lastly - the last paragraph is written as a Hollywood movie scene was amazing and is definitely worth a read. "

Cool! Not assuming too much prior exposure to the sciences – thank the singularity, Lederman's book is a gift to the genre of 'pop science': He respects the whoa factor of science and also the pesky scientific methodology part.

There's also some cutesy, fun diagrams that paint a really neat picture of the standard model and some geometric classification of every single subatomic particle. But don't be frightened, it's not like a text book at all! At the end of the book, Lederman goes on to tear Gary Zukov (author of The Dancing Wu Li Masters) a new black hole, if you are drifting my meaning. Lederman really didn't like Zukov's book."

82,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2526106-jason,4,"This was arguably the best popular science book I've read. The titular God Particle, or theoretical Higgs boson, is a recurring character in the book, but the scope is far broader than one yet-to-be-discovered particle. Nobel laureate Lederman tells the story of particle physics from Thales and Democritus up to the as-then-not-yet-aborted Superconducting Supercollider in Waxahachie, TX. He re-envisions the history of physics and chemistry as the quest for the fundamental piece of nature, a quest that has currently described fundamental particles like the fermions (quarks---the building blocks of protons and neutrons and other subatomic particles---and mesons---including electrons, muons, and neutrinos) and bosons (force particles like gluons, photons, and the Ws and Z). Along the way, Lederman shares his fondness for experimental physics and experimentalists, his thoughts on the urgent need for more science education and literacy, his modest philosophical musings on what this stuff all means, and a sense of humor that affirms my sense that he is a born science educator.I'm glad I decided to re-read this (and finish it this time) after so many years. "
83,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/598644-richie-c,5,"First half of the book: 6/5 stars.Second half of the book: 4/5 stars.The first half of the book is a brief (well, brief considering that it covers a couple thousand years) history of particle physics up until the mid-20th century. It's exciting to discover how the knowledge of the ""a-tom"" progressed over time. Lederman's hypothetical conversation with Democritus is especially well-constructed to allow the reader to understand some deep concepts without too much work.Then the second half of the book it turns into something else. Suddenly Lederman feels like he has to go into much more detail about everything and turns some pages into a chore to read. Perhaps he felt this was necessary to accomplish the goal of gaining support for the Superconducting Super Collider that was under construction in Texas, or perhaps once he started explaining the physics that was new during his lifetime, he was unable to take the long view as he did in the first half of the book. It's still fascinating and fun to find out about quarks and mesons and bosons, but it would have been better explained by using the approach in the first half of the book.Overall, an excellent book, especially for someone like me who is somewhat science-oriented but only took a couple Physics classes in college."
84,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64369720-hal-gabow,5,"This is a wonderful introduction to the physics of subatomic particles, not to mention background material that starts at the very beginning (ancient Greeks and Galileo). It is well-written -- Lederman has a wonderful sense of humor -- and as close to a page-turner as you can get, even when progress slows to allow excursions to the Wikipedia or a handy physics text. (Supplementaryreading helps clarify the physics, and also gives more up-to-date information than the book, which was written in 1993. But the book is still topical.) The book also offers insights into the lives and personalities of physicists, as well as entertaining quips about the two cultures of theorists versus experimentalists. I even enjoyed the details of particle accelerators and detectors, which I wasn't interested in beforehand.My only complaint is the Kindle edition is poorly scanned. There are many misspellings --even words that are incomprehensible -- as well as technical terms (e.g. particle names) that are clearly wrong and have to be guessed at."
85,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60974478-andrea-balsara,4,"The first part of the book really helped me to understand some things that had been outside of my education experience. I found particle physics fascinating—the universe as creative force—but as the book went on I found my lack of foundational science to be a real hindrance in understanding. If anything, this book made me regret my assumption in high school, and later in university, that science was for other people and that, as an artist, I should focus solely on the arts. I regret that I will never quite understand something that is so beautiful, so mysterious in many ways. The older I get, the more I realize that art and science are not divided, but are merely aspects of the same thing. One of these days I will slog through the end, with my brain smoking and understanding sorely tried (and fried) but it will be worth it. The subject is fascinating. I am only giving the book 4 stars because there came a point where I just couldn’t seem to understand it anymore. Prior to that, it was sheer bliss reading about the underpinnings of the universe."
86,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33004524-ashar-malik,5,"This book is amazing. To start with the author takes us on a journey through the life of particle physics from almost 500 BC to 1992 AD. Chronicling the greatest moments that led the field to where it is (or was in 1993) made for an amazing time spent reading. I didn't see the publishing date on the book (1993) -- which makes the science a bit outdated now. However in the last chapter the author attempts to envision the future of the field in 2020. While this was a stand-alone instant, other places in the book do predict discoveries in the near future. What, to me, was the most exciting bit was that this is the first book that I have read where based on knowledge of the time predictions were made about discovery of the particles which have now come to pass. So from that point it was a great read. Lastly - the last paragraph is written as a Hollywood movie scene was amazing and is definitely worth a read. "

Cool! Not assuming too much prior exposure to the sciences – thank the singularity, Lederman's book is a gift to the genre of 'pop science': He respects the whoa factor of science and also the pesky scientific methodology part.

There's also some cutesy, fun diagrams that paint a really neat picture of the standard model and some geometric classification of every single subatomic particle. But don't be frightened, it's not like a text book at all! At the end of the book, Lederman goes on to tear Gary Zukov (author of The Dancing Wu Li Masters) a new black hole, if you are drifting my meaning. Lederman really didn't like Zukov's book."

104,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17864015-paul-little,4,"It was the basic premise of this ebook that interested me. Essentially it takes its leaping off point from the unmistakable truth that with great scientific advances come great unknowns and unexpected or perhaps ill-considered consequences. Even the most noble of intentions can potentially, when used to probe beyond the safe zone of our current understanding, create tools of almost unimaginable devastation. So, in a sense, it is not such a leap of faith to think that there might be self-appointed guardians of sanity working in the shadows to try and temper the more inappropriate flights of fantasy that the ‘boffins’ embark upon. From this launchpad, we have an intriguing conspiracy thriller with good guys and bad guys and the poor unfortunate hero thrown ignorantly into the middle.As a thriller this ebook works well, generates tension and generally moves along at a good pace with just the right amount of action and tension. Our hero Tom seems to be a mixture of many things and is delightfully more energetic and interesting than I would anticipate his real life counterpart to be. That probably says a lot more about my personal opinion of top academics, in that I can see them being extremely intelligent and dedicated but running around in a breathless race against time, not so much. I am thinking more Ricky Gervais than Tom Cruise I suppose. As a scientific conspiracy it also works pretty well. There are some good historical perspectives and scene setting that lift the book and give a nice feel to the experience. As with any book of this nature there are aspects that go into the areas of fantastic speculation that will irritate some people and yet for others will be an integral part of the tension building. There was one surfing vignette that, whilst nicely written, seemed to stick out from the rest of the story and slowed the plot for a few pages, it caught me so off guard that I thought I had accidently switched files on my Kindle. As a part of a larger debate, about the possible implications of dabbling with the basic building blocks of nature and the potential devastating implications if an admittedly extremely low probability event would occur, this work can bring something. Like the plethora of natural disaster and man-made disaster action movies, The God Particle is great entertainment with a serious theme if you want it. In the end though we should not forget the irony that CERN was also somehow the birthplace of the internet which allows us to spread this message."
105,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1935025-manuk,5,"Mr. Lederman and Mr. Teresi set this book as a journey through a history of human thought over the space and time, which is manifested in a beautiful ideas that lure you closer to get you experience curvatures of pure logic that are kin to those of roller-coasters. But, do not fear! On this journey you won't be left alone, Mr. Lederman and his incredible imagination on par with an astounding sense of humor (I mean, you don't really expect to have a good laugh while reading a book on quantum physics, but man, will you smile like an idiot) will guide you through the most strangest of concepts and indeed, make you believe that standard model is free of randomness (to some extent). In case if that kind of support isn't enough, there are other characters that join the search with you and Lederman, and even some that wait for you in the end of it. They will help you through sharp-bends and hold you if you try to quit before another crazy drop (I mean it, you won't be let go). At some points you will need to look at something, like your own hand, just to be sure that world around you is not dots and forces as it appears in your head. Authors make you believe that you are actually a part of this book, they make you struggle with some of the most brilliant minds in the human history, as well as share excitement from their triumphs, both, in the field of quantum theory and in the field of personal cunning. If I ever will have a chance of meeting Mr. Lederman, I'm not sure if I won't be just like ""Hey, Leon! Remember that one time we got on a trip together?"", and I definately will wear a t-shirt with 'oops-leon'.Another major contribution to God's particle success and my personal delight comes from authors abilities to explain everything in a simple eloquent way using all the deepness of English language, even if the science part would have been gibberish in academic sense, I still would have read it just for the personal pleasure that comes from articulate, crisp and informal style of writing used by authors.Thank you for the journey, please let me go now."

134,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17864015-paul-little,4,"It was the basic premise of this ebook that interested me. Essentially it takes its leaping off point from the unmistakable truth that with great scientific advances come great unknowns and unexpected or perhaps ill-considered consequences. Even the most noble of intentions can potentially, when used to probe beyond the safe zone of our current understanding, create tools of almost unimaginable devastation. So, in a sense, it is not such a leap of faith to think that there might be self-appointed guardians of sanity working in the shadows to try and temper the more inappropriate flights of fantasy that the ‘boffins’ embark upon. From this launchpad, we have an intriguing conspiracy thriller with good guys and bad guys and the poor unfortunate hero thrown ignorantly into the middle.As a thriller this ebook works well, generates tension and generally moves along at a good pace with just the right amount of action and tension. Our hero Tom seems to be a mixture of many things and is delightfully more energetic and interesting than I would anticipate his real life counterpart to be. That probably says a lot more about my personal opinion of top academics, in that I can see them being extremely intelligent and dedicated but running around in a breathless race against time, not so much. I am thinking more Ricky Gervais than Tom Cruise I suppose. As a scientific conspiracy it also works pretty well. There are some good historical perspectives and scene setting that lift the book and give a nice feel to the experience. As with any book of this nature there are aspects that go into the areas of fantastic speculation that will irritate some people and yet for others will be an integral part of the tension building. There was one surfing vignette that, whilst nicely written, seemed to stick out from the rest of the story and slowed the plot for a few pages, it caught me so off guard that I thought I had accidently switched files on my Kindle. As a part of a larger debate, about the possible implications of dabbling with the basic building blocks of nature and the potential devastating implications if an admittedly extremely low probability event would occur, this work can bring something. Like the plethora of natural disaster and man-made disaster action movies, The God Particle is great entertainment with a serious theme if you want it. In the end though we should not forget the irony that CERN was also somehow the birthplace of the internet which allows us to spread this message."
135,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1935025-manuk,5,"Mr. Lederman and Mr. Teresi set this book as a journey through a history of human thought over the space and time, which is manifested in a beautiful ideas that lure you closer to get you experience curvatures of pure logic that are kin to those of roller-coasters. But, do not fear! On this journey you won't be left alone, Mr. Lederman and his incredible imagination on par with an astounding sense of humor (I mean, you don't really expect to have a good laugh while reading a book on quantum physics, but man, will you smile like an idiot) will guide you through the most strangest of concepts and indeed, make you believe that standard model is free of randomness (to some extent). In case if that kind of support isn't enough, there are other characters that join the search with you and Lederman, and even some that wait for you in the end of it. They will help you through sharp-bends and hold you if you try to quit before another crazy drop (I mean it, you won't be let go). At some points you will need to look at something, like your own hand, just to be sure that world around you is not dots and forces as it appears in your head. Authors make you believe that you are actually a part of this book, they make you struggle with some of the most brilliant minds in the human history, as well as share excitement from their triumphs, both, in the field of quantum theory and in the field of personal cunning. If I ever will have a chance of meeting Mr. Lederman, I'm not sure if I won't be just like ""Hey, Leon! Remember that one time we got on a trip together?"", and I definately will wear a t-shirt with 'oops-leon'.Another major contribution to God's particle success and my personal delight comes from authors abilities to explain everything in a simple eloquent way using all the deepness of English language, even if the science part would have been gibberish in academic sense, I still would have read it just for the personal pleasure that comes from articulate, crisp and informal style of writing used by authors.Thank you for the journey, please let me go now."

137,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3837733-joan,4,"Lederman is a Physics Nobel prize winner so he is certainly authoritative! Of course, this book came out in 1993, so a fair amount of information is out of date. For example, the Supercollider in Texas was still going to be built when this book went to press but the writing was on the wall as Lederman acknowledged and I doubt he was surprised when the project was cancelled but surely was terribly disappointed. I think he is currently at MIT but won't swear to it. In any case, this book was extremely well written. He leavened it with lots of humor and as little math as he could manage. His excitement at the work being done was obvious and exuberant which made this a pleasure to read even if it took me considerably longer than I thought it would! He started by having a chapter long conversation with Democritus which was a great way to introduce the subject and start on the history leading to modern physics and the Higgs boson. It was actually discovered shortly after the book was published but was still theoretical when it went to press. He had a blast with Democritus and it was a great ice breaker for the subject. If you're wondering WHY some Greek guy, Democritus was the guy who came up with the idea of atoms, indivisible bits of matter. Which of course, as Lederman pointed out, isn't true of OUR atom. As usual, I certainly can't claim I really understood everything but I understand a fair amount better than I did! I can't help but let people know that HE wanted to call the book The Goddamn Particle but the publisher wouldn't let him! He said that was more appropriate since it has been so hard to actually find the Higgs Boson! Of course, the publisher knew a good title when he saw one and went boldly ahead with a different title from what Lederman had suggested! I'm now of course going to have to find more recent books on the subject to try and understand some of this even more! Suggestions for basic more up to date Physics tittles anyone? "
138,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21134714-aiman-faruqi,5,"This is a book I did not go into with any anticipation whatsoever. In fact, I had never heard of Leon Lederman prior to seeing this book, despite the fact he is a Nobel laureate in physics. Despite my ingoing ambivalence, I am glad to say that this book is simply amazing. On the back of my version, a reviewer remarks, ""What Hawking did for cosmology, Lederman does for particle physics."" This sentence in and of itself is a perfect summary of Lederman's book. The book, having been published in the early '90s, is a tad outdated when it comes to particle accelerator capabilities and forthcomings, but it does not suffer from this same problem when it comes to discussing the actual science (the big exception being the discovery of the Higgs). In this work, Lederman takes the reader through a fascinating history for the quest of the ultimate constituent of the universe we reside in—Democritus' a-tom. He outlines early Aristotelian thinking and explains the significance of revolutionaries such as Galileo, Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, and Hertz. He not only describes the role of particle accelerators to continue the quest started by Democritus, but also explains their inner-workings to demystify ""big science"" from something esoteric to something understandable. In the process, he reveals the importance of continuing investment by governments in these massive machines to advance the frontier of human knowledge. All in all, this book is expertly crafted. It's remarkably funny and insightful, while simultaneously accessible and profound. It does not treat the reader as a child but nor does it expect knowledge of advanced calculus. If you are interested in science in general, this is a must read. "
139,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/253428-roger,5,"Far more informational than I had hoped, perhaps even better than all the questions it answered for me was all the new questions it made me think up that weren't answered between its covers; without loading his book down so as to be unwieldy or frightening for the mathophobes, Lederman's managed to get at least this reader enticed to learn more. If only it had a list of other books that are great reads for the couch physicists out there.Anyway, it's a must-read to round out all that your high school and college physics classes left out. Why my classes never even got to relativity, not to mention basic particle physics, is beyond me. :)Also let me note that I'm not really a fan of the title. The book is hardly ""about"" the Higgs field, doesn't pretend that finding the Higgs boson will conclude our quest for knowledge, and only really gets to this and the big Questions about the universe at the very end. It's really just a history of and introduction to particle physics.One happy thing about the book: Lederman repeatedly mentions the hunt for the top quark, and looks like his lab Fermilab found it just a few years after he published this.One sad thing about the book: he pins a lot of hope on the Superconducting Supercollider project in Texas, which theoretically could have been powerful enough to discover the Higgs boson (and plenty other besides) - but the project was killed in the Clinton era and now all that's there is some empty tunnels. More than a decade later, the Large Hadron Collider is still offline, and its operational energies are a fraction of what the SSC could have achieved. I guess this vindicates somewhat his position on science evangelism."
140,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/134097-eric,5,"This book is written in an extremely coherent, informative manner with a touch of intellectual humor and imagination. Not having much of a history with the study of physics, the first time reading through this book, many concepts seem somewhat beyond my grasp of initial comprehension. Although, it touches on nearly every theorist's and experimenter's ideas and results concerning the physical world and it's constituents. I'm still in the process of getting into this book, but for the first few chapters, the author emphasizes on explaining the atomic and sub-atomic particles' actions, composition, charge, mass and influence on one another. Also, he included many of the important and relevant discoveries of mathematical studies (mainly physics and chemistry) and the discoverer of them in, for the most part, a chronological order. So far, it has been a very enjoyable and knowledgeable read. L. Lederman is an intelligent and experienced physicist and very proficient at collaborating data into a easily understood format, also by using a very well educated vocabulary. It definitely shows through his writing. I commend the man for his obsession or love for the profession that he chooses to pursue day in and day out. Personally, I feel as though I have a combination of theorist's and experimenter's blood in me, that way instead of going back and forth between the two seperate individuals, I only change modes when necessary and continue my own pursuit from there!"

Among many other terms, he explains and speaks fluently of anti-protons, baryons, bosons, dimensions, electrons, fermions, gluons, hadrons, ions, kaons, leptons, mesons, muons, neutrons, nucleons, photons, pions, protons, selectrons, sleptons, tevetrons, upsilons.

On this journey you won't be left alone, Mr. Lederman and his incredible imagination on par with an astounding sense of humor (I mean, you don't really expect to have a good laugh while reading a book on quantum physics, but man, will you smile like an idiot) will guide you through the most strangest of concepts and indeed, make you believe that standard model is free of randomness (to some extent).

167,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3837733-joan,4,"Lederman is a Physics Nobel prize winner so he is certainly authoritative! Of course, this book came out in 1993, so a fair amount of information is out of date. For example, the Supercollider in Texas was still going to be built when this book went to press but the writing was on the wall as Lederman acknowledged and I doubt he was surprised when the project was cancelled but surely was terribly disappointed. I think he is currently at MIT but won't swear to it. In any case, this book was extremely well written. He leavened it with lots of humor and as little math as he could manage. His excitement at the work being done was obvious and exuberant which made this a pleasure to read even if it took me considerably longer than I thought it would! He started by having a chapter long conversation with Democritus which was a great way to introduce the subject and start on the history leading to modern physics and the Higgs boson. It was actually discovered shortly after the book was published but was still theoretical when it went to press. He had a blast with Democritus and it was a great ice breaker for the subject. If you're wondering WHY some Greek guy, Democritus was the guy who came up with the idea of atoms, indivisible bits of matter. Which of course, as Lederman pointed out, isn't true of OUR atom. As usual, I certainly can't claim I really understood everything but I understand a fair amount better than I did! I can't help but let people know that HE wanted to call the book The Goddamn Particle but the publisher wouldn't let him! He said that was more appropriate since it has been so hard to actually find the Higgs Boson! Of course, the publisher knew a good title when he saw one and went boldly ahead with a different title from what Lederman had suggested! I'm now of course going to have to find more recent books on the subject to try and understand some of this even more! Suggestions for basic more up to date Physics tittles anyone? "
168,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21134714-aiman-faruqi,5,"This is a book I did not go into with any anticipation whatsoever. In fact, I had never heard of Leon Lederman prior to seeing this book, despite the fact he is a Nobel laureate in physics. Despite my ingoing ambivalence, I am glad to say that this book is simply amazing. On the back of my version, a reviewer remarks, ""What Hawking did for cosmology, Lederman does for particle physics."" This sentence in and of itself is a perfect summary of Lederman's book. The book, having been published in the early '90s, is a tad outdated when it comes to particle accelerator capabilities and forthcomings, but it does not suffer from this same problem when it comes to discussing the actual science (the big exception being the discovery of the Higgs). In this work, Lederman takes the reader through a fascinating history for the quest of the ultimate constituent of the universe we reside in—Democritus' a-tom. He outlines early Aristotelian thinking and explains the significance of revolutionaries such as Galileo, Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, and Hertz. He not only describes the role of particle accelerators to continue the quest started by Democritus, but also explains their inner-workings to demystify ""big science"" from something esoteric to something understandable. In the process, he reveals the importance of continuing investment by governments in these massive machines to advance the frontier of human knowledge. All in all, this book is expertly crafted. It's remarkably funny and insightful, while simultaneously accessible and profound. It does not treat the reader as a child but nor does it expect knowledge of advanced calculus. If you are interested in science in general, this is a must read. "
169,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/253428-roger,5,"Far more informational than I had hoped, perhaps even better than all the questions it answered for me was all the new questions it made me think up that weren't answered between its covers; without loading his book down so as to be unwieldy or frightening for the mathophobes, Lederman's managed to get at least this reader enticed to learn more. If only it had a list of other books that are great reads for the couch physicists out there.Anyway, it's a must-read to round out all that your high school and college physics classes left out. Why my classes never even got to relativity, not to mention basic particle physics, is beyond me. :)Also let me note that I'm not really a fan of the title. The book is hardly ""about"" the Higgs field, doesn't pretend that finding the Higgs boson will conclude our quest for knowledge, and only really gets to this and the big Questions about the universe at the very end. It's really just a history of and introduction to particle physics.One happy thing about the book: Lederman repeatedly mentions the hunt for the top quark, and looks like his lab Fermilab found it just a few years after he published this.One sad thing about the book: he pins a lot of hope on the Superconducting Supercollider project in Texas, which theoretically could have been powerful enough to discover the Higgs boson (and plenty other besides) - but the project was killed in the Clinton era and now all that's there is some empty tunnels. More than a decade later, the Large Hadron Collider is still offline, and its operational energies are a fraction of what the SSC could have achieved. I guess this vindicates somewhat his position on science evangelism."
170,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/134097-eric,5,"This book is written in an extremely coherent, informative manner with a touch of intellectual humor and imagination. Not having much of a history with the study of physics, the first time reading through this book, many concepts seem somewhat beyond my grasp of initial comprehension. Although, it touches on nearly every theorist's and experimenter's ideas and results concerning the physical world and it's constituents. I'm still in the process of getting into this book, but for the first few chapters, the author emphasizes on explaining the atomic and sub-atomic particles' actions, composition, charge, mass and influence on one another. Also, he included many of the important and relevant discoveries of mathematical studies (mainly physics and chemistry) and the discoverer of them in, for the most part, a chronological order. So far, it has been a very enjoyable and knowledgeable read. L. Lederman is an intelligent and experienced physicist and very proficient at collaborating data into a easily understood format, also by using a very well educated vocabulary. It definitely shows through his writing. I commend the man for his obsession or love for the profession that he chooses to pursue day in and day out. Personally, I feel as though I have a combination of theorist's and experimenter's blood in me, that way instead of going back and forth between the two seperate individuals, I only change modes when necessary and continue my own pursuit from there!"
171,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18844786-joe-ciola,4,"I love long books that peek my interest, challenge conventional ways of thinking, and sufficiently address / answer the author's main topic; the latter part is where I feel the book comes up short. Despite needing updating since it was originally written, it starts with a well articulated and interesting history of physics (I especially like his sense of humor) however following that, if your intent is to learn quantum physics, be prepared to read disproportionately about supercolliders and the author's experiments, and throughout take notes to try to comprehend the science (also might help if you took an intro to physics course). Among many other terms, he explains and speaks fluently of anti-protons, baryons, bosons, dimensions, electrons, fermions, gluons, hadrons, ions, kaons, leptons, mesons, muons, neutrons, nucleons, photons, pions, protons, selectrons, sleptons, tevetrons, upsilons. Don't get me wrong, I think (as apparently does the author) that he is brilliant, which is why, despite my degree in mathematics, the book makes me feel like a peon (so I do not feel bad about obtaining the book at a significant discount). If I have walked away with any lasting impressions, they are 1. physicists apparently like words that end in ""on"" and 2. I'm now convinced that they will not solve the Higgs Boson God Particle mystery until they have exhausted all the combinations and permutations of such words. ... Anon"
172,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2526106-jason,4,"This was arguably the best popular science book I've read. The titular God Particle, or theoretical Higgs boson, is a recurring character in the book, but the scope is far broader than one yet-to-be-discovered particle. Nobel laureate Lederman tells the story of particle physics from Thales and Democritus up to the as-then-not-yet-aborted Superconducting Supercollider in Waxahachie, TX. He re-envisions the history of physics and chemistry as the quest for the fundamental piece of nature, a quest that has currently described fundamental particles like the fermions (quarks---the building blocks of protons and neutrons and other subatomic particles---and mesons---including electrons, muons, and neutrinos) and bosons (force particles like gluons, photons, and the Ws and Z). Along the way, Lederman shares his fondness for experimental physics and experimentalists, his thoughts on the urgent need for more science education and literacy, his modest philosophical musings on what this stuff all means, and a sense of humor that affirms my sense that he is a born science educator.I'm glad I decided to re-read this (and finish it this time) after so many years. "
173,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/598644-richie-c,5,"First half of the book: 6/5 stars.Second half of the book: 4/5 stars.The first half of the book is a brief (well, brief considering that it covers a couple thousand years) history of particle physics up until the mid-20th century. It's exciting to discover how the knowledge of the ""a-tom"" progressed over time. Lederman's hypothetical conversation with Democritus is especially well-constructed to allow the reader to understand some deep concepts without too much work.Then the second half of the book it turns into something else. Suddenly Lederman feels like he has to go into much more detail about everything and turns some pages into a chore to read. Perhaps he felt this was necessary to accomplish the goal of gaining support for the Superconducting Super Collider that was under construction in Texas, or perhaps once he started explaining the physics that was new during his lifetime, he was unable to take the long view as he did in the first half of the book. It's still fascinating and fun to find out about quarks and mesons and bosons, but it would have been better explained by using the approach in the first half of the book.Overall, an excellent book, especially for someone like me who is somewhat science-oriented but only took a couple Physics classes in college."
174,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64369720-hal-gabow,5,"This is a wonderful introduction to the physics of subatomic particles, not to mention background material that starts at the very beginning (ancient Greeks and Galileo). It is well-written -- Lederman has a wonderful sense of humor -- and as close to a page-turner as you can get, even when progress slows to allow excursions to the Wikipedia or a handy physics text. (Supplementaryreading helps clarify the physics, and also gives more up-to-date information than the book, which was written in 1993. But the book is still topical.) The book also offers insights into the lives and personalities of physicists, as well as entertaining quips about the two cultures of theorists versus experimentalists. I even enjoyed the details of particle accelerators and detectors, which I wasn't interested in beforehand.My only complaint is the Kindle edition is poorly scanned. There are many misspellings --even words that are incomprehensible -- as well as technical terms (e.g. particle names) that are clearly wrong and have to be guessed at."
175,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60974478-andrea-balsara,4,"The first part of the book really helped me to understand some things that had been outside of my education experience. I found particle physics fascinating—the universe as creative force—but as the book went on I found my lack of foundational science to be a real hindrance in understanding. If anything, this book made me regret my assumption in high school, and later in university, that science was for other people and that, as an artist, I should focus solely on the arts. I regret that I will never quite understand something that is so beautiful, so mysterious in many ways. The older I get, the more I realize that art and science are not divided, but are merely aspects of the same thing. One of these days I will slog through the end, with my brain smoking and understanding sorely tried (and fried) but it will be worth it. The subject is fascinating. I am only giving the book 4 stars because there came a point where I just couldn’t seem to understand it anymore. Prior to that, it was sheer bliss reading about the underpinnings of the universe."
176,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33004524-ashar-malik,5,"This book is amazing. To start with the author takes us on a journey through the life of particle physics from almost 500 BC to 1992 AD. Chronicling the greatest moments that led the field to where it is (or was in 1993) made for an amazing time spent reading. I didn't see the publishing date on the book (1993) -- which makes the science a bit outdated now. However in the last chapter the author attempts to envision the future of the field in 2020. While this was a stand-alone instant, other places in the book do predict discoveries in the near future. What, to me, was the most exciting bit was that this is the first book that I have read where based on knowledge of the time predictions were made about discovery of the particles which have now come to pass. So from that point it was a great read. Lastly - the last paragraph is written as a Hollywood movie scene was amazing and is definitely worth a read. "

If I ever will have a chance of meeting Mr. Lederman, I'm not sure if I won't be just like ""Hey, Leon! Remember that one time we got on a trip together?"", and I definately will wear a t-shirt with 'oops-leon'.Another major contribution to God's particle success and my personal delight comes from authors abilities to explain everything in a simple eloquent way using all the deepness of English language, even if the science part would have been gibberish in academic sense, I still would have read it just for the personal pleasure that comes from articulate, crisp and informal style of writing used by authors.Thank you for the journey, please let me go now."

Of course, this book came out in 1993, so a fair amount of information is out of date.

I think he is currently at MIT but won't swear to it. In any case, this book was extremely well written. He leavened it with lots of humor and as little math as he could manage. His excitement at the work being done was obvious and exuberant which made this a pleasure to read even if it took me considerably longer than I thought it would! He started by having a chapter long conversation with Democritus which was a great way to introduce the subject and start on the history leading to modern physics and the Higgs boson. It was actually discovered shortly after the book was published but was still theoretical when it went to press. He had a blast with Democritus and it was a great ice breaker for the subject.

As usual, I certainly can't claim I really understood everything but I understand a fair amount better than I did! I can't help but let people know that HE wanted to call the book The Goddamn Particle but the publisher wouldn't let him!

He outlines early Aristotelian thinking and explains the significance of revolutionaries such as Galileo, Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, and Hertz. He not only describes the role of particle accelerators to continue the quest started by Democritus, but also explains their inner-workings to demystify ""big science"" from something esoteric to something understandable. In the process, he reveals the importance of continuing investment by governments in these massive machines to advance the frontier of human knowledge. All in all, this book is expertly crafted.

Despite needing updating since it was originally written, it starts with a well articulated and interesting history of physics (I especially like his sense of humor) however following that, if your intent is to learn quantum physics, be prepared to read disproportionately about supercolliders and the author's experiments, and throughout take notes to try to comprehend the science (also might help if you took an intro to physics course). Among many other terms, he explains and speaks fluently of anti-protons, baryons, bosons, dimensions, electrons, fermions, gluons, hadrons, ions, kaons, leptons, mesons, muons, neutrons, nucleons, photons, pions, protons, selectrons, sleptons, tevetrons, upsilons. Don't get me wrong, I think (as apparently does the author) that he is brilliant, which is why, despite my degree in mathematics, the book makes me feel like a peon (so I do not feel bad about obtaining the book at a significant discount). If I have walked away with any lasting impressions, they are 1. physicists apparently like words that end in ""on"" and 2. I'm now convinced that they will not solve the Higgs Boson God Particle mystery until they have exhausted all the combinations and permutations of such words. ... Anon"
202,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2526106-jason,4,"This was arguably the best popular science book I've read. The titular God Particle, or theoretical Higgs boson, is a recurring character in the book, but the scope is far broader than one yet-to-be-discovered particle. Nobel laureate Lederman tells the story of particle physics from Thales and Democritus up to the as-then-not-yet-aborted Superconducting Supercollider in Waxahachie, TX. He re-envisions the history of physics and chemistry as the quest for the fundamental piece of nature, a quest that has currently described fundamental particles like the fermions (quarks---the building blocks of protons and neutrons and other subatomic particles---and mesons---including electrons, muons, and neutrinos) and bosons (force particles like gluons, photons, and the Ws and Z). Along the way, Lederman shares his fondness for experimental physics and experimentalists, his thoughts on the urgent need for more science education and literacy, his modest philosophical musings on what this stuff all means, and a sense of humor that affirms my sense that he is a born science educator.I'm glad I decided to re-read this (and finish it this time) after so many years. "
203,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/598644-richie-c,5,"First half of the book: 6/5 stars.Second half of the book: 4/5 stars.The first half of the book is a brief (well, brief considering that it covers a couple thousand years) history of particle physics up until the mid-20th century. It's exciting to discover how the knowledge of the ""a-tom"" progressed over time. Lederman's hypothetical conversation with Democritus is especially well-constructed to allow the reader to understand some deep concepts without too much work.Then the second half of the book it turns into something else. Suddenly Lederman feels like he has to go into much more detail about everything and turns some pages into a chore to read. Perhaps he felt this was necessary to accomplish the goal of gaining support for the Superconducting Super Collider that was under construction in Texas, or perhaps once he started explaining the physics that was new during his lifetime, he was unable to take the long view as he did in the first half of the book. It's still fascinating and fun to find out about quarks and mesons and bosons, but it would have been better explained by using the approach in the first half of the book.Overall, an excellent book, especially for someone like me who is somewhat science-oriented but only took a couple Physics classes in college."
204,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64369720-hal-gabow,5,"This is a wonderful introduction to the physics of subatomic particles, not to mention background material that starts at the very beginning (ancient Greeks and Galileo). It is well-written -- Lederman has a wonderful sense of humor -- and as close to a page-turner as you can get, even when progress slows to allow excursions to the Wikipedia or a handy physics text. (Supplementaryreading helps clarify the physics, and also gives more up-to-date information than the book, which was written in 1993. But the book is still topical.) The book also offers insights into the lives and personalities of physicists, as well as entertaining quips about the two cultures of theorists versus experimentalists. I even enjoyed the details of particle accelerators and detectors, which I wasn't interested in beforehand.My only complaint is the Kindle edition is poorly scanned. There are many misspellings --even words that are incomprehensible -- as well as technical terms (e.g. particle names) that are clearly wrong and have to be guessed at."
205,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60974478-andrea-balsara,4,"The first part of the book really helped me to understand some things that had been outside of my education experience. I found particle physics fascinating—the universe as creative force—but as the book went on I found my lack of foundational science to be a real hindrance in understanding. If anything, this book made me regret my assumption in high school, and later in university, that science was for other people and that, as an artist, I should focus solely on the arts. I regret that I will never quite understand something that is so beautiful, so mysterious in many ways. The older I get, the more I realize that art and science are not divided, but are merely aspects of the same thing. One of these days I will slog through the end, with my brain smoking and understanding sorely tried (and fried) but it will be worth it. The subject is fascinating. I am only giving the book 4 stars because there came a point where I just couldn’t seem to understand it anymore. Prior to that, it was sheer bliss reading about the underpinnings of the universe."
206,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33004524-ashar-malik,5,"This book is amazing. To start with the author takes us on a journey through the life of particle physics from almost 500 BC to 1992 AD. Chronicling the greatest moments that led the field to where it is (or was in 1993) made for an amazing time spent reading. I didn't see the publishing date on the book (1993) -- which makes the science a bit outdated now. However in the last chapter the author attempts to envision the future of the field in 2020. While this was a stand-alone instant, other places in the book do predict discoveries in the near future. What, to me, was the most exciting bit was that this is the first book that I have read where based on knowledge of the time predictions were made about discovery of the particles which have now come to pass. So from that point it was a great read. Lastly - the last paragraph is written as a Hollywood movie scene was amazing and is definitely worth a read. "

That is sort of the premise of this book, but in order to get to that point, our authors give us a great 101 of physics, starting with, of course, an ancient Greek and winding all the way up to the present day and the creation of super particle accelerators built to smash already tiny shit into ever smaller bits. Cool! Not assuming too much prior exposure to the sciences – thank the singularity, Lederman's book is a gift to the genre of 'pop science': He respects the whoa factor of science and also the pesky scientific methodology part. Never sensational, always a hoot. "

He covers a lot of history of advancement in the field and spends a lot of time on quarks since that was big shit when he wrote the book. There's also some cutesy, fun diagrams that paint a really neat picture of the standard model and some geometric classification of every single subatomic particle. But don't be frightened, it's not like a text book at all! At the end of the book, Lederman goes on to tear Gary Zukov (author of The Dancing Wu Li Masters) a new black hole, if you are drifting my meaning. Lederman really didn't like Zukov's book."

224,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17864015-paul-little,4,"It was the basic premise of this ebook that interested me. Essentially it takes its leaping off point from the unmistakable truth that with great scientific advances come great unknowns and unexpected or perhaps ill-considered consequences. Even the most noble of intentions can potentially, when used to probe beyond the safe zone of our current understanding, create tools of almost unimaginable devastation. So, in a sense, it is not such a leap of faith to think that there might be self-appointed guardians of sanity working in the shadows to try and temper the more inappropriate flights of fantasy that the ‘boffins’ embark upon. From this launchpad, we have an intriguing conspiracy thriller with good guys and bad guys and the poor unfortunate hero thrown ignorantly into the middle.As a thriller this ebook works well, generates tension and generally moves along at a good pace with just the right amount of action and tension. Our hero Tom seems to be a mixture of many things and is delightfully more energetic and interesting than I would anticipate his real life counterpart to be. That probably says a lot more about my personal opinion of top academics, in that I can see them being extremely intelligent and dedicated but running around in a breathless race against time, not so much. I am thinking more Ricky Gervais than Tom Cruise I suppose. As a scientific conspiracy it also works pretty well. There are some good historical perspectives and scene setting that lift the book and give a nice feel to the experience. As with any book of this nature there are aspects that go into the areas of fantastic speculation that will irritate some people and yet for others will be an integral part of the tension building. There was one surfing vignette that, whilst nicely written, seemed to stick out from the rest of the story and slowed the plot for a few pages, it caught me so off guard that I thought I had accidently switched files on my Kindle. As a part of a larger debate, about the possible implications of dabbling with the basic building blocks of nature and the potential devastating implications if an admittedly extremely low probability event would occur, this work can bring something. Like the plethora of natural disaster and man-made disaster action movies, The God Particle is great entertainment with a serious theme if you want it. In the end though we should not forget the irony that CERN was also somehow the birthplace of the internet which allows us to spread this message."

On this journey you won't be left alone, Mr. Lederman and his incredible imagination on par with an astounding sense of humor (I mean, you don't really expect to have a good laugh while reading a book on quantum physics, but man, will you smile like an idiot) will guide you through the most strangest of concepts and indeed, make you believe that standard model is free of randomness (to some extent). In case if that kind of support isn't enough, there are other characters that join the search with you and Lederman, and even some that wait for you in the end of it.

254,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17864015-paul-little,4,"It was the basic premise of this ebook that interested me. Essentially it takes its leaping off point from the unmistakable truth that with great scientific advances come great unknowns and unexpected or perhaps ill-considered consequences. Even the most noble of intentions can potentially, when used to probe beyond the safe zone of our current understanding, create tools of almost unimaginable devastation. So, in a sense, it is not such a leap of faith to think that there might be self-appointed guardians of sanity working in the shadows to try and temper the more inappropriate flights of fantasy that the ‘boffins’ embark upon. From this launchpad, we have an intriguing conspiracy thriller with good guys and bad guys and the poor unfortunate hero thrown ignorantly into the middle.As a thriller this ebook works well, generates tension and generally moves along at a good pace with just the right amount of action and tension. Our hero Tom seems to be a mixture of many things and is delightfully more energetic and interesting than I would anticipate his real life counterpart to be. That probably says a lot more about my personal opinion of top academics, in that I can see them being extremely intelligent and dedicated but running around in a breathless race against time, not so much. I am thinking more Ricky Gervais than Tom Cruise I suppose. As a scientific conspiracy it also works pretty well. There are some good historical perspectives and scene setting that lift the book and give a nice feel to the experience. As with any book of this nature there are aspects that go into the areas of fantastic speculation that will irritate some people and yet for others will be an integral part of the tension building. There was one surfing vignette that, whilst nicely written, seemed to stick out from the rest of the story and slowed the plot for a few pages, it caught me so off guard that I thought I had accidently switched files on my Kindle. As a part of a larger debate, about the possible implications of dabbling with the basic building blocks of nature and the potential devastating implications if an admittedly extremely low probability event would occur, this work can bring something. Like the plethora of natural disaster and man-made disaster action movies, The God Particle is great entertainment with a serious theme if you want it. In the end though we should not forget the irony that CERN was also somehow the birthplace of the internet which allows us to spread this message."
255,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1935025-manuk,5,"Mr. Lederman and Mr. Teresi set this book as a journey through a history of human thought over the space and time, which is manifested in a beautiful ideas that lure you closer to get you experience curvatures of pure logic that are kin to those of roller-coasters. But, do not fear! On this journey you won't be left alone, Mr. Lederman and his incredible imagination on par with an astounding sense of humor (I mean, you don't really expect to have a good laugh while reading a book on quantum physics, but man, will you smile like an idiot) will guide you through the most strangest of concepts and indeed, make you believe that standard model is free of randomness (to some extent). In case if that kind of support isn't enough, there are other characters that join the search with you and Lederman, and even some that wait for you in the end of it. They will help you through sharp-bends and hold you if you try to quit before another crazy drop (I mean it, you won't be let go). At some points you will need to look at something, like your own hand, just to be sure that world around you is not dots and forces as it appears in your head. Authors make you believe that you are actually a part of this book, they make you struggle with some of the most brilliant minds in the human history, as well as share excitement from their triumphs, both, in the field of quantum theory and in the field of personal cunning. If I ever will have a chance of meeting Mr. Lederman, I'm not sure if I won't be just like ""Hey, Leon! Remember that one time we got on a trip together?"", and I definately will wear a t-shirt with 'oops-leon'.Another major contribution to God's particle success and my personal delight comes from authors abilities to explain everything in a simple eloquent way using all the deepness of English language, even if the science part would have been gibberish in academic sense, I still would have read it just for the personal pleasure that comes from articulate, crisp and informal style of writing used by authors.Thank you for the journey, please let me go now."

257,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3837733-joan,4,"Lederman is a Physics Nobel prize winner so he is certainly authoritative! Of course, this book came out in 1993, so a fair amount of information is out of date. For example, the Supercollider in Texas was still going to be built when this book went to press but the writing was on the wall as Lederman acknowledged and I doubt he was surprised when the project was cancelled but surely was terribly disappointed. I think he is currently at MIT but won't swear to it. In any case, this book was extremely well written. He leavened it with lots of humor and as little math as he could manage. His excitement at the work being done was obvious and exuberant which made this a pleasure to read even if it took me considerably longer than I thought it would! He started by having a chapter long conversation with Democritus which was a great way to introduce the subject and start on the history leading to modern physics and the Higgs boson. It was actually discovered shortly after the book was published but was still theoretical when it went to press. He had a blast with Democritus and it was a great ice breaker for the subject. If you're wondering WHY some Greek guy, Democritus was the guy who came up with the idea of atoms, indivisible bits of matter. Which of course, as Lederman pointed out, isn't true of OUR atom. As usual, I certainly can't claim I really understood everything but I understand a fair amount better than I did! I can't help but let people know that HE wanted to call the book The Goddamn Particle but the publisher wouldn't let him! He said that was more appropriate since it has been so hard to actually find the Higgs Boson! Of course, the publisher knew a good title when he saw one and went boldly ahead with a different title from what Lederman had suggested! I'm now of course going to have to find more recent books on the subject to try and understand some of this even more! Suggestions for basic more up to date Physics tittles anyone? "
258,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21134714-aiman-faruqi,5,"This is a book I did not go into with any anticipation whatsoever. In fact, I had never heard of Leon Lederman prior to seeing this book, despite the fact he is a Nobel laureate in physics. Despite my ingoing ambivalence, I am glad to say that this book is simply amazing. On the back of my version, a reviewer remarks, ""What Hawking did for cosmology, Lederman does for particle physics."" This sentence in and of itself is a perfect summary of Lederman's book. The book, having been published in the early '90s, is a tad outdated when it comes to particle accelerator capabilities and forthcomings, but it does not suffer from this same problem when it comes to discussing the actual science (the big exception being the discovery of the Higgs). In this work, Lederman takes the reader through a fascinating history for the quest of the ultimate constituent of the universe we reside in—Democritus' a-tom. He outlines early Aristotelian thinking and explains the significance of revolutionaries such as Galileo, Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, and Hertz. He not only describes the role of particle accelerators to continue the quest started by Democritus, but also explains their inner-workings to demystify ""big science"" from something esoteric to something understandable. In the process, he reveals the importance of continuing investment by governments in these massive machines to advance the frontier of human knowledge. All in all, this book is expertly crafted. It's remarkably funny and insightful, while simultaneously accessible and profound. It does not treat the reader as a child but nor does it expect knowledge of advanced calculus. If you are interested in science in general, this is a must read. "
259,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/253428-roger,5,"Far more informational than I had hoped, perhaps even better than all the questions it answered for me was all the new questions it made me think up that weren't answered between its covers; without loading his book down so as to be unwieldy or frightening for the mathophobes, Lederman's managed to get at least this reader enticed to learn more. If only it had a list of other books that are great reads for the couch physicists out there.Anyway, it's a must-read to round out all that your high school and college physics classes left out. Why my classes never even got to relativity, not to mention basic particle physics, is beyond me. :)Also let me note that I'm not really a fan of the title. The book is hardly ""about"" the Higgs field, doesn't pretend that finding the Higgs boson will conclude our quest for knowledge, and only really gets to this and the big Questions about the universe at the very end. It's really just a history of and introduction to particle physics.One happy thing about the book: Lederman repeatedly mentions the hunt for the top quark, and looks like his lab Fermilab found it just a few years after he published this.One sad thing about the book: he pins a lot of hope on the Superconducting Supercollider project in Texas, which theoretically could have been powerful enough to discover the Higgs boson (and plenty other besides) - but the project was killed in the Clinton era and now all that's there is some empty tunnels. More than a decade later, the Large Hadron Collider is still offline, and its operational energies are a fraction of what the SSC could have achieved. I guess this vindicates somewhat his position on science evangelism."

Not having much of a history with the study of physics, the first time reading through this book, many concepts seem somewhat beyond my grasp of initial comprehension. Although, it touches on nearly every theorist's and experimenter's ideas and results concerning the physical world and it's constituents. I'm still in the process of getting into this book, but for the first few chapters, the author emphasizes on explaining the atomic and sub-atomic particles' actions, composition, charge, mass and influence on one another. Also, he included many of the important and relevant discoveries of mathematical studies (mainly physics and chemistry) and the discoverer of them in, for the most part, a chronological order. So far, it has been a very enjoyable and knowledgeable read. L. Lederman is an intelligent and experienced physicist and very proficient at collaborating data into a easily understood format, also by using a very well educated vocabulary. It definitely shows through his writing. I commend the man for his obsession or love for the profession that he chooses to pursue day in and day out.

284,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17864015-paul-little,4,"It was the basic premise of this ebook that interested me. Essentially it takes its leaping off point from the unmistakable truth that with great scientific advances come great unknowns and unexpected or perhaps ill-considered consequences. Even the most noble of intentions can potentially, when used to probe beyond the safe zone of our current understanding, create tools of almost unimaginable devastation. So, in a sense, it is not such a leap of faith to think that there might be self-appointed guardians of sanity working in the shadows to try and temper the more inappropriate flights of fantasy that the ‘boffins’ embark upon. From this launchpad, we have an intriguing conspiracy thriller with good guys and bad guys and the poor unfortunate hero thrown ignorantly into the middle.As a thriller this ebook works well, generates tension and generally moves along at a good pace with just the right amount of action and tension. Our hero Tom seems to be a mixture of many things and is delightfully more energetic and interesting than I would anticipate his real life counterpart to be. That probably says a lot more about my personal opinion of top academics, in that I can see them being extremely intelligent and dedicated but running around in a breathless race against time, not so much. I am thinking more Ricky Gervais than Tom Cruise I suppose. As a scientific conspiracy it also works pretty well. There are some good historical perspectives and scene setting that lift the book and give a nice feel to the experience. As with any book of this nature there are aspects that go into the areas of fantastic speculation that will irritate some people and yet for others will be an integral part of the tension building. There was one surfing vignette that, whilst nicely written, seemed to stick out from the rest of the story and slowed the plot for a few pages, it caught me so off guard that I thought I had accidently switched files on my Kindle. As a part of a larger debate, about the possible implications of dabbling with the basic building blocks of nature and the potential devastating implications if an admittedly extremely low probability event would occur, this work can bring something. Like the plethora of natural disaster and man-made disaster action movies, The God Particle is great entertainment with a serious theme if you want it. In the end though we should not forget the irony that CERN was also somehow the birthplace of the internet which allows us to spread this message."
285,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1935025-manuk,5,"Mr. Lederman and Mr. Teresi set this book as a journey through a history of human thought over the space and time, which is manifested in a beautiful ideas that lure you closer to get you experience curvatures of pure logic that are kin to those of roller-coasters. But, do not fear! On this journey you won't be left alone, Mr. Lederman and his incredible imagination on par with an astounding sense of humor (I mean, you don't really expect to have a good laugh while reading a book on quantum physics, but man, will you smile like an idiot) will guide you through the most strangest of concepts and indeed, make you believe that standard model is free of randomness (to some extent). In case if that kind of support isn't enough, there are other characters that join the search with you and Lederman, and even some that wait for you in the end of it. They will help you through sharp-bends and hold you if you try to quit before another crazy drop (I mean it, you won't be let go). At some points you will need to look at something, like your own hand, just to be sure that world around you is not dots and forces as it appears in your head. Authors make you believe that you are actually a part of this book, they make you struggle with some of the most brilliant minds in the human history, as well as share excitement from their triumphs, both, in the field of quantum theory and in the field of personal cunning. If I ever will have a chance of meeting Mr. Lederman, I'm not sure if I won't be just like ""Hey, Leon! Remember that one time we got on a trip together?"", and I definately will wear a t-shirt with 'oops-leon'.Another major contribution to God's particle success and my personal delight comes from authors abilities to explain everything in a simple eloquent way using all the deepness of English language, even if the science part would have been gibberish in academic sense, I still would have read it just for the personal pleasure that comes from articulate, crisp and informal style of writing used by authors.Thank you for the journey, please let me go now."

287,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3837733-joan,4,"Lederman is a Physics Nobel prize winner so he is certainly authoritative! Of course, this book came out in 1993, so a fair amount of information is out of date. For example, the Supercollider in Texas was still going to be built when this book went to press but the writing was on the wall as Lederman acknowledged and I doubt he was surprised when the project was cancelled but surely was terribly disappointed. I think he is currently at MIT but won't swear to it. In any case, this book was extremely well written. He leavened it with lots of humor and as little math as he could manage. His excitement at the work being done was obvious and exuberant which made this a pleasure to read even if it took me considerably longer than I thought it would! He started by having a chapter long conversation with Democritus which was a great way to introduce the subject and start on the history leading to modern physics and the Higgs boson. It was actually discovered shortly after the book was published but was still theoretical when it went to press. He had a blast with Democritus and it was a great ice breaker for the subject. If you're wondering WHY some Greek guy, Democritus was the guy who came up with the idea of atoms, indivisible bits of matter. Which of course, as Lederman pointed out, isn't true of OUR atom. As usual, I certainly can't claim I really understood everything but I understand a fair amount better than I did! I can't help but let people know that HE wanted to call the book The Goddamn Particle but the publisher wouldn't let him! He said that was more appropriate since it has been so hard to actually find the Higgs Boson! Of course, the publisher knew a good title when he saw one and went boldly ahead with a different title from what Lederman had suggested! I'm now of course going to have to find more recent books on the subject to try and understand some of this even more! Suggestions for basic more up to date Physics tittles anyone? "
288,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21134714-aiman-faruqi,5,"This is a book I did not go into with any anticipation whatsoever. In fact, I had never heard of Leon Lederman prior to seeing this book, despite the fact he is a Nobel laureate in physics. Despite my ingoing ambivalence, I am glad to say that this book is simply amazing. On the back of my version, a reviewer remarks, ""What Hawking did for cosmology, Lederman does for particle physics."" This sentence in and of itself is a perfect summary of Lederman's book. The book, having been published in the early '90s, is a tad outdated when it comes to particle accelerator capabilities and forthcomings, but it does not suffer from this same problem when it comes to discussing the actual science (the big exception being the discovery of the Higgs). In this work, Lederman takes the reader through a fascinating history for the quest of the ultimate constituent of the universe we reside in—Democritus' a-tom. He outlines early Aristotelian thinking and explains the significance of revolutionaries such as Galileo, Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, and Hertz. He not only describes the role of particle accelerators to continue the quest started by Democritus, but also explains their inner-workings to demystify ""big science"" from something esoteric to something understandable. In the process, he reveals the importance of continuing investment by governments in these massive machines to advance the frontier of human knowledge. All in all, this book is expertly crafted. It's remarkably funny and insightful, while simultaneously accessible and profound. It does not treat the reader as a child but nor does it expect knowledge of advanced calculus. If you are interested in science in general, this is a must read. "
289,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/253428-roger,5,"Far more informational than I had hoped, perhaps even better than all the questions it answered for me was all the new questions it made me think up that weren't answered between its covers; without loading his book down so as to be unwieldy or frightening for the mathophobes, Lederman's managed to get at least this reader enticed to learn more. If only it had a list of other books that are great reads for the couch physicists out there.Anyway, it's a must-read to round out all that your high school and college physics classes left out. Why my classes never even got to relativity, not to mention basic particle physics, is beyond me. :)Also let me note that I'm not really a fan of the title. The book is hardly ""about"" the Higgs field, doesn't pretend that finding the Higgs boson will conclude our quest for knowledge, and only really gets to this and the big Questions about the universe at the very end. It's really just a history of and introduction to particle physics.One happy thing about the book: Lederman repeatedly mentions the hunt for the top quark, and looks like his lab Fermilab found it just a few years after he published this.One sad thing about the book: he pins a lot of hope on the Superconducting Supercollider project in Texas, which theoretically could have been powerful enough to discover the Higgs boson (and plenty other besides) - but the project was killed in the Clinton era and now all that's there is some empty tunnels. More than a decade later, the Large Hadron Collider is still offline, and its operational energies are a fraction of what the SSC could have achieved. I guess this vindicates somewhat his position on science evangelism."
290,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/134097-eric,5,"This book is written in an extremely coherent, informative manner with a touch of intellectual humor and imagination. Not having much of a history with the study of physics, the first time reading through this book, many concepts seem somewhat beyond my grasp of initial comprehension. Although, it touches on nearly every theorist's and experimenter's ideas and results concerning the physical world and it's constituents. I'm still in the process of getting into this book, but for the first few chapters, the author emphasizes on explaining the atomic and sub-atomic particles' actions, composition, charge, mass and influence on one another. Also, he included many of the important and relevant discoveries of mathematical studies (mainly physics and chemistry) and the discoverer of them in, for the most part, a chronological order. So far, it has been a very enjoyable and knowledgeable read. L. Lederman is an intelligent and experienced physicist and very proficient at collaborating data into a easily understood format, also by using a very well educated vocabulary. It definitely shows through his writing. I commend the man for his obsession or love for the profession that he chooses to pursue day in and day out. Personally, I feel as though I have a combination of theorist's and experimenter's blood in me, that way instead of going back and forth between the two seperate individuals, I only change modes when necessary and continue my own pursuit from there!"
291,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18844786-joe-ciola,4,"I love long books that peek my interest, challenge conventional ways of thinking, and sufficiently address / answer the author's main topic; the latter part is where I feel the book comes up short. Despite needing updating since it was originally written, it starts with a well articulated and interesting history of physics (I especially like his sense of humor) however following that, if your intent is to learn quantum physics, be prepared to read disproportionately about supercolliders and the author's experiments, and throughout take notes to try to comprehend the science (also might help if you took an intro to physics course). Among many other terms, he explains and speaks fluently of anti-protons, baryons, bosons, dimensions, electrons, fermions, gluons, hadrons, ions, kaons, leptons, mesons, muons, neutrons, nucleons, photons, pions, protons, selectrons, sleptons, tevetrons, upsilons. Don't get me wrong, I think (as apparently does the author) that he is brilliant, which is why, despite my degree in mathematics, the book makes me feel like a peon (so I do not feel bad about obtaining the book at a significant discount). If I have walked away with any lasting impressions, they are 1. physicists apparently like words that end in ""on"" and 2. I'm now convinced that they will not solve the Higgs Boson God Particle mystery until they have exhausted all the combinations and permutations of such words. ... Anon"
292,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2526106-jason,4,"This was arguably the best popular science book I've read. The titular God Particle, or theoretical Higgs boson, is a recurring character in the book, but the scope is far broader than one yet-to-be-discovered particle. Nobel laureate Lederman tells the story of particle physics from Thales and Democritus up to the as-then-not-yet-aborted Superconducting Supercollider in Waxahachie, TX. He re-envisions the history of physics and chemistry as the quest for the fundamental piece of nature, a quest that has currently described fundamental particles like the fermions (quarks---the building blocks of protons and neutrons and other subatomic particles---and mesons---including electrons, muons, and neutrinos) and bosons (force particles like gluons, photons, and the Ws and Z). Along the way, Lederman shares his fondness for experimental physics and experimentalists, his thoughts on the urgent need for more science education and literacy, his modest philosophical musings on what this stuff all means, and a sense of humor that affirms my sense that he is a born science educator.I'm glad I decided to re-read this (and finish it this time) after so many years. "
293,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/598644-richie-c,5,"First half of the book: 6/5 stars.Second half of the book: 4/5 stars.The first half of the book is a brief (well, brief considering that it covers a couple thousand years) history of particle physics up until the mid-20th century. It's exciting to discover how the knowledge of the ""a-tom"" progressed over time. Lederman's hypothetical conversation with Democritus is especially well-constructed to allow the reader to understand some deep concepts without too much work.Then the second half of the book it turns into something else. Suddenly Lederman feels like he has to go into much more detail about everything and turns some pages into a chore to read. Perhaps he felt this was necessary to accomplish the goal of gaining support for the Superconducting Super Collider that was under construction in Texas, or perhaps once he started explaining the physics that was new during his lifetime, he was unable to take the long view as he did in the first half of the book. It's still fascinating and fun to find out about quarks and mesons and bosons, but it would have been better explained by using the approach in the first half of the book.Overall, an excellent book, especially for someone like me who is somewhat science-oriented but only took a couple Physics classes in college."
294,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64369720-hal-gabow,5,"This is a wonderful introduction to the physics of subatomic particles, not to mention background material that starts at the very beginning (ancient Greeks and Galileo). It is well-written -- Lederman has a wonderful sense of humor -- and as close to a page-turner as you can get, even when progress slows to allow excursions to the Wikipedia or a handy physics text. (Supplementaryreading helps clarify the physics, and also gives more up-to-date information than the book, which was written in 1993. But the book is still topical.) The book also offers insights into the lives and personalities of physicists, as well as entertaining quips about the two cultures of theorists versus experimentalists. I even enjoyed the details of particle accelerators and detectors, which I wasn't interested in beforehand.My only complaint is the Kindle edition is poorly scanned. There are many misspellings --even words that are incomprehensible -- as well as technical terms (e.g. particle names) that are clearly wrong and have to be guessed at."
295,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60974478-andrea-balsara,4,"The first part of the book really helped me to understand some things that had been outside of my education experience. I found particle physics fascinating—the universe as creative force—but as the book went on I found my lack of foundational science to be a real hindrance in understanding. If anything, this book made me regret my assumption in high school, and later in university, that science was for other people and that, as an artist, I should focus solely on the arts. I regret that I will never quite understand something that is so beautiful, so mysterious in many ways. The older I get, the more I realize that art and science are not divided, but are merely aspects of the same thing. One of these days I will slog through the end, with my brain smoking and understanding sorely tried (and fried) but it will be worth it. The subject is fascinating. I am only giving the book 4 stars because there came a point where I just couldn’t seem to understand it anymore. Prior to that, it was sheer bliss reading about the underpinnings of the universe."
296,0385312113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33004524-ashar-malik,5,"This book is amazing. To start with the author takes us on a journey through the life of particle physics from almost 500 BC to 1992 AD. Chronicling the greatest moments that led the field to where it is (or was in 1993) made for an amazing time spent reading. I didn't see the publishing date on the book (1993) -- which makes the science a bit outdated now. However in the last chapter the author attempts to envision the future of the field in 2020. While this was a stand-alone instant, other places in the book do predict discoveries in the near future. What, to me, was the most exciting bit was that this is the first book that I have read where based on knowledge of the time predictions were made about discovery of the particles which have now come to pass. So from that point it was a great read. Lastly - the last paragraph is written as a Hollywood movie scene was amazing and is definitely worth a read. "
