First published on November 13, 2012. Kurzweil describes a series of thought experiments which suggest to him that the brain contains a hierarchy of pattern recognizers. Based on this he introduces his Pattern Recognition Theory of Mind (PRTM). He says the neocortex contains 300 million very general pattern recognition circuits and argues that they are responsible for most aspects of human thought. He also suggests that the brain is a ""recursive probabilistic fractal"" whose line of code is represented within the 30-100 million bytes of compressed code in the genome.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز نهم ماه دسامبر سال 2018میلادیعنوان: ‏‫آینده شبیه‌ سازی مغز‮‏‫: چگونگی خلق یک مغز غیربیولوژیک‮‬‏‫؛ نویسنده: ری کرزویل‮‬‏‫؛ مترجم: حسین کاشفی‌ امیری؛ تهران آینده پژوه‏‫، 1396؛ در 330ص؛‬ شابک 9786007265574؛ موضوع: هوش مصنوعی - خودآگاهی - مغز - از نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 21م‏‫آینده شبیه‌ سازی مغز‮‏‫: چگونگی خلق یک مغز غیربیولوژیک‮‬‏‫؛ درباره ی راز ذهن انسان و درباره ی مغز، چه از نظر طبیعی، و چه مصنوعی، که توسط دانشمند، مخترع و آینده نگر، «ری کورویل»، مورد بحث قرار گرفته است؛ این کتاب نخستین بار در تاریخ روز سیزدهم ماه نوامبر سال 2012میلادی در یک جلد توسط مؤسسه انتشاراتی وایکینگ منتشر شد؛ نویسنده در این کتاب برهان میآورند که ذهن انسان از سلسله مراتب تشخیص الگو تشکیل شده که از یک مدل آماری برای یادگیری، ذخیره، و بازیابی اطلاعات، استفاده میکند، و ...؛ تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 09/06/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"
1,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed by Ray Kurzweil “How to Create a Mind"" is a very interesting book that presents the pattern recognition theory of mind (PRTM), which describes the basic algorithm of the neocortex (the region of the brain responsible for perception, memory, and critical thinking). It is the author’s contention that the brain can be reverse engineered due to the power of its simplicity and such knowledge would allow us to create true artificial intelligence. The one and only, futurist, prize-winning scientist and author Ray Kurzweil takes the reader on a journey of the brain and the future of artificial intelligence. This enlightening 352-page book is composed of the following eleven chapters: 1. Thought Experiments on the World, 2. Thought Experiments on Thinking, 3. A Model of the Neocortex: The Pattern Recognition Theory of Mind, 4. The Biological Neocortex, 5. The Old Brain, 6. Transcendent Abilities, 7. The Biologically Inspired Digital Neocortex, 8. The Mind as Computer, 9. Thought Experiments on the Mind, 10. The Law of Accelerating Returns Applied to the Brain, and 11. Objections.Positives:1.	Well researched and well-written book. The author’s uncanny ability to make very difficult subjects accessible to the masses.2.	A great topic in the “mind” of a great thinker.3.	Great use of charts and diagrams.4.	A wonderful job of describing how thinking works. 5.	Thought-provoking questions and answers based on a combination of sound science and educated speculation.6.	The art of recreating brain processes in machines. “There is more parallel between brains and computers than may be apparent.” Great stuff!7.	Great information on how memories truly work.8.	Hierarchies of units of functionality in natural systems. 9.	How the neocortex must work. The Pattern Recognition Theory of Mind (PRTM). The main thesis of this book. The importance of redundancy. Plenty of details.10.	Evolution…it does a brain good. Legos will never be the same for me again.11.	The neocortex as a great metaphor machine. Projects underway to simulate the human brain such as Markram’s Blue Brain Project.12.	Speech recognition and Markov models. Author provides a lot of excellent examples. 13.	The four key concepts of the universality and feasibility of computation and its applicability to our thinking.14.	A fascinating look at split-brain patients. The “society of mind.” The concept of free will, “We are apparently very eager to explain and rationalize our actions, even when we didn’t actually make the decisions that led to them.” Profound with many implications indeed.15.	The issue of identity.16.	The brain’s ability to predict the future. The author’s own predictive track record referenced.17.	The laws of accelerating returns (LOAR), where it applies and why we should train ourselves to think exponentially. 18.	The author provides and analyzes objections to his thesis. In defense of his ideas. Going after Allen’s “scientist’s pessimism.”19.	The evolution of our knowledge.20.	Great notes and links beautifully.Negatives:1.	The book is uneven. That is, some chapters cover certain topics with depth while others suffer from lack of depth. Some of it is understandable as it relates to the limitations of what we currently know but I feel that the book could have been reformatted into smaller chapters or subchapters. The book bogs down a little in the middle sections of the book. 2.	Technically I disagree with the notion that evolution always leads to more complexity. Yes on survival but not necessarily on complexity. 3.	The author has a tendency to cross-market his products a tad much. It may come across as look at me…4.	A bit repetitive. 5.	Sometimes leaves you with more questions than answers but that may not be a bad thing…6.	No formal separate bibliography.In summary, overall I enjoyed this book. Regardless of your overall stance on the feasibility of artificial intelligence no one brings it like Ray Kurzweil. His enthusiasm and dedication is admirable. The author provides his basic thesis of how the brain works and a path to achieve true artificial intelligence and all that it implies. Fascinating in parts, bogs down in other sections but ultimately satisfying.

2,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16151018-t-k-see-tho,1,"I saw this book while browsing around in a local book store and the title really caught my eye. Kurzweil was a name I already knew and there were good reviews from some very well known people printed on the back - I bought it. However, after just the first few chapters I was beginning to get the feeling I wasted my $25, and nearer towards the end I felt that I wasted my time as well. By the end of the book I felt that it was a real waste of the paper it was printed on.Kurzweil started off by giving a very brief description of how his Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HHMM) has made his speech recognition software so successful, and then the billions he has made from it. He goes on to boast that if others adopted the same model they'd built far more superior machines. He then progresses to speculate that if only our brain would work like his speech recognition software we'd have far more superior minds. At this point I felt that this section read very much like an excerpt of some talk he gave, sprinkled onto his marketing brochure. Totally devoid of any useful information about what you'd expect from a book with such a title. It was as though he sent a draft to his panel of patent lawyers to remove anything that can give away anything at all about the technology he employs in his company. (This was were I felt $25 poorer.)In the middle of the book he seemed to have lost his focus and started talking about random topics. This to me felt as if he handed over the writing to his interns. (Now I was feeling like my time was wasted.)Towards the end he was like some over-the-hill-has-been-after-too-much-wine rambling about the philosophy of consciousness, identity, free will, etc. while focussing on his law of accelerating returns (LOAR). This I must say is a gross misuse of the term ""law"". He rambled on about how his graphs of data on computing power, data capacity, and price were laws in the sense of laws of thermodynamics. These are data extrapolations Mr. Kurzweil! It can hardly be compared to physical laws. (Now I really felt this book was a real waste of paper it was printed on.)All through the book I was wondering why, with a title like this, there were no references to the very interesting research (that's publicly accessible) done at the Allen Institute. As it turns out, the reason was in the final chapter - Paul Allen had earlier criticised his ""laws"" as not being actual physical laws in one of Kurzweil's earlier books. I'm imagining that at this point he must be really drunk to dedicate a whole chapter to saying how Paul Allen was wrong in saying that.I don't normally write lengthy reviews of books that I've read but this was so bad that I felt obliged to warn others not to waste their money and time (and saving some trees in the process). I'd give this book zero stars if I could."
3,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13365236-james-dittmar,2,"I like Kurzweil. But I thought he did a little too much boasting and did not provide enough details.First half of the book: it appears that we can model the brain with hierarchical hidden Markov models better than we can with neural nets. Some back of the envelope calculations show that Hidden Markov models may contribute to the functioning of the brain. Ok, so far so good. Second half of the book: wildly uneven coverage of a wide range of topics in neuroscience philosophy, such as identity, free will, and consciousness. Kurzweil likes to frequently mention all of the contributions that he has made to AI. I think this could have been toned down a little bit. Back in year XXX, I was one of the first to do XYZ. He has some good ideas in the first part, but I don’t think he comes close to explaining how to create a mind. "
4,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,2,"I'm just going to warn everyone at the offset: this book triggered my grumpy, cane-waving, ""you kids get off my lawn"" reflexes pretty hardcore. So, buckle up.If you ever need a really clear example of how intelligence and wisdom are not the same thing, this book is a great place to get started. I don't for an instant doubt that Ray Kurzweil is a very, very smart guy. (Almost certainly smarter than I am.) The problem is that, like quite a lot of people who have had a super-abundance of success--a dearth of healthy failure leads to a superabundance of confidence. Basically everything that is wrong in this book stems from that. So let's get started.Two of Kurzweil's motivating points are that:1. we don't really need to understand principles to use them2. more complicated things are sometimes simpler than less complicated thingsFor the first, he cites the fact that while an exact scientific explanation of Bernoulli's principle is still controversial (at best), we have airplanes. So, the theory goes, if his Pattern Recognition Theory of Mind (PRTM) works then we can build AI without fully grasping it just like we build airplanes while still pondering Bernoulli's principle. Except, of course, that if you went back in time 2,000 years and explained Bernoulli's principle to people, they couldn't exactly go out and build a 747. Same principles here: even if PRTM is correct, the idea that it's sufficient to build human-level AI is totally unsubstantiated. (We'll get to some specific deficits shortly.)As for the second, here's his argument: Let's think about what it means to be complex. We might ask, is a forest complex? The answer depends on the perspective you choose to take. You could note that there are many thousands of trees in the forest and that each one is different. You could then go on to note that each tress has thousands of branches and that each branch is completely different. Then you could proceed to describe the convoluted vagaries of a single branch. Your conclusion might be that the forest was complexity beyond our wildest imagination. But such an approach would literally be a failure to see the forest for the trees. Certainly there is a great deal of fractal variation among trees and branches, but to correctly understand the principles of a forest you would do better to start by identifying the distinct patterns of redundancy with stochastic (that is, random) variables that are found there. It would be fair to say that the concept of a forest is simpler than the concept of a tree.This is analogy is, shall we say, strained. If all you care about is geometry, then yes: you could use procedural generation to generate a reasonable facsimile of a forest without trying to minutely recreate an actual forest. (This is the idea behind the video game No Man's Sky, which uses procedural generation to create a universe ""which includes over 18 quintillion (1.8×1019) planets, many with their own sets of flora and fauna.""However, (1) that's how to create a forest in general, not any particular forest, and (2) what's the legitimate excuse for reducing a tree or a forest to merely their geometric shapes? A tree is an organism, and a forest is a superorganism of even greater complexity (even if you only consider the relationships between the various trees and ignore all the other creatures inhabiting it.) In short, this is just wishful thinking presented as an argument. There's an awful lot of pseudoscience like this in the book. He spends some time estimating the total number of patterns that a human brain needs to memorize, patterns for everything from the shape of the letter ""a"" to rules for driving safely. Unsurprisingly, his estimate of the number of patterns we need to memorize and his estimate for the number of discrete pattern-recognition unites in the neocortex coincide. This is convenient for his theory, but useless for any other purpose because he had defined his terms so loosely (if at all) that the explanation is entirely a black-box, while the method used to derive it is no more scientific than the infamous Drake equation. Another argument he repeats several times is that the brain really can't be that complex because there's only but so much information related to the brain in our DNA. This is an extremely problematic assertion, because it leaves out the very serious possibility of pointers. Think about it this way: we can easily compute how much memory it takes to send a string of English characters. If you use a typical encoding, you spend about 1-2 bytes per character, so a thousand characters is about a kilobyte. Now consider that I encode random gibberish and send it. How much information have I sent? Or imagine I write something meaningful, but that I send it to someone who doesn't speak English? How much information has been transmitted? Now imagine that I send it to someone who does speak English. Obviously this person--receiving a meaningful message--gets a lot more information out of what I've sent than the previous two. And so obviously measuring how much information is available for transmission isn't the same thing as measuring how much information is received. The English speaker is interpreting my message against a vast library of linguistic data that they already have in mind, and so they're getting a lot more out of it. Or, to make this example really extreme, suppose that my message says, ""You should look up this article on wikipedia"" and then provides a URL. This is what I really mean by a reference. It's possible to send a small message that refers to a much larger amount of information stored elsewhere. Effectively, this is what DNA is doing, since it's basically saying ""here's how to build proteins"" and then relying on the information encoded in physics--which dictates the behaviors and interactions of those proteins--to reference a vast library of information. How much data it takes to send instructions to build a brain via DNA and how much data we would need to replicate a mind in some other substrate are entirely different questions. The only way we could be assured of needing no more information than is available in the DNA is if we were actually building a biological brain or, at least, simulating one at the atomic level, which is exactly what Kurzweil insists we don't have to do. In other words: more wishful thinking.The real irony here, of course, is that Kurzweil refers to these concepts in the book. He understands that human intelligence is important because it allows us to store information ""in the cloud."" Historically, this meant social knowledge and culture. Instead of transmitting knowledge via DNA, we transmitted it via spoken language, and so we could store a lot more. Than we figured out writing, etc. He's familiar with all of this, so he should understand that the same could be true of DNA.But the most egregious problems occur when Kurzweil ventures outside of science entirely and starts talking philosophy. (This is a common problem with science writers, by the way. They really tend to lack a fundamental sense of humility when treading outside their own specialized domains.) For example, he has a chapter on theories of consciousness where--after summarizing some of the competing views--he basically waves the entire topic aside: ""These theories are all leaps of faith... where consciousness is concerned 'ya gotta have faith'"" It's odd for someone to dismiss so glibly the entire topic of consciousness and yet still take such a strong stance that we'll have conscious machines by 2029.Perhaps the most embarrassing section was his discussion of Descartes' famous ""cogito ergo sum."" Kurzweil writes:is famous ""I think, therefore I am"" is generally interpreted to extol rational thought, in the sense that, ""I think--that is I can perform logical thought--therefore I am worthwhile""This is an absurd misinterpretation of Descartes' statement that I have literally heard nowhere. I can imagine a remarkably ignorant person who decided to invent meaning for a quote without bothering to look it up online might come up with such a silly theory, but to claim it is ""generally interpreted"" this way is only to reveal a deep chasm of ignorance on fundamentals of Western philosophy. To his credit, Kurzweil goes on to say that ""reading this statement in context of his other writings I get a different impression,"" whereupon he gives the correct summary of Descartes' point. However, getting the point correct doesn't really make up for claiming as your own interpretation the meaning of a phrase that (1) is abundantly clear in context and (2) appears in introductory philosophy textbooks everywhere. As I stated: it's probably just a case of overconfidence. Kurzweil is probably really quite brilliant in his area of expertise (e.g. hierarchical hidden Markov modes, but it certainly erodes his credibility when he speaks so confidently and incorrectly on matters that are really pretty basic within their own domain.This is compounded when, a few pages later, he seriously attempts to defend his Law of Accelerating Returns (a generalized version of Moore's Law) as being just as much a real ""law"" as the laws of thermodynamics. I'll leave out a detailed rebuttal of this point, because I think for most people the silliness--and vanity--of this position are self-evident.All of this culminates in his final attack on John Searle and his Chinese room thought experiment. Searle is one of the most respected philosophers alive today, and Kurzweil is someone who thinks stating the obvious and accepted interpretation of philosophy's most famous three words is somehow his own invention. Naturally, this does not end well.Searle's Chinese room thought experiment is based on a simple setup: imagine a room with a library full of Chinese symbols listed in a table of input / output. Inside this room sits a man who speaks not a single word of Chinese. Occasionally, someone will write a question (in Chinese) and submit it through a slot. The man then looks through his library of symbols to find an input that matches. When he does, he copies down the output and slides that paper back out of the window.To an outside observer, it looks as though they can simply ask the room a question in Chinese and get an answer. So they might naturally assume that the person in the room speaks fluent Chinese. Of course, having to wait minutes or even hours to get a reply might spoil the illusion, but the point of this example is to make an analogy for a computer, so you can imagine the person looking up the Chinese symbols is really, really fast.Of course, we know that he doesn't understand a word. And so--according to Searle--the fact that an AI program could (for example) pass the Turing test wouldn't guarantee that the AI understood anything at all.Kurzweil's rebuttal to the most famous argument against strong-AI is to simply state that--while the man doesn't understand Chinese--the man and the room taken together do. This is not bad as a starting point to try and respond to Searle, but it's just that: a starting point. It's not clear to me at all that a library of books ""understands"" information just because it contains information. And it's certainly not clear to me what it means to say that a library + a librarian = a unified, holistic intelligence. (Especially if the librarian happens to be unable to read any of the words in his library!)Suffice it to say: I didn't find this book very convincing.I find the overall topic interesting, and I do think that Kurzweil's explanation of how the neocortex works is entirely plausible. I found it convincing, anyway. This PRTM (pattern recognition theory of mind) seems entirely plausible as an explanation for how the neocortex handles knowledge--both learning and recall--and I do think that his basic aspiration (to use that as a basis for constructing cybernetic brain-enhancements) has some realistic promise. I say, some because I think he's skipping over some really, really hard problems, especially how to integrate an artificial neocortex with a biological one. The neocortex is impressively plastic, but not infinitely so, and it's not at all clear to me that this is a trivial problem.Moreover, creating an auxilliary neo-cortex is very, very, very far from creating a stand-alone AI. As Kurzweil admits, even if you constructed an artificial brain (he seems to think you could get away with just a neocortex) you're going to have to teach it. But he views this as a symbol matter of pattern recognition. This is obviously false, because a lot of what is required for growing a healthy human mind includes things like love and empathy. He suggests that waiting to teach a nascent AI in real time would be tiresome, so we should speed up the clock cycle and fast-forward our artificial brain through 10-20 years of development in 1-2 years of real time. Would anyone like to propose a method of providing a simulated version of 10-20 years of love and healthy attachment to a computer simulation at 10x speed? Because we know--from tragic natural experiments--that a lack of love and nurture leads to severe developmental problems both emotionally and intellectually.There's some really, really interesting material here. And if Kurzweil was willing to show some humility in dealing with experts outside his field--and maybe a little bit of humility with his own visions--it could have been a fascinating and influential book. As it stands, however, his achievements are overshadowed by his unjustified arrogance."
5,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6857911-ryan,3,"If you don’t know much about the current state of artificial intelligence, brain science, or the philosophy of consciousness, and don’t mind a little bit of technical discussion, Kurzweil does a fine job of articulating the current rapid converge between these areas of understanding. However, if you already do know the basics, this book probably isn’t going to do much to expand your own consciousness.Speaking as a software engineer who has a fascination with AI, I largely agree with Kurzweil's glowing assessments about the future of machine intelligence, though I'd probably push his timeframe back a few decades and could do with a bit less of his self-promotion. Though there's a lot we still don't understand about how the human brain operates, neuroscience and computer science are starting to form the same fundamental insights about how intelligence ""works"", whether it's represented as neurons or a mathematical process. In a truly intelligent machine, data from the outside world is taken in by a large, hierarchical array of pattern-recognizers, which gradually rewire themselves to better anticipate the messy-but-hierarchical patterns of the real world (visual squiggles to letters, letters to words, words to syntax, syntax to meanings, meanings to relationships, relationships to concepts, concepts to insights -- and back down again). To some extent, the software world has already made useful progress in this direction.However, most of the insights Kurzweil offers aren’t anything new. Indeed, most of what he says was explored in Jeff Hawkin’s 2004 book, On Intelligence, and in academia before that. Briefly stated, the hierarchical architecture of the human brain’s neocortex is the major engine of human intelligence, and it seems to start out mostly as a blank slate, a generalized learning machine that builds neural connections through experience, eventually forming a complex inductive model of reality, which constantly makes predictions about what comes next. Kurzweil shares some of his own successes solving certain kinds of problems decades ago, but the new ideas he advances seem somewhat vague and underdeveloped (maybe he’s saving the nuts and bolts for his new job at Google).Still, there's plenty here for a general audience, when he gets away from the geekery. Kurzweil is passionate and pretty convincing about his belief that even limited gains in awareness of how the human brain works still provide AI researchers with some powerful springboards, and that, conversely, advances (or missteps) in AI teach us more about the brain. As he points out in discussing Watson, the IBM computer system that famously won on Jeopardy after acquiring most of its knowledge from scanning natural-language documents (the sampling of questions it got right is impressive), things have already come a long way. And there's no reason to believe that the rapid convergence won't continue, especially in the post-cloud computing world. After all, the specific, idiosyncratic way our monkey-rat-lizard brains were shaped to think as our ancestors crawled/darted/clambered around undoubtedly isn't the only way an evolutionary process can discover thought.There’s also a succinct but informative history of the field of AI, with brief overviews of significant thinkers and developments. And Kurzweil wades a little bit into the philosophy of consciousness, exploring some its more paradoxical aspects in light of what science knows about the human brain. For example, it's been shown that the two cerebral hemispheres, in patients with a severed connection, operate almost as two separate brains. Yet, each one still seems to think it has a conscious link to the other. Maybe such individuals are more like two people in one body, but don't realize it? Eerie, huh? His other thought experiments are nothing new, but still fun. Everyone should know what the Chinese Room is.Finally, there’s a section in which Kurzweil responds to critics, and calls out a few flagrant misunderstandings of his ideas. While it’s debatable how on-target his past predictions about technology have been, as far as I’m concerned, if he was even halfway right, then he’ll be fully right soon enough.Overall, I think I would recommend this book most to AI neophytes who haven’t read anything by Kurzweil before. His enthusiasm for the topic can be quite inspiring. For other readers, especially those who have read On Intelligence, I don’t think you’re missing anything essential. I’d probably give this one 4 stars for the former audience, 2.5 for the latter, 3.5 overall."
6,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33276635-chaunceton-bird,4,"This is a fascinating look into how our brains operate, and how the first synthetic brains have been operating, and will operate as they become more sophisticated (and, eventually, sentient). "
7,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"Kurzweil's book offers an overview of the biological brain and briefly overviews some attempts toward replicating its structure or function inside the computer. He also offers his own high-level ideas that are mostly a restatement of what can already be found in other books (such as Hawkins' On Intelligence) with a few modifications (he admits this himself though at one point, for which he gets bonus points). Finally, he applies his Law Of Accelerating Returns (LOAR) to field of AI and produces some predictions for the future of this field. The good: Nice thought experiments section, nice overview of the biological brain (both old brain/cortex and their function), reasonably ok philosophical mambo jambo parts about consciousness and whether it is possible for a computer to be a mind (if you're into that), some analysis of relevant computational trends. By the end, you're almost convinced we're almost there!The bad: First, his own theories are extremely vague and half-baked (though I forgive this. If he knew more he would be busier with things other than writing this book) and essentially reduce to some form of Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model. That's not especially exciting, I think most researchers in the field will agree on such high-level things. I also find it puzzling that he claims to be talking about the mind in its entirety, but then his exposition focuses almost entirely on temporal modeling/prediction aspects and mostly ignores a lot of other magical components of a mind, such as a flexible and efficient knowledge representation / inference engine, or a reinforcement learning - like actor /critic system that surely exists somewhere at the core of all of our learning and reasoning.All in all, I would recommend this book to anyone who's interested in some pointers to our efforts to replicate a brain in the computer, who wants to learn a bit about the biological brain, or who's into the philosophy of it all."
8,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"Well, I am simply in love with Kurzweil. How could I not be? This was one of the best books on Philosophy of Mind that I could imagine reading. Early on in the book, Kurzweil respectlfully disagreed with Steven Pinker, and imo, setting himself apart from the good genes crew (Dawkins et. al.). He went on to take his lucky reader on a tour of the future of the mind, teaching them about everything that has been done to date to try to create a mind. In 2008, I took a cognitive science class that featured a lot of Kurzweil's work, as well as many other things included in this book. I later took two courses in Philosophy of Mind. All of these courses focused heavily on AI. I loved those classes so very much and this book brought everything flooding back. You will be treated to the role Hidden Markov Models (HHMs) play in speech dictation. In fact, this very book was written not by hand, but was dictated using Dragon Dictation (which is a product of HMMs). Kurzweil also provided his reader with a short but excellent history of Philosophy of Mind by including Jackson's Mary (The Knowledge Argument), Searle's Chinese room, Chalmers zombies, and Dennett's ideas about all of that. I was sad that he didn't include Andy Clark, but even with that oversight, it was one of the best and most relatable summaries of Philosophy of Mind that I have read. He took out the jargon and, instead, made every concept easy enough for a middle schooler to grasp, yet interesting enough for academics.Kurzweil chose the most interesting bits of neuroscience to include in this book, all of which are still exciting in 2016. I can only imagine what I would have felt like if I had read this book in 2012. I would have been blown away. The efforts to create a mind have been ongoing for decades. There is not stopping it, much to the chagrin of many. If you want to be informed about how this process works, read this and Kevin Kelly's The Inevitable. They pair nicely with one another. "
9,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8660033-aaron-thibeault,4,"*A full executive summary of this book is available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2012/11/27...When IBM's Deep Blue defeated humanity's greatest chess player Garry Kasparov in 1997 it marked a major turning point in the progress of artificial intelligence (AI). A still more impressive turning point in AI was achieved in 2011 when another creation of IBM named Watson defeated Jeopardy! phenoms Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter at their own game. As time marches on and technology advances we can easily envision still more impressive feats coming out of AI. And yet when it comes to the prospect of a computer ever actually matching human intelligence in all of its complexity and intricacy, we may find ourselves skeptical that this could ever be fully achieved. There seems to be a fundamental difference between the way a human mind works and the way even the most sophisticated machine works--a qualitative difference that could never be breached. Famous inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil begs to differ.To begin with--despite the richness and complexity of human thought--Kurzweil argues that the underlying principles and neuro-networks that are responsible for higher-order thinking are actually relatively simple, and in fact fully replicable. Indeed, for Kurzweil, our most sophisticated AI machines are already beginning to employ the same principles and are mimicking the same neuro-structures that are present in the human brain.Beginning with the brain, Kurzweil argues that recent advances in neuroscience indicate that the neocortex (whence our higher-level thinking comes) operates according to a sophisticated (though relatively straightforward) pattern recognition scheme. This pattern recognition scheme is hierarchical in nature, such that lower-level patterns representing discrete bits of input (coming in from the surrounding environment) combine to trigger higher-level patterns that represent more general categories that are more abstract in nature. The hierarchical structure is innate, but the specific categories and meta-categories are filled in by way of learning. Also, the direction of information travel is not only from the bottom up, but also from the top down, such that the activation of higher-order patterns can trigger lower-order ones, and there is feedback between the varying levels. (The theory that sees the brain operating in this way is referred to as the Pattern Recognition Theory of the Mind or PRTM).As Kurzweil points out, this pattern recognition scheme is actually remarkably similar to the technology that our most sophisticated AI machines are already using. Indeed, not only are these machines designed to process information in a hierarchical way (just as our brain is), but machines such as Watson (and even Siri, the voice recognition software available on the iPhone), are structured in such a way that they are capable of learning from the environment. For example, Watson was able to modify its software based on the information it gathered from reading the entire Wikipedia file. (The technology that these machines are using is known as the hierarchical hidden Markov model or HHMM, and Kurzweil was himself a part of developing this technology in the 1980's and 1990's.)Given that our AI machines are now running according to the same principles as our brains, and given the exponential rate at which all information-based technologies advance, Kurzweil predicts a time when computers will in fact be capable of matching human thought--right down to having such features as consciousness, identity and free will (Kurzweil's specific prediction here is that this will occur by the year 2029).What's more, because computer technology does not have some of the limitations inherent in biological systems, Kurzweil predicts a time when computers will even vastly outstrip human capabilities. Of course, since we use our tools as a natural extension of ourselves (figuratively, but sometimes also literally), this will also be a time when our own capabilities will vastly outstrip our capabilities of today. Ultimately, Kurzweil thinks, we will simply use the markedly superior computer technology to replace our outdated neurochemistry (as we now replace a limb with a prosthetic), and thus fully merge with our machines (a state that Kurzweil refers to as the singularity). This is the argument that Kurzweil makes in his new book 'How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed'.Kurzweil lays out his arguments very clearly, and he does have a knack for explaining some very difficult concepts in a very simple way. My only objection to the book is that there is a fair bit of repetition, and some of the philosophical arguments (on such things as consciousness, identity and free will) drag on longer than need be. All in all there is much of interest to be learned both about artificial intelligence and neuroscience. A full executive summary of this book is available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2012/11/27... A podcast discussion of the book will be available soon."

The chapter on consciousness offers an amazing discussion of how a computer can (or can’t) replicate a human mind. The author finishes by taking on objections to his ideas. Highly recommended.While the brain has been considered by many to be beyond the scope of comprehension, history is replete with claims of what couldn’t be done. How to Create a Mind offers a thoroughly supported argument for the eventual reverse engineering of the human brain."
11,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5948865-james,4,"Very interesting look at how to create a mind. One of the most fascinating and real world experiences I now better understand is how the Dragon Speech to text engine was created. In the last couple of years, I have been working with dictation applications and the struggles we have had with the tool. You often hear why doesn't it understand what I'm saying. Listening to this book, I now understand how the fundamentals of recognition were constructed and why folks may be struggling. Very interesting and not something I expected to learn from this book. Good insights, Thank you."
12,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12307604,4,"So this was probably the fattest, densest science book I've read this year. As programmer, I want to understand the theory behind the latest advancements in AI/machine-learning, but as a normal human, I'm fascinated by the brain and all these concepts (conscience, identity, mechanics of memory, etc) science hasn't quite figured out.I'll say this about Ray Kurzweil just from reading this book. This guy has been in the field for more than 30 years and is highly respected, and in his writing he comes across as a guy who likes to toot his own horn. I guess it's just normal if you've been in the field for this long, but he loves to refer to his own accomplishments. When he doesn't do that though, his line of argumentation is very convincing, and the model he puts forward in the beginning of the book, the hierarchical model of pattern recognition (turtles all the way down) was quite revelatory for me personally. I don't know if it's his theory, but no matter. This model answers quite a lot of questions I've asked myself and stirred me to form deeper, more involved lines of thought, so for that this book is already worth it.I hear that there's criticism of this theory, as you'd expect, but for a layman it's a good starting point to get into the subject matter.After that, the book moves towards more philosophical stuff. It's thought provoking, sure, but a lot of it wasn't that groundbreaking to me, though still enjoyable. I'll say the best bits are in the first half for sure. The last chapter is just him refuting some guy who once criticized an essay of Kurzweil and it was jarring how petty it felt. He literally went over a bunch of arguments that person wrote that they didn't agree with in Kurzweil's essay and refuted them, and put that in print (I presume, I'm reading the ebook version). The last chapter feels utterly unnecessary and just underlined my impression that Kurzweil is a bit of a twat haha"
13,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/927546-rachel-williams,4,"I had always dismissed Kurzweil's theories about ""strong"" artificial intelligence to be wishful thinking but this book changed my mind. I'm not quite as optimistic about scaling things up to human adult levels, but reading this book gave me new found respect for his ideas and the evidence and theories he uses to back them up. I had no idea how powerful ""hidden Markov models"" are for solving problems, and Kurzweil makes a good argument that neocortical pattern recognition (essentially a form of probabilistic prediction making) is computationally approximate enough to these hidden Markov models that, if you put 300 billion such pattern recognizers and gave it the entire internet to ""grow up"" in, then you could create a reasonable approximation of the intelligence worth wanting: categorizing pattern recognizing problem solvers with huge memories and lightning speed. Also, when Kurzweil delved into heady philosophical territory he held himself fairly well and exposed many of the fallacious and sadly misinformed criticisms of his views, many I once held myself due to lack of familiarity with what his views actually amount to, which are more modest than his vocal popularizers would have you believe. Granted, this is the only book of his I have read, so I can't pretend to stand behind all his ideas, but the AI stuff in this book seemed solid to me. His view of an ""intelligent mind"" is really a modified form of Jeff Hawkin's thoery of neocortical intelligence as a giant massively redudundant, hierarchical, recursive, and self-learning memory-prediction machine.4/5 stars."
14,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10635083-john-patterson,5,"In How to Create a Mind, Ray Kurzweil argues that the human mind is composed of hierarchy of pattern recognizer that uses a statistical model to learn, store, and retrieve information. He then goes on to argue about how this model can be used to develop artificially intelligent machines. He argues that in fact huge strides have been made towards this goal in such machines as Watson (the computer that handily defeated Ken Jennings at Jeopardy!)This may seem dry, but this book has engaged my imagination in ways that few novels have. He finishes with the philosophical and social implications that such advances in technology could have and addresses potential objections to his arguments. I found myself stopping on occasion to reflect on what I have read. Highly recommended for those interested in cognitive psychology or in artificial intelligence."
15,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4975321-joseph,4,"I consider myself a singularity skeptic, and I'm definitely not convinced by Kurzweil's so-called ""Law of Accelerating Returns"", but starry-eyed idealism about the future aside, this book is quite well-reasoned and well-argued. I've seen firsthand how deep learning applications can deliver some pretty amazing results, and it's hardly a stretch to say that can only get better faster as long as Moore's Law holds (which could end tomorrow or a century from now).But honestly what surprised me the most out of this book was how willing Kurzweil was to grapple with philosophical issues, as opposed to merely technical ones. Though I seem to recall he once or twice attributed quotes or ideas to the wrong people, the ideas were fully formed, and highly relevant. I've definitely reevaluated my opinion of Kurzweil, and I think I'll check out his other stuff."
16,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9795663-rodan,5,"As my friends well know, a great deal of my neocortex is dedicated to pattern recognition in search of ways to prevent the robot apocalypse. Kurzweil paints a bright picture over a frightening future where humans and computer minds blur and robots overtake the world. When the Kurzweiltron 3000 (controlled by a copy of Ray's consciousness) has been destroyed and I stand on top of a pile of mangled rivets and torn metal, I'll rip the neocortex extender out of my forehead (allowing my amygdala let me feel feelings again) and shout ""Kurzweil, you magnificent bastard, I read your book!"""
17,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87751-rachel,1,"The thing about fiction is that I accept errors or lack of reference as long as the story is interesting. In nonfiction, I need all of those elements there. So, when you're completely ripping off Plato, maybe you should give him a hat tip (and not just vaguely 100 pages later about an entirely different topic)."
18,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44289250-robert-martin,4,"A fascinating weave of neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and the philosophy of mind.Kurzweil presents the pattern recognition theory of mind (PRTM), which holds that the fundamental unit of computation in the brain is a group of ~100 neurons in the neocortex that recognises a pattern. The clever part is that these patterns can exist within arbitrarily complex hierarchies, containing ""pointers"" to other patterns, and feeding input/output to both sub-patterns and parents. It's a nice theory and seems to explain some empirical findings in neuroscience, though I would defer to a domain expert to comment more on that. Some of his arguments seem quite suspicious: for example, he often justifies his view of how the brain works by implementing the procedure on a computer – if it works on a computer, that is likely how it works in the brain. The second half of the book is somewhat disorganised, covering the whole gamut of standard topics within the philosophy of mind: computation, consciousness, free will, identity, etc. Nevertheless, it's a highly accessible introduction containing plenty of references to famous thought experiments and philosophical writings. The chapter relating to the ""Law of Accelerating Returns"" is scary. Due to the linear nature of our neocortices, humans consistently misunderstand exponential growth trends. As a result, the future will come much faster than people realise. Kurzweil convincingly argues that within the next twenty years, we will have reached the singularity and that by the end of this century, cybernetic enhancements will be the norm. Well worth a read if you are interested in neuroscience, AI, philosophy, or futurism. This book is an excellent complement to sci-fi books dealing with uploading consciousness (e.g Ubik, Greg Egan's short stories) – which may not be fiction for much longer!"
19,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8527195-alex,4,"This book was fascinating and mildly terrifying. Kurzweil's main point is the Pattern Recognition Theory of Mind: that idea the human brain is nothing more than a series of pattern recognizers and mechanisms for interpreting and acting on those patterns. The suggestion that all of a human's experience (yes, including consciousness) can be reduced to and explained by such a system, and the subsequent implication that this system can be modeled with machines, is depressing, if not a little insulting. But it's tough to argue with.Kurzweil does a decent job of explaining complex concepts in a way that is somewhat understandable by the layperson, although I'm not convinced that it was necessary to provide explanations - even simplified ones - of every topic introduced (yes, it was cool to feel like I understood vector quantization, but no, it was not necessary for my understanding of the book overall). Additionally, while I appreciated the discussion of consciousness near the end of the book (I was worried he would conveniently avoid the topic), it was overly philosophical and dense - I needed multiple sittings to get through chapter 9.I'm also glad Kurzweil addressed (successfully, in my opinion) objections to his theories and predictions (although it was a little awkward for him to call out Paul Allen all over the place - I think he could have made his points without naming any names). This book was well-organized and certainly comprehensive, and it has made me welcome the idea of one day becoming a cyborg."
20,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49372463-ryan-kirk,4,"This was a fascinating book.I've never thought about combining a biological examination of the neocortex, the study of language recognition (and speech recognition), the development of Artificial Intelligence, and a dive into some of the trickier questions of consciousness, free will, and identity.Yet, that is exactly what Kurzweil does in this book.His arguments regarding the functioning of the human mind, and our attempts to mimic and improve upon those processes are compelling, even if at the time of writing proof was lacking in some areas.I'm not always a fan of Kurzweil. He spends a lot of time talking about himself and his own experiences in the field of AI. In some cases, I feel it's appropriate: He has done incredible work. Moreover, it does make it clear that in many cases in the book, Kurzweil his sharing his opinions and not facts.But there are places where it becomes unnecessary. A whole chapter is dedicated to objections, not necessarily focused on the topic at hand, but on articles written against his theories. Likewise, I'm aware he has an excellent track record at prediction. I don't need to hear about it again.I'd very much recommend this book for people looking to get a background in AI, or even human cognition. Particularly recommended for those interested in how the two intersect."

After decades of being together, a virtual other exists in the neocortex such that we can anticipate every step of what our lover will say and do. Our neocortical patterns are filled with the thoughts and patterns that reflect who they are. When we lose that person, we literally lose part of ourselves. This is not just a metaphor—all of the vast pattern recognizers that are filled with the patterns reflecting the person we love suddenly change their nature. Although they can be considered a precious way to keep that person alive within ourselves, the vast neocortical patterns of a lost loved one turn suddenly from triggers of delight to triggers of mourning.Tell me if this is not the best definition of love you've ever read."

He proposes a basic structure comprised of several neurons that accounts for all learning in the brain. He then explains how he thinks we will be able to simulate this structure using computers and eventually create machines who can think and even be deemed conscious. Some of his claims might be wild, but they definitely spark curiosity and open the reader's mind to a world that might look very very different in a few years."
23,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64425508-jan-sp-rer,4,"These are my key takeaways from the book.-Kurzweil emphasizes a nonstandard approach of brain modeling that is close to current neurological research and less related to the latest deep learning model designs. One will not find elaborations on the latest LSTMs or other “hot topics” in the book. Kurzweil wants to take a top-down approach and model the brain as realistically as possible. He goes into depth about how the brain is physically wired, how many neurons are in individual sections, how large these sections are, how many sections there are, and how they are connected. For example, Kurzweil says that the main learning comes not from inter-neuron connections (individual neurons that flexibly attach themselves to each other) but from inter-section connections of neuron clusters with about 100 neurons each. Kurzweil also explicitly states that he follows a multi-disciplinary approach. (pp. 115-116) As I have a computer science background, the book seemed to lack technical solidness at first, but this was because of my stereotypes about what a book about the mind should be like.-Evolution led to increasing abstraction. While physics was the first relevant field of study, chemistry became relevant when molecules formed from atoms. Then DNA evolved, making biology a useful field of study. Then neurology comes into focus as we travel down the evolutionary history. (p. 2)-The mammalian brain is capable of hierarchical thinking by using the neocortex. (pp. 2-3)-Brain Architecture: The neocortex is complex from the outside, but it is built with significant redundancy, making its design less complex than expected. This is due to repeating (hierarchical) patterns. (p. 11) “There are about a half million cortical columns in a human neocortex, each occupying a space about two millimeters high and a half millimeter wide and containing about 60,000 neurons (resulting in a total of about 30 billion neurons in the neocortex). A rough estimate is that each pattern recognizer within a cortical column contains about 100 neurons, so there are on the order of 300 million pattern recognizers in total in the neocortex.” (p. 38) Kurzweil states that there are about 10e15 connections in the neocortex, but they only take up 25m bytes of information in the genome (after lossless compression) (p. 90), while most of these 25m bytes constitute biological information (p. 155). A human brain is estimated (by Kurzweil) to be able to recognize a low 8-digit number of patterns. (p. 40) A neocortical pattern recognition module consists of: Dendrites that send signals in and out. Axon (output), expected pattern (signal from above), size parameter, weight, expected variability of the lower-level pattern, Inhibitory signals from above, inhibitory signals from below. (pp. 42, 66-68) Kurzweil’s description of the hierarchical nature of the pattern recognition design reminds of convolutional neural networks. (pp. 43-47) Language is just one higher-level pattern in our brain. Our thoughts are not necessarily in language format and need to be converted into this higher level. (p. 56) Kurzweil citing Donald Hebb: “When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A’s efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased.” (p. 80) “The central assumption in Hebb’s theory is that the basic unit of learning in the neocortex is the neuron. The pattern recognition theory of mind that I articulate in this book is based on a different fundamental unit: not the neuron itself, but rather an assembly of neurons, which I estimate to number around a hundred. The wiring and synaptic strength within each unit are relatively stable and determined genetically--that is, the organization within each pattern recognition module is determined by genetic design. Learning takes place in the creation of connections between these units, not within them, and probably in the synaptic strengths of those interunit connections.” (p. 80) The brain’s physical structure is 2D, not 3D. (p. 82) Kurzweil compares neocortex modules to FPGAs. (p. 83) “The brain does not have sufficient flexibility so that each neocortical pattern recognition module can simply link to any other module… an actual physical connection must be made, composed of an axon connecting to a dendrite.” (p. 90) “Signals go up and down the conceptual hierarchy. A signal going up means, “I’ve detected a pattern.” A signal going down means, “I’m expecting a pattern to occur,” and is essentially a prediction. Both upward and downward signals can be either excitatory or inhibitory.” (p. 91) The optic nerve carries only ten to twelve output channels, each which only limited information. For example, one channel is responsible for detecting edges. (pp. 94-95) This sparse coding makes sure that the neocortex is not overwhelmed. (pp. 95-96) The brain is slow, but parallel. (p. 195) Today’s computers are at least 10m times faster than a brain. But the overall memory and throughput requirements of the brain are immense. (p. 195)-Hippocampus: Each side of the brain has one hippocampus. The hippocampus can remember novel events. If the neocortex sees unknown patterns, it will forward them to the hippocampus. The hippocampus then creates pointers to the neocortex. (p. 101) The hippocampus enables the short-term memory of the brain. It plays the memory sequence to the neocortex over and over again and thereby forms long-term memories. (p. 102)-Movement is controlled by the cerebellum and the neocortex, whereby the neocortex has taken over most functions from the “old” cerebellum. (p. 103) -“Finding a metaphor is the process of recognizing a pattern despite differences in detail and context--an activity we undertake trivially every moment of our lives.” (p. 115)-Similar to Elon Musk (maybe he got this idea from Kurzweil?), Kurzweil argues that the devices we use today are already extensions of the brain and we will soon interface our brains with technical devices via direct neural connections. (pp. 116-117)-The main contribution of the neocortex is that it sped up the process of learning. Complex learning is no longer only possible over many generations, but also within the lifespan of a single entity. (p. 122)-There are already brain scans that allow scientists to follow individual connections through the brain and attempts to fully simulate regions of the brain or even the whole brain. (pp. 129-130) For full brain emulation, one needs scanning, translation, and simulation. (p. 130) The Cyc project aims to aggregate all commonsense knowledge. (pp. 162)-Vector quantization is a way to preprocess visual information, arguably similar to how optic information is preprocessing information by the brain. (pp. 138-141)-Kurzweil strongly advocates the use of hidden Markov models to simulate how different layers (pattern recognizers) interact. (p. 143) “Today, the HHMM together with its mathematical cousins makes up a major portion of the world of AI.” (p. 155) Evolutionary genetic algorithms could be used to determine hyperparameters of pattern recognizers. (p. 147) Watson uses UIMA (unstructured information management architecture) to bundle the intelligence of its hundreds of subsystems. The special element of Watson’s design is that subsystems can contribute without providing a definite answer. The subsystems can also help to narrow down the answer. The subsystems consist of hidden Markov model variants,rule-based approaches, and other models. (pp. 167-168) “Neuromorphic” chips and similar approaches to simulate the behavior of brains’ parts can be more efficient than emulating the brain only with software. (p. 195)-LISP was popular in the AI community of the 70s and 80s because of the hierarchical nature that it supported. The elements of a LISP list can store other lists and even allow for recursion. (p. 154)-Rule-based systems can help to allow a system to be learned on-the-fly (self-labeling). Complex models usually take much data to be accurate while rule-based systems do not. A combination of statistical and rule-based systems leads to an optimized learning curve. (pp. 164-165)-One of the key differences that I found when comparing Kurzweil’s architecture to today’s state-of-the-art deep learning is that pattern recognizers (which are roughly comparable to neural network layers, I would say), do not just feed forward, but also backward. They feed backward and confirm that the pattern is “expected”. (p. 173)-Ideas that Kurzweil proposes to add to an artificial brain: A critical thinking module which would perform a continual background scan that would revolve cognitive contradictions. Unlike humans, the AI could then avoid holding conflicting views. Also, he would add a module that identifies open questions in each field and would search for answers in other fields. Another background process would be metaphor search. (pp. 176-177)-”Simply repeating information is the easiest way to achieve arbitrarily high accuracy rates from low-accuracy channels, but it is not the most efficient approach. Shannon’s paper, which established the field of information theory, presented optimal methods of error detection and correction codes that can achieve any target accuracy through any nonrandom channel.” (p. 184) The brain uses Shannon’s principle too (redundancy). (p. 185) The left and the right brain are to a large part redundant. A human can often function reasonably well after one side of the brain is removed. (pp. 224-225) Each side of a human brain is probably conscious by itself. (p. 227)-Predictions: Kurzweil predicts that there will be the first artificial humans in 2029 and become “routine” in the 2030s. (p. 210) If one were to clone a person into a robot so that this robot would be a 100% perfect emulation of the person, we would probably accept this robot to be an independent entity. But we would also say that this robot is not exactly this person, it is a clone. Now if we take the same person and gradually replace all of its brain and other organs, while keeping its self-awareness at all times, until it becomes fully artificial, we would probably say that this is still the same person. But this is contradictory if the second robot is exactly the same robot as the first (cloned) robot. The human body also gradually replaces itself (replacement of cells and molecules within the cells). (pp. 242-245) People will replace their organs more and more until their thinking will completely be in the cloud. (p. 247) Exponential growth (of computing power) will continue. Our current circuit technology (and the associated paradigm Moore’s law) will be replaced by another breakthrough paradigm that resolves the current limitations of circuits. (p. 255) The final limit to the physics of computation will probably be reached by the end of the century. This limit is defined by molecular computing. We still have a trillion-fold increase to go until we reach this limit. (p. 256) It is not true that only hardware is improving: Professor Martin Grötschel of the Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum für Informationstechnik Berlin observed that for a particular linear programming algorithm, the efficiency between 1988 and 2003 improved by a factor 1,000 due to hardware and by another 43,000 due to better software. (p. 269) The scientist’s pessimism seems to be present for a long time among the computer scientist community. The progress that CPUs made over the last decades was not seen as possible by many people back then. (p. 272) Kurzweil thinks that the question of whether we can break the speed of light will be a key question at the beginning of the twenty-second century as this will determine how quickly we can expand in the universe. (p. 281)-Some of the intelligent machines that we will build may not behave humanlike, but may still be “conscious”. (p. 213) Entities that are not convincingly conscious or do not even try to be could still be conscious. (p. 215)-Wittgenstein first proposed that the discussion about consciousness is circular, but the newer writings by Wittgenstein say that this discussion is really important. (pp. 220-221)-Freedom of will: Vilayanur Subramanian Ramachandran says that “free won’t” is a better term. Actions are already prepared unconsciously. Sometimes, the human can stop the action. But action does not normally form purely consciously. (p. 230) Wolfram says that the universe is deterministic, but we cannot have enough computing power to compute the future. Therefore, it is not really deterministic for us. (p. 239)"

25,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,4,"This book focuses on two of the author's pet theories:1. The Law of Accelerating Returns (LOAR)
An evolutionary process inherently accelerates, as a result of its increasing levels of abstraction, and that its products grow exponentially in complexity and capability.
This is strait out of his last book, and refers to things like Moor's Law, and how the price drops when you mass produce something.What chronically Kurzweil fails to realize is that these returns are only exponential for a time. In the case of an invasive species, the population increases exponentially, until it fills up the new environment. In the case of Moor's Law, computing gets smaller until it hits the atomic limit. In the case of factories, eventually, supply is great enough that demand drops off, and a stable, low price is arrived at.He even says, ""no other species has been able to achieve this"" in reference to the kind of LOAR-driven growth human industry has achieved. But, being a uniquely human achievement contradicts his grandiose claim that this is a ""universal law"" and that it applies to all ""evolutionary processes"".Thankfully, he moves on from this failed idea to a more interesting one.2. Pattern Recognition Theory of Mind (PRTM)
It is the neocortex, after all, that has been responsible for every novel, every song, every painting, and the multifarious other products of human thought.
His core claim is that the human brain (the frontal cortex, in particular) is simple, and uses same rule (or repeated, fractal structure) over and over. Basically, he proposes that miniature cortical columns are basic unit of pattern recognition in the brain. Wired together into a hierarchy, these account for the properties of mind.Things start to get surreal when he talks about a hypothetical neuron that represent the pattern match for a high level concept, like the letter A. This happens not to be the way the brain is organized, as seen by laboratory studies.But, there's lots of talk about brain simulators, AI, natural language processors, LISP, computer resources needed to simulate human brain, etc. which is all sort of interesting.He gives a good explanation and demystification of the philosophical idea of qualia.He talks a lot about another (strictly) philosophical idea: consciousness. He dismisses the ""grand illusion of consciousness"" as fundamentally unscientific. Lee Smolin should have a look at this chapter!In one of my favorite chapters, Kurzweil proposes a thought experiment. First, consider that I make a robotic duplicate of your brain and body, then kill the original. Unsettling, right? But what if I gradually replace one neuron at a time with a synthetic, functional equivalent? He proposes that this would be much easier for people to accept, even though the end result is the same. I see this as a question of whether you want to sink slowly into the cold water, or jump in. There's no contradiction; both options are different in experience but have the (superficially) the same final outcome. This reminds me a lot of Permutation City by Greg Egan.While this book is a lot more acceptable his previous books, it still contains an awful lot of beleaguered pontification.
Evolution also moves toward greater complexity, greater knowledge, greater intelligence, greater beauty, greater creativity, and the ability to express more transcendent emotions, such as love.
He actually talks as if humanity is the ""purpose"" or ""goal"" of evolution! Its the rambling that gets him into trouble. Maybe not the best job of editing, in this book."

This book describes current theory about how the brain functions cognitively, and how a computer might be designed to mimic its operation and abilities while doing away with the brain’s shortcomings such as unreliable recall, inconsistency, self-deception, and memory loss. Speculatively, the book persuasively projects a future in which human intelligence — whose technological evolution, starting with language, has already far outstripped its biological evolution — will transcend its flesh-and-blood incarnation.The book is logically organized. It requires basic scientific literacy, and now and again gets into technical detail that can be challenging, while notes at the end provide additional technical information for those who want it. The writing is clear if occasionally plodding and repetitive. The voice is authoritatively knowledgeable; the author has been at the forefront of such research for decades. The tone is excitement over the subject matter and the author’s personal involvement in the field. He explains the material, which is fascinating, very well, but the businesslike, rather impersonal approach doesn’t add that extra dimension of engagement encountered in the best nonfiction writing. The book is certainly a memorable learning experience but not a memorable reading experience. Nevertheless, it’s very worthwhile for anyone interested in the field. I’d give it 4.5 stars if this site’s software were sufficiently evolved to deal with it."

As the book went on, Kurzweil dug deeeper into the working brain at an evermore abstract, complicated and very confusing way, to try to dumb down and simplify how the human brain works. This is where the book breaks down. The material gets repetitive and twisted within its own complexities, to the point of misunderstanding and boredom. I was fine with the fact that the book is not entertaining, but when it became uninformative, I dropped it."

Our memories are stored as sequences of patterns. Memories that are not accessed dim over time.  	 The human mind is capable of recognizing patterns even if they are altered: ""This represents a key strength of human perception: We can recognize a pattern even if only part of it is perceived (seen, heard, felt) and even if it contains alterations. Our recognition ability is apparently able to detect invariant features of a pattern—characteristics that survive real-world variations.""  	 We are constantly predicting the future and hypothesizing what we will experience.  	 Unused pattern recognizers (the authors thinks that our mind contains about 300 million of them) get reassigned to other more-used pattern recognizers:  ""That is why memories grow dimmer with time: The amount of redundancy becomes reduced until certain memories become extinct.""  	 DNA doesn't determines how the neuronal connections work:  ""There are on the order of a quadrillion (1015) connections in the neocortex, yet only about 25 million bytes of design information in the genome (after lossless compression), so the connections themselves cannot possibly be predetermined genetically. It is possible that some of this learning is the product of the neocortex’s interrogating the old brain, but that still would necessarily represent only a relatively small amount of information. The connections between modules are created on the whole from experience (nurture rather than nature).""  	 Four items of working memory at a time:  ""We are apparently able to keep up to about four items in our working memory at a time, two per hemisphere according to recent research by neuroscientists at the MIT Picower Institute for Learning and Memory.6 The issue of whether the thalamus is in charge of the neocortex or vice versa is far from clear, but we are unable to function without both.""  	 The brain is wired to seek novelty:  ""Each brain hemisphere contains a hippocampus, a small region that looks like a sea horse tucked in the medial temporal lobe. Its primary function is to remember novel events. Since sensory information flows through the neocortex, it is up to the neocortex to determine that an experience is novel in order to present it to the hippocampus. It does so either by failing to recognize a particular set of features (for example, a new face) or by realizing that an otherwise familiar situation now has unique attributes (such as your spouse’s wearing a fake mustache).""  	 There is a struggle between the old reptilian brain and the neocortex, but the neocortex has the last say:  ""There is a continual struggle in the human brain as to whether the old or the new brain is in charge. The old brain tries to set the agenda with its control of pleasure and fear experiences, whereas the new brain is continually trying to understand the relatively primitive algorithms of the old brain and seeking to manipulate it to its own agenda. Keep in mind that the amygdala is unable to evaluate danger on its own—in the human brain it relies on the neocortex to make those judgments. Is that person a friend or a foe, a lover or a threat? Only the neocortex can decide.""  	 There are medical cases in which a hemisphere was removed from a  patient's brain and the patient continued to function properly (and even to have an above average IQ):  ""While these observations certainly support the idea of plasticity in the neocortex, their more interesting implication is that we each appear to have two brains, not one, and we can do pretty well with either. If we lose one, we do lose the cortical patterns that are uniquely stored there, but each brain is in itself fairly complete. So does each hemisphere have its own consciousness? There is an argument to be made that such is the case. ""  	 Ultimately most of our thinking will be in the cloud:  ""What I believe will actually happen is that we will continue on the path of the gradual replacement and augmentation scenario until ultimately most of our thinking will be in the cloud.""Also posted on: My Blog"

33,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16469107-fred-beshears,5,"In this book, Kurzweil develops what he calls a Pattern Recognition Theory of Mind (PRTM). He argues that the human neocortex is actually far less complex than one might think. Citing Vernon Mountcastle's work in 1957, Kurzweil describes the neocortex as having a ""remarkably unvarying organization ... composed of a single mechanism that [is] repeated over and over again"" (p. 36). According to the PRTM, the neocortex consists of around 300 million pattern processors that are, in turn, composed of around 100 neurons each. Each pattern processor can do a number of things with a pattern: ""learn it, predict it (including parts of it), recognize it, and implement it (either by thinking about it further or through a patten of physical movements)"" (p. 40-41).The patterns recognized by pattern processors are organized in hierarchies. Each pattern is composed of three parts: 1) the input from lower-level patterns or sense organs, 2) the pattern's name, which in the neocortex would be the axon that emerges from each pattern processor (when this axon fires the pattern has been recognized), and 3) the set of higher-level patterns that the lower level pattern is a part of (when a pattern processor's axon fires the message is received by dendrites in the neurons that make up the higher level patterns.Kurzweil's former company (Kurzweil Computer Products now known as Nuance Speech Technologies) has developed software based on a Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HHMM) to simulate the behavior of the neocortex. His in company - Patterns Inc. - is continuing this work. (Note: Kurzweil has been hire by Google to be their Chief Technology Officer.)Kurzweil admits that in many ways his HHMM software resembles the Hierarchical Temporal Model (HTM) developed by Jeff Hawkins and Dileep George (and sold by their company Numenta), which is described in On Intelligence. Kurzweil points out some technical differences between the two models (p. 73), which will probably not impress the lay reader.What may impress the lay reader is that these relatively new approaches to machine learning are now being incorporated in natural language understanding systems such as IBM's Watson system with impressive results. Watson beat the world's best human Jeopardy! players. Furthermore, Nuance Speech Technologies is now working with IBM on a new version of Watson ""that will read medical literature (essentially all medical journals and leading medical blogs) to become a master diagnostician and medical consultant"" (p. 6-7).In addition to his technical discussion of HHMM and PRTM, Kurzweil also returns to the themes he introduced in The Singularity is Near. In that work he develops the case for his Law of Accelerating Returns (LOAR), which is itself based on Moore's Law, which predicts that computer clock speeds and memory capacity will double about every two years. In How to Create a Mind, Kurzweil sticks with is prediction that a computer will pass the Turing Simulation test by 2029 and that a technological Singularity will come into being by 2045. The former is the point when a computer masters natural language to the extent that human judges will not be able to distinguish text messages they exchange with it from those they exchange with a human. According to Kurzweil, a technological Singularity is the point at which humans transcend biological evolution and computers attain a level of intelligence that far surpasses that of unenhanced human intelligence.In How to create a Mind, Kurzweil gives some additional details on how human intelligence might merge with machine intelligence. According to PRTM, unenhanced humans have around 300 million pattern processors. But, according to Kurzweil, by 2045 brain-computer interfaces will come into being which will enable enhanced humans to do ""most of their thinking"" in the cloud. So, instead of having 300 million pattern recognizers to work with, enhanced humans could have many times that number (why not a trillion or more pattern recognizers). Also, it's likely that enhanced humans would be able to acquire new knowledge and skills with out having to learn by traditional means - i.e. from direct experience, books, lectures, etc. In other words, when humans are able to do most of their thinking in the cloud, perhaps all the knowledge that exists in today's libraries will already have been read into some future version of Watson and directly accessible via the brain-computer interface or in some shared set of pattern recognizers.So it would appear that in Kurzweil's view of the post-Singularity world, schools may still exist, but their enrollment may consist mostly to those humans who do not wish to be enhanced. Of course, trying to predict what a post-Singularity world might be like is almost a contradiction in terms since for some the term Singularity is the point at which technological change becomes so immense that making predictions past that point becomes impossible.Nevertheless, I for one can't resist at least on speculation on what some of the issues might be for those who live past 2045 (assuming Kurzweil's prediction is correct). One issue that will probably come up is the relationship between personal identity and death. Many transhumanists believe that immortality will become an option in a post-singularity world, especially if enhanced humans are able to spread out into space. Many transhumanists also believe that ultra-intelligence will also become an option for enhanced humans. In a post-Singularity world a millionaire may not be someone with a net worth of a million dollars; instead we might be referring to someone with an IQ of over a million. But what would it mean to one's identity if one's IQ went from something in the neighborhood of 100 to a million. Also, what would happen to one's identity if one received a brain-computer implant that gave you the knowledge and insight of reading and understanding all the books in all the libraries. My guess is that the old you would still be there in the sense that you could remember events from your pre-enhanced life. But the new you would be a very different individual indeed. Therefore, you may get to live forever, but it may come at the cost of your former, unenhanced identity."

He gives a short outline of how his HHHMM (Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models) has made his speech recognition software so successful. Some chapters are spent going back and forth trying to prove how an artificially created 'mind' could be considered as valid as human. Towards the end he mentions some interesting topics such the philosophy of consciousness, identity, free will etc finishing by applying his Law Of Accelerating Returns (LOAR) to the field of AI in order to provide some predictions for the future of this field.The title and summary of the book raised my expectations into believing that this book is going to start with a baseline of human brain genetics and organic structures, mutations, replicating feelings or discussing topics such as whole brain emulation, robotoids, synthetic telepathy but none of these topics were covered."

45,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73029907-cav,4,"This was a really fascinating book. Kurzweil lays out a few really interesting theories here; including his ""Law of Accelerating Returns"", as well as his theory of mind: ""Pattern Recognition Theory of Mind (PRTM)"", that I found to be particularly thought-provoking. Kurzweil is attempting to reverse-engineer the brain; human intelligence and consciousness.This book is part of that story.
Law Of Accelerating Returns:

""...Kurzweil, after Moravec,Moore's Law to describe exponential growth of diverse forms of technological progress. Whenever a technology approaches some kind of a barrier, according to Kurzweil, a new technology will be invented to allow us to cross that barrier. He cites numerous past examples of this to substantiate his assertions. He predicts that such paradigm shifts have and will continue to become increasingly common, leading to ""technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history."" He believes the Law of Accelerating Returns implies that a technological singularity will occur before the end of the 21st century, around 2045.""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceler...
Pattern Recognition Theory of Mind (PRTM):

""Kurzweil describes a series of thought experiments which suggest to him that the brain contains a hierarchy of pattern recognizers. Based on this he introduces his Pattern Recognition Theory of Mind (PRTM). He says the neocortex contains 300 million very general pattern recognition circuits and argues that they are responsible for most aspects of human thought. He also suggests that the brain is a ""recursive probabilistic fractal"" whose line of code is represented within the 30-100 million bytes of compressed code in the genome.Kurzweil then explains that a computer version of this design could be used to create an artificial intelligence more capable than the human brain. It would employ techniques such as hidden Markov models and genetic algorithms, strategies Kurzweil used successfully in his years as a commercial developer of speech recognition software. Artificial brains will require massive computational power, so Kurzweil reviews his law of accelerating returns which explains how the compounding effects of exponential growth will deliver the necessary hardware in only a few decades.""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_...Pattern-seeking and recognition is a fundamental piece of architecture of the human mind, and Kurzweil examines this in-depth in the book.The start and subsequent ~50-75 pages was super-interesting, as was the later ~50-75 pages. I found the middle of the book to be a bit arduous, dry and esoteric, though. Maybe it's a subjective thing, as I imagine detail-oriented people in the field of AI would appreciate his attentions here. He talks about how micro-robots and other mechanical biotech will gradually supplant our own biology near the end of the book, which I would largely agree with.I found this quote near the end of the book to be particularly noteworthy:
 ""After lossless compression, due to massive redundancy in the genome, the amount of design information in the human genome is about 50 million bytes, roughly half of which (around 25 million bytes) pertains to the brain.That's not simple, but it's a level of complexity we can deal with. It represents less complexity than many software systems in the modern world.""
Overall I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in AI, or the neuroanatomy of the brain in general. Kurzweil is a brilliant mind, and this book reflects that."
46,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174365-kurtbg,2,"This book makes an attempt at documenting how to recreate a human mind with technology. I was let down by this book. Perhaps it was too early to write the book. Other of Kurzweil books come off as just trying to be the first to document the idea. The structure and presentation of this book seems to support that premise.First off, there's the definition of the word 'mind.' it's a word made up by humans to describe a phenomena real or not. For a scientific approach you define it then move forward. Some chapters are spent going back and forth trying to prove how an artificially created 'mind' could be considered as valid as human. I wasn't looking for a wordplay book, but the author does the same thing with the words 'soul', 'freewill', and 'sentient/conscious.' I wasn't so interested in a proof of whether an AI representation of a mind would be considered a valid entity on par with a human. My thoughts: it's not, because whatever is electronically stored can be copied ad infinitum. It is a machine. A human body is not easily copied (even 1000 years from now) and is singularly irreplaceable.I think the author gets caught up in the representations.Onto creating a brain. The question is, do you want to build an AI replica of the human brain, or do you want to create an AI entity that can process and think like a human brain?Computers (hardware and software) are representations that store, process and act on inputs. A human brain does the same thing, but with organic structures, chemicals. Understandings in both sides can be used to build upon. The abstract concepts are the key here. What does a brain do and how does it do it? From there you go with whats feasible. Does a AI version need an equivalent of two hemispheres? why not four? It really doesn't matter. What does matter are areas of function and their interconnectivity.To build a replica of a human brain you would need to start witha baseline which is the genetics and organic structures of a human brain. This would include mutations, and potentially defects. Next there would need to be an impetus for that life form. Humans are driven by impetus which defines how they look at the world, what drives actions, and what drives learning.Humans have fears, survival mechanisms, ego, etc this drives knowledge accumulation. A similar impetus would be needed for an AI brain more than just a single purpose like playing chess, recognizing speech, or answering questions from the television show, Jeopardy.Next would be the interconnection of stimuli, their storage, weighting, retrieval and associations. The brain stores visual separate from the written and aural. Would you structure an AI mind similarly? What about smells, touch, temperature, deja vu etc?None of the above was discussed. Instead, there's a lot of talk on his previous works, shout-outs to his companies, patents, books, etc.A later chapter covers how he's a predictor of the future. He provides graphs showing, that if you historically document achievement you can identify - trends. Surprise! Can anyone do that? He also takes a section for some smackdown against a paper Paul Allen from Microsoft critiqued him. That doesn't really push the advancement of creating an AI initiative forward.Anyways, perhaps the book was too early for its time. I'd like to see a much better, and scientific book written on how to create an artificial intelligence."
47,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2153061-jewce,5,"One of the most brilliant and intriguing books I've ever read. He covers many of the new things we have learned about the brain in recent years and he ties it together with the latest developments in computer technology. His briefing on these topics alone make this well worth reading. The other half of the book extends these ideas into the realm of exponential future possibilities and the philosophical implications, which I found equally as riveting. He covers a lot of ground in a short space, so there are endless things to mull over. For one example: his recurring premise that the brain is not as impossible to study as we have always assumed is one of the real eye-openers for me. Another example: the mathematician's postulation on free will, complete with a little graph, is pretty startling too.Kurzweil lays out a straightforward and strong case , but the conclusions are so futuristic that anyone would be incredulous if starting with the predictions without thoroughly reading the reasons for the predictions. It would be like if you went back in time one hundred years ago and told people there would be smart phones soon. Most reasonable people would think you were crazy, or at the very least your time frame was much too optimistic. And if you told them we'd all be using these things to mostly look at cat pics and talk smack to each other... they'd actually probably believe that.I think if our present technological trajectory continues then Kurzweil is going to be more or less right about his predictions. That said, there are a lot of ""black swan"" type of catastrophes that no one can predict that could interrupt that trajectory. The ending of the book has the problem that a lot of great books have. An author often spends many hundreds of pages crafting an excellent book, and then apparently gets tired and wraps the ending up in just a couple pages. After a succinct but thorough explanation of every step of his reasoning, he ends the book with just one extremely optimistic scenario of the long-term outcome of all this tech progress. Granted, exploring all the possibilities post-singularity is fodder for plenty of other entire books, and really gets into the arena of pure speculation. But still, a normal guy like me immediately came up with several other obvious possible outcomes, some of them complete doomsday scenarios. I mean... it would be like envisioning a future filled with Sexbots and not even mentioning the possibility of Terminators. Just saying it would have been nice to have him discuss a few pages further about ultimate outcomes, even if he simply ended by noting how vast the possibilities really are.Again though, the entire book is packed full of many of the brightest ideas and developments that are in progress today, and I wouldn't have known about them if not for reading this. In the end the predictive parts of his books get the most hype, but for me it is the overwhelmingly informative and thought-provoking nature of his writing that makes it so compelling. I also like books that automatically make me smarter than everyone else, and now I am, so that's good too."
48,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9892350-ollie,4,"Ray Kurzweil's books are scary. Not in a mystery horror movie kind of way, but in a this-is-where-humanity-is-headed-whether-you-like-it-or-not kind of way. And while The Singularity is Near (his only other book I've read) was a rather in-depth outlook at our ability to use technology to advance our brain capacity and human life, How to Create a Mind is a little lighter. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I said that the Singularity is Near was more in depth, but that was only because Kurzweil went more into the specifics of how technology can be used to benefit people, which didn't exactly lead to me understanding the process any better. It was still very confusing at parts.How to Build a Mind is a little more basic. And although Kurzweil doesn't really get into the specifics of how to build a mind, he does discuss what we know so far about how the human brain functions and how it creates our personalities. So, really, it reads more like a text book, albeit a fun one. The most important underlying theme is that there is a system of pattern recognition built into our neocortex (the part of our brain that makes it look like a human brain) that is organized in a hierarchical fashion. So, while certain neurons fire when they recognize a certain part of the letter A, that firing neuron is then linked to another neuron that fires when all the other neurons that recognize all the parts of the letter A fire into it as well. That A neuron is then organized into a system that recognizes a word that has the letter A. The brain also plays with this system by lowering the threshold of a neuron to fire when it's expecting a certain letter or word and elevating the threshold when we haven't learnt something yet.Kurzweil also touches on the different parts of the brain such as how it recognizes speech (and how we learn about it by developing voice recognition software), how our ability to learn and remember is limited by the amount of neuron connections we can make in our neocortex (and how that can be ""solved"" by allowing us to ""access"" knowledge we have previously stored on a ""cloud""), and what makes a personality (is it what we know, what we've learned, what we recognize as human, or what we perceive as acting like a human). All of these are very thought provoking questions, and if indeed one day will be able to use technology to improve ourselves by ""roboticizing"" ourselves, I will reference the Simpsons and simply say that ""I, for one, welcome our future robot overlords."""
49,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18346013-yasser-mohammad,2,"OK this is a confusing book to rate.The book proposes a theory (pattern recognition theory of mind) that simply put states that the neocortex consists of roughly 300000000 pattern recognizers that are more or less the same each consists of an order of 100 neurons or so. There is a lot in this book that is in the same spirit as ""on intelligence"" but this one is more computational and higher level in its modeling of the cortex.By profession, I should like a book that may be mentions Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models (HHMMs) more than anything else and that explains many ideas in modern pattern recognition for the lay person. Nevertheless, the idea presented seems to be over simplistic. This is not to say that it is false but just I cannot see that the justification provided is enough to assume that this single ""algorithm"" explains the neocortex. Given that I used HHMMs several times, it seems to me that they require much more data for training than can be provided by a general recognizer over and over again which gets adapted only through development. Kurzweil I believe agrees with that and leaves a role of genetics in adapting specific regions to specific recognition tasks yet I think that he does not give this innate factor enough credit in the book.Of course the book near its end reverts to speculations about the future (as is the case with Kurzweil's other works) and for me what is projected could have been accepted except that it seems that the neocortex may be a complex system that would not allow us ever to interface it as Kurzweil suggests. After all, most of the processing and representation in the brain are distributed which may put a limit on how much can we target it with enhancements or interface it with an artificial cortex."
50,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12891325-ian-williams,5,"I loved this book. It was 1/3 neurology, 1/3 AI, 1/3 philosophy (in that order). Kurzweil presents his latest theory on how the neo cortex works, and how this process is possible to emulate with software. The first two sections of the book are extremely interesting, and I'd recommend to anyone with a moderate interest in learning how the brain works.I've heard that a lot of people think Kurzweil is a bit crazy and don't like him, but I felt that in general he uses pretty cool logic backed by continually emerging evidence to present forward-thinking theories on the brain and AI. With my background in CS I found it very easy to follow everything. I think it would be more difficult and would requite double reading / Wikipedia lookups if you don't have this background.If you find yourself being dismissive of the eventuality of creating computing systems with intelligence that surpasses that of humans, you're in denial. This is clearer to me than even global warming :-)The final 3rd of the book is probably where he loses a lot of readers especially, since he gets into the philosophy of consciousness, life, and all those sort of big questions. If you accept theory as presented, and make reasonable assumptions afterwards, there are some 'disturbing' consequences. Yet even in this section I see his point of view... interesting stuff. For some, I'd recommend not reading the last bit of the book because it's less 'scientific'. For me, it was still very interesting, but a bit depressing. If you take it to it's fullest, it's way to easy to become a nihilist...Enjoy! You'll be talking about it with everyone you know for weeks... "
51,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15435937-chris,5,"This is a very interesting book, and Kurzweil argues his positions well. Drawing on cognitive neuroscience, evolution and computer science he articulates a novel philosophy-of-mind and considers what it would take to instantiate this model in a computer.As well as convincing illustrations of the past history and projected power of exponential growth in information subjects and subjects which have become information subjects (like biology and medicine), Kurzweil also articulates some of the philosophical and ethical consequences of building minds in silico and how that could affect our not-too-distant future society.Writing with some knowledge of theoretical biology, some of the evolutionary claims he makes are a little bit naive, but not in ways which affect the strength of his arguments, and he also dedicates an entire chapter to rebutting some of the claims made by others. I think he executes this rebuttal very convincingly.In short, well worth reading if you're a philosopher, computer scientist or cognitive neuroscientist or any individual interested in the potential trajectory of human society. An easy 5 stars."
52,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3767458-matthew,2,"I quickly became suspicious about Kurzweil's scientific discourse. The notes section seems large, but this is mostly because many of the individual notes are elaborate and cite Kurzweil's own works. The actual number of citations is very small for book that throws half a dozen scientific claims at the reader per paragraph. Conciliatory words and phrases like 'perhaps', 'maybe', or 'research seems to indicate' are not to be found and I could not shake the feeling that this along with the lower number of citations indicated that all of these claims about the neo-cortex and the how the human mind works are simply what Kurzweil thinks is going on in the brain. Now Kurzweil is a bright guy who has immersed himself in these topics. His ideas should be taken seriously and not dismissed out of hand. Yet his 'this is how the brain works' is stated as though it is already established scientific fact. Some of it may be, some of it may not be, but these distinctions are not made clear to the reader either in the text or through citation."
53,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13245689-ignacio,4,"I like this guy. Kurzweil is an absolute genius (19 doctorates!!) and never compromomises. He firmly believes we are approaching a singularity (do not miss his 'The sigularity is near') and boldly explains what is going to happen. You heard me right: he does not propose his theory of things to come but instead explains what will happen. You have to cope with this, but if you do, his writing is fun, entertaining and informative.In this particular book, he promises to reverse engineer a mind and then explain us how to build one (and by when it will be ready!). He presents a theory called “the pattern recognition theory of mind (PRTM)” which he claims “describes the basic algorithm of the neocortex"". The theory is plausible to someone as uninformed as I am, although some scientists contest it strongly. From there he moves into the world of Artificial Intelligence and conscious minds, where the book is less informative and very opinable.All taken into account, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone interested in the future and the debates AI will bring with it."
54,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33704238-filippo-pacifici,4,"In this book, Ray Kurzweil provides an effective description of the brain mechanisms with concrete examples that can be understood without any neuroscience background.The author also makes the claim that within a few decades we could be able to reproduce a brain artificially. This comes together with an introduction to some artificial intelligence technologies we have today.The description of the brain processes and mechanism is done amazingly well. Precise, and concrete. Same for the description of the artificial intelligence technique that can be pretty much understood without background in the field.The book becomes a bit less sharp in the section that describe consciousness and free will, which is probably where we know less and is more philosophical and less concrete.Just one negative remark on a book that otherwise I liked a lot: the author tends to repeat himself in several places where he could have been more concise."
55,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4837743-halden,5,"How to create a Mind has gone a long way in tempering my skepticism of Ray Krurzweil and the possibility of a sentient AI. I, like many of Kurzweil’s critics, find his timeline overly optimistic but this book reveals that his prediction comes from an enthusiastic desire rather than headline seek no. The first portion of the book is a great overview of today’s understanding of the brain and mind as well as how we have been successful in replicating many of its functions. The later part and conclusion of the book outlines his law of accelerating returns which is where he tends to lose me but I am more willing to cut him some slack now that I have a little more understanding of where technology is and where he is coming from. There is a chapter where he takes time to rebuke his critics arguments which I appreciate. Overall this is a fascinating read if you have any interest in the mind and/or AI"
56,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3109219-nathan-shepherd,3,"Interesting, thought-provoking - sometimes provocative – ideas. How does the human brain work? How can its computational capabilities be replicated using technology? What is consciousness, and when will computers have it? This book poses many such intriguing questions (and more) and provides many intriguing responses. It is fodder for many quiet moments of contemplation.Minor annoyances: 1) Kurzweil’s self promotion throughout the book (although I guess he *does* need to generate business, and he *did* do those things…), 2) the seemingly slow discussion on the neocortex (that chapter dragged for me), 3) the fact that Kurzweil never actually describes the Turing Test, which he refers to constantly (I'll have to look it up, I guess.), and 4) a defense of the ""Law of Accelerating Returns"" as an inviolate ""law,"" rather than a long-standing empirically-observed phenomenon."
57,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"Kurzweil is not for everyone, but he is for me. He covers a wide range of topics from how the brain works, quantum physics, logical positivism and Ludwig Wittgenstein up to what does it really mean to be human.I get a little glossy eyed during the description of the brain and its interactions, but he explains them as good as anyone and I could follow them but not well enough to repeat it to others, but when he's talking about what constitutes a thinking human is where he really excels and excites and I can and will repeat to others his thoughts on that stuff.The narrator really added to the books enjoyment. I thought he was narrating the book exactly the way the author would have been while he was writing the book."
58,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10547530-mark,4,"Very intriguing for anyone interested in machine learning or future technology. Not everyone will like this though. In addition to interesting segments on technology and a bit of AI theory, there is a significant number of philosophical segments scattered throughout the book (e.g. what is consciousness) which makes sense when talking about artificial intelligence and it’s future coming of age. I found the entire book fascinating. Be warned that some of it is deeply into the machine learning theories and algorithms. Not all will enjoy that technical part. While I didn’t understand all parts, I had a lot of fun with this book, contemplating what will soon be and the impacts of it. Thanks Ray!"
59,0670025291,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34621415-jasmin-shah,5,"This book covers topics like reverse engineering of brain, Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models(HHMM), Pattern Recognition Theory of Mind(PRTM), Consciousness and relevant philosophies, The Law Of Accelerating Returns(LOAR) and at last Kurzweil's mind-boggling predictions for upcoming 3 decades. My favorite topics were PRTM and LOAR, I enjoyed it so much that I had to give 5 stars to this book. Frankly, some consciousness related philosophies went over my head but I'll try to re-read it later. :PRay Kurzweil is an absolute genius, he earned himself another follower for his brilliant work.A must-read for all Cognitive AI enthusiasts."
