0,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick,3,"In the author's preamble to The Ten Most Beautiful Experiments, I was slightly alarmed to see Cormac McCarthy thanked for his help composing the manuscript of this scientific history. Presumably this is a different Cormac McCarthy, but one does wonder.JOHNSON: Now then, Cormac, where were we. Chapter Eight; new paragraph. Quote: ‘Edward Morley, a chemist at neighboring Western Reserve University, was as meticulous a scientist as Michelson. The two men agreed that it would be pointless to make another attempt to detect the Earth's absolute motion unless they could first confirm Fresnel's hypothesis – that the celestial backdrop is fixed in space with only pinches of aether dragged along by transparent objects.’ Just read that back for me, would you?MCCARTHY: The sky was clear and Michelson's heart was clear and only in the far west the clarity was broken where the last cloudbank bled over the land like a jugged hare; and yet all was in motion, heart, blood and sky, spiraling forever into the measureless void and haling the ether along with it like the caul over a miscarried infant's soft and innocent head. Innocent? Nay – rife with original sin.Michelson spat on the ground, and the parched land accepted his meager gift.—Reckon Fresnel might have been on to something after all, Morley said, studying the westering sun.JOHNSON: Perhaps we should take a break.(Edit – as has been pointed out to me, it was in fact almost certainly the Cormac McCarthy. See e.g. here.)Distracting Acknowledgements aside, this is an engaging, if slight, description of ten key experiments from across the sciences: Harvey's demonstration that blood circulates through the body, Newton's refraction of light, Michelson-Morley, Pavlov's dogs, and so on. As with any such selection, there are some surprising omissions (no double-slit experiment?), but, more fundamentally, and although the writing is decent, the chapters are a little too short and they fail to generate the sort of excitement that following these efforts should have generated.The chapters also function as mini-biographies of the scientists involved, and in part this book is a love-letter to the ‘great men’ (they're all men) who have driven science forward through insight combined with exhaustive slog. One of the things we're left wondering at the end is whether this kind of single moving spirit may be anachronistic now: Johnson notes that there were 439 names on the paper announcing the discovery of the top quark. So lots more beautiful experiments to come, we can be sure – but most of them are likely to have been designed by committee."
1,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4384303-brad-lyerla,4,"Johnson could have just as easily, and accurately, called this book THE TEN COOLEST EXPERIMENTS. It is undeniably cool how the famous scientists featured here figured out ways to isolate and test the variables that interested them. Johnson tells the story of each experiment clearly and without unneeded elaboration. Even though these are familiar stories from high school science, Johnson manages to convey a genuine sense of ""gee whiz, how did he figure to do that” that makes his book fun.Science has no rules as such. It is not an ‘ism', such as an ideology or religion. The rules that science offers are simply marking points for the next scientist to improve upon if he or she can. Science is never over. The scientist's urge to improve our understanding is unquenchable. Nothing is ever settled. All is subject to revision or refutation. Science has improved our lives immeasurably precisely because it does not settle the question at hand. It merely suggests an explanation, until a better explanation emerges. The experiments described in THE TEN MOST BEAUTIFUL EXPERIMENTS illustrate how science never rests. Johnson chose to include the ten experiments featured here specifically because each required inordinate cleverness of design. Some scientists are theorists. They propose scientific theories. But many scientists are lab rats. They design experiments to test theories. And the ingenuity of their designs is the subject matter of this book.Highly recommended."
2,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,3,"I would have liked The Ten Most Beautiful Experiments more if I'd read it as part of a class, where my instructors demonstrated the experiments and talked their way through them. I wanted to see, to feel, to smell. As it was, I often felt that I missed the details of most of the stories told here. I certainly couldn't have replicated that research based on George Johnson's descriptions or the drawings included, most of which were from the original researchers, as with this one from Sir Isaac Newton's journal.For me, the most compelling parts of the stories was the ""messy"" parts of science: * The ways that professors steal credit for work that their students have done – or that their students lay greater claim to that work their advisors believed they deserved (e.g., Robert Millikan and Harvey Fletcher).* The important roles of scientific rivals or supportive colleagues in the progress of that science (e.g., Galvani and Volta): Though neither man could quite see it, their experiments complemented each other, for they were dancing around a single truth (p. 74). Conversely, Lady Ada Lovelace was an effective and important muse to Michael Faraday, and Alexander Graham Bell was an important benefactor to A. A. Michelson.* It's not just the observations that matter, but what you do with them (e.g., Lavoisier, Priestley, and Scheele). Could Priestley and Scheele recognize their data's meaning? (Of course, data doesn't come with clear labels.) Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier did.* The experimental mindset is central and essential to the work and to the personality of the researcher, illustrated in the story of Lavoisier's execution by guillotine – surely hyperbole. He wondered whether death by guillotine was painless. Lavoisier tested this hypothesis, so the story goes, by beginning to blink his eyes as soon as he felt the blade touch his neck and as many times as he could, while an assistant in the crowd would count his blinks. Such a mindset touches everything. Or, as in the drawing above, Sir Isaac Newton was so intensely curious about vision and light as to poke a stick in and around his own eye to observe what happened.* Memory is often treacherous. Johnson described several cases of clear misremembering, as in Wilhelm Roentgen's first reports of x-rays of the hand, which so excited Robert Millikan that he misremembered this report as happening at the German Physical Society on Christmas Eve, but it instead took place in the following January. * But Johnson described other cases of ""misremembering,"" which seem much more to be ""cooking the books,"" where researchers appeared to comb their data for support for their preconception (e.g., Robert Millikan).*Or in yet other cases, the experimental method appears to be ""smoothed over"" rather than an accurate description of the initial research. Stillman Drake, for example, argued that Galileo probably sang in order to assess time in his experiments, but “Even in [Galileo's] day, it would have been foolish to write, ‘I tested this law by singing a song while a ball was rolling down a plane, and it proved quite exact.’"" (p. 15). I doubt that Johnson hoped that I would draw these conclusions, although he probably would not have been surprised either. Science is a very human endeavor."
3,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4651295-jason-furman,4,"The table of contents was not promising. The book promises the ten ""most"" beautiful experiments but doesn't have Rutherford discovering the nucleus? But it does have Galvani chopping up frogs to find out if they transmit electricity.But as I read, I came to appreciate Johnson's idiosyncratic selections. Rather than reading the Nth treatment of classic experiments, he presents some very interesting and well-told vignettes. Especially of Galvani and the frogs. And Pavlov, who turns out to have loved his dogs.Still, some of the vignettes, like Harvey Lavosier, were less engaging. And at some point, and this is a comment about the entire science history genre, you just do not want to spend the amount of effort the books requires to try to understand theories of two fluids pumped by the heart, phlogiston, and caloric just to learn how they were discovered to be wrong.A final thought: someone should write a book on ten experiments that failed -- and discovered something much more important as a result. Michelson and Morley would be in it, not sure the other nine, which is why someone should write it."
4,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3035194-lubinka-dimitrova,3,"In hindsight, not a book well suited for audio. Apart from that, I was not particularly impressed with the experiments the author chose to present, and at some points I found the writing too technical for the lay audience it seems to be targeted at. The trivia tidbits though were quite interesting."
5,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,4,"It has been said that the greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance but the illusion of knowledge. That's a great line. I'm not sure but it seems to me that ignorance and the illusion of knowledge are one and the same. A great example of this is when J. J. Thomson said he found an electrically charged particle with an independent existence inside of an atom. People had trouble accepting electrons. After all, the word atom means uncuttable. Experimental science began less than 400 years ago with Robert Boyle. He created the air pump. It could be moved about so others could confirm test results. Hearsay was no longer required. Air pumps became a form of entertainment as people put things like birds in them and sucked out the oxygen. Boyle's experimental method was the impetus for the Royal Society. Their motto was Nullis in Verbia: Take nobody's word for it. Observations and conclusions were written in the painstaking form of modern science. The search for beauty has been endless. Just ask any barhopper. Pythagoras thought the distance between heavenly bodies was harmonious: the music of the spheres. Coleridge defined beauty as ""unity in variety."" Newton defining the fall of an apple with the motion of the moon is one example. Darwin's world changing discovery of evolution by natural selection is another. 1. Galileo rolls two balls of different weights down an inclined plane. A recent conclusion is that Galileo sang a simple tune to establish a rhythm. When Galileo's body was exhumed one century after his death to be moved to a better burial site, a finger and a tooth were removed from the body. The bones of the finger are now preserved in a reliquary like the bones of a saint pointing upward to the sky. It is located in the Museo di Storia della Scienza in Florence, Italy. 2. William Harvey studies the circulation of blood and the heart. He experimented with all sorts of animals. I hate to think of what was done to them. In the English civil war of 1642, his papers were taken. He survived and lived for 15 more years but never got over that great loss. 3. Isaac Newton experiments with prisms and color. He had to deal with many accusations of plagiarism and other criticisms. 4. Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier studies fire, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. During the Reign of Terror, he was guillotined. One probably untrue story states that he promised to blink his eyes as many times as he could once he felt the blade touch his neck to show how long he lived after. This would show how humane the execution was. 5. Luigi Galvani discovered what he called ""animal electricity"" by experimenting with frogs. Eventually science would realize that each microscopic cell acts like a battery. Life is nothing but electrochemistry. 6. Michael Faraday found that electricity was entwined with magnetism and magnetism with light. Two decades later James Clerk Maxwell's famous equations showed that light is electromagnetism. 7. James Joule worked with experiments on heat. Carry them further and we realize that eventually the Earth will become uninhabitable because the heat within will be lost. Of course, carbon in the atmosphere will do considerable before that event. The same is true with the universe as a whole: It began with a bang and has been going downhill ever since. 8. A. A. Michelson studied aether in space. He viewed aether as ""one of the grandest generalizations of modern science--of which we are tempted to say that it ought to be true even if it is not."" He died a few months after meeting Einstein, whose theory of relativity would prove the true significance of their experiments: There is no fixed backdrop of space, or even of time. As we move through the universe, our measuring sticks stretch and shrink, our clocks run slower and faster--all to preserve the one true standard, not aether but the speed of light. 9. Ivan Pavlov treated his dogs better than other experimenters. He equated vivisection with smashing a watch to see how it ran. He preferred anesthesia and surgery. He sometimes resorted to acute experiments, but only with regret. ""When I dissect and destroy a living animal, I hear within myself a bitter reproach that with rough and blundering hand I am crushing an incomparable artistic mechanism. But I endure this in the interest of truth, for the benefit of humanity."" We are conscious automata. In 1935, an ornate fountain was built called Monument to a Dog with the busts of eight canines, water pouring from their mouths as they salute in salivation. It has this quote: ""Let the dog, man's helper and friend since prehistoric times, offer itself as a sacrifice to science. But our moral dignity obligates us to ensure that this always occurs without unnecessary pain."" 10. Robert Millikan's oil drop experiments caused some people to doubt his records. "

10,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/776599-steve,5,"While visiting Santa Fe, I picked up this book in Collected Works, an excellent little bookshop off of Santa Fe's main square. At the time, I was in the process of reading Lisa Jardine's excellent ""Ingenious Pursuits: Building the Scientific Revolution."" While I have as a rule avoided reading two or more books simultaneously in recent years, I felt this volume to possess enough overlap with Jardine's book as to make it less difficult to make the segue. This is a fun little book that illustrates the benefits of minimalism. These days, as part of being in a PhD program, my reading consists of very detailed accounts of some case or area of study. Hence, it is easy to lose the forest for the trees. I thus have great appreciation for an account that makes the forest easier to apprehend. Since I am beginning the long and arduous process of preparing for a doctoral exam in science and technology studies, I well appreciate the quick and easy grounding that Johnson provides. While the broader history of science is outside the direct purview of the exam I will take, I feel it important to brush up on this history as a way of making myself a better sociologist of science. While I am sure some would descry this book as a ""potted history"", I would very strongly disagree. While brief, there is a lot of information contained in these pages. I am in fact quite surprised at how little I knew of the actual scientific work of the famous scientists listed here such as Lavoisier, Joule, and Michaelson (for instance). So, while it is undoubtedly true that Johnson compresses the accounts he presents, I think he does a good job of conveying the important details and also a short but comprehensive thesis of the role of experiment in science. But then, I have generally disagreed with fellow academics (particularly some historians), who lambast works for summarizing complex processes. My response has been and is to point out that a 1 to 1 (one meter to one meter/one foot to one foot) map would both be impossible and useless as a map. Even someone ostensibly committed to historiography ""untainted by social theory"" has to summarize, analyze, and synthesize - in short, to not present every possible detail. Further, no interested reader - lay or professional - is going to stop at one book. They generally go on to comprehend a broader literature. So, part of the job of all book reviewers is to position books in the broader literature of which any particular books are a part. Johnson's book is not a comprehensive history of science. What it is is an excellent addition to a bookshelf, or several bookshelves, on science. I now possess, in reading just 158 pages, a much clearer sense of ten important scientists plus associates and colleagues than I could claim before reading this book. Moreover, I have more easily reached a synthesis in one book than in reading 10 individual biographies.I apologize to you, the reader, if I seem to be belaboring this point. However, I have come to have very strong opinions on the value of short but sweet overviews as a way of building understanding. As a caveat, though, I will point out that my academic training has taught me to treat all accounts as provisional, to be respected but not treated as Absolute Truth by themselves. I also respect this book for how it judiciously merges biographical, technical/scientific, and historical information. I am not generally a fan of biographies, but Johnson does a good job of introducing the relevant biographical details without getting lost in speculation. Likewise, his scientific and technical discussions are just enough to promote understanding without getting bogged down. This is a crucial if often under-appreciated skill. All that said, I do have some quibbles with this book. For instance, he seems to prefer Isaac Newton to Robert Hooke - writing that Hooke was a ""stooped troll of a man"" (page 35). While Lisa Jardine in ""Ingenious Pursuits"" makes it clear that Hooke did wrong Newton in rejecting an early draft of his ""Optics"", neither men were very nice or easy to live with. But they were both geniuses with Hooke excelling in practice and Newton in theory. In this instance, I prefer Jardine's more balanced and complete account of the two men. Second, while I don't believe that Johnson himself believes in the mid-twentieth century portrayal of ""the scientist [as] an omniscient sage"" (Jardine, Lisa. 1999. ""Ingenious Pursuits"", page 335), he perhaps does not do quite enough to show the back and forth nature of science and the often frustrating nature of laboratory science. To be fair, he does demonstrate this much better with the later scientists such as Michaelson and Millikan. Hence, this may be more an artifice of the depth of historical information rather than cultural lensing. My sense, from remarks made in the beginning of the book by Johnson himself, is that he began with a preference for theory over experiment. That said, this book can be read as the author coming to see the beauty of lab work as coeval with - but different from - theoretical work. Hence Newton has an edge over Hooke in an early chapter, but by the time of Millikan, Johnson has embraced the beauty of hands on science. I am *certainly* impressed with his efforts to personally replicate Thomson's vacuum tube and Millikan's oil drop experiments with equipment he scrounged and assembled. It has set a new bar for my own historical work - I am now considering doing the same myself - and really adds to the later chapters - particularly Milikan. Perhaps this is a kind of middle-aged scientific ""bildungsroman"" for Johnson. The solution to the quibbles that I have discussed is for the reader not to stop here, but to use Johnson's book as a launch pad towards other excellent works on the history of science. For the adventurous lay reader, may I suggest some readings in the sociology of science such as Thomas Kuhn, or even Bruno Latour - in particular his book (with Steve Woolgar) - ""Laboratory Life"" or even ""Science in Action""? In any case, there is a constellation of excellent science writing - of which this book is a part - which any interested reader should sample as widely as possible. "
11,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5970049-christie,4,"Though I disagree with some of the choices, I enjoyed this book very much. The writing style is easy to read and understand, and I liked it until the last chapter, in which the author suddenly injects himself into the previously all third-person narrative. I did find the chapters involving vivisection and animal experimentation hard to read and, while the experiments themselves were elegant, the way animals were used makes them pretty ugly. If you are a lover of dogs or frogs you may want to skip this one. And no, there were no women in this book. Not a single one."
12,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/150648-tiffany,3,"I used to be smart. Now, apparently, not so much. I don't know if it's because I'm not smart anymore, or because I was reading this in places where I couldn't concentrate on it as much as I should have, but a lot of it went over my head. I have a feeling that if I were still smart (*cry*) I would have understood more. I got the gist of the descriptions of all of the experiments, though, just not necessarily the details. "
13,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76863493-kevin,2,"Too much technical jargon. Johnson does not take the time and space needed to describe the experiments thoroughly and show why they're beautiful. Each chapter needs to be about 3 times as long, or at least better explained. Also, heavily physics-focused, and there are so many experiments in biology that are just as beautiful, if not more."
14,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1597887-john,2,"This is a strange book. I want very much to like it, but the writing and subject matter is so uneven in some places that I can't quite bring myself to rate it higher than 'It was ok'. Allow me to explain why.Let me start with the last chapter for if the entire book had been like this, it would have been far better. Here Johnson repeats Millikan's experiment, giving firsthand information on what the experiment was like. He mixes his own narration with the story of Millikan, making sure to link the two...Though even this feels a bit disconnected in some ways. For instance, I can't see a point in telling the reader about the store where he ALMOST bought ""a Fluke 415B High Voltage Power Supply"" (139)...It seems this 1.5 pages of 'almost' could have been better spent on the story of Millikan. Also, by the end of the chapter, Johnson has launched into a brief, disjointed retelling of a fight between Millikan and Fletcher (Millikan's assistant). Somewhere in between these things, the experiment happens.I say somewhere because this chapter, like the other 9, is a bit uneven on how it explains things. I don't believe I'm a stupid person, but in many ways I had trouble following some of the experiments that Johnson set out to describe. For instance, I'm still a little perplexed as to HOW Millikan could deduce the existence of electrons from his experiment...Though I don't doubt that he did. I'm also confused as to exactly what Michelson did and why it mattered, though Johnson tries to explain it in very brief terms at the end of the section involving this experiment - he notes, cryptically, that Einstein's theories explained what Michelson was investigating...Though, again, I'm still not sure HOW.I don't believe that my failure to understand is a result of the experiment; rather, I believe my failure to understand is a result of either: 1) Johnson's writing: He doesn't know how to explain this better; or, 2) Johnson's intended audience: He didn't think the average person such as myself would read his book, so he wrote to scientists instead. In either case, the book suffers for this lack of explanation. Johnson has a good idea with this book (and with a more thorough scientific background, others may enjoy it more…Though I would suggest you be familiar with historical scientific terms as well, since Johnson uses these in many places), but he needed a good editor to help him achieve his vision.In short: If you can find this at a slight bargain, it may be worth your time…"
15,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/752176-vanessa,4,"This is exactly what the title says--the ten most beautiful experiments as reckoned by the author, a science reporter for the New York Times among other publications. To clarify beautiful, his meaning is experiments that were performed by small groups or individuals rather that committees (the author points out the paper announcing the discovery of top quarks had over 400 contributors) and motivated by insatiable curiosity rather than economics. With that in mind the author's list is as follows: Galileo (for his experiments with motion and friction), Newton, Lavoisier, Pavlov (for his famous beloved dogs), Joule, Harvey (who broke with classical views of anatomy to explain how the heart and circulation really work), Galvani (who discovered bioelectricity by sending an electrical charge thru severed frog legs), Millikan (who proved the existence of electrons with mineral oil, charged plates and a vacuum tube), Michelson (a Cleveland native whose almost forgotten experiments with mirrors and light laid some of the groundwork for relativity), and Farraday. If you are interested in the history of science, there is a wealth of information in this slim book which clocks in around 150 pages followed by copious footnotes. This book made me wistful for the days when someone might shut themselves into a darkened room, sawing holes in shutters and moving a prism around to understand the nature of light as Newton did. I was less nostalgic for the days when someone stuck a needle behind their eyeball to figure out how the optic nerve perceived light (also Newton who fortunately didn't incur any permanent damage.) Some of the experiments setups were complicated and difficult for me to visualize even with diagrams which makes the rating more of a 3.5 for me but this may be more my limitation than Johnson's as a writer. See what you think. "
16,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3617921-david-schwan,3,"Some of the experiments in this book I was quite aware of, some not so much. For me the most interesting experiments had to do with thermodynamics. I had studied thermodynamics in college but when you study it nothing is really put in context (atomic and nuclear physics tend to be taught in part from an historical perspective). I had not really been exposed to the history of thermodynamics before and thus those experiments made more sense with their history explained. The first experiment was from Galileo and highlighted that while the results are correct the method might have been a bit shaky. "
17,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/128532-sarah,3,"The writing was fairly technical, so I'm not sure if this book will work for the popular audience Johnson seems to want. Johnson didn't give much context or analysis about the implications of these experiments, which I would have found more enlightening than precise descriptions of exactly how the experiments were carried out. His choices are also very heavy on physics and experimentation on animals, neither of which are particular favorites of mine."
18,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2758455-katy,4,"Very short vignettes of important discoveries in early science and the history behind the science. Written for the non-scientist, it is easy to read and a great piece of history."

Some of the ""experiments"" he describes aren't single experiments at all, but longer procedures involving several experiments and their refinements over time. If you can overlook these and a few other quibbles, you'll probably find a few things to learn. I'm no scientific ignoramus, and was generally familiar with every finding, but I have to admit that the chapter on Pavlov introduced me to quite a bit that I didn't know about his dogs and his process, as well as the panoply of conclusions he was able to draw (going well beyond the well-known dinner bell).It's also a very quick read, at least for those of us who don't have to hit Google in order to follow each chapter.

So, for that reason, I would recommend it to someone who wants to learn a little bit more about 10 pretty cool experiments. I don't know if I'd agree that they were the most beautiful (which Johnson fully acknowledges) and I don't know if the writing is always very great but it is interesting. I think this the sort of book you use as a jumping off point to learn a little more. Then, if you find something that particularly catches your eye, you head down another path."

I read a few stories that were pretty interesting, but this book didn't make me wonder like the title and cover made me thought I would. Most likely responsible is my own understanding of science, but, while I understood the importance of every experiment and the way it broke new scientific ground, I wasn't often struck by the beauty of the experiment itself. The progress made in our understanding of the world was fun to read about. I missed the beauty in the apparatus and reasoning it took to carry it out. That's not the case for every chapter. The most obvious evidence that my lacking science education impeded my enjoyment of this book is this: as the experiments became more recent, theoretical, and abstract, I enjoyed them less. This means that I greatly enjoyed the chapters on Galileo, Harvey, Newton, Lavoisier, and Galvani while not quite understanding/enjoying the latter.

31,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42750245-christian,5,What a great read! I like the initial history of the experiment followed by the experiment itself. Very cool. 
32,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87764451-megan-m,3,"I had a good time reading it, the text is engaging, although each section seems to focus more on the experimenter than the experiment, and the experiments chosen represent a somewhat narrow selection"
33,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16252654-hiram-brown,4,Great reading for a complete nerd. It was a wonderful tribute to the upside of being curious.
34,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53657559-mark,3,"Fairly erratic, and the title is a bit misleading. Really the focus is on experimental problems / discoveries rather than actual experiments. I found the chapters on Galvini, Galileo, and the discovery of oxygen to be the most compelling. The section on Pavlov was particularly poor, and the section on Faraday was simply odd...with its framing of his being ""inspired"" by Ada Lovelace. Whether important or not, that framing...in a book that is already very much male-centered, really stuck out. That said, as a quick and dirty introduction to the history of science, the book can produce some nice lessons. I've used it in scientific methods classes with great success."
35,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1013594-robyn,3,"George Johnson wrote one of my favourite science books: A Shortcut Through Time: The Path to the Quantum Computer, so I wanted to give some of his other works a try. One of the reasons I love A Shortcut Through Time so much is that even though I don't have a scientific bent, I understood everything he was writing about quantum mechanics and quantum computing. It all made sense to me, all the way through, and yet I didn't feel as if my hand was being held. That is not true for this book. Unfortunately, for The Ten Most Beautiful Experiments, I didn't understand the science in practically any chapter. Even the chapters where the science wasn't particularly deep, it was expressed in terms that did not make sense to me, often using only the words of the time period the experiment was taking place in. I would read an entire chapter having no idea what the scientist was trying to prove, no clue where they were heading or even where they were starting, and at the end I'd say (for example), 'oh, wait. This was about what is in air?' I basically have to take the author's word for it that the experiments were ""beautiful"" because I couldn't visualize them, and with the short length of chapters (which dedicated a lot of space to explaining who each involved party was, who disagreed with them, etc.), I felt that a lot of assumptions were made about the reader's familiarity with the history of science. Since this is a book for laymen, not for those who read science all day (they would generally already know much of the information, I believe), those assumptions are not necessarily valid. I started the book in late October, read about a chapter, put it down, and didn't get back to it until a few days ago. I only finished the book a few minutes ago, and already the experiments have merged together in my mind, and I can't remember who did which, when, or why (other than Pavlov because it was already familiar, and Newton because he was already familiar). I did find myself amazed at where the experimenters' knowledge began. It's hard to keep in mind what the beliefs of a given time were, and how what we now consider to be standard information was completely antithetical at times in the past. When I read--during the second described experiment (Harvey)--what people believed to be true about the circulatory system (Galen's theories) in the 1600s, I was shocked to think that was what was taught in medical schools just a few hundred years ago. Or how recently the word ""oxygen"" was coined. Human experience and experiments stretch across such a huge breadth of time that for some of these things that we now teach elementary school students to have been such recent discoveries seems very strange to me. "
36,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/946799-samantha-penrose,4,"One might refer to a person like myself as being ""scientifically challenged"", but even I was able to enjoy this book.I found it to be well written and easily accessible to anyone. I fully understood and enjoyed where three of the experiments/experimenters were coming from and was able to appreciate the rest of them even without a full grasp on what was happening. I think that they were explained well.....I just have trouble wrapping my particular mind around certain concepts.I waited a while to review this one hoping to come up with something really fantastic to say about it.....alas, I have given up. I cannot do it justice. The best thing I can say to you about this is simply ""READ IT""! ****I HAVE TO COME BACK AND ADD A COUPLE OF EXCERPTS.....****For and old sailor like Albert Abraham Michelson, what Maxwell was describing (""There are no landmarks in space; one portion of space is exactly like every other portion, so that we cannot tell where we are. We are, as it were, on an unfuffled sea, without stars, compass, soundings, wind or tide, and we cannot tell in what direction we are going. We have no log which we can cast out to take a dead reckoning by; we may compute our rate of motion with respect to the neighboring bodies, but we do not know how these bodies may be moving in space."" -James Clerk Maxwell, Matter and Motion) was a nightmare---to be adrift on a windless night without a star to guide you. Michelson had learned his physics as a young man in the U.S. Navy, both at the academy in Annapolis and on the ocean, practicing the art of navigation. You had to forget Copernicus, think like Ptolemy. You and your ship were at the center with the orbiting stars as your guide. In reckoning your postion, you would take into account the velocity of your vessel, adjusting for the speed and direction of the wind. But as lost and confused as a young ensign might feel, he knew that his ship was in the crosshairs of some godly eye--precisly at a certain latitude and longitude. Surelly the same must be true as we sailed the universe. There had to be some kind of standard, something fixed to measure by.(chapter 8)(chapter 9)William James circa 1890....""The self-same atoms which, chaotically dispersed, made the nebula, now, jammed and temprarily caught in peculiar positions, form our brains; and the 'evolution' of the brains, if understood, would be simply the account of how the atoms came to be so caught and jammed."""
37,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2452279-john-catlin,0,"George Johnson used eloquent writing and interesting stories; both historical and personal anecdotes, to tell the story of some of the most important scientific experiments ever conducted. He calls them the most “beautiful” experiments because they were the product of one man’s intuition, curiosity, and artistic expression. Johnson helped me appreciate these ten historic experiments which were all conducted with great simplicity. Each experiment helped to reveal some key feature about us or the world we live in. His selection of experiments in this volume celebrates the simplicity in all of their collective work. The experiments he selected all defied the contemporary thought not only with their results, but with their logic and clear, simple design. He also makes a point to tell the reader how he feels about the loss of this facet in Science today.Each of the chapters focuses on a specific experiment representing a breakthrough in some field. There are very interesting stories behind each. One of the most interesting involves Isaac Newton inserting a needle behind his eye to learn how light causes vibrations in the retina. Each chapter is filled with stories like this that would never be thought of today. Descriptions of the experiments also come with copies of the original drawings and handwritten pages from the scientist’s personal notebooks. While some understanding of science would probably be helpful; even my wife thought some were interesting enough to warrant some additional interest.They were experiments produced by men who lived more like artists do today. They worked alone and often in obscurity. Today, scientific discoveries are the result of teams of researchers with huge amounts of resources and money. Johnson points out that “there were 439 names on the paper announcing the discovery of the top quark.” He feels that Science has strayed from its roots and could use a little dose of passion on behalf of the researchers. Reading this book made me think about reading Darwin’s On the Origin of Species… A professor made our class read a couple of chapters in an evolutionary Biology class I took last year. It reminded me of how scientists used to rely more on intuition and curiosity rather than hard data to direct their search for knowledge. I certainly think it would be beneficial for all scientists and people interested in Science to read."
38,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1469789-oldpoltroon,3,"My wife pointed out this book and Barnes and Noble and I knew instanty I had to have it.I'm an enormous fan of James Burke's original 1978 Connections Series - I'll go so far as this: it may be the greatest documentary in the history of the genre. So it seemed natural that George Johnson's book, that highlights some of the same experiments Burke chronicled 30+ years ago, would be a good fit for me.Johnson's book is thorough, but lacks Connections' compelling, if quirky narrative. Granted their goals are different. Burke was trying to show how change happens, Johnson just wants to show how experiments happen. What's lost in Johnson's book, that made Connections such a great work, is ""story."" I say that because so many of these scientists had great stories to tell - working under difficult conditions in World War II Berlin, the French Revolution, the Inquisition, at the top of mountain peaks, etc. That story is worth learning about, just to get a sense of the dedication, commitment, struggle and yes - passion - these thinkers exemplified. Johnson misses an opportunity to spend more time on that story.Still, this is a fun book and you should read it if you enjoy the History of Science and Technogy. It's also a great companion to Nova's recent television special - ""Einstein's Big Idea."" "
39,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1390990-stuart,3,"This book describes ten scientific experiments that the author feels best exemplify clear thinking and elegant experimental design. What I enjoyed while reading this book was not primarily the description of the actual experiments, which added little to what I already knew about them, but rather the description of the earlier theories that the experiments refuted. Popular science education, when it does present these earlier theories (humors, aether, Aristotelian motion, alchemy, etc), presents them as absurd straw men. The author provides a much more nuanced explanation of many of these theories that exposes their internal consistency, and why they were plausible explanations for known phenomena until further experiments invalidated them. The book is at its best when discussing the intellectual and social environment in which the experimenters operated, and weakest when discussing the experiments themselves. Unfortunately, as the authors says early in the book, the intent was to write primarily about the apparatus and experimental design. In that area, I found the writing, especially in later chapters, covered the experimental design and the significance of the results somewhat superficially."
40,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2389795-steven-pattison,3,"In the prologue the author describes a beautiful experiment as - ""The great experiments that mark the edges of our understanding were most often performed by one or two scientists and usually on a tabletop.....these experiments were designed and conducted with such elegance that they deserved to be called beautiful"" Given it's a science book it did start off a tad slow for me, but it picked up mid way through. It's an interesting read with science school textbook content but written in laymen prose (for folks like me). In addition to the science lessons the chapters include biographical and personal information on each individual featured and are divided by the scientist and specific fields and ""beautiful experiments"" they were noted for.For example, the chapter on chemist Antoine Lavoisier ends with a rumor on his death - during the French Revolution he was labeled a traitor and sentenced to death. During this time the guillotine was ""advertised"" as the most humane form of execution, so Lavoisier decided to conduct one last experiment - at the moment he first felt the blade touch his skin he would begin blinking his eyes as much as he could - and gave the task to one of his assistant's in the crowd to count the blinks for him for one last ""beautiful experiment"""
41,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32324-clara,4,"I'm very occasionally tempted to idealize the key scientific insights of past centuries relative to the present, a la 'science used to be simple and elegant, with key insights defined by definitive straightforward experiments.' The reality, of course, is both reassuring and awe-inspiring: the ten most beautiful experiments are elegant and certainly definitive in retrospect, but they were far from straightforward or facile when they were being conducted (or even to duplicate). Only when diligence and exquisite attention to detail intertwine with profound insight was it possible for Michael Faraday to elucidate the circular relationship between electricity, magnetism, and light; only with ten years of tenacity and astounding dedication (accompanied by profound psychological distress) was Michelson (and Morley) able to measure the speed of light (and substantiate the absence of a luminiferous aether). And measuring the charge of one electron? I'm still astounded that Millikan got it right. Johnson's ten essays combine to form far more than the sum; they are an elegant testament to the nitty, gritty, and awesome insights we aspire to build upon."
42,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2942631-mandy,3,"This book is a slender little volume, and was the only one of the books I won from Sky that arrived as a hardback. I found it fascinating, gruesome, and incomprehensible.Sadly, my knowledge of science has probably not increased one bit, as I lack the knowledge to access the information in this book. Magnets are moved about and a motor is created. What? A motor like the one in my car? Other descriptions of experiments lost me after the first few sentences. I cannot recall one from the other now, except for Pavlov and his dogs.I had better luck understanding the anatomical experiments - but my those were gruesome - severed frogs legs, animals vivisected, dogs with salivary glands fixed outside their bodies, a scientist (was it Newton?) poking a probe behind his eyeballs - yuk.I do not regret reading the book - it was very interesting. The scientists' rivalries, the way their minds worked when studying a problem, the things they put themselves (and others) through whilst pursuing their theories. Yes, very interesting. But I would not read it again, unless the little book was made a bit thicker, and called 'The 10 most beautiful experiments for dummies'. "
43,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1484507-brian,2,"Eh. If I understood science a little bit better this probably would have been more interesting. I mostly just skimmed over the pages where equations were being explained. The most ""fun"" part of this book was the recognition. The chapters, or experiments, don't start out like a news story where they explain all the pertinent information for digestion and then work slowly through all the details in order of importance.It works more like a mystery novel. You are given a name and sometimes a relative date and then backstory on the time and then the invention starts to be explained. But you learn about it kind of like the inventor learned about it. It is all interesting but you just dont know what you are actually learning or reading about until you get to the end.And, generally, near the end of each chapter was the name of the invention we just learned about as we know it today. It is like an ""AHA!"" moment. I would recognize the law or new thing that came out of it and then be pleasantly wowed about all the things the inventors had to do in their time to get to what we know today."
44,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4732237-alexandra-joy,2,"Enjoyable book, which taught me about experiments I was unfamiliar with. Synopses include Galileo (motion of uniformly accelerated objects), William Harvey (how blood is pumped to the body from the heart), Isaac Newton (developed a theory of color based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into the many colors that form the visible spectrum), Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier (found and termed both oxygen and hydrogen), Luigi Galvani (discovered that the muscles of dead frogs legs twitched when struck by a spark: bioelectricity/nervous system), Michael Faraday (studied the magnetic field around a conductor carrying a DC electric current), James Joule (studied the nature of heat, and discovered its relationship to mechanical work), A.A. Michelson (measurement of the speed of light: 186,282 miles per second), Ivan Pavlov (analyzed the saliva of dogs and what response it had to food under different conditions: reflex system), Robert Millikan (measurement of the charge on the electron)."

But I enjoyed this book-- I enjoyed understanding some of the meticulous grace of ""tabletop"" experiments revealing great truths about the way the universe works. I wish that I had a better technical understanding of the machinery of the experiments and the range of the implications-- sure it sounds familiar (you measure electricity in Joules, right?) but the science was mostly a little over my head. In a perfectly good way-- I want to understand better, to learn more. Like looking at a whirling mandala, I appreciated the beauty without fully understanding it.So for humanities soft-heads like me, there's lots of interesting personality and narrative description-- the flash of insight on the train, the delicate ""maestro's hand"" and the subjective objectivity in experimental science."
46,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/936038-lori,4,"In the prologue to this book, George Johnson writes:""Science in the twenty-first century has become industrialized.... But until very recently the most earthshaking science came from individual pairs of hands.... The great experiments that mark the edges of our understanding were most often performed by one or two scientists and usually on a tabletop. Computation, if there was any, was carried out on paper or later with a slide rule.""The experiments described in this book truly are beautiful - in part because of their amazing simplicity, and in part because of the creativity that was required of their designers to think them into existence.Truly fun to read. After reading this book, I am left with a list of scientists whose experiments were described therein, or were simply mentioned in passing. I've 'read' about them all before in text books, but never really studied their lives or the experiments they did. Now I am excited to delve deeper into their stories."
47,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2446389-upom,4,"I have no idea why I'm so seduced by slender little books, but I am. Perusing through my father's latest Scientific American book grabs, I found this tiny volume. It is a series of vignettes describing some of the best and most elegant experiments performed, including Galileo's ramp, Pavlov's dogs, and Millikan's oil drop experiments. The book was really well written, being both concise and interesting. The book also revealed some surprising facts, such as Pavlov's immense love for his dogs (interesting note: a fountain was erected to Pavlov's dogs that had stone dog heads ""salivating"" streams of water). I think the book was rated down a bit because of my familiarity with most of these experiments. However, Johnson's writing was enchanting enough to make the journey enjoyable. Bottom line: a short read that really does show some beautiful experiments."
48,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/330138-steve,4,"Johnson's a good writer, who does a great job of telling the stories behind some of the foundational science that has shaped our understanding of the world around us. Sure, it's a little arbitrary to call these then ten ""most beautiful"" experiments, but there's no denying that all of the experiments can easily be called ""beautiful"" or, if you prefer, ""elegant"". In addition to doing a good job of explaining the actual experiments, he also explains the questions that prompted the experiments, which are often as profound as they are simple. He spreads his attention among multiple disciplines including physics, biology, and psychology, which keeps things lively. Some of the stories he tells were already familiar to me, and others were stories that I thought I knew, but didn't. All of them were interesting. If you have even a passing interest in science, I'll bet you'd like this book."
49,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6007522-mark-muckerman,2,"Hmmmm. How to provide a review which is fair, balanced and accurate, yet doesn't portray me as a pretentious ass. . . a challenge, to be sure!In fairness, the ten ""most"" of anything is subjective, and this book presents a broad spectrum of selections, and does a good job of offering education, context and relevance on what could be a very dry subject (hence the dearth of science majors in universities).If you're a science afficionado, then you'll love it. If you pursued any science studies beyond high school, you like it, and will likely take some satisfaction in those moments of ""oh yeah, I remember that guy"". At worst, it imparts knowledge to help you in Trivial Pursuit, on line time wasting, and can help you be ""that guy"" at parties who offers up the obscure and arcane pearls of knowledge, that no one else will have."
50,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4048835-rebecca,3,"I found the first half of the book more interesting than the second, which, with the exception of Pavlov, started becoming very physics-heavy. A more diverse group of experiments would have made the book more comprehensive and compelling. Johnson is an engaging writer, but his aim to cover both biographical and experimental details (and sometimes the history of research prior to the experiment, and once even his own experiences) in so few pages is ultimately too ambitious. I often find that the implications of the results could have been discussed much further, to show readers exactly why the experiments mattered and how the findings impacted future research. Although interesting, biographical details often seemed irrelevant or not well-linked to the experiments. However, his use of diagrams is very helpful!"
51,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/189205-pandanator,4,"while it's a quick read (i finished it in ~4 hours - thank you VTA), it's a good start for anyone who is mildly interested in where all of these good ideas come from. while the experiments described are indeed mind-boggling, it's not some much that they were performed, but for what reasons they were performed, and with what materials used, with what ideas were already going around at the time (my favorite would have to be the Galenites' theory of blood). i could have seen this book be twice as thick and still needing more, but johnson does a great job condensing the facts and still getting across the amazing things that scientists of old figured out without all these fancy gizmos we have today (and actually, we can thank these guys for the fact that we even have gizmos)."
52,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1481465-tom,2,"A fun, quick read, but not really written very well. I should have possibly given it a lower rating, but the experiments are well chosen and fun. The drawings/diagrams and explanations are somewhat tedious and ultimately not that informative, the historical background is randomly anecdotal (not germane) and sometimes irritatingly speculative. In the final experiment, the author includes information about his own attempt to recreate the Millikan oil drop experiment (mass and charge of the electron.) The digression is somewhat interesting (I would love to visit that store in New Mexico that sells all of the old Manhattan Project equipment,) but it is inconsistent with the rest of the book and therefore confusing."

But the best part is, if you already really do love science, you still love this book! This is the personalized, historical accounts of how some of the greatest scientific discoveries of all time were made.Of particular note to me were the chapters on Michelson and Millikan.The Manhattan Project is not in here. Nothing like CERN or Fermilab is in here. These are particularly personal accounts, of a time when science could be done on a bench by one person alone with a small budget and a good idea. Calling these 10 experiments ""beautiful"" is truly apt."
54,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1864728-kevin,4,"This was a great book to read on the train or plane - it really holds your attention, and if you are at all interested in science, it will fascinate. The thing that I really learned from this book is that so much of science is just looking, measuring, and asking why? The thing that was so cool about the experiments in the book is that you can really follow the thinking of the scientist -- but the book is not some sort of fan-boy literature of the scientist, they sort of take a back seat. It is all about the experiment, but you can suddenly say to yourself, ""but I could have done that!""Great vacation reading - I highly recommend it if you are at all interested in science."
55,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4256070-jose,2,"I love the idea of this book. The anecdotes alone are pretty interesting and each chapter is self contained, so it can be read over lunch breaks. The reason it gets 2 stars is that the author doesn't really describe the experiments! Instead he gives some short summary of the experimenter's life, lumps in a few interesting tidbits about his field and then goes into a family of experiments. More importantly, he does a pretty horrible job of describing each experiment (when he does actually bother to single it out.) This book just has no flow and each chapter is a rambling mess of random facts."
56,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6335246-niki,1,"Maybe the fact that I would only read this book around 11 p.m. (when I was almost asleep) made me not understand anything. This book was pointless to me. I hated it. Maybe if I had read it during the day at a normal time I could have a better understand of it but it probably would have still sucked. I hate reading about science in general so right off the bat this book wasn't for me(but I still had to read it for school) If my language arts class is going to be like this book for the whole year, kill me now, I'm not going to be able to survive. This book was horrible. A big waste of time. I have no idea what happened. Wait, what?"

For anyone interested in the experimental side of the physical sciences, this book presents an interesting popular presentation of the structure and context of the experiments selected by the author. As stated in the preface, the author used his own discretion to determine the 10 ""most beautiful"" experiments, and anyone is free to come up with their own list. That being said, the only thing I wish for with regards to this book is that it were longer; both longer in each individual segment, and longer in the reach of experiments covered (20, 30+ most beautiful, anyone?)."
58,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1154871-odk,2,"I can appreciate the author's enthusiasm, but unlike the reviewers on the jacket of the book I didn't think it was well written. The author could have explained the experiments more clearly, more simply for the average reader. (Thankfully, I already was aware of the experiments..) I also think he could've done a better job in explaining the context for the experiments, even just adding more dates.Perhaps I was too enthusiastic on setting out, as in the end I thought the book was a great idea but disappointing."
59,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1317038-brent,3,"I wanted this book to talk more about science and less about scientists. But I have a degree in Physics, so my preferences may be unique. When the book discussed the experiments, I found it very interested. After all, each of the ten experiments was groundbreaking and ingenious. When the book discussed the lives of the scientists, it seemed like a biography about people that aren't overly interesting. All-in-all, I found this book to be interesting and very readable. My guess is that it appeals to a general audience more than it did to me."
60,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/314310-mike,4,"I liked this book-- it had a good balance of interesting experiments and odd stories about the scientists and the beliefs of the time. It is also weird to realize how a total non-scientist like me knows a whole lot about physics, for instance, compared to a scientist in the 1700s-- that the ideas that sprang from the experiments has made it to popular knowledge and has been absorbed into the general pool of human knowledge. No doubt we've got some ideas that are going to look pretty dumb 200 years from now and people are going to be amazed that we believed some of the things we do now."
61,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/648105-shannon,3,"The book was interesting, but I do agree that it was more technical and less descriptive than I would have liked. It was also heavy on physics, which limited my interest. People I know who are scientists, though, really enjoyed it.The one thing I found really fascinating about the book is how many times these people who came up with these brilliant insights actually got it wrong about other stuff. It seems like even people this interested in how the world worked still only got it right a few times."
62,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3320405-raj,4,"This book takes as its starting point the idea that an experiment can be elegant and simple and devised and carried out by a single individual. He choose his ten favourite and gives each one a short, descriptive chapter. Including Galileo's work with gravity, Harvey's discovery of the heart as a pump, Newton's optical work and more, it's a whistle-stop tour through some of the most interesting science since the Enlightenment.Clearly written and easy to read, while remaining descriptive, it makes it easy to follow the logic of the experiments themselves. Well worth reading."

I especially liked the inclusion of many of original sketches of apparatus used by the experimenters. The days of small, unfunded, bench-top science may be over, but the spirit of the curious and obsessed carries through in this book. "
64,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5311199-gabriel,3,"Fun for anyone who likes science, but sometimes I wish the author would get more into the details of each experiment. He tries to make the descriptions a little too approachable sometimes.

The author successfully gets across the beauty of some of the experiments and made me feel that I'd like to have a go at re-enacting them myself.

268,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3499703-david-kessler,5,The author chose 10 very interesting stories about individuals rather than groups of researchers who made startling discoveries through many years of hard work and concise thought.

269,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11770555-amber,1,"Hated it. Not much else to say. Its only redeeming feature is that it explained the science in a way that would have been far more difficult to grasp with the same level of interest (absolutely zero) in a textbook.

270,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/314310-mike,4,"I liked this book-- it had a good balance of interesting experiments and odd stories about the scientists and the beliefs of the time. It is also weird to realize how a total non-scientist like me knows a whole lot about physics, for instance, compared to a scientist in the 1700s-- that the ideas that sprang from the experiments has made it to popular knowledge and has been absorbed into the general pool of human knowledge. No doubt we've got some ideas that are going to look pretty dumb 200 years from now and people are going to be amazed that we believed some of the things we do now."
271,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/648105-shannon,3,"The book was interesting, but I do agree that it was more technical and less descriptive than I would have liked. It was also heavy on physics, which limited my interest. People I know who are scientists, though, really enjoyed it.The one thing I found really fascinating about the book is how many times these people who came up with these brilliant insights actually got it wrong about other stuff. It seems like even people this interested in how the world worked still only got it right a few times."
272,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3320405-raj,4,"This book takes as its starting point the idea that an experiment can be elegant and simple and devised and carried out by a single individual. He choose his ten favourite and gives each one a short, descriptive chapter. Including Galileo's work with gravity, Harvey's discovery of the heart as a pump, Newton's optical work and more, it's a whistle-stop tour through some of the most interesting science since the Enlightenment.Clearly written and easy to read, while remaining descriptive, it makes it easy to follow the logic of the experiments themselves. Well worth reading."
273,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2399138-doug,3,"I think I'd give this 2.8 stars if I could...being a science nerd, I need more technical information and background than this slim little book provides, but it was still an interesting and entertaining read, with (again, all-too-brief) profiles of some well-known scientists and their breakthrough work: Millikan, Gallileo, Michelson, Pavlov, and others. I especially liked the inclusion of many of original sketches of apparatus used by the experimenters. The days of small, unfunded, bench-top science may be over, but the spirit of the curious and obsessed carries through in this book. "
274,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5311199-gabriel,3,"Fun for anyone who likes science, but sometimes I wish the author would get more into the details of each experiment. He tries to make the descriptions a little too approachable sometimes. And some of the later experiments deal with complex enough scientific principles – relativity, for example – that a “layman’s overview” starts feeling a little insubstantial. But I loved the historical and personal contexts provided for each experiment; learning about the people who pioneered concepts we now take for granted is the great strength of popular science books."
275,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5125829-ana,5,"Often in history, we are surprised to learn the stories behind the dates and names, and personally more so in fhe scientific world. This book is ample proof that the most fantastic of scientific history's facts stand for only the barest of representations of some of the most beautiful and complicatedly simple experiments ever conducted. With plenty of pictures and diagrams, George Johnson describes in just the right amount of detail the amazing circumstances behind what we hold to be some of the greatest scientific discoveries ever - perhaps to the degree that one could try a few."
276,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8386821-rachel,3,"I believe three stars to be misleading. This book was nicely presented and easy to read; it summarized the lives and circumstances of the men behind what the author feels are the 10 most beautiful experiments. As a biologist I only found fault in the lack of all the sciences. The majority of experiments described could be considered studies in physics (which is fascinating but also a bit dry to read in my opinion). I would have enjoyed an assortment of the sciences but of course limiting oneself to 10 experiments would be very challenging, and physics really is at the heart of everything."
277,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/896857-anton,0,ten vignettes about experiments meeting the author's criteria of beautiful. well done with simplicity and genuine 'method' behind them. not to ruin it or anything: the first is about Galileo who worked with force and motion. It comes out that he used his own heartbeat to monitor 'force over time' and later revealed that he probably sang or hummed in order to mark time.  some bearded loony singing in his laboratory while dropping marbles down a smooth chute? yeah. beautiful.
278,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/455291-sam,4,"This book describes ten elegant science experiments that allowed their designers to answer specific questions they had of the universe, such as Galileo's measurements of our planet's gravity or William Harvey demonstrating that blood circulates throughout our bodies. Johnson puts equal emphasis on the experiments and the people conducting them, and does a good job placing the work in the context of its historical moment and the life of its designer."
279,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1609068-katherine-collins,4,"This book helps to connect science and people – Johnson enlivens the experimenters as well as their experiments. Did you know that Pavlov intended to become a priest, but then started sneaking into the library to read Darwin? That he was deeply concerned with the ethical issues surrounding animal experimentation If you are a science geek, this is a fun and light skip through history; if you are a humanities lover, this is a great reminder that science and people are not two different subjects."
280,1400041015,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18370648-mishehu,5,"Those are some beautiful experiments. Most beautiful of all though? I can think of a few that Johnson omits. Then again, so -- as he tells us -- can he. No quibbles with the ten he chose. Each is an ingenious moment in the march of science. Amazing how far simple and elegant experimental design brought us. Johnson's little essays are pop science gems: informative, entertaining, and inspiring."
