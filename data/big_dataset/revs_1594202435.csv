Combine prohibition, bootleggers, and poison. Mix and pour. Drink at your own risk. The Poisoner's Handbook is a murderous romp through Jazz Age New York and an enthralling look at the birth of forensic medicine, developed in response to the growing number of poisons in illegal alcohol, common household products, and in the hands of calculating murderers using toxic substances to their nefarious advantage.Highly recommend this thoroughly researched work of non-fiction to chemistry fanatics and science/history buffs."
1,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,2,"Please note: this book is not actually helpful if you were looking for tips on how to poison someone (unless you are the U.S. government, in which case there are notes scattered throughout on how to poison industrial alcohols).I wanted to like this book. I wanted to rate it higher. I'm not quite sure what I expected, but I don't think it was this mix of science journalism, novel and research notes. I'm a biology nerd who enjoys science writing and have two years of chemistry under my belt--including organic, which was the most effort I've put into a college class ever--so this should have been like serving truffles to a chocoholic (who, me?). Unfortunately, awkward organization and writing has me wondering if it was laced with wood alcohol.Divided into chapters on early 1900 poisons, it roughly covers the birth of forensic medicine in New York City under one of the more motivated chief examiners, Charles Norris, and a talented chemist Alexander Gettler. However, a great deal of Prohibition detail is also included, scattered throughout most the chapters. The publisher was misleading with the subtitle; I suppose The Emerging Disciplines of Medical Examiners and Toxicology in Context of Courtrooms and Politics During Prohibition in New York would not have been nearly so sexy a description as ""a fascinating Jazz Age tale of chemistry and detection, poison and murder."" Alas, there is no jazz to speak of. There is, however, a paragraph mentioning the development of cocktails in the Prohibition speakeasies as a way of disguising the harsher alcohols--now that is a chapter I could have enjoyed. Chapters include chloroform, wood alcohol (an inadvertent poison resulting from Prohibition), cyanide, arsenic, mercury, carbon monoxide methyl alcohol, radium, and ethyl alcohol. To me, the implication in the jacket of ""tale,"" implies a singular subject. There is no real common link between chapters (barring the intermittent appearance of Norris or Gettler), except that they are about ""poisons"" and detection. Please note, junior scientists, that some of these cases are intentional poisonings, but some are accidental and more correctly described as casualties of the human search for improvement--one story mentions how an ""over-zealous nurse 'poisoned' a child by treating his head-lice with the prescribed radium tonic."" (As such, the technical term is likely 'toxin' over poison). As the book continues, Blum does little to separate the intentional from the accidental, which is a disservice to the material and the victims. In her afterword, Blum mentions how poisoning always seemed particularly horrific because the murderer was not only planning a death, but presumably aware of the potential for the victim's suffering. So to discuss both murderers, accused murderers, and those who kill (or suicide) by accident or ignorance is misleading and imprecise, rather surprising in a science writer.One of the few threads pulling the story together is the difficulty of prosecuting poisoners, and the efforts of examiner Norris and chemist Gettler to build and prove their evidence of cause of death. I can only shudder at some of the experiments--nowadays, chemistry is conducted more-or-less safely under specially vented lab areas and usually doesn't involve liquified organs. One experiment was designed to detect post-mortem cyanide, both in poisoned subjects and unpoisoned ones. The chemist tested flesh up to 8 weeks old, noting that there was a fair degree of putrefaction. Ugh. Her writing style is acceptable, although I occasionally found her attempts to add flourish awkward. Case in point: ""Or Belle Guinan's El Fay Club on West 45th, where the hostess gleamed like a candelabrum and the house band played..."" Candelabrum?  Really? I found myself completely distracted, unable to decide if she meant the hostess was metallic, on fire, or, in a more literal translation of the word, had hair twisting branch-like from her head.Personally, I found narrative structure awkward, both within each chapter and through the book as a whole. In the arsenic section, for instance, Blum dramaticizes the story of a young girl who ate a berry pie from a cafe and died, breathing life into her tale. Then she starts a new paragraph, states ""something similar happened the previous October at another cafe,"" then mentions ""the cafe is now closed."" When, exactly, is ""now?"" In July, when the girl died? In 2010 when the book was published? Confusing and irrelevant. We never find out why the girl died. We move on to a brief history of arsenic poisoning, it's decline when it was discovered it could be traced in autopsy, and then, oddly, Blum covers the process of opening a body for autopsy. It's the type of writing weirdness that leads me to wonder what she's trying to do. The arsenic chapter continues in its hopscotch development by describing the pathology lab, then gang violence in the city from Prohibition. While one can argue for creating a mood, it leaves the reader largely unclear as to theme. Prohibition continues to ricochet into chapters, and the story related may or may not be pertinent to the poison discussed. By no means is the logic-challenged narrative confined to the arsenic chapter; the chapter on mercury poisoning contains no actual intentional poisonings and then discusses the case of an industrial toxin, tetraethyl lead, used to prevent engine knock.Sections are redeeming, however. As a science dork, but generally history-impaired, I find it interesting to have the history of chemical science come alive. Nowadays, we cringe to hear about cyanide and arsenic; in 1920, they were common in the home as pesticides. In fact, arsenic was still in topical medicines. Both arsenic and lead were used in makeup (and still are, dear reader). How did society learn about toxicity, except through accidental deaths, man like Norris and Gettler, and the suffering of thousands of dogs, cats and rabbits? The book also casts a whole new angle on Prohibition, with the concern that wood alcohol is toxic. Learning that our own government deliberately poisoned alcohol with various substances in order to discourage drinking was shocking. Can you imagine that now? What if agents were out there adding arsenic to soda pop, or Agent Orange to tobacco (do be quiet, dear conspiracy theorists)? It kind of echoes current drug epidemics where people go on using despite the possibility of harm or death.Other interesting mentions: radium poisoning. Can you imagine buying a tonic made from radioactive materials? Or having your doctor suggest you use it? Me either, but it wasn't that long ago when it was done. The FDA, when it was created, was so toothless that it took scores of people dying and FDR to give it power to regulate pharmaceutical claims three decades later.Ultimately, while sections were interesting and thought provoking, the narrative was far too jumbled to make reading enjoyable. I'm not quite sure what Blum's chief focus was, but this mix of newspaper articles, court reports, New York history and scientific research is blended too well, and contains a few too many ingredients. I can't, in good conscience, say that I'd recommend it, unless someone wanted a few creative ideas for 1900s murder mysteries. There's clearly a moral to her story here. Too bad it's so torturous to find.Cross posted at http://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2013/0..."
2,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,3,"I don’t know why publishers feel the need to put huge subtitles on non-fiction books. Take The Poisoner’s Handbook, for example. To me, that’s a great title that would probably intrigue most potential readers. But the full title is The Poisoner’s Handbook: Murder and the Birth of Forensic Medicine in Jazz Age New York. While accurate, it doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue, does it?Think about The Devil and the White City. Even if you knew nothing about that book, if you saw it while trolling through a bookstore, wouldn’t you at least give it a look based on that title? But then you see that the whole thing is actually The Devil and the White City: Murder, Magic and Madness at the Fair that Changed America which makes you feel like you just got eye strain so you drop the book and stagger out of Barnes & Noble to go get a beer. The trend isn’t getting any better either. There’s a new book out called Hellhound On His Trail. That sounds cool. But wait for it! The whole title is Hellhound On His Trail: The Stalking of Martin Luther King Jr. and the International Hunt for His Assassin. It’s like you just read the whole Wikipedia entry about James Earl Ray.Thank goodness that Truman Capote wrote In Cold Blood before this trend started. Because the title these days would be In Cold Blood: Murder and Fear On the Kansas Plains & The Two Dipshit Losers Who Killed An Innocent Family . But back to The Poisoner’s Handbook, as we will refer to it from now on because I am not typing all that shit out again. This is a mix of science, crime, politics and history. It tells the story of how two men, Charles Norris and Alexander Gettler, worked tirelessly to bring scientific methods to the New York City coroner’s office and laid the groundwork for much of modern forensics. So I guess we can blame them for all those goddamn CSI shows.America used to be just as poison crazy as it is gun crazy, and before there were documented methods to prove the existence of poisons in a body, it was tough to get a conviction. Plus, the old New York coroner’s office was corrupt and incompetent so it was an uphill battle for Norris and Gettler to gain respectability. There’s detailed, but easy to understand, explanations of the chemical nature of the various toxins they dealt with as well as a sometimes hilarious account of the political in-fighting that happened to even get a qualified coroner appointed. There’s also a ton of stories about how the American public was routinely poisoned by harmful products or misunderstood chemicals.One of the more interesting parts is about the work done during Prohibition. Norris and Gettler considered Prohibition a lethal joke that was killing people who were drinking almost anything to get a buzz and they did a lot of research into alcohol and intoxication levels to show that people were drinking more when it was illegal. And the fun fact that I didn’t know before reading this was that the U.S. government actually had companies add things to industrial alcohol to make it MORE poisonous in a vain attempt to keep bootleggers from using it. And if a few thousand boozehounds went blind or died from drinking it, then they shouldn’t have been breaking the law anyhow.Interesting book, but I would have liked a bit more history about Norris and Gettler and a little less of a chemistry lesson.

A good editor might have pointed out that presenting a parade of a dozen villainous poisoners is ultimately less affecting than choosing to discuss just one or two. The organization of chapters by compound is a little artificial, but works reasonably well. Including some relevant photos would have greatly improved the book. But these are minor quibbles - this is a well-researched, interesting book. The material relating to Prohibition was unexpected and fascinating. Despite the author's skill, this book will never match my own little project in the works.

4,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s,3,"Can a book be both interesting and dry? Never thought so before, but here it applies well. Taking place between 1915-1936, the book opens with a self confessed murderer claiming he has poisoned many. The problem here is that there is no evidence to convict him, and he gets away with his crimes. The problem is that there are no tests to detect poison in corpses. Plus, so many poisons are do readily available, used in common household cleaners, in beauty products and in medicines.The Uber corrupt Tammany Hall and Prohibition also are also but players during this time. The book is structured like connecting stories, each featuring a poison and the nefarious uses of said poison. We have a modern day Lucretia Borgia, poisoned pies, a blue man and of course bathtub gin and wood alcohol. We also have the beginning of the medical examiners and pathology. So many got away with so many murders. But we have two heroes, Brother and Norris, the first medical and his assistant. They run experiments, event tests, see what the poison does to a human body, and slowly things begin to change.So why both interesting and dry? The cases were interesting, but the testing and results took of too many pages. Unless you are in this field or inordinately curious, I think many will feel the same."
5,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23315273-carol,4,"Yes, it's a 4 star read and I didn't finish it. I own it. The fault is mine, in that I am truly not a reader dedicated to reading non-fiction works start to finish. Blum's book is fantastic - both entertaining and fact-filled, and can be approached as a collection of short stories. That makes it easy for readers like me to feel no guilt if they put it down and don't pick it up again for several months. It also means that readers whose attention span exceeds mine (the vast majority of the educated universe) can look forward to a delightful read, capable of being finished in a weekend if murder by poison is as interesting to you as it is to me."
6,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/127002-ginger-k,4,"Wow! I picked this up as an impulse buy, thinking my sister (who loves all things Jazz Age) would want to borrow/steal it later. Now that I've read it, she can't have it: it's mine. Science! History! Prohibition! Murder! Accidental deaths due to the utter lack of regulation of drugs, household chemicals, and cosmetics!The book has an interestingly layered organization. Each chapter is titled for the poison/chemical whose investigation is woven the most centrally through that section; however, the book is also a chronological biography of Charles Norris and Alexander Gettler, the scientists who put science at the center of death investigations in New York. Deborah Blum uses individual case studies -- some solved, some not -- to highlight the development of various detection techniques, Norris and Gettler's efforts to elevate the status of good science in the courtroom, and even the everyday dangers of the era.Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys science, history, and forensics."
7,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"Deborah Blum has combined true crime with Jazz Age history and science to create a fascinating book. Medical examiner Charles Norris and toxicologist Alexander Gettler headed New York City's first scientifically trained forensic team. Each chapter features a different poison--chloroform, cyanide, arsenic, lead, radium, carbon monoxide, etc--with the story of a questionable death, the way the poison attacks the body, and the methods used by the toxicologists to identify the toxin.The most important poison during the Prohibition era was wood (methyl) alcohol, often tainted with additional substances. The government required more poisons to be added to industrial alcohol to discourage people from drinking it. But some people refused to stop imbibing alcohol during Prohibition, and enjoyed the intrigue of obtaining bootlegged alcohol. Tainted alcohol during Prohibition contributed to more deaths than drinking normal liquor (ethyl alcohol) ever had. Eventually a constitutional amendment did away with Prohibition.The author is a colorful storyteller so this nonfiction book moves quickly. The well-researched book was also a tribute to two tireless scientists--Norris and Gettler--who brought forensic investigation into the modern age in New York. I highly recommend this engaging book."
8,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/900340-nancy-oakes,4,"more of my chattiness about this book  here if you so desire. One day I left this book downstairs in the kitchen right next to the coffee maker intending to take it upstairs later, and the next thing I knew there's a post on my husband's facebook page with a photo of this book that reads as follows:""Hmmmmm, first she has me get more life insurance - then I see this book. #‎eatouttonight‬?""I didn't really ask for more life insurance, but his post is kind of spot on regarding this book -- one of the main points in Blum's study is that for a very long time, people who were so inclined could get away with murder when it came to poisoning. With very few exceptions, in this period of time there were a wide range of toxic poisons that were basically undetectable, used as a weapon to get rid of unwanted people. That all starts to change with the advent of serious forensic medicine during the 1920s, especially under the auspices of two major figures: Dr. Charles Norris, and Dr. Alexander Gettler. Norris was New York's Chief Medical Examiner, while Gettler was a brilliant toxicologist -- together the two started to change not only the way in which science was used in crime cases, but also brought to the fore the emphasis on how government should work to protect its citizens. Beyond being just plain interesting, it's also a very good look at politics of the time, at the failures and dangers of Prohibition, and at the unsuspected dangers that lie hidden in some every-day products and how science worked to study them and ultimately lead the fight in making lives safer. I first came across this book when one night, I couldn't sleep and decided to watch anything I could find remotely interesting at 2 a.m. and chose an American Experience episode with this title. I was hooked and then discovered that there was a book and that's all it took. I enjoyed The Poisoner's Handbook -- one thing it did for me was that it hit home that in some ways a lot has changed (and happily so) since that time but in others, a lot remains the same. Today, like in the 1920s, many pro-business interests in government continue to represent the interests of corporations at the expense of the people who work in their industries; there are still people who for some reason I do not fathom continue to insist that science is wrong, undermining the work of skilled, brilliant people for some political or financial reasons. One more thing -- this book takes more of a journalistic approach making it highly accessible to everyone, which is a good thing. I have only one negative thing to say and that's that each chapter ends in some sort of anecdote which not only adds unnecessary fluff but gets tiresome after a while. A lot of readers might enjoy that, but I'm all about keeping the flow going so I didn't. But that is just such a nit-picky kind of thing that really did not make my interest flag or prevent me from being absorbed in this book, and I highly recommend it, especially to people who are into historical true crime. "
9,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This book is mainly about two men; Charles Norris, the chief medical examiner of New York City, and Alexander Gettler, the chief toxicologist. These two learned, fiercely dedicated men fought city hall and the establishment, in bringing forensic medicine into the twentieth century, and to bring respect to the profession that it deserved. Basically, the book is a collection of short stories of various mysteries that these men, and the medical departments they served, helped to solve in the early twentieth century. I was most struck by two things in the book. First, the depth of corruption in the city's administration under Mayor Hylan was incredible. Hylan put a drunkard named Riordan into the coroner's office; he had absolutely no qualifications for the office. Three medical pathologists applied for the job; they had passed the civil service exam for the job, which required successfully performing autopsies. But the state-required autopsies were not performed in a medical school, as required by law, so the doctors were arrested and charged with felonies!It was also interesting how, during the Prohibition, hundreds of people died in New York City each year because they were poisoned by illegal alcohol. Many different types of poisons were involved, and were required by the government to be additives to industrial alcohol, to discourage drinking!Despite the wealth of grim stories, this is a fascinating book, and very well written. Highly recommended!"
10,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31857555-jody-mcgrath,3,"I was really excited for this book and I was a little let down. It was very interesting, but so dry in parts that I had to set it down. The story was broke up in strange chunks with the ongoing problems of prohibition running throughout. There was a lot of information about forensic scientist and medical examiners fighting for budgets and prestige. I am glad I read it, it I wouldn't read it again."
11,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/287915-name-redacted,4,"Though the author's intent is clearly to argue against prohibition in the US, the main take-away for me is that people are IDIOTS and love filling their bodies with things they know are poisonous and will kill them. It's a wonder to me that, in an age so obsessed with eugenics; an age in which Margaret Sanger founded her Planned Parenthood with the dream of ""purging"" the US of ""mental defectives"" and minorities; an age in which G.K. Chesterton actually had to write a Christian tract AGAINST eugenics (anti-eugenicists being seen as hopelessly old-fashioned and provincial); and in which the US govt. actively poisoned liquor in the hopes of enforcing prohibition; in such an age, NO-ONE ever suggested that perhaps the people's willingness to risk blindness, insanity and death by drinking, rubbing into their skin, or smoking/chewing substances they KNEW were deadly was something that should be encouraged. Not a person seems to have voiced the opinion that people who willingly destroy themselves should be allowed to do so, despite the sickening passion for eugenics which pervaded that age. The US is very lucky most eugenicists were opposed to prohibition and most of the anti-eugenicists were for it, because otherwise we would have had one of the most incredible mass-exterminations in human history. Seriously, PEOPLE ARE IDIOTS.PS: I could probably write a book on the double-think and cognitive dissonance which must result from the fact that most of the same people who demand government oversight of foodstuffs (pushing for trans-fat bans, bans on high-fructose corn-syrup, etc.) also insist that prohibition was a huge and immoral mistake. *sigh*"
12,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15033381-laura,4,"While this book is ostensibly about poisons, it is also very much the story of the development of forensic toxicology and its pioneers Charles Norris and Alexander Gettler. In a time when cause of death was often determined by a politically appointed coroner with little or no medical or scientific training, the appointment of Norris as Chief Medical Examiner of the city of New York was a game changer. Norris, along with his chief toxicologist Gettler, would introduce scientific methods into determining cause of death and pioneer forensic methods to determine the presence of poisons in a body. This book follows their 20 years of work in the early twentieth century, covering various poisons and discussing real cases of homicide by poisoning and of inadvertent poisoning due to exposure to toxic substances in the work place and in everyday health and beauty products in the years before the FDA had any real power. It is crazy to learn that poisons like arsenic and even radioactive elements like radium were sold to the public in various concoctions without their knowledge, often with disastrous results. This book also covers the years of Prohibition and the many deaths which occurred from attempts to circumvent the law by doctoring industrial alcohols for consumption. This really was a fascinating book on so many levels."
13,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2679341-jane,4,"Where I got the book: purchased at Borders ALAS POOR BORDERS.This short (278 pages of text) nonfic covers the development of forensic toxicology in New York from 1915 to 1936 (with a little look before and after) against the background of Prohibition, which led to an epidemic of self-poisoning as people drank, seriously, ANYTHING because they couldn't get regular alcohol. I had no idea it was that bad, or that Prohibition had done quite such a splendid job of turning moderate tipplers into binge-drinking maniacs. Says a lot for human nature.Interestingly, each chapter focuses on a specific poison, although the Prohibition theme is relentlessly hung on every hook the author can find so things go a bit off-topic at times in an engagingly rambling sort of way. Lots of anecdotes of real crime, a little bit of science and a few brisk character sketches add up to an entertaining read. Although I suspect this is not the best book on poisoning out there, it's worth reading for a little inspiration.NO, not inspiration to poison people. Honestly. *Rolls eyes.* I'm talking about inspiration for stories. Talk about truth being stranger than fiction. As for the writing, I'd class it as highly competent journalistic prose but not exciting per se. Still good enough to merit 4 stars and to whet my appetite for more murder."
14,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2908629-ellie,4,"I strongly recommend The Poisoner's Handbook: Murder and the Birth of Forensic Medicine in Jazz Age New York by Deborah Blum. While I found the book less ""sensational"" (in the sense of lurid) than its tabloid name, I also found it far more fascinating. It is an extremely well-written and engrossing account of New York City during the Prohibition years as well as a history of the development of forensic medicine, particularly toxicology. There are shocking revelations of government activities in support of prohibition (such as the deliberate poisoning of available sources of liquor with the well-foreseen consequences of many additional deaths from alcohol poisoning), the political maneuverings of the time, the life of the average citizen in New York City (which I'll admit is of particular interest to me as an NYC resident!) and, well, yes, some pretty shocking crimes.So, ok, there is some reportage of lurid crimes which were pretty interesting as well.Something for pretty much everyone put together in a terrific package."

16,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2832635-cornerofmadness,5,"This is one of those rare non-fiction books that suck you in, every bit as smooth and engrossing as the best fiction book. It centers on NYC’s first medical examiner (as opposed to the elected and often corrupt coroner), Charles Norris and his chemist partner, Alexander Gettler. Between the two, a huge chunk of forensic medicine is gotten under way. Blum makes both men alive and as interesting as the best mystery characters. I was honestly sad by the end that I would never meet them (being contemporaries of my great grandmother).The time frame of the book goes from 1915 to the mid 1930’s encompassing all the mighty upheavals of that time. So not only do we get forensic history and many many criminal cases to read about, we examine prohibition and the Great Depression as well and the vehicle to do so was as the title suggests, poison. Blum looks at chloroform, wood and ethyl alcohols, carbon monoxide, arsenic, cyanide and thallium among others. Each poison gets its own chapter, its own criminal cases and how forensic chemistry got started (much of which was in fact created by or enhanced by Gettler and Norris). We get rich details of both New York and national history along the way. There are many side stories, each as interesting as the main chapter theme. I learned so much in this book and was entertained the whole time. For example, I didn’t know the government purposely made alcohol poisonous when it became clear prohibition didn’t work and bootleggers were winning. Their attitude ‘if they obeyed the law, they wouldn’t have died.’ Nice and chilling. You also get the idea that those screaming we were so violent now and it was so much better back in the day have never read a history book. These people prove we’ve always have been good at killing each other. This is an excellent book for people interested in jazz age history, forensic medicine and poisons (none of which would help you much today since they’re all easily detectible). I can’t wait to use some of this in writing historical fiction. I liked this book so much it’s not leaving my shelf."

This was absolutely phenomenal. Each chapter deals with a different poison prevalent in the 1920s, including carbon monoxide, wood alcohol, and radium.

I'm knocking off half a star simply because I could NOT deal with the number of times it was like ""They needed to test their theory so they went to the pound and got a bunch of dogs.......""

19,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54489623-the-captain,4,"Ahoy there me mateys!  For those of ye who are new to me log, a word: though this log’s focus is on sci-fi, fantasy, and young adult, this Captain does have broader reading tastes.  Occasionally I will share some novels that I enjoyed that are off the charts (a non sci-fi, fantasy, or young adult novel), as it were.  So today I bring ye a non-fiction title:the poisoner's handbook (Deborah Blum) Except this review has a twist.  The First Mate and I listened to this one together.  We discussed the book as we listened and I enjoyed his viewpoint so I ordered asked him to write a review.  So you get one from me and a bonus additional review from me crew.  Please note that I write like I talk and the First Mate writes like he thinks.  Hope you enjoy!From the Captain:I first heard about this book from the amazing what's nonfiction? blog.  Y'all should read her excellent review.  I thought this would be one the First Mate and I could enjoy together and I was correct.  The shortened title is a bit misleading because while it is about poisons, the actual focus is on how forensic medicine was established in New York City during the Prohibition era.  Absolutely fascinating!This historical account has quite a mix of features.  There is the chemistry behind poisons and also how chemists learned to establish cause of death using experiments.  It discusses how the coroner system worked before the use of science (craziness!).  There are true crime stories with the sordid details of both how the murders happened and the sensational trials afterwards.  There is insight into how horrible the over-the-counter medicines of the day were.  Prohibition is discussed at length as was manufacturing and the unhealthy working conditions (the radium chapter!).  Political machinations abound.  But the heart of the story is Charles Norris and Alexander Gettler, two of the hardest working men I have ever had the pleasure of reading about.  Seriously they are heroes for mankind.Aye, that list of topics may seem overwhelming but it really is a very accessible book.  The science components are easy to follow.  Toxicology turns out to be endlessly interesting.  Each chapter is loosely dedicated to a different toxin.  A lot of the work Norris and Gettler did to establish forensic guidelines involved trying to determine if a death was from murder or natural causes.I loved this one and only had two minor quibbles.  The Prohibition sections, while extremely interesting, seemingly advocated that the government was actively poisoning people to cause deaths.  Because of how the book jumps in and out of the discussion of Prohibition (somewhat frustratingly), the facts were a bit misleading.  Aye, the government put more toxic chemicals into the industrial substances bootleggers were reverse engineering to make the hootch.  The industrial alcohol was never meant for human consumption.  This did lead to deaths.  The government was trying to discourage the use of these toxic chemicals as alcohol additives.  Stupid on the part of the government and absolutely evil on the part of the bootleggers.  But drinkers were determined to get alcohol any way they could regardless of known health risks.  The Snopes article about the issue actually quotes Blum's material and clarifies the complexities of the issue.The other quibble is with the audiobook narrator, Coleen Marlo.  She did a fantastic job except for a pet peeve of mine.  Accents.  She distinguished some of the people by giving them accents when quoting them.  The French, Brooklyn, and other choices just sounded so fake and cliché.  Annoying.  Though the First Mate didn't really have the same problem.All together a wonderful read where upon finished leads me to want more information about a variety of topics.  I love when that happens.  Arrrrr!From the First Mate:A few weeks back I read Jeffrey Toobin’s book on the OJ Simpson trial, “The Run of His Life,” and I commented to the Captain how fascinating it was that so many areas of forensic science were obtuse to the jury in that case.  We’ve lived in a post-”CSI” world for so long that it’s difficult to comprehend a world where DNA and fiber analysis are not understood by most people. The Captain, of course, had a book in mind that showed that there was a time when even the police were skeptical of what uses forensic science could be put to.The subtitle of this book “Murder and the Birth of Forensic Medicine in Jazz Age New York” is really more accurate than “The Poisoner’s Handbook” as a title.  While the book does detail a few murderers who are involved in “the poison game,” the real focus of the book is the efforts of Charles Norris and Alexander Gettler to establish the role of forensic science as a vital component of crime investigation in the 1920s and 30s.  Norris is the New York Chief Medical Examiner and he deals with the seemingly endless bureaucratic attacks by various New York City Mayors. Gettler is the head chemist and he figures out all sorts of chemical tests that need to be performed in order to determine what chemicals may have led to a person’s death.  When the men get started they’re vilified by the establishment (Norris is himself arrested for performing an autopsy) and are constantly fighting for funds and respect.Each chapter of the book is nominally devoted to a single poison but typically it exists simply as a central focus from which to talk about what Norris and Gettler were up to in a particular time frame.  Specifically, we typically get the process by which Gettler figured out how to measure the amount of a particular poison in the human body. Unfortunately, a very reliable aspect of his process involved poisoning dogs and examining the effect various levels of dosing had on the animals.  The radium chapter was particularly harrowing.A peculiar aspect of the book are the chapters devoted to the poisonous properties of methyl and ethyl alcohol.  I’m certainly not denying that alcohol is a poison, just that it’s not one that is typically thought of when considering the poisons that are used to kill people.  Particularly interesting were the sections on the adulterants that the US government mandated be added to methyl alcohol to make it even more lethal in an effort to further deter people from drinking it.  I have to admit that this book is the first I’ve ever read about the odd chemistries that were involved in the battles between bootleggers and the government. I’ll certainly be keeping my eye out for more.Ultimately, “The Poisoner’s Handbook” is a fascinating read.  It’s technical enough that you get really do come to understand the broadest outlines of how the poisons work, while also being accessible in giving you heroes you can root for in Norris and Gettler.  They changed the world for the better, and their path to doing so was full of interesting, grotesque, and surprising turns. Highly recommended."
20,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6857324-lauren-stoolfire,4,"The Poisoner's Handbook is absolutely fascinating and not for the faint of heart. It follows the careers of Charles Norris, an NYC medical examiner, and Alexander Gettler, a toxicologist, who modernized and completely changed the game when it comes to forensic toxicology from about 1918-1936. Their work helped get the innocent out of murder charges and convict the guilty. One of the more well known cases today that they worked on was the Snyder-Gray case which inspired both The Postman Always Rings Twice and Double Indemnity."
21,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35088694-carly-friedman,4,"I really enjoyed this informative and engaging book about the start and development of forensic medicine. I loved learning about Gettler and Norris and their early research in forensic science. I learned a good deal of new information about poisons and their use in crime in the early and mid-1900s. My favorite sections detailed the research they engaged in and discussed more common toxins like leaded gasoline, lead, and alcohol. I am so glad I read this book!"
22,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1836077-lightreads,2,"Feh. In the afterward, the author thanks a whole bunch of people for helping her with the technical aspects of the chemistry. And I was like ""ahaha what technical aspects? What chemistry?"" This book is like the Youtube video of chemistry: the ""technical"" sections would read something like, ""he ground the tissue into a paste, then boiled it in a simple solution. And then he added nitric acid and the whole thing flared green!""That isn't chemistry, that's a Mr. Rogers voice over. And this is not science writing. It's history with a sprinkle of description using science words on top, with no exploration of how or why.The book could have been somewhat redeemed with interesting historical content, given that's what it was really doing. And there is a lot of stuff here about the founding of the first true American forensics lab, and the institution of a lot of modern law enforcement procedures against a corrupt political background. Oh, and a whole bunch of stuff about the homebrewed poisons of the prohibition era, when a glass of moonshine actually could kill you. But it was disorganized and shallow, with the usual journalist focus on the sensationalist details of cases without any real analysis or depth.And the fake ""science writing"" was astonishingly irritating. Didn't I just swear off nonfiction by reporters? Well, I'm doing it again, and this time I'll actually check first so it sticks."
23,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222319-jill-hutchinson,4,"This is an unusual but interesting book as it is a mix of the history, science, and true crime. The author traces the birth of forensic medicine which basically began in the office of the Medical Examiner of New York City. The use of poison as a means of murder was all-pervasive and had been since the days of the infamous Borgia dynasty. Science was at a loss to determine the presence of poison in a human body and murderers were having a field day. Drs. Charles Norris and Alexander Gettler changed all that in 1918 with trailblazing scientific detective work and became the founders of forensic medicine. The author cites famous and not-so-famous murder cases and how forensics played the major part in bringing the killers to justice. Each chapter deals with a particular poison from chloroform through thallium and explains the effects that each has on the body's systems. A fascinating subject which is well presented and enlightening. Recommended."

But this one just dragged for me and I never picked it back up. I don’t think I’ll be getting to this one again, but it honestly was pretty dang cool. I’d recommend it if you want to read about poisons and their histories."
25,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,5,"Lovely book on the birth of modern forensics. When two men - Carles Norris and Alexander Gettler, - took it upon themselves to revolutionize toxicology science and the methods used by medical examiners, murder by poison ran rampant in New York City. Prior to their contributions it was incredibly easy to get away with poisoning, because no real tests were created to find harmful substances in dead tissue. Often, medical examiners weren't even real physicians, but incompetent officials, guessing the cause of death and taking bribes to cover up crimes. Norris and Gettler introduced structure into the pathology office, argued with the Mayor's Office for adequate budget, used multiple control experiments to offer bulletproof evidence, and contributed personal time and finances to keep their department out of mediocrity. The book looks at multiple cases, broken down by the type of poison used, all flowing in a chronological order. These include intentional crimes of passion, accidental deaths, government-sponsored introduction of poisons into liqueur during the Prohibition Era, and the early days of FDA's inadequate treatment of harmful ingredients in medicine and cosmetics. There is drama, suspense, bootleggers, conniving vixens, odd accidents, insurance forgers, and scientific breakthroughs at every turn. Norris and Gettler tackle it all like the awesome, nerdy Batman and Robin of NYC. Once I picked up The Poisoner's Handbook I had a hard time putting it down."

I found the history fascinating. The author did a great job in detailing the information so it didn't sound like a wikipedia report. It amazes me how easy it was to poison people to get rid of them back in the day and how far research has come in determining certain causes of death regarding poison. I understand that research was important, but the dog experiments hurt my heart. "

28,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3848561-anatl,5,"This is the story of Charles Norris and Alexander Gettler, who contributed much of the groundwork for modern forensics and toxicology. I absolutely loved this book but I feel the need to warn animal lovers that they that the research of poisons in that era involved animal testing. The book starts with Prohibition and the fight against wood alcohol. It also covers Cyanide poisoning, Arsenic, Mercury, Carbon monoxide, Radium, Nicotine and Thallium. But mostly it's a good portrait of the first half of the 20th-century New York that fasinates with real crime tales about “Mike the Durable,”or the case that inspired James M. Cain’s two famous novels “The Postman Always Rings Twice” and “Double Indemnity.”"
29,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1628041-book-concierge,5,"Book on CD read by Coleen Marlo.The subtitle describes the book perfectly: Murder and the Birth of Forensic Medicine in Jazz Age New York. In the early 20th century poison was often the method of choice for murderers. Corruption ran rampant in New York City’s Tammany Hall-controlled coroner’s office. However, when Charles Norris was appointed chief medical examiner in 1918 things changed. With the help of toxicologist Alexander Gettler, Norris quickly set about making “cause of death” dependent on sound scientific studies, and put many a poisoner out of commission. But lest you think this is merely a true-crime book, Blum also gives considerable attention to other poisonings of the day – accidental asphyxiations, industrial poisoning, and the many instances of death due to additives used in Prohibition-era alcohol. The book is divided into chapters, each focusing on one element – mercury, chloroform, radium, carbon monoxide, etc – and moving the story from 1915 to 1936. Blum includes basic scientific information on the compounds, their effects on human tissues, and the scientific experiments / tests used to identify poisons in the body. It may not sound like it, but this is really a page-turner. What makes this more than a textbook or simple history is the inclusion of personal stories: the “radium girls” who painted luminescent watch dials and died of resulting aplastic anemia, or the bookkeeper exonerated of killing his family based on scientific evidence (instead of the popular opinion which resulted in his being accused). Blum brings the Jazz-Age New York to life – teeming slums, smoky speakeasies, and noisy streets. In contrast she gives us two scientists (and their team) who quietly toil in their laboratories to find answers to the city’s crimes, treating the dead with equal respect regardless of their station in life – millionaire or beggar. Coleen Marlo does a very good job of the audio version. Even when imparting relatively dry scientific information, she manages to convey a sense of interest and excitement in learning, which helped this listener maintain focus. The text version does include about 20 pages of notes and bibliography which are not read on the audio. The first time I read a book about forensic science I was in 7th grade. The subject has continued to fascinate me ever since. I highly recommend The Poisoner’s Handbook, even to non-science-geeks. "
30,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"A narrative of the careers of a city coroner, Charles Norris (no, not this Charles Norris) and a toxicologist, Alexander Gettler, who together blazed a path for forensic medicine.  Organized neatly with each chapter focusing on a different poison, from radium to arsenic to alcohol, the research on this one is fantastic (I’ve been saying that a lot lately but I’ve been lucky to read a lot of really, really well-researched nonfics this year).  I mean, it seems incredible that somehow we’ve never heard of an anarchist chef named Crones poisoning hundreds of people with arsenic in Chicago just for the giggles, or an unknown person poisoning upwards of 60 office workers via blackberry pie at a restaurant (the Shelbourne) in New York. Moreover, googling these occasions bring up very little information online- there’s no Wikipedia article about the Shelbourne incident, and the Crones case gets only a glancing mention in a Wiki about an Italian anarchist who Crones was a follower of. There’s just a tiny newspaper article on the Shelbourne case in a newspaper article. Most of the other online references are to articles written by this book’s author.  There’s a lot of really incredible finds like that in this book. A huge amount of detail included considering the lack of publication on some of these incidents! The beginning was a bit dry but it picks up. By the way, I read City of Light, City of Poison just before reading this one, and I recommend the pairing (yes, books should be paired like fine wines and cheeses). It’s interesting to consider how forensics, especially poison, has changed from then/there (Paris, 17th century) to nowish/hereish (1920s New York)."
31,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2375838-cheryl,4,"An unexpected treat! There are many kinds of poisons, but back in the early 20th century, there wasn't much knowledge about them. Often it was the case that a substance wasn't even known to be poisonous. Other poisons were known about but it wasn't known how to measure them or assess their action. It is written with a deceptively breezy style: there's a fair amount of science hiding in there but you barely notice it because the book is heavily laced with tales of nefarious doings and dastardly crimes, as well as tragic stories of ignorance leading to unexpected deaths. Mercury-laden tonics, ubiquitous arsenic distribution, beauty creams fortified with radium or thallium. Cyanide, mercury, carbon monoxide poisoning -- they all were deadly compounds attached to a roster of fascinating stories. But the dogged work of two uncaped crusaders of New York City -- Norris and Gettler, the first medical examiners and toxicologists -- helped create and define the field of forensic medicine. They brought science in to the light to show it could be used to solve crimes. They also tirelessly worked to demonstrate that Prohibition was deadly. It resulted in replacing legal alcohol with toxic alcohol alternatives, and blindness, paralysis and deaths skyrocketed. They were public service heroes, battling corrupt politicians, lazy bureaucrats, public apathy, and venal greed. Some battles are never won. Some things never change.Fascinating. "
32,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4578470-craig-monson,4,"Organized by poison (chloroform, wood alcohol, cyanides, arsenic, etc.) and chronologically (1915, 1918-19, 1920-22, 1922-23, etc.), the book opens a window onto the exploitation of chemicals for lethal ends and the development of forensic techniques specifically to discover and prove their use in any number of nefarious crimes. Writing for a general, “Science Friday”-type audience (but in a more literate and less long-winded style than that of many “Science Friday”-type speakers), Blum avoids bogging down in scientific jargon much more complicated than chemical formulas and is quick to balance it with grisly details from a long, satisfying string of chemically-induced murders. Science-nerdy, Sheldon-types may delight in sneering at the lack of science as hard as diamonds, but die-hard devotees of true crime will likely learn a lot of the how-to-do-it and why-it-works variety as the bodies continue to pile up over the years. Interestingly enough, those guilty of notably criminal behavior include local and national politicians, as well as heartless True Believers of the early-20th-century culture wars. Plus ça change. . . . "
33,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17420799-olive-fellows-abookolive,5,"I read this book for a book club and boy am I glad they picked this one.I've seen some other reviews complaining that it's heavier on the history than it is on the science, but I found it to be a good mix of the two. The focus is on the work of Charles Norris and Alexander Gettler, New York City's first medical examiner and toxicologist, respectively. We learn about developments in forensic science through their work: the main cases they come up against, the political climate, and the time period in which they lived. Blum paints their world so clearly with some of the best storytelling I've ever experienced in a piece of nonfiction. You get a thrilling narrative, a 1920s-1930s history education, and hard scientific facts all in one fun package. I was so taken in by the story that I had to force myself to take it slow so as to be able to retain my knowledge for my book club meeting.This book was fantastic. You should read it."
34,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24011982-cynda,3,"3.5 Stars Many others have and will rate this book higher: those in medical field, those who have been poisoned, those who write/read mystery stories.I read the book 1. Because GR groups keep choosing this book as group reads. Must be popular. Must be good. 2. Because recently I read Bellevue: Three Centuries of Medicine and Mayhem at America's Most Storied Hospital. Bellevue is a world-renowned hospital that has led US medicine, including in forensic studies. I felt as though I were re-tracing my imaginary steps that I had taken through Bellevue when reading the book about the history of the hospital.As a result of reading this book, I want to learn more about the FDA, its origins and development. Sometimes the FDA has had the power to protect us and sometimes not. I am interested inn the bigger picture. I am looking for a good and affordable book about the FDA."
35,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216284-mark,5,"This is the story of how forensic medicine was established and strengthened during the early 1900s in New York under the leadership of a remarkable medical examiner, Charles Norris, and his obsessively perfectionist pathologist and toxicologist, Alexander Gettler.Because Deborah Blum writes so well and is such a good storyteller, a book that could have been a dry recitation of scientific history has all the flow and crackle of a good novel. Each chapter is divided up by certain organic chemicals that become the focus of that section (carbon monoxide, methyl alcohol, arsenic, etc.). It's a bit of an artifice, because the movement through the book is also chronological, but it works.The structure allows Blum to tell great criminal forensic stories about relatives and others who poisoned people out of hatred or greed, but also larger societal trends, such as the huge increase in alcohol-related injuries and deaths during prohibition. As the ""wettest city in America,"" New York gave Norris and Gettler much support for their position that Prohibition not only was not creating abstinence in people, but making them drink harder and more dangerous liquor. One factoid I had never known was the fact that during Prohibition, the federal government had an active research program to make industrial alcohol much more poisonous than it was, in hopes of making it so dangerous that bootleggers wouldn't be able to sell it. Instead, it only made illegal alcohol more treacherous.The advent of the automobile age, along with illuminating gas used to light the many tenements of New York, also created a huge surge in carbon monoxide deaths.Between the gripping yarns of poisoners caught and only sometimes convicted, and these broader social issues, Blum has crafted a book that teaches us a lot about forensic medicine and organic chemistry without once sounding like a textbook or treatise. What a gifted writer."
36,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4968851-beth,5,"Holy Moley! This one is a smokin' good read. All about poisoning, both deliberate and accidental. It tells about the beginnings of forensic medicine, and how two men pioneered the modern era of pathology by uncovering the infinitely various causes of death by exposure to toxic substances...many of which were long believed to be benign, or even beneficial. The chapters on radium absolutely stunned me! For a terrifyingly long period of time, people handled, ingested, and even bathed in it, which led, of course, to many horrible deaths. The story begins in the early 20th century, and covers the often deadly substances that are the products and by- products of the modern Industrial Age. This reads like a riveting detective novel, and is filled with fascinating case histories of some of our country's most notorious poisoners-- some individuals, some corporate, and in the case of the 12 years of Prohibition, our own government. The motives were revealed along with the methods, and were heartbreakingly familiar and often breathlessly cruel. I'd never heard of the two men ( New York's first Medical Examiner Charles Norris, or gifted toxicologist, Andrew Gettler), but what a heroic and brilliant team they were. Our medical and scientific knowledge and our modern consumer safety net governing the substances and products that are marketed for profit to the consumer owe a great debt to these determined, selfless, and gifted men."
37,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2073876-jan,4,"Can a book about poison be fun? Sure it can, if you're morbid like me.Each chapter of Blum's book is about a different kind of poison. You learn how each poison kills, what the symptoms are, and what your body looks like on the inside after you're killed by it. She also provides very detailed descriptions of how chemists test body tissues for various poisons, which was interesting. She intersperses all of this with details of real poisoning cases, in addition to an analyses of how Prohibition affected the citizens of the U.S. Oh yeah, and she also details the birth of modern forensic science. Phew!It sounds like a lot for such a relatively short book, but it seems to fit together nicely and it's all pretty interesting. I thought this book was a great deal more accessible than the other Blum book I've read (Ghost Hunters). It was short and to the point. I sped through it pretty quick. My only complaint is that I would have liked to read about MORE poisoning cases, but I'm just morbid like that.If you like Mary Roach or non-fiction books about disease or murder, you'll probably like this one."

Along with toxicologist Alexander Gettler, Norris took on not only private murderers but big business and even the U.S. Government. (During Prohibition government chemists fought a savage war with bootleggers in which the poorest segment of society paid the price in increasingly lethal alcoholic ""beverages”.) This was also an era in which incredibly dangerous poisons (arsenic, thallium, radium) were readily available in a number of household products, or even advertised as health aids! This book is a fascinating read. I actually learned something about chemistry and there’s enough murder and bloodshed to satisfy any true crime buff. "

Dr. Charles Norris, the chief medical examiner of NYC, and his devoted toxicologist, Dr. Alexander Gettler, revolutionized New York's justice system by forcing it to pay attention to scientific evidence. Their painstaking, meticulous, and yet audacious work into chemicals' interactions with mammals helped catch and convict murderers. This isn't all forensic pathology and chemistry, though--there's a great deal of history, all woven together with the anecodotal tales of murderers, bootleggers, and accidental poisoners that Norris & Gettler encountered."

It is easy and fun to read....not dry at all."

Because I'm not fluent in chemistry, I would read one chapter at a time (they were broken out by different poisons) so I could absorb the information. That said, the information was not incredibly in depth and I think the average reader shouldn't have much trouble comprehending the different concepts. If you are looking for a science read, this was a really interesting way to relay the material, complete with stories of bungled poisoning during the 1920s. If you're looking for stories, you may find this a little flat. Also, go into this expecting lot of side material on prohibition. I found it interesting and enjoyable, but if you strictly picked this up for chemistry, that piece will feel a lot like filler. I'd rate this a PG-13 due to some disturbing images related to murder and mild language."

47,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4463803-aaron-wolfson,4,"The Poisoner’s Handbook is packed with scandalous murders. There’s Tammany Hall corruption, “drys” and “wets” fighting over Prohibition, and creepy science. These are all lots of fun, and very educational. But the centerpiece of the book is the story of how two men, Charles Norris and Alexander Gettler, created modern forensic science in America against overwhelming odds. While little-known today, the two are an archetypal example of the founding duo, in the mold of Gates/Allen, Jobs/Wozniak, even Lennon/McCartney. Not only do they predate those more famous partnerships, they arguably contributed more to the world. You should read this book if only because these men deserve far more notice for their efforts.Before Charles Norris, criminal deaths were handled by city coroners, who in New York City were notoriously corrupt. Part of the Tammany Hall Democratic machine, they sat in elegant offices and extracted graft from every crevice of their domain– from extra fees for death certificates and autopsies to bribes for favorable rulings on cause of death. Most damningly, these coroners had little to no medical expertise: this pathetic state of affairs meant that criminal investigations were nothing but guesswork, leaving astute killers free reign over the city.And such killers had unlimited access to the perfect tool: poison. Postwar America was awash in deadly poisons, which proliferated in various tonics, elixirs, and revitalizers at a time when the FDA was young and toothless. Even if the coroners were interested in helping the police and the DA fight criminals, they would have had no chance of detecting poison murders, what with their nonexistent forensic skill.Charles Norris changed all of this. He was a doctor with actual medical skills, but more importantly, he was a hard-driving man who refused to take no for an answer, a man dedicated to the cause of establishing forensic science in the U.S., with the political will to match. During the 20+ years of his tenure as New York City’s first chief medical examiner, he worked in the dingy labs he loaned from Bellevue Hospital, paying for equipment and parts of his staff’s salaries out of his own pocket. He was constantly battling New York’s alternately corrupt and reformist (read: cost-cutting) mayors to get additional funding for his cash-starved department, even as this same department was churning out scientific breakthroughs in detecting poisonous substances. Over time these advances built up an incredible reverence for his office’s findings across New York’s police stations and courtrooms. Norris insisted on developing and documenting strict procedures for everything his office did, and on following them to the letter. He performed thousands of autopsies, spent countless long nights in Bellevue’s labs, and ultimately worked himself to death. According to Blum, he took two vacations during his entire career in office.No less influential was Norris’s chief toxicologist, Alexander Gettler. Norris was the political and marketing guru behind the medical examiner’s office, but Gettler played the Wozniak to his Jobs. At the end of his life, in a rare interview, Gettler estimated he’d looked at a hundred thousand bodies. He was singly determined to learn as much about poisons, toxins, and anything that could cause death as he possibly could. Gettler developed or enhanced toxicologists’ ability to detect alcohol, arsenic, radium, thallium, cyanide, carbon monoxide, and hundreds of other substances. His experiments were exhaustive, and his results incontrovertible: where defense attorneys once openly mocked his witness-stand pronouncements (and juries followed suit), they later complained that juries listened unquestioningly to whatever Gettler said. His deputies, known as the Gettler boys, went on to head their own toxicology labs around the country, and they created the next set of advances in forensics and dry chemistry. He did the jobs of at least two men, despite working for chronically low pay; oh, and he also taught classes and published reams of papers (some of which are used to this day). Gettler caught murderers and exonerated innocents: people who would never have seen justice without his work.If Norris and Gettler were the Jobs and Wozniak of their time, then the New York City medical examiner’s office was one of the greatest startups of all-time. It helped pioneer a whole field on this side of the Atlantic, forensic toxicology, despite hardly anyone believing in it or understanding it, and it did so on a shoestring budget. Its incredible success created the political and cultural atmosphere that led to the eradication of poisons from daily-use products, the banishment of lethal intoxicants like lead and radium from American factories, and the granting of real power to the FDA.Anyone who wants to create an organization and make lasting change in the world had better study the work of Norris and Gettler.And if you read about them here, you also get lots of murder! You can’t lose!"
48,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5380374-dashie,5,"As Deborah Blum points out in her Author's Notes, ""anything in a large enough amount, can kill."" And that sort of sums up the underlying story of this book. But that's not all there's to it. It's also a story of the tireless efforts of the pioneer toxicologists struggling to teach people about the dangers of poison over and over again, their advise seemingly falling on deaf ears. It also opened my eyes to the fact that America has always been cruel to the American people, it's not something that appeared recently. Overall a nonfiction you should definitely read at some point in your life."
49,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,4,"I am going to preface my review by saying that I do not know if this was a fascinating book because it inherently is or because I find anything fascinating when I don’t know anything about it. This book has it all, poison, daring-do, prohibition, mobsters, murder, heroes, brilliance, and SCIENCE. It packs a whollop. This book will definitely make you realize that everyone has always been deranged, and it apparently takes very little to set people off. Frankly, I don’t know how any of us survived lacing our water with radium as a tonic. Sidenote- the radium chapters was perhaps the most haunting- learning of girls that glow in the dark until the day of their death, exhaling radioactive material from their breath as it leeches from their bones. It was a lot like learning about phossy jaw. It makes your cringe and not want to sleep.The only qualm I have with this book is with the overall editing. I liked the idea of doing the chapter poison by poison, but there was too much spillover in each chapter, so either that structure didn’t work or they should have chosen their stories more carefully. Wood alcohol (with good reason) made it into almost every chapter in the book, but at times it made the science confusing because suddenly you were talking about a very different system. The narratives also seem to stutter. There are times the Blum delves into the story of the murder, or accused murderer, and writes with flourish, drawing the reader in, only to abruptly stop and resume a much more journalistic manner immediately.Still that should not deter you from looking into this book if you have any interest in the birth of forensic science. We owe Norris and Gettler a great deal, and they should be remembered for their contributions. What they were able to accomplish with minimal tools, zero funding, and wet chemistry is nothing short of amazing. Each chapter could have been its own book, and each chapter had information that was individually fascinating (did you know arsenic poisoning was so common that they called it Inheritance Dust, oh lalala).I would give it 3.75 because by the end I really didn't want to put it down despite the organizational problems, and because it sent me down the rabbithole several times on the internet as I looked up Snyder's execution photo, information on inheritance dust, and the American borgia, and because I would definitly read Blum again.….One further qualm that I always feel its necessary to point out- Publishers being in love with misleading titles. There is zero Jazz in this book. There is talk of prohibition, and a lot of that was fascinating, but its not you delve into the shady scenes of the speakeasy where you encounter nefarious and intricate murder plots. And murder was discussed, a lot, but its not like there was an over-arching theme of murder. The murders themselves were not study, mostly they were discussed out of hand…. And a lot of the time they were accidents and not even murders, but that was never really distinguished because the focus was really on the science. All in all, I would say this is a title fail extreme."
50,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66104609-leah-maltzman,3,"The Poisoner’s Handbook by Deborah Blum is a book describing how toxicology grew as a scientific field and how we now test for certain poisons in corpses. The book goes over eleven different poisons, and their effects in addition to talking about Prohibition’s effects on medical examiners. Blum recounts many different cases involving the poisons and how they were used, giving readers a vivid image of the victims. I had very mixed feelings about the book. One of its strengths was the actual description of how the useful poisons affected people and the cases that were described. Reading about, specifically, Mary Frances Creighton made me want to learn more, especially after her first appearance ended with talking about how she “fooled so many people” (102). The story of her, somehow, coming out of a trial innocent, by she was almost certainly guilty of committing murder, intrigued me. Another case that made me want to keep reading was the case with “Mike the Durable.” It amazed me how much a man can survive before he is forcefully killed while unconscious. In the methyl alcohol chapter, it was blatantly clear that the substance was extremely poisonous, so when Mike Malloy was able to drink more than a full cup of straight methyl alcohol, it surprised me greatly, making me want to keep reading for an explanation. While the cases were interesting, there were also many things I did not like about the book. When I picked it to read, I thought it would be about poison. Then, as I continued reading, all I could see was the effect Prohibition had on everyone. Yes, the eighteenth amendment was seen as a cause of the many deaths in the 1920s, but it was mentioned in every chapter. Most of the description, to me, felt unnecessary and was just there to make the cases less heavy for the reader. Taking up multiple pages at the beginning to talk about corrupted politicians has nothing to do with the advancement of toxicology. For example, is talking about how “[city agents] indulged only in the really good liquor they’d confiscated” really necessary for talking about cyanides? When Charles Norris repeatedly writes to the mayor of New York for more funds, I do not think I need to hear about that more than twice. In addition, The formatting of the book was confusing to me. Each section of a chapter is a page long before the subject changes. If I am reading about mercury, then I want to read about the special case and not about the chemical composition of the poison, at least not until I hear about the entire case. Changing the subject right in the middle of the case made me confused and want to stop reading. In all, the book is very fascinating, there is no doubt about it. Every case was unique and special, some being about murders and others about accidents; However, the space taken up with talking about unnecessary historical problems and the many breaks in the middle of subjects made the book less enjoyable, making it seem very choppy."
51,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3727168-teresa-lukey,4,"The Poisoner's Handbook is full of interesting tidbits of information, which may be especially interesting to those who do not know much about the goings on during prohibition. Although I found the information a bit on the dry side, there was so much interesting information that I did enjoy the research it provoked.First, I'll say that wood alcohol is prominent throughout the entire book. I did not realize exactly what wood alcohol was prior to reading this book and now that I know I cannot believe people put something in their body that could be used as solvent or gasoline. It was like the meth of the 30's, people were so desperate to feel that high they were poisoning themselves like crazy from the sound of it.The section on Radium, was horrifying to me. It is unthinkable to me for Ra to be used as a cure-all for many ailments. The author goes in to some detail about how Ra was used to paint watch dials, so that they glowed in the dark. Woman painting in the factory were encouraged to wet the paintbrush in order to keep the tip pointed, thereby ingesting the radium. Woman in the factory started to become quite ill, they even lost there lower jaws and eventually passed on due to the way that Ra bonds with calcium, essentially stealing the bone. We also find out that Marie Curie, the scientist who discovered Ra, died as a result of her precious element-again this was another unknown for me.The author discuss chloroform and its uses. I did not know that this element was known to kill so easily and I surely did not know it would kill. You know-the movies make it look so harmless, but it is not. In this section the author notes that Ruth Snyder, who killed her husband with chloroform, was the inspiration for James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice. Her execution on the electric chair was secretly photographed and can be found online for people interested in the morbid.If you like subjects related to science, prohibition, life in the 30's or stories of people who murder and think they can get away with it, then you should enjoy this read."
52,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,3,"Eh. That is to say, please don't mistake my lukewarm rating for a comment on the quality of this book. As I read this, I chided myself for not appreciating it more as it was certainly well-written, well-researched, and engaging at times. But there you have it. I was simply not a sufficiently appreciative (or curious, maybe) reader for this book and found myself dragging my way through it as opposed to eagerly picking it up. So I can't honestly give it more than three stars, despite its admirable qualities.Basically, working poison by poison, this book describes several murders in the 20s and 30s and the evolution of forensic medicine from corrupt, bribable coroners looking away from murder evidence to actual scientists performing autopsies and working tirelessly with their microscopes to determine the true cause of death. Each chapter focuses on one element, describes its chemical action, offers perhaps a bit too much detail on its workings in the body (think Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers), describes one or more well-publicized murders with the element, and discusses the early toxicologists' struggle to scientifically determine the truth around these murders. Despite the sensational appeal of many of the murders and Deborah Blum's good writing, the whole thing got repetitive for me after a while and I was glad to be done with it.If the topic sounds interesting to you, please don't let my review put you off. People with a pre-existing interest in chemistry, true crime, and/or popular history may find this book more appealing than I did. Unfortunately for me, my interest level in these topics was mild at best and despite the book's virtues, it didn't manage to raise my level of curiosity."
53,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/944359-rosemary,4,"Okay, you have to understand something about me. I love chemistry. I love chemistry so much that they invented an Advanced Chemistry class at our high school for me and my friend Cindy. And I was the lab assistant for the science teachers--it was my job to prepare all the equipment, and the solutions. I don't know if it's still true, but then the science closet was full of very high concentrations of chemicals and boxes of distilled water. I made up the solutions used in all the classes except for some of the Regents chemistry experiments. I still get nostalgic remembering the difference between molal and molar concentrations. I sometimes dream of having my own titration setup. And all those lovely bottles of really dangerous substances to play with. *sigh*Did I mention, I love chemistry.So this book was like handing a bottle of bourbon to an alcoholic who has been ""dry"" for thirty years. The author talks about chemical formulas and the properties of elements, and the processes of attachments of elements in the human body and how they interact with body processes. And then there are lots of interesting murders. And patent medicines that kill people. And speak-easies. And closed minded, corrupt public officials.What's not to like!?!And best of all? The science is solid, and the protagonists (to the degree there are any) are real people, who did real good.Highly recommended but be warned--it's a very science-geeky book!"
54,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3537134-kyrat,3,"Wanted to like it more than I did. Didn't make it past the mercury chapter (around page 130). Actually I probably would've kept reading but it was due at the library.I think the writing style and the grouping by drug, rather than a chronological order threw me off.The story kept bouncing around in time, yet going back to the same people, and even referencing the poisons from earlier chapters.Also, not being a chemist I was a little bored when they actually described every element and every stage the test. Something like "" poison X corrodes the organs or keeps the blood from absorbing oxygen"" or ""tests involving ground up liver & chemicals would reveal...."" would have sufficed instead of a paragrah on each of these. The elements I did find interesting were the poisoning cases, I found the solving or not solving and the murder/accident element to be quite interesting. I know this is non-fiction, but I had hoped this would be more like Caleb Carr's ""The Alienist"" where he explored the roots of psychology while solidly grounded in a mystery. Ah well, worth a read."
55,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7400591-writer-s-relief,5,"Deborah Blum’s THE POISONER’S HANDBOOK is steeped in history, Tammany Hall politics, and early forensics. The book follows Charles Norris, the chief medical inspector of New York City, and his toxicologist Alexander Gettler as they become trailblazers in the study of poisons. Each chapter focuses on a specific poison—arsenic, wood alcohol, mercury, and more—and presents an actual case of death by poisoning that Gettler and Norris must solve using techniques that were exceptionally innovative at the time. Meanwhile, THE POISONER’S HANDBOOK also presents an interesting history of life in Jazz Age New York City.Not all the deaths by poison studied in the book are murder. Blum sheds light on the dangers of prohibition: people would drink whatever alcohol they could get a hand on--including alcohol from distilled wood, which was extremely poisonous. The Government’s solution was to add more poison to readily available household alcohols in an effort to stop people from drinking them. This, of course, resulted in many more deaths, leading Norris and Gettler to not only become pioneers in forensics, but also outspoken opponents of prohibition."
56,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/176618-noiresque,4,"An excellent example of how to frame and execute a non-fiction book that focuses on a topic. The author does an excellent job of giving you a broad view of the poisons used in this era, the science that grew up around how to detect it, and a reason why she has picked this particular era (mainly because of Prohibition in the US).She handles the personalities involved very well, without dwelling so long on someone that you get bored. She delves into the science of the poisons and forensics to the point where you can understand and appreciate it. A first-rate, enjoyable, informative read. I wanted to stay up later and later to keep reading, and that is rare for non-fiction. She has picked some great case studies on poison use, and they are fascinating.Mainly we are left with a great portrait of Norris and Gettler, the two scientists who do the bulk of the forensic work in NYC at this time. Dedicated, skilled, but not one-dimensional, I found myself rooting for them, understanding them, and appreciating their largely unheralded contributions."
57,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5547618-neil-hepworth,5,"The Poisoner’s Handbook is a captivating blend of 1920’s crime stories and the chemistry that made it all possible. Blum’s book is easy to read (though it assumes an intelligent reader), the chemistry is never overwhelming, and the two gentlemen that she chose to follow throughout the chemical boom of the Roaring 20’s led fascinating jobs filled with mystery, murder, death, ground brains and Bunsen burners. And at under 300 pages, it is just the right length.I often use non-fiction books such as this to cleanse my palate (as it were) if I’ve had a bit too much fantasy and SciFi. This book did the trick. Also, reading the anecdotes in this book makes me want to quit my job and write murder mysteries because there are just so many sneaky ways of killing people! Fortunately, all y’all are safe - I very nearly failed junior Chemistry in high school, and sometimes, even measuring out teaspoons of coffee grounds in too much chemistry for me. I guess I’ll need to hire an evil genius assistant..."
58,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68314276-daisy-garcia,4,"I liked this book, it wasn't what I expected, but in reality I didn't know what to expect. I didn't truly get in to this book until the first chapter. The prologue wasn't as attention grabbing as I expected. We got to witness how they solved crimes with the lack of technology we have now. How they had to rely on their skills and the evidence they had. How they had come to conclusions by doing various tests (which involved killing dogs). How they had to fight for their career, they didn't have the resources they needed. One of them even had to put in their own money to but equipment. This book wasn't just about all the poisons they discovered over time, but also the story of the man who saw enough dead bodies that can scar anyone for a life time. How dedicated he became, how everyone respected him. This isn't an action and adventure book, it's something that actually happened. There's not a bomb going off on every other page. It's not a romance book, well, it mentions it, but it the plot doesn't revolve around it. "
59,1594202435,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56704-ashley,4,"This is an incredibly fun book-- if a book about poisons can be called ""fun."" Blum's book is as much a true crime book as it is a history of particular poisons. The book is organized chronologically around particular murders or industrial accidents and the scientists in New York City who ferreted out the causes of these deaths. The major recurring theme in the book is Prohibition-- the poor alcohol substitutes and additives bootleggers used in the 1920s provided the NYC forensic inspectors with a wealth of material to analyze. I highly recommend this book to fans of murder mysteries (you'll learn how arsenic and cyanid really work), history buffs, and the slightly morbid. It's a fast and compelling read. Scientists may quibble with Blum's tendency to personify elements (she says things like a hydrogen atom ""hangs on to this loop like a tired swimmer clutching a life preserver) but for the average reader, this book is a delightful read."
