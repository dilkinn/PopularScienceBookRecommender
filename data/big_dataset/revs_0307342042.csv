0,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1971718-b-rule,2,"I didn't finish this book. The author gets points for being exhaustive, but... he loses points for being exhaustive. A lot of the book is just lists of things some birds do. And since birds are so diverse, those lists get LONG. And not necessarily organized by any particular principle. While I usually like this sort of infodump, I just couldn't get into it here. There needs to be some narrative structure or hook that keeps you awake. Sadly, I didn't find one before Izzzzzzzzzzz"
1,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,4,"This is a book that took me longer to read than any other book of 2016. And I stuck to the read diligently. But I think it is only going to be appreciated by those with scientific classification onus and supreme interest and patient love of BIRDS. There are many species and this is no short cut to their placements, shapes, locales, and habits. Far, far more than most people would want to know, IMHO. And posed in bird study language prose, at that. MANY terms to learn if you are a novice. More than in any Biology course or Aves genus survey.There were some aspects that I never knew or realized and that absolutely intrigued and would allow for further knowledge of the language needed to describe and observe birds at hand, or birds during travel, or birds as pets. Words like cline. The best chapter was upon how human cognition or ""people think"" can or cannot translate to ""bird think"" or cognition that is quite apart from a Skinner response or stat behavioral reaction. There were excellent philosophical theory points, but for me ruined by preaching. Especially when some huge characterizations for human behaviors involved within the ""philosophy"" hold intrinsic flaws. As if all wars are only the result of materialism. They are not. But what he knows about birds and their natures, habits- is more than you'd ever be able to forget. I'm going to look at my Wood Ducks differently, let me tell you."
2,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7278262-sher,3,"The writer tries to do much in 400 plus pages besides just covering the natural history of birds. Tudge has chapters on the mind of the birds, bird conservation and the history of extinct species, and even a chapter on prehistoric birds and bird classification. I got lost in the detail in some of this book, but I have studied birds enough that I found much of his esoteric details on species I know --fascinating. Because Tudge is British, many birds of the UK are covered, and although he uses metric measurements --pounds - ounces and feet are always provided in ( ).Definitely not recommended for the casual reader, but if you are seriously into birds and natural history, you should find some gems here. "
3,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24482190-marissa-f,3,"As a birder, I enjoyed all the parts of the book with details about birds’ lives and ancestry, which luckily comprised most of the book! I learned a lot that I didn’t already know. My rating is not higher, however, because the sections discussing economics, philosophy, psychology and politics that came up were boring and hard to get through, and had me ready to get back to the birds. "
4,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10138542-chris-leuchtenburg,2,"This book is packed with fun facts like the 100-minute copulation of Vasa Parrots and the 25,000-mile annual migration of the Arctic Tern, but all of those facts without a central purpose weigh down the text. I am an avid birdwatcher, but this book was too much of a good thing. The narrative often rambles, so it isn't at all clear why the author wrote this book. The rambling and the long, long lists of factoids made it feel like I was trudging through Tudge's book. I skipped 96-page chapter four (All the Birds in the World: An Annotated Cast List) entirely. "
5,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5087715-kerry,4,"Wow, it took me ages to finish this book (18 months or so). The first half was a long trudge through a survey of every bird family. Exhaustive but lots of interesting things in there to keep me going. The second half was a fascinating look at how different birds feed, breed, think, and behave. "
6,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16074792-tutankhamun18,4,"Great book! The first eight chapters I loved, his style is easy and conversational and yet he still provides a wealth of hard hitting science. The 9th chapter about the mind of birds asks some interesting questions but for a biology student these have already been made and discussed and so nothing was really added in this chapter. Particularly after reading the book by Nathan Emrery. But this is not a fault of the book... "
7,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3140428-june,2,Don't waste your time. This author seems to have an inflated opinion of himself and never passes up a chance to stick it to Americans (the military man is a natural born killer??). All I wanted to do was learn more about birds but the author ruined that experience by his warped political views scattered into the chapters. Wish I had my money (and time) back. 
8,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14004933-kelly-macfarlane,4,"Eminently readable (by a non-specialist, non-scientist, like myself) account of birds and what makes them tick. "
9,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,4,"This is a rather wonderful summation of current knowledge regarding birds, beautifully written, with some rather lovely line drawings (for those of you expecting some nice colour photos bve warned: there are none...) and covering just about anything a lay person might want to know about the current state of knowledge regarding those amazing creatures we know as birds.Admittedly, there is the occasional feeling that the book is providing one with too much information, but it appears to me that the biological definitions cannot be dealt with otherwise. The science is provided as it is understood to be at the beginning fo the 21st century; yet the author is never insistent that only one view is permissible: he presents alternative views without rancour, and is most gentle about it all...It is obvious from this work that the study of birds is comparatively in its infancy, but that does not say that we are completely ignorant. Birds are far more fascinating and interesting the more we learn from them. Indeed, the author suggests that as we learn more about them, the more we actually learn to understand ourselves, essentially because it forces us to re-evaluate our preconceptions; and those preconceptions are more indicative of our 'definitions' of ourselves as 'different'.The final chapters of the book talks about our 'responsibility' to the world, and how our actions influence, for better or for worse (often mostly the latter!), our relationships not only to birds, but to all life forms on earth. More and adequate funding is required by responsible governments to examine, study, marvel at, and untimately protect this valuable resource. As Tudge tells us at the end:""In short, birds are wonderful to behold. They can bring us pleasure wherever they are. But also, the more we look at them, the more they tell us about ourselves and the way the world really is."""
10,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/558700-ed,4,"I’ve become interested in birds lately. They’re everywhere! I want to know more about them! From this book’s cover I was kind of expecting a casual introduction to robins and starlings and blue tits and other garden birds, but this book was a lot more than that. It’s about pretty much every bird there is. There’s lots of interesting stuff on the origins of birds, and their various behaviours. There’s a big chapter in the middle that goes into all the different bird families, which was interesting but, as another reviewer mentioned, did feel like one big long list. There’s tons of information and I only absorbed a fraction of it, I’m sure. This book is definitely a broad overview, not going in-depth about any particular species, but I think it’ll be a great starting off point for further reading.Really easy to read writing style, too. Though in places it’s written with typical British indirectness, and occasionally he uses words like ‘could’ and ‘may’ too freely and I was left wondering exactly in what sense he meant them.I was kind of apprehensive starting out when the book seemed to be taking a religious bent, but thankfully the mentions of god and Christianity are kept to a minimum and don’t impinge on the science. However, personally I’d much prefer they weren’t there at all - they wouldn’t be missed. It was weirdly incongruous in a science book, written in the 21st century, to have these references to human myth thrown in. As I said, it’s not that invasive, but do be warned if you’re like me and religion isn’t your thing."
11,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2256347-robert,4,"A tour of what we know and what we are learning about birds. There is one chapter that surveys all of the birds of the world. It's a bit encylopedic and I skipped it. But the rest is engaging and packed full of detail, historical and otherwise.One good example of these marvelous details, of the many that stuck with me, is his example of a cline -- a population, generally spread out geographically, that varies continuously from one end to the other with individuals successfully mating only with those that are neighbors to each other:""One group of gulls forms a cline that runs right around the ARctic Circle, and their color varies continously from a silvery gray to dark slaty gray. All along the cline the gulls in any one place breed perfectly happily with their neighbors on either side. But the gulls at the two extreme ends of the cline are so different that they cannot, or at least do not, breed with each other. In fact, both ends of the ciruclar cline meet around Britain and are regarded as separate species. The silvery-gray one is the Herring Gull...and the dark one is the Lesser Black-backed Gull""Not to be overlooked: the Further Reading section at the end."
12,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2546274-james,5,"Not a guide to birds, but an introduction and discussion of what birds are, including extensive glances back into the fossil record as well as assessments of current (often grim) bird habitats, populations, and prognoses.Since the book deals with the fossil record, it also of necessity discusses the entire evolutionary development of bird phylogeny as currently understood. Tudge fearlessly leaps into the world of DNA phylogeny and highlights major portions of the current structure that likely will shift, fall, move, or otherwise change dramatically in response to new evolutionary data derived from DNA studies.Long sections on bird feeding, reproduction (including sex), nesting, environment, intelligence, mind, conservation efforts, and more.Extremely well written, and not nearly as technical as I have made it sound. Quite pleasant and conversational, actually.I highly recommend this to anyone with a remote interest not only in birds, but science in general and biological sciences in particular."
13,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88991-mark-desrosiers,4,"Colin Tudge is a remarkable writer in that he can remain both authoritative and filled with doubt in a sentence. Along with a bit of angular Anglo wit, this makes for a groovy page-turner about birds: their evolution, abundance, behavior, classification, and strangeness. Although one brave and huge chapter depicting the dramatis personae -- every avian order in the 2010 taxonomic system -- will bog you down as he tries to say something interesting about them all, the rest of the book is a delight. Digressions and controversies all over the place, and as always the quicksand of ambiguity, not just in bird evolution (which he engages with both vast knowledge and poetic confusion) but basics such as speciation and behavior. And penises. Most birds have none. Some have baffling huge ones. "
14,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3027501-leilani,5,"An absolutely brilliant immersion in everything Bird, written in thoughtful prose with a wonderfully dry wit. The sections on evolution, eating, mating, and bird consciousness were fascinating, filled with lively anecdotes and clear descriptions of the science involved. The listing of all the bird families in the world did slow me down a bit, but even that chapter had interesting tidbits scattered all the way through. The last two chapters, about our historical/cultural views of humanity's relation to the rest of nature and how it needs to be re-evaluated, included lots of material for further thought, and I'm looking forward to checking out some of the books he listed for additional reading!"
15,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20954866-travis,0,"A random book that caught my interest at the library. It is well written and interesting, and I think I would like to read more of it, especially a section that examines all of the currently defined orders of birds and example species from each. And yet I've had this book checked out for several months now and it never quite catches my interest enough, or drags me into it so that I must read more. And consequently I don't read it and feel guilty about not doing so, and so I give up for now, maybe to revisit it at some time when birds are more on my mind and learning details about them seem more engaging to my lines of thought."
16,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4356381-troy,2,"Tons of material in here, not easy to just sit down and read, easier to take it in a little bit at a time. As a comprehensive study of birds, this book is great. Thorough and detailed, Tudge looks at all aspects of this animal and presents it in a clear way. As a non-fiction book, it was a bit dull and boring at times, occasionally repetitive, and overall just far too long to appeal to the layperson. "
17,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5910965-roger,5,"I thought this book was going to be what the title says. I was wrong. I started it thinking I was going to have a pleasant little stroll and ended up on a massive journey which at times was pretty rough tough going. I have learned a tremendous amount, I have been encouraged to read further, and at times the comments have utterly chimed with my own sensibilities- a very scary and interesting travel with some amusement and lots of horror within its pages. "
18,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/336616-clarissa,4,"This is a wonderful book full of entertaining facts about birds and how they live. Colin Tudge is quite funny at times, and birds do many interesting things. For example crows have been seen to make and use tools.Konrad Lorenz once had a jackdaw who was fond of the maid. To show it's affection it would try to stuff caterpillars into her ear!"
19,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3323077-catherine-thompson,5,"This book has changed the way I look at birds. I've always liked birds, with the exceptions of gulls and pigeons, but now I can't even look at a herring gull the same way as I always have. Tudge delves into the lives of birds with humour and a keen eye. You'll learn things you didn't even know you didn't know! "
20,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1165121-patricia,4,"This book calls for a slow reading and then a rereading. It's packed with wide-ranging detail that takes some time to start to sink in. All that detail conveys wonder and delight, though, in author's personal, personable style. One of the most wonderful chapters explores how birds might think. "
21,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1851057-billy,4,"What a wonderful book. Told with great love and affection for its subject, this is a story of the growth of scientific knowledge backed by the growth of the human heart and spirit.Through birds, Tudge helps us get a handle on all of life."
22,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3738925-laith-el-moghrabi,4,A nice enjoyable read. Although I am a birdwatcher but there was a lot of info that was new to me. I would recommend to people who would like to know more about these amazing creatures.It's a very good awareness book for birds and nature as a whole
23,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8700346-kathe,5,"Love this book, after several re-readings I truly appreciate the deep understanding of birds and their lives. Wow. Now to find more books by Colin Tudge. British, of course. This book so complete, so detailed, I'll refer to it often."
24,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2374945-florence-millo,5,"An excellent book on birds, their ancestry, their feeding, migrating, & mating habits, and their future in the hands of mankind. I especially enjoyed his little personal asides and his sense of humor. Really good book. "
25,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1312257-colleen,5,"An excellent book. After an introduction to evolution and bird physiology and an overview of species, it gives information on mating, child rearing, migration, feeding and social structure. A nice mix, primarily of science, but with a bit of philosophy for good measure "
26,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17066093-tania-greenwood,4,"Excellent text covering just about any and every bird in existence (and a few that are not). Tudge 's knowledge of birds is incredible, and he writes in such a way that the book's information is accessible and often humorous. Loved this! This was the non-fiction text in my 2017 reading challenge. "
27,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/910909-j-d,5,"This is a fascinatng survey of current knowledge about birds. Tudge is an able ornithologist, a capable advocate for avains, and a fine, entertaining writer."

29,0307342042,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2588430-david-r,4,This is a surprisingly readable text in light of the high density of material. In spite of small flaws I would recommended book to bird enthusiasts at any level.
