Schutt sucks all the fun out of cannibalism, swapping morbid curiosity and sensationalism for stilted prose and heavy-handed science. "
1,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent,4,"Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History is a book about cannibalism.Laced with dark humor, Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History covers cannibalism in many in its many forms. Schutt starts with the animal kingdom, noting nutritional and evolutionary advantages to snacking on your own species. Tadpoles do it, insects do it, even the monkeys in the trees do it.The bulk of the book deals with human cannibalism, from the Neanderthal to the present day. There's cannibalism for medicinal reasons, like epileptics drinking blood in Victorian times, to powdered mummies being injested, to cannibalism for religious reasons. Religious and cultural views on cannibalism are explored, as is the grand daddy of them all, the Donner Party. Schutt deliberately sidesteps cannibal serial killers since that topic has been sensationalized to death by the media. The modern placenta-eating movement is covered in great detail, as are kuru and similar diseases.The writing in Cannibalism is engaging, tinged with Schutt's dark brand of humor. I devoured the book in two long sittings like a tribesman not wanting his relative's corpse to go to waste as food for maggots. Apart from Bill Bryson, I'm not usually drawn to non-fiction but this book was really hard to put down.If I had to pick out something to bitch about, it would be that kuru and other spongiform encephalopathies were given a little too much space. Apart from that not mentioning the episode of The IT Crowd that was about a cannibal, I have no complaints. I recommend to anyone even remotely interested in cannibalism. Four out of five stars. "

This is a study about cannibalism as it happens around the world , how cannibalism has used by colonial powers to brand cultures as such and then using that as an excuse to colonize them. It also dwells into the dinner party and it reaches an agreeable conclusion , I do think that this book will enlighten whoever is interested in this topic , and I can promise that if you read this book, you'll have a good time and learn something new , maybe it's just the anthropologist in me . :)"
3,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8836060-michelle,4,"I got weird reactions from my co-workers while I was reading this book. I explained that I’m planning to go on a camping trip, so I’m reading some survival guides, starting with this book. Long story short -- I read this book in peace!But really, “Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History” is not really a survivor’s manual, get a hold of yourself! The book explores the practice across the animal kingdom, and argues that we can actually learn a lot from observing any species that sometimes eats its own kind -- including our own. The book starts by introducing you to cannibalism in animals (which happens more often than one may think) before moving on to incidents in human history, up into modern times, and then even addresses the taboo associated with cannibalism and where it may stem from. At the very beginning, Bill Schutt tells the reader that he, in no way, is there to sensationalize those who the public may consider the ""modern day cannibals"" of recent history and refuses to give any attention to murders or serial killers and their acts. I can appreciate that, since I feel like those people, their lives, and their actions are something that are so sensationalized already -- and if that's what you're looking for then you could always find that somewhere else. This book is about cannibalism in nature, in survival situations, and in culture. I thought the animal science and information was fascinating and it made me think a lot about where taboos come from and how our abhorrence for cannibalism may differ greatly with another culture.Schutt’s wry tone is well-suited to this scientific retelling, and I found myself laughing on most occasions, cringing on the rest. Cannibalism has much to teach us about evolution, disease, racism, and even familial sacrifice and love. And it also, surprisingly, makes for delectable reading!"

Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestI blame Bill Nye for fostering in me a fascination with all things science (something I think he'd gladly take the credit for). Romance novels might be my one true love, but pop science nonfiction is the other woman, my secret mistress, the one I keep coming back to again and again on the sly.I was trying to talk about why this book is so good, but my friends and family were having none of it. So instead, I'm going to talk to you, my delightful captive audience, and let me just warn you right now that if the thought of reading about people eating other people squicks you out in a major way, you might want to consider hitting the ""pause"" button and exiting stage left.Don't say I didn't warn you!P.S. In case it weren't obvious, seeing as how this book isn't published yet, I received a copy of this to review honestly from the publisher + Netgalley. CANNIBALISM: A PERFECTLY NATURAL HISTORY is written in the style of Mary Roach. What I mean is that it's a mixed bag of anecdotes, ranging from the scientific to the pop-cultural, with a lot of (interesting) tangents. The author has a wry, tongue-in-cheek sense of humor that keeps rearing its head, but sometimes he'll get too caught up in the subject to be funny, and this variance in tone is a bit jarring.The prologue opens up with some examples of cannibalism that are readily accessible to the public: Hannibal Lecter, and the inspiration behind him: Ed Gein. After a compelling introduction, Schutt launches into cannibalism in the natural world. Birds eating the eggs of other birds. Spiders and praying mantises eating their mates. Tadpoles eating other tadpoles. Sharks eating their fellow baby sharks in utero. Cannibalism is rarer in mammals, but there are examples of it, especially when said animals are overcrowded and over-stressed (think hamsters).Next, he talks about cannibalism in ancient history, like in cave people and dinosaurs. It's more difficult to prove this, because there are so many variables that you can't control for, and I think these chapters were fascinating because they really show how much detective legwork archaeologists have to pull in order to give us science.After this, there are a couple chapters about cannibalism in culture. Pop-culture and mythological cannibalism (Hansel and Gretel, TITUS ANDRONICUS, the Chronos myth, etc.), endo and exocannibalism (for example, eating your family to honor their bodies vs. eating your enemies to gain their strength), medicinal cannibalism (eating body parts or drinking blood for medicinal purposes), placenta eating (Buzzfeed did it), and cannibalism in history.Two historical accounts of cannibalism really stood out to me and that was 1) Queen Isabella issued an edict saying that only New World peoples who were uncivilized and/or cannibals could be enslaved, so Columbus and his men intentionally and wrongfully labeled many island tribes as ""cannibals"" so they could be enslaved and sold, and 2) George H.W. Bush was the only man in his group to survive being eaten by an isolated, starving group of Japanese men during WWII, in what came to be known as the Chichijima Incident.The last couple chapters were about prion diseases, which I actually knew a lot about because I read this great medical mystery on the subject a few years ago. It's called THE FAMILY THAT COULDN'T SLEEP and it's about Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, scrapie, kuru, and spongiform encephalitis, and how they are all linked (spoiler alert: cannibalism). Schutt interviews some of the scientists who pioneered this research and some who are continuing to develop it, including one woman who believes that these diseases might be caused by a sneaky virus, and that the malignant proteins are just symptoms to an altogether more sinister cause.If you are interested in science books and have a strong stomach, I heartily recommend that you read CANNIBALISM: A PERFECTLY NATURAL HISTORY. It's a fascinating and balanced look at a taboo subject, and I learned a lot about so many things I am now kind of wishing I hadn't.Read it. I dare you.3.5 stars."
5,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt,5,"When the mention of cannibalism enters a discussion, many think of human skulls being used as soup bowls or how a liver might be nicely accompanied by some fava beans. However, Bill Schutt argues that these have been overly dramatised views and were likely drummed up from a horror movie or documents in history meant to demean a specific group. His exploration of cannibalism throughout the various species does include humans, though there are but one minute example of the overall study found herein. Schutt argues that the idea of eating one’s own species—how we would define the idea of cannibalism—is not strictly for reasons of starvation, but also for social order, ritual, and to cull the population. He speaks about some birds, specifically those in the ‘raptor’ classification, whose young target the slow to hatch siblings. These younger and less vigorous hatchlings will be bullied by siblings and either eaten when times are tough, or tossed out of the nest to ensure the plentiful food does not need to be shared too many ways. There are also some of the interesting species who use cannibalism as a form of sexual activity, whereby the female will obtain the needed fertilisation and then dispose of her mate in short order. While the praying mantis and black-widow spider come to mind, there are also varieties of snails who follow this same practice, leaving the reader to wonder if their next posh appetiser might once have been a killer mother! Schutt not only looks at the animal kingdom, but turns his attention to humans and cannibalism. Once used as a societal weapon, cannibalism labels were discussed and documented by Christopher Columbus during his trips to the New World. He discussed how tribes would eat their enemies by hacking them to bits and then cooking them up for a meal. Columbus also depicts this as more of a celebratory way to exact victory, than the need to sustain one’s self with food. Thus began the branding of peoples who were not as refined as cannibalism or savages, though Schutt argues that some of these reports were likely exaggerated tales, drummed up to earn the respect an awe of those back in Spain. Interestingly enough, humans have used a form of ritual cannibalism in one of their major monotheistic religions since the Common Era. Christianity’s central theme of the body and blood of Jesus with bread and wine has long been glossed over. Schutt discusses the Vatican’s argument of transubstantiation and how Catholics are to feel they are sharing the actual body and blood in that symbolic changeover has rarely caused anyone to bat an eye. However, it is right there in the Eucharist and Schutt can find no one within the Church who calls this an abomination or ‘sick’ act. Continuing the human cannibalism discussion, Schutt uses his longest chapter to tackle one of the most infamous events of the act in American history. The Donner party sought to travel from Missouri through to California in the 1840s. When they took what some felt was a shortcut, they were trapped in a massive snowstorm and left without food. Early accounts depict members of the 87 adults and children turning to killing and eating one another for sustenance, though Schutt argues that some of this was pure fallacy, where modern examination of the remains clearly showed mules and other livestock to be the primary victims. Still, it makes for some great reading and explains some of the modern jokes and barbs that are tossed around.In a final section of the book, Schutt explores not only the ritual cannibalism of some cultures far off the beaten path, but also the anthropological documentation (or lack thereof) surrounding the activity. While it is likely taking place, when asked directly, elders would discount that there was anything of that nature within their village. However, it was more because of the stigma outsiders offered about the practice than complete embarrassment surrounding it that led the the lie. Schutt further examines the fact that many groups consider the cannibalistic rituals to be so sacred that they are not flouted to the general public, much as sexual activity and defecation would not be a public display. Schutt’s research and interviews sheds some light on the issue and proves enlightening to the curious reader. He further explores how the secretive nature of the rituals also led to an inadvertent cover-up surrounding a serious brain disease, akin to what many know in the vernacular as Mad Cow Disease. Women and children were contracting the disease from infected victims of sacrifice and thereby spreading it through ingestion of diseased flesh and organs. A fascinating look and analysis, though surely not for the weak of constitution. A great book to open the eyes of the curious reader, while they remain baffled at how the world around them seems to work in such unique ways. Recommended to those who love to learn as they read, as well as the reader who is always seeking to think outside the box.I stumbled upon this book by Bill Schutt and thought that it might be a wonderful reading experience, enlightening as much as it was entertaining. Schutt, a trained invertebrate zoologist, offers a wonderful glimpse into the world of the animal and insect kingdoms without shying away from much. He explores not only cannibalism, but also the natural birthing and mating techniques of many animals, as well as how vastly different they are from humans. This sheds light on just how unique the world around us tends to be, which ushers in a great discussion about the larger issue of cannibalistic behaviours. I do not think that Schutt seeks to erase that eating one’s own species should be seen as something worth noting, but more to demystify the idea and show that it happens with some degree of regularity and should be accepted. The numerous examples of cannibalism in other species is not only fascinating, but to learn that it happens for a variety of reasons is also worth noting. Sibling rivalry, pre-natal survival, and even controlling the population, all seem to make sense, when argued from an academic perspective. With great detail, Schutt seeks to educate his reader about the ins and outs of it all, though he seems not to inundate the reader with too much. Schutt uses the expertise of many zoologists, like himself, and other specialists to shed light on the rituals of many species, mixing his own research with well-documented interviews. Schutt divides his discussion into well-balanced chapters and offers just the right about of witty repartee to keep the reader from taking things too seriously. An eyebrow-raising book that keeps the reader on their toes throughout, I can only hope that others will take the chance to read this piece. Plus, after a period when parents were schooling their children at home (and may be again, this scholastic year) due to COVID-19, it helps to justify why some adults wanted to toss their offspring into the oven and crank up the heat!Kudos, Mr. Schutt, for this enlightening view of the world through the eyes of cannibals. I loved it and will be reading more of your work soon!Love/hate the review?

7,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,4,"Natural doesn´t have to be better all the time.Please note that I have put the original German text to the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Cannibalism is only so controversial in human societies. One would just eat another person in exceptional situations. In a classic plane crash or if, in a post-apocalyptic world, the survival of the family depends on it.When human flesh was part of religious ceremonies, it often included exocannibalism. The inclusion of the power of the enemy. The more peaceful variant was the endocannibalism, with which one honored the family members by consuming them. The only form left in the modern world is the ritual eating of placentas. But the positive mentality behind this act is in no relation to the bloody rituals of the past. Although in the depths of unexplored rainforests, there may probably be one or the other tribe.In other forms of life than humans, it is common practice and a fixed component of the life cycle. When, for example, cannibalism is integrated into reproduction, rearing or nutrition as an element of preservation of the species. When it comes to preserving the species, sentimentality is out of place in the animal kingdom. In particular, if, for example in the case of insects, the life expectancy of males is not long anyway. Economically speaking, after fulfilling their primary task, they have the most significant benefit as available kilocalories.Even after the act of reproduction, cannibalism continues in the womb in various ways. Shark species in which it is usual that the inhabitants eat each other. Children snacking their mother's skin. And parents one would have better never met because they make no difference between food and own children. Therefore, it is well advised not to build a relationship with them. But if one of the few available sources of essential nutrients is your own kind and family, you can not be picky.A long-term study with different species would be fascinating. By this, one could see under what conditions species develop cannibalism. Similar species do not always start eating each other under similar circumstances. Therefore, there must be an unknown factor in the game. In lab environments with changing climatic and nutritional conditions, one could see clearly when the transition occurs. Although besides not yet found genetic factors could play a role too.The medical applications testify to the curious history of healing and medicine. There is a bigoted difference between a medical prescription for differently prepared parts and proper cannibalism. Of course, with such spectacular remedies, a reputation and good money can be made. The psyche eats too and heals better with exclusive nutrition.Since cannibalism is less common in humans, no microorganism has yet specialized in this mode of spreading. Although such cases have already occurred in indigenous peoples (Kuru). What raises a borderline hypothesis: A pathogen wants to spread in a fictive population, which has practiced cannibalism for centuries. What could be more effective than to strengthen the craving for human flesh in the minds of already infected people? Not to mention direct distribution channels. Following the same principle as mushrooms manipulating and killing insects. Respectively, it may be possible that such a virus might have developed in any of the jungles or has been manufactured by humans.If one interprets it exaggeratedly, many processes in the smallest are based on miscellaneous variants of cannibalism. Somatic cells, microorganisms, symbionts, pathogens,… have a wide range of capabilities for assimilation, control and digestive functions. A vast country, yet to be explored.The short span of time, which can often stand between haute cuisine and cannibalism, is barely aware. Not even weeks, only days would be enough. One does not associate the reports of humanitarian catastrophes with it and the reporting is silent about it. But what would each individual himself, faced with the choice, do? How quickly would the thin and fragile varnish of sophisticated behavior be wiped away by archaic survival instincts?Natürlich muss nicht immer besser sein. Ah, Kannibalismus, das nur bei Menschen so kontroverse Thema. Man würde nur in Ausnahmesituationen einen anderen Menschen essen. Beim klassischen Flugzeugabsturz oder wenn in einer postapokalyptischen Welt das Überleben der Familie davon abhängig ist.Wenn Menschenfleisch Teil von religiösen Zeremonien war, beinhaltete das häufig Exokannibalismus. Die Aufnahme der Kraft des Feindes. Die friedlichere Variante war der Endokannibalismus, mit dem man die Familiemitglieder durch deren Verzehr ehrte. Die einzige in der modernen Welt verbliebene Form ist das verbreitete Essen von Plazentas. Wobei die positive Mentalität hinter diesem Akt in keiner Relation zu den blutigen Ritualen der Vergangenheit steht. Obwohl es in den tiefen der unerforschten Regenwälder sicher noch den einen oder anderen Stamm geben dürfte.Bei anderen Lebensformen als dem Menschen ist es gang und gäbe und fixer Bestandteil des Lebenszyklus. Wenn Kannibalismus etwa als Element des Arterhalts in Fortpflanzung, Aufzucht oder Ernährungsweise integriert wird. Wenn es um den Arterhalt geht, ist im Tierreich Sentimentalität fehl am Platz. Insbesondere, wenn etwa im Insektenreich die Lebenserwartung der Männchen ohnehin nicht lange ist. Ökonomisch gesprochen haben sie nach Erfüllung ihrer Hauptaufgabe den größten Nutzen als verfügbare Kilokalorien. Auch nach der Fortpflanzung geht der Kannibalismus im Mutterleib auf verschiedene Arten weiter. Haiarten, bei denen sich die Umgeborenen gegenseitig auffressen. Kinder, die an der Mutter snacken. Und Eltern, von denen man sich wünscht, dass man sie nie getroffen hätte. Weil sie keinen Unterschied zwischen Futter und eigenen Kindern machen. Daher sind diese gut beraten, keine Beziehung zu ihnen aufzubauen. Wenn eine der wenigen verfügbaren Quellen für essentielle Nährstoffe die eigene Art oder die eigene Verwandschaft ist, darf man nicht wählerisch sein. Wirklich interessant wäre eine Studie mit verschiedenen Tierarten. Daran könnte man sehen, unter welchen Bedingungen Arten Kannibalismus entwickeln. Ähnliche Arten beginnen unter ähnlichen Bedingungen nicht immer, sich gegenseitig aufzufressen. Daher muss noch ein unbekannter Faktor im Spiel sein. In Laborumgebungen mit wechselnden Klima- und Ernährungsbedingungen könnte man anschaulich sehen, wann der Übergang erfolgt. Obwohl zusätzlich noch nicht gefundene genetische Faktoren auch eine Rolle spielen könnten.Die medizinischen Anwendungen zeugen von der kuriosen Geschichte der Heilkunst. Wobei bigotterweise ein Unterschied zwischen ärztlicher Verordnung für verschieden zubereitete Teile und richtigem Kannibalismus besteht. Natürlich ist mit derart spektakulären Heilmitteln auch immer ein Renommee und gutes Geld zu machen. Die Psyche isst und heilt mit. Da Kannibalismus bei Menschen nicht so verbreitet ist, hat sich noch kein Mikroorganismus auf diese Art der Verbreitung spezialisieren können. Obwohl bei indigenen Völkern (Kuru) bereits derartige Fälle aufgetreten sind. Was ein grenzwertige Hypothese aufwirft: Ein Erreger will sich in einem fiktiven, seit Jahrhunderten auf Kannibalismus spezialisierten Volk stärker ausbreiten. Was läge näher, als das Bedürfnis nach Menschenfleisch in den Köpfen der bereits infizierten Menschen zu stärken? Von direkten Verbreitungswegen ganz zu schweigen. Nach dem gleichen Prinzip, wie Pilze Insekten manipulieren. Beziehungsweise, könnte sich so ein Virus nicht etwaig in einem der Dschungel bereits entwickelt haben oder von Menschen hergestellt? Wenn man es etwas übertrieben auslegt, fußen auch viele Prozesse im kleinsten auf diversen Varianten von Kannibalismus. Körperzellen, Mikroorganismen, Symbionten, Krankheitserreger haben ein breites Spektrum an Fähigkeiten für Assimilation, Kontrolle und Verdauung. Ein noch zu erschließendes, weites Land.Die kurze Zeitspanne, die oft zwischen Haute Cuisine und Kannibalismus stehen kann, ist kaum bewusst. Nicht einmal Wochen, nur Tage würden ausreichen. Man assoziiert die Berichte über humanitäre Katastrophen nicht damit und die Berichterstattung schweigt sich darüber aus. Aber was würde jeder einzelne selbst, vor die Wahl gestellt, tun? "

I love learning about anything medical or science related so it was as surprising of a choice as you might think. I have always said that I read a little bit of everything and this book is proof positive of that fact. Cannibalism is a really interesting subject and I learned a lot while listening to this book. It was really an enjoyable experience.I have to admit that as soon as I saw this book, I started thinking about criminals who practice cannibalism. If you are looking for a book that chronicles the actions of serial killers, this probably isn't the book for you. There is a little bit of those kind of stories in this book but very few. The author actually makes a point to explain why he chose not to focus on criminals. This book instead deals with many other topics pertaining to cannibalism.If you are interested in learning about cannibalism in nature, look no further because this book is full of that kind of information. This books covers cannibalism in fish, birds, tadpoles, insects, and spiders. It discusses why it might be advantageous for animals to cannibalize others creatures of their own species sometimes including their own offspring. I can honestly say that I learned more about cannibalism in nature than I even knew that I wanted to know.I really enjoyed the sections of the book that involved human cannibalism. The very few sections that did discuss criminal cannibalism were very interesting. At the very beginning of the book, I learned that the book Psycho is based off a true story of a man that killed and cannibalized his victims. Survival cannibalism was another very interesting topic. I had never heard of the Donner party prior to listening to this book but I was captivated and saddened by their story. There is a section that discusses the eating of one's placenta, not something that I ever gave any thought to before this book but interesting nonetheless.I thought that Tom Perkins was the perfect narrator for this book. It almost felt as if I were listening to a nature show on television. His voice is exactly the kind of voice I think of when imagining the voice over sections in any nature program. This book had a lot of details and was full of information but I never tired of listening to it largely because of the narrator's skill. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the topic. It is a heavy subject but it is delivered in a very readable manner. There are a lot of details but it is presented in an entertaining manner. I was entertained and learned a few things. This is the first book by Bill Shutt that I have read but I would consider his work in the furture. I received a review copy of this book from HighBridge Audio via Audiobook Jukebox.Initial ThoughtsThis was an interesting book. I learned quite a few things and was entertained. There were some sections that were a bit too detailed for my tastes but overall this was a good listen. I am ready for a cannibalism category in the next trivia night I attend!"
9,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27123577-ellen-gail,4,"Life lesson: most of your coworkers won't want to discuss the cannibalism habits of tadpoles or the progression of prion diseases. They will look at you strangely.Well well well. This was a fun little bit of science! Author Bill Schutt did a great job of combining scientific evidence, speculation, history, and humor. He also does a good job of touching on a broad range of cannibalism topics, such as prion diseases, placenta eating, natural (and unnatural) cannibalism in nature, filial piety, medicinal cannibalism, and historical records of cannibalism (as well as the cultural & racial bias involved.) The writing is balanced and fun, while avoiding being sensational, choosing to steer away from criminal cannibal cases in favor of the more interesting, less discussed aspects of people eating. It does a great job of being gross, funny, and knowledgeable!
Surprisingly, the clerk at a local liquor store had no idea what wine would go well with placenta. I went with an Italian red.
So what will you learn from Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History?*Placenta tastes like chicken gizzards*Banana slugs are fucking disgusting. (view spoiler)[
  
An even more cringeworthy behavior is exhibited by banana slugs (genus Ariolimax), which become so entwined during sex that they sometimes chew off their partner’s corkscrew-shaped penis in an effort to disengage. During this process, which is known as apophallation, penises are slurped down spaghetti-style, occasionally by their owners.

(hide spoiler)]*Christopher Columbus was a top shelf dick burger - but you probably already knew that one.*Most people will not be pleased when you start a sentence with ""Random cannibal fact!""*Spiders don't have penises*If you had epilepsy way back when in the 1800s, you might have been told to drink a cup of blood or eat some powdered skull.*Soylent Green is people!Bill Schutt's Cannibalism makes for a fascinating read. Take a little bit of Mary Roach (not literally, you sick freaks,) a little bit of Greek myths and The Walking Dead, some Bill Nye (again, please not literally,) and top it off with a few man eating spiders - mix it all together and you've got yourself a hell of a book!"
10,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47799008-tudor-vlad,4,"This was fun. I know, a book about cannibalism, how fun could that be? There are times when the book is dry and there were moments when I trudged through pages and pages of information. Still, for the most time the author manages to infuse this, at times, creepy subject with enough humor to make it easier to go through records of people eating their dead relatives, mothers eating their placenta and lots of other things that made me lose my appetite. Warning: do not read this before or after a meal. Just a friendly warning. I’m probably making this seem worse than it was. Just a very very tiny portion of this book goes into the details of human cannibalism, most part of the books looks at cannibalism from a historical, social, psychological and scientific standpoint. It’s not just about human cannibalism, the first part of this books focuses on the presence of cannibalism in the animal kingdom while also presenting an interesting fact: that that the most famous villains in fiction are cannibals (hmm). In the last chapters it also goes into the territory of progressive neurodegenerative conditions that are caused by cannibalism, like the mad cow disease and the infamous Kuru. I can thank Reddit for first informing me of how scary prions are, and this book for further cementing my fear of prion diseases.Kudos to the author for presenting a thorough study of cannibalism without sensationalizing the subject. There are lots of cases of cannibals, alive or dead, that he chose not to talk about out of respect for their families and I’m glad he did that. There’s a lot of that online and free for people that enjoy those sorts of things."

Still, this is a fun book. The author has a very light touch, lending humor to the gruesome business. I learned lots of useless trivia (that's why we all read so much, right?) and I'll never turn my back on a tadpole again. They are ruthless little bastards."
12,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34922017-katie-ford,5,"This has been an enormously entertaining read, with surprising laugh out loud moments from an author who is obviously passionate about the subject matter.This isn't an account of murdering cannibals, in fact they barely warrant a mention due to the authors wish not to offend still living relatives of the victims or perpetrators. Instead the first half of the book covers instances of cannibalism the animal kingdom which is where some of the best passages appear - I draw your attention to sexy snails....'Although snail sex can last for up to six hours in some herbivorous species this is definitely not the case in certain carnivorous gastropods, where foreplay can turn into cannibalism in the blink of a turreted eye. In these species, since even copulating individuals will bite their mates, each potential partner is also a potential predator. As a result, they often employ the wham-bam-scram approach during sexual encounters, which sometimes linger on for as long as six seconds!'The second two thirds of the book focus on human cannibalism, specifically in terms of early colonisation rumours spread by Columbus in the Caribbean, ritual cannibalism, cannibalism in the Bible, survival cannibalism, medicinal cannibalism (the placental eating chapter is not recommended before dinner), origins of BSE and even a look ahead to a possible apocalyptic future where overpopulation and low food production is solved with dietary supplements from the funeral business.All in all, a fascinating, entertaining and thought-provoking read. P.S. Did you know that George H. W. Bush was the only survivor the Ogasawara Incident which saw his compatriots livers eaten by the starving Japanese officers that captured them?!"

Lest you think I am an aspiring cannibal, it’s important to know that this is not a gruesome, sensational retelling of cannibalism among modern serial killers; Schutt respectfully stays away from that in favor of exploring the history of cannibalism from a biological and anthropological viewpoint. So no Jeffrey Dahmer, and plenty of spiders sacrificing themselves up to their young and slugs getting so tangled up in reproduction they have to chew their genitals off to escape! It’s a fun, entertaining read, and Bill Schutt’s insatiable curiosity for his subject is infectious (although I don’t think I’ll be eating placenta like he did). If you’re a fan of Mary Roach, you’ll definitely want to check this out.— Gina Nicollfrom The Best Books We Read In February 2017: http://bookriot.com/2017/02/28/riot-r... "
14,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista,3,"Away for the weekend for my husband's work, we went out for a group dinner last night not long after I finished reading Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History, and as one does, I steered the conversation around to the topic of cannibalism – even as we nibbled our artisanal pizzas – and I held the group in thrall with a couple of the anecdotes I had gleaned from this book. We returned to the hotel and someone suggested we play the game Table Talk. The first question was, “If you were cremated, what would you want done with your ashes?” and I was the first to reply with, “I'd want to be snorted by Keith Richards”, getting a huge laugh. Thanks Bill Schutt: this may not have been the most valuable pop science book I've ever read, but I learned just enough to add to my social capital.Bill Schutt is a zoologist (Biology Professor at LIU Post and researcher at the Museum of Natural History), so when he decided to investigate the history and prevalence of human cannibalism, he started by looking at the animal world; arguing that what's natural in the wild must be natural for us, too. He approached the topic thinking that cannibalism is rare in nature (it's not), and was surprised to find that those famous animal cannibals (from Black Widow Spiders and Praying Mantises to the Global Warming-affected Polar Bears who are seen eating their own cubs) have actually been misunderstood. What I found most interesting in the animal sections are the variety of ways in which different species have evolved to become cannibals (from spadefoot toad tadpoles, some percentage of which will have carnivorous teeth and guts to munch on their omnivorous siblings, to the African caecilian, the brooding mother of which will rapidly regrow her epidermis for its young to peel and eat “like a grape”), and while I found these stories to be fascinating, they rather undermine Schutt's initial point: since humans haven't evolved any cannibal-specific features, it's hard to compare what's “natural” (beyond making the point that just about any animals, when overcrowded and starved, will resort to eating each other).When Schutt turns to humans, he discusses the first allusions to cannibalism in Western writing (which is there right from the start in Homer and Herodotus; which was especially interesting to me as the last book I read included the myth of Thyestes being tricked into eating his own sons), and through Shakespeare and the Brothers Grimm, right up to Cormac McCarthy and The Walking Dead, we in the West have always thought of cannibalism as particularly unnatural (reinforced by the Judeo-Christian belief in keeping the body whole for the Resurrection). This paved the way for Christopher Columbus to justify enslaving the Caribbean people he encountered after misinterpreting (or lying about) their funerary rites; and this set the tone for all of European colonisation. Contrasted with this is thousands of years of Chinese writings in which cannibalism has been seen as acceptable: necessary in times of war and famine; an epicurean curiosity; a matter of filial duty in which people have always been happy to cut off pieces of themselves to feed their elders. What's ironic is the West's long history of using human body parts as medicine (from drinking the blood of a hanged man to ingesting ground up mummy dust) and not considering this cannibalism.Schutt examines the famous stories of human cannibalism – Was it really that prevalent in the South Pacific? What really happened with the Donner Party or the Siege of Leningrad? Why is it becoming trendy for women to eat their placentas after giving birth? – and ends with a very long section on the similarities between kuru and Mad Cow Disease, and while I didn't find this part that interesting, I was surprised to learn that the science behind these diseases hasn't been settled (apparently, it was never about prions). Ultimately, Schutt concludes that we're heading towards a Soylent Green future.So, that's the what, and as for the how: Schutt attempts a jokey-accessible tone (like Mary Roach or Sarah Vowell), and I don't know if he really pulls it off. An early example of the jokes, while discussing that spadefoot toad tadpole:It was evident that the jaw muscles were significantly enlarged in the cannibals, especially the jaw-closing levator madibulae, whose bulging appearance reminded me of a kid with six pieces of Dubble Bubble jammed into each cheek (a dangerous behavior I only rarely attempt anymore).Is that lame joke worth the change in tone? I also didn't really like the way that Schutt mocks some interview subjects on the page. While talking with Dr. William Arens – an Anthropologist who made a stir in the 70s by declaring that all stories of “social” cannibalism in “primitive societies” are inventions of Western researchers – Schutt writes that he's listening politely to the man while thinking, “Yeah right”. Schutt does the same thing throughout the chapter about the woman who promotes placenta-eating – first underlining the hilarity of her having ten kids, and then mentally correctly her as she shares with him what she understands to be the scientific benefits of placenta-eating (can you believe she thought the main research was done on mice when they used rats?) Ultimately, this is what I learned: Cannibalism is pretty common in nature, and under starvation conditions, it's something we're probably all capable of. Also, social cannibalism, as part of funerary rites, was likely less common than believed, but other than the risk of kuru or other transmissible diseases (one of which may have wiped out the Neanderthals), it is no more “unnatural” than the dozens of other ways in which humans have respectfully ushered their loved ones into the afterlife. In the end, this book was perfect preparation for a dinner party conversation, but beyond George H. W. Bush's brush with the butcher block and Keith Richards' sendoff to his father, not much will likely linger with me."
15,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,5,"So, just to deter any possible squeamish readers: Schutt eats placenta, prepared a la osso bucco, in this book. I kinda-sorta-maybe-wanna eat placenta right now, just to see how it tastes. Is that gross? Probably. But I'm just curious - and as we all know, curiosity killed the cat. This time it might kill the cat through the form of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. If I go, I might as well go from something that has a long, cool, science-y sounding name. What you'll find in this book: fascinating etymologies of words such as ""mummy"", the fact that Francis Bacon and a score of other scientists used to practice medical cannibalism, an explanation for why-the-fuck are humans called ""the long pigs"", a terrifying look at the idea of the prion and an all around super-god-damn-interesting book about one of the behaviours that, here in the West, we have considered taboo since the beginning of time... Wait, what was that? Not since the beginning of time? Since about the 16 hundreds? Oh. Yeah, you spelled West wrong: it should have been ""hypocrites"". For the record: cannibalism is not ""inhumane"". There is no such thing as ""inhumane"", unless you specifically refer to something not of the humans or you use it metaphorically. If it has been done by humans, then it exists on the human spectrum of behaviour. There's instances in which I don't consider it morally wrong: starvation (survival), and if it is included in the social practices of a certain culture (like the Fore people). The fact that I haven't been raised on human meat is based solely on chance or luck. I consider it morally wrong if: it is done in the same vein as/along with murder, torture: then you are talking about intent to destroy, and it usually stems from psychological aberrations such as violent psychopathy or other mental illnesses (for example related to hallucinations)."
16,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35009937-the-behrg,4,"I'm not sure if reading a non-fiction novel about Cannibalism says more about the READER than it does the AUTHOR, but I found this a disturbingly fascinating read. Running the gamut from insects to the animal world to dinosaurs and neanderthals, the book then jumps to more modern cases from the Donner party to survival cannibalism to placentophagy. The research and science behind zoologist Bill Schutt's study is impressive, if at times overwhelming. I definitely identified more with the human aspects of this ""study in history,"" and there were both some mind-opening ideas and criminally tragic insights into humanity. I appreciate Schutt's decision to not include any recent sensationalized media cases where family's of victims (or culprits) might be unintentionally affected.This a novel that changes you. It's impossible to look at the world the same way after diving into the depths of such a bizarre yet potentially natural practice. For all my disturbed like-minded individuals, this is one you should definitely check out.** Thanks to the publisher and NetGalley for providing a copy of this book for review purposes. This in no way affected my review. **"
17,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3772692-jenny-bunting,5,"Utterly fascinating piece of non-fiction that is easy-to-follow, accessible, and snarky. I do think it lost focus at the 11th hour when it discussed Mad Cow Disease (which I totally missed the connective tissue *pun intended* of how he got there). Still, it was haunting and chilling but totally gave compelling reasons for why some societies turned to cannibalism and discussed how it became taboo. You start asking yourself, ""Would I eat someone if I were hungry enough?"" I mean, I do get HANGRY but I don't know if I could do it. I don't want to know, thank you.The book builds from the cannibalism I'm least interested in (bugs) to the shit that I peak around corners at so smart move, Bill. Still the bug chapters were REALLY interesting which shocked the hell out of me because I am not a science person. Still Schutt drives the point home in the epilogue where he makes a case that cannibalism could happen in the near future in drought and famine-ridden areas and I was like, ""Bill, SHUT YOUR MOUTH."""

19,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,3,"Hmmmm! What to say about this non-fiction read that I thought would be more ""scientific"" than it was? Closer to a 2.5 star for me? Yes, but then I rounded it up for the first half. Because those sections hold chapters of information in the kind of microscopic and observable detail of physicality ""eyes"" that I anticipated the entire volume would have. But didn't.Those form chapters of classified invertebrates and the precise definition of the various categories of cannibalism were all 4 or 5. As were the toad species tadpoles and the other amphibian inclusions. He tries to be funny. A few times he seems instead flippant. That's forgiven, considering the subject. But I didn't find the over all tone of instruction to what was happening in nature or the past or the historical aspects to be one that was predominantly accurate. There are all kinds of assumptions that I would never include in a book that seems to be categorized as ""natural history"" on its cover. Theory for some far past sections (dinosaur and Neanderthal ones especially) were actually more misleading in theories than in science based information.Here's the deal. And I do repeat myself, I know. The more a non-fiction book STAYS on the topic of the title and focuses on a narrow band of information in detail and record, the better it becomes. Here he wanders into immense historical tangent and entire past era 10 or 12 page ""other"" information. Not at all focused on the practice of the title except to a minute portion of a supposition upon the ""possibility"" and a history interpretation, for the most part, that has little or nothing to do with the topic subject except in a far tangent sense. As if you had to teach the entire alphabet to your child, ever time you read a chapter of their bedtime story book to them. And what he chooses to pick for the ""instruction"" tangent? Well, it's more about his own soapbox or two than it is anything at all in strictures or patterns of cannibal practice described. What did I learn? Only the size differential and special parts adaptions of certain broods coming from the same batch of fertilization. And a couple other minor bird and fossilized feces study facts. The second half of the book was a 2 at the most. This is not hard science and it is mostly taught theory or entire tracts of guessing suppositions. But what proof and evidence in it was interesting to me.Because I try to keep up with the anthropology and forensics literature, studies, further interpreted copy upon the homo species especially- this reciting all the half accurate ""past"" proofs or finds recited histories was not a fit for me. Sometimes he spent pages and pages to ""teach"" what is theory and not at all proven but which he has swallowed whole piece himself. And the definitions are also murky in those chapters too. No more so than in his era categories and homo species crossover information that he tells ""as assumed"" truth. All homo category populations do and have practiced cannibalism under dire circumstances. And earlier homo species and modern man in tribal conflicts have almost all done so as well. He makes it sounds an exception when it never was. The section on prion diseases, I also found questionable to completely ""true"". Kuru disease is the one attached to cannibal practices and as a group those diseases are not as simplistic (or as related to eating brains either) as he makes it out to be. Not a fan of any non-fiction that has a narrow focus in the title, and then doesn't stay on that focus. He also tried to entertain in a kind of garish dark humor that often fell awkwardly. But the first half had some nifty drawings and proofs for nature in how it has evolved to have the best offspring survive bad situations (like a quickly drying puddle)."

Accessible, well written, avoids being sensational. A lot of interesting history. Maybe i'll write a better review one day, maybe not, but I am very glad to have read this book and definitely recommend it."

Enter cannibalism. I don’t know about you, but nothing makes me relax like eating people. (I am a Soylent convert, after all).  Fascinating, original, comprehensive, and refreshing, this is a very well-done book. The beginning runs a little slower- it’s a little hard to get excited about tadpoles and tiny water flea things, I know- but it sets the mental and evolutionary groundwork for the more interesting human parts later, so read it. Also, it’s actually interesting after you set your mind to it.  Overall, just a very clever, intriguing history. Must-read for any aspiring cannibal. "
22,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5866774-alex-sarll,0,"By turns hilarious and horrific, this book will have you quoting curious facts at people like a ghoulish child given The Bumper Book Of Cannibal Facts by an imprudent aunt. And if those people don't edge away from you, you know the right people. Consider curious amphibian order the caecilians, some of whom lay eggs and some birth live young, but all of whom consume non-lethal quantities of their mothers in early life. Or that eating the placenta is thoroughly ubiquitous among those mammals who have them - except for humans, and camelids. True, certain hippyish fractions of the middle-class are trying to upend that exception (though presumably not because they want to differentiate themselves from alpacas), which obviously gives Schutt an excuse to put his mouth where his money is and chow down. How does it taste? Well, I can't give everything away here, can I?Broadly speaking, the book's divided in two, covering animal cannibalism first before moving on to people - though of course the BSE scandal, with which Schutt concludes at a little too much length, ultimately bridges both via the kuru links. But many themes recur throughout - most notably the widespread Western repulsion at the very notion, which has manifested both in a lack of proper research into the topic until quite recently, and in using cannibal panics as a convenient shield for the expropriation of everyone from mediaeval Jews to indigenous populations. Indeed, it even manages to twist back on itself in the latter-day notion that there have never been societies where cannibalism was standard and it has always been a calumny - a claim which at once ignores vast swathes of evidence, and demonstrates exactly the same hegemonising notion of universal moral norms which it affects to oppose. There are some quite affecting and emotionally plausible quotes here from members of tribes in Brazil and New Guinea who are as appalled by the notion of putting dead loved ones in the damp, unwelcoming earth or leaving them for the maggots and worms as we'd be by serving them up at the wake. And even away from the wild places of the Earth there's a fascinating chapter on China, where the Western taboo has never had the same hold even before you consider how many apocalyptic famines that land has seen; there, cannibalism as an act of filial piety has a long and surprising history which mirrors the tendency among some fish to eat a few of the kids (because, after all, they have plenty left) or indeed all of them (especially if there aren't many left because, after all, at that point they're probably not going to make it anyway). And this sense of correspondences is something else which recurs throughout, though Schutt never fully interrogates it. It's suggested that those peculiar snails which fire love darts at their intendeds may have inspired the notion of Cupid's arrows - but given how inept the ancients could be at observing nature even on a much larger scale, is that really likely? In many ways it would be more plausible to suggest (as per that wonderful line about birth metaphors in Carey's Lucifer) that Cupid is the reality for which these snails are the metaphor. Or simply that the human mind is powerfully adapted to find echoes and parallels all over the shop.Amongst many surprising chapters, perhaps the most startling is the one on cannibalistic medicine - in which we learn how cures such as mummy powder and skull moss persisted in the West until a lot later than you'd think, even while eating the dead in a non-medical sense was being used as a convenient excuse for annihilating the barbarous Caribs et al. The black comedy is only amplified when it turns out that the idea of mummy powder as a curative in the first place probably stemmed from a translation error. Oops. However, despite his frequent and very fair jabs at unscientific fits of morality, and despite opening with a Hannibal Lecter quote and a section on Ed Gein, Schutt later falls prey to the former and neglects the likes of the latter two, mostly dodging the topic of cannibal serial or spree killers. He claims rather flimsily that this is out of sensitivity to the victims and not wanting to glorify ""psychopaths"" already amply covered elsewhere. Which is uncharacteristically feeble, not least in lumping the scrupulously consensual cannibal Armin Meiwes in with the genuinely evil. And what about Sawney Bean? Surely his victims' families are all safely under the sod now, and I'd consider him the joint most notorious historical cannibal with the Donner party, who are covered in a fair amount of detail. Still, that fumble aside this is a great read.(Refused on Netgalley, got a physical review copy instead. Go me)"
23,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25898891-r-k,3,"Want to make people look twice? Read this book daringly in public. You're guaranteed to get head's turning.What can I say about this book? It's exactly what it says it is, the history of cannibalism. Bill Schutt takes a scientific and culture approach to this so taboo topic. We first warm ourselves by seeing how nature views this ""taboo"" only to learn that nature could care less. In the world of eat or be eaten, you use everything you can to survive, even if that mean you eat your own undeveloped siblings. Schutt goes to show in nature how creatures have evolved to best survive and feed, even if that mean they must resort to eating their own species. He also brings up interesting dinner table conversations such as:If a species resorts to cannibalism as a means to survive, is it still taboo?What if the victim doesn't die but has evolved a tougher skin that its offspring eats in order to grow? In this case, no one dies nor is unwilling. Is it still wrong, especially if growth rate and thus, survival rate is higher?What about species that live life normally but then sacrifice themselves during the mating process (talk about dedication 0.0)Ultimately, Schutt concludes that when it comes to nature, cannibalism occurs under certain conditions: 1. Means of survival 2. Starvation 3. Mating and all it's intricacies 4. Dominance (but not so frequent). He also debunks a lot of myths that surround many animals such as the praying mantis and polar bears. However, when it comes to humans, turns out we're much more darker which by now shouldn't be a shocker to anyone. Like I said, Schutt clearly states that this book is only approaching the topic from a scientific and cultural view. So put your excitement away film and horror fanatics. This book isn't discussing that. Yet, after the halfway mark, we start to look at humans, and things get gruesome. One of the most foreboding uses of cannibalism to learn about was not the actual act of cannibalism but how it was used as essentially a weapon. We often see in movies and books how explorers fall onto the Island where a tribe is living and this tribe sudden turn out to be cannibals. It's a trope used over and over again but has very dark route. You see, a lot of these so called ""cannibal tribes"" may just be a whole bunch of falsified propaganda. That's right ladies and gentlemen. When the Spanish were off ""exploring"" the new world, they stumbled onto the indigenous population. Upon asking Queen Isabel on what to do, she basically said ""If they're not Catholic nor following the laws of Catholicisms not willing to convert, then only exert force on them"" A bit cruel and harsh but religious freedom and diversity were not really present in those times. So did out Spanish explorers heed her words? No, they didn't. They manipulated her words into their advantage. Suddenly areas they had their eyes on or had resources were inhabited by ""savage cannibals"" that needed to be ""educated"" But are we surprised by that?Reading that chapter really made me think which was worse, cannibalism or using it as a means to extort colonialism? Schutt goes into describing some infamous incidents of cannibalism in our history. Why they occurred. What caused them/led up to it. How it was tampered with by the media. And what new information historians have uncovered. Turns out, most ""dark and gruesome"" incidents are fluffed up by media or hidden by the government. (It's always one or the other). Schutt also explains why some cultures view it as taboo while others have accepted the strenuous conditions under which cannibalism occurs into their culture. Ultimately, it's a book that's trying to show that cannibalism isn't as unnatural as we make it out to be. He's obviously not advocating for it but rather stating that it happens and that it shouldn't really shock us. In other words, stop making it the taboo topic to have over dinner because as it turns out, humans also resort to cannibalism under the same conditions as nature with the exception of a 5th reason - our darker side. We really are no better then nature because the only dividing line is our culture and morals. But put us in extreme situations, and our beast side takes over because despite walking and talking, we still are wild creatures in clothing. "
24,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5460316-fiona,5,"This was a very entertaining, thoroughly fascinating look at cannibalism - a much-debated and frequently controversial topic outside of fiction.Bill Schutt has clearly done his research (his notes cover the last fifth of the novel!), as he covers topics ranging through the entire animal kingdom. Examples of cannibalism are listed from tadpoles to the now-extinct dinosaurs, and humans are absolutely not exempt from this scrutiny.I would whole-heartedly recommend this for anyone with an interest in unusual behaviours full stop, let alone just cannibalism; it's incredibly engaging, with a solid base in good science."
25,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,5,"Am I weird for impatiently waiting for a book on cannibalism to be released? After all, I've had this one on my TBR for months. Finally getting my hands on Bill Schutt's unconventional biology study, I'm happy to confirm that the wait was well worth it. Far from trying to sensationalize the subject, Schutt instead chooses to investigate every aspect of cannibalism from a hard science angle.He starts the book with a logical question: how common is cannibalism in nature, and if it is far from rare, what causes animals to partake in such counterintuitive practice? After all, wouldn't all living things naturally abstain from eating their own kind due to higher likelihood of disease contamination, or to an all-ruling desire to preserve the species? What makes some animals kill their young - a definite strike against basic parenting instinct? Why would a certain species of shark evolve to consume their unborn siblings while in utero? Why do chickens attack and eat their neighbors in a crowded coop? While presenting all of these interesting examples, Schutt doesn't forget to debunk well-established myths about female praying mantis or black widow spiders.After proving that cannibalism in fact is quite natural to many species, the author moves on to a controversial subject of humans eating humans. He addresses questions associated with Neanderthals, Spanish colonialists in the New World, odd mortuary rituals of Brazilian natives, Biblical belief of transubstantiation, and finally some more recent cases among pioneers and WWII sieges. Schutt even tries out the relatively modern fad of eating a human placenta for pseudo medicinal reasons... Because science, of course. With knowledgeable research, good humour, and skilled writing style he manages to make a topic of high ick factor into a fascinating read full of thought provoking data."
26,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21413858-k-j-charles,0,"A very interesting read from a biologist--funny and personal and non-sensationalised. The British title is Eat Me, which is so much better. Takes a very reasonable attitude to cultural variance and non Western attitudes. Even better, the only account of cannibalism that's dwelt on in an anthropological ""look at these people like specimens"" way is of the peculiar modern cannibal subculture that's developed in the USA, with a description of a middle-class mum serving placenta for dinner. This passage is hilarious. Lots of grounding in animal behaviour, no dwelling on psychopaths, a very thoughtful book with a lot of delightfully and grimly fascinating stuff. Reminds you we're all meat machines, really. But not in a bad way. "
27,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2644090-erica,3,"I kept thinking to myself, ""I thought this would be more...meaty.""HA! No, I didn't think that, although I kind of did. I truly did expect this to be more interesting.Unlike Mary Roach's or Mark Kurlansky's books (with exception to Milk!: A 10,000-Year Food Fracas, which I couldn't even finish. No, I didn't finish my milk. #allthepuns), I didn't run around telling everyone what I'd just heard while I was listening to this book. Gabe didn't have to suffer listening to me exclaim, out of the blue, ""Oh! Guess what I heard in that book about cannibalism?"" more than once or twice.Actually, I was mostly bored with it all up through about the middle. The author first looks at cannibalism in the animal kingdom (minus the human animals), from insects to fish, reptiles, and amphibians then to mammals and I learned nothing new. (Yes I did - banana slugs. See the quote I liked)Maybe for people who haven't watched their rabbit give birth and then eat the babies or hadn't seen orb weavers wrapping up their mates for dinner while the male black widows happily left their girlfriends' houses post-coitally, maybe then this would be a solid foundation from which to launch into the second half of the book: People eating people. For me, though, it was just a lot of rehashing of stuff I already knew and it was not even put forth in an entertaining fashion. It was just biology. Well, zoology, I suppose, as the author's a zoologist.So then we get into people eating people and of course the Donner Party plays a big role in getting us motivated to learn about human cannibalism. As the Donner Party's situation plays out on the page, asides about other cannibalistic events in human history are introduced to help bolster the Why's and How's of our famous cannibal camping trip gone wrong. I did learn some stuff here, I think, but it was so weirdly laid out and explained, I will have to go research the event to find out just what this guy was trying to tell me. Also, why no Alferd Packer? It seems that would have been a good comparison piece.Then we go to China because of all the humans in the world, the Chinese have the best historical records. Thanks to said records, it's possible to find historical traces of documented cannibalism and the worst case ever recorded was during the Great Leap Forward when agriculture became so terribly mismanaged that everyone who wasn't rich was starving and dying.Now that we have a couple of historical examples of recent people eating people - oh, and of how colonizers love painting locals as cannibals so that we can eradicate them because no one wants to let such sinners stay on this earth...well, on the earth that they are inhabiting but we want - the author launches into a short piece on just why cannibalism is so maligned. The answer: Religion. Also, fairy tales. And now we can move on to contemporary examples, such as people eating placentas and Keith Richards snorting his father's ashes. The author tries placenta, cooked by the placenta-maker's husband. I sort of wondered why it had to be cooked to hide the flavor? Why wasn't it just fried up so the author could actually taste it? He never said.From there, we read about The Problems of Cannibalism, namely spongiform encephalopathies. Sheep get it and it's called scrapie (because it makes them feel like scraping themselves on fence posts), cows get it through being fed ground-up sick cows in the form of protein powder and it's called mad cow disease and you have to walk through sanitization stations if you're trekking through Scotland during an outbreak, and, of course, people get it from eating people and it's called Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and kuru (which you may have learned about in that one episode of ""Bones""). This is all pretty interesting, especially tracking kuru through the indigenous people of New Guinea but it also seemed a bit gossipy and glossed over, like we're hurrying on to the good stuff. Because that's what it was, a gossipy jump to the good stuff.Finally, we got to the part I was waiting for: When cannibalism isn't motivated by forces of nature (overpopulation, starvation, continuation of your DNA and removal of rival DNAs, etc), why does it happen?Well, see, he isn't here for sensationalism, which he states a few times throughout the book, despite beginning it all with a quote from Hannibal Lector as well as the tale of Edward Gein who was the inspiration for both Norman Bates and Buffalo Bill.(this one:

not this one:

)I am also not here for sensationalism. I honestly wanted to know why cannibalism happens in the animal kingdom when it doesn't have to.I think the author's thoughts on that took up maybe a page. I was disappointed.And then he ends with a dire prediction which could quite possibly come true.The whole thing is mostly dry but not deep. It's a broad look at cannibalism across species, through time, all over the world (as per the subtitle). It definitely has some interesting bits and pieces but not enough to make me finish the book and think, ""Wow. Now I want to learn a whole lot more about this fascinating topic!""My takeaway: Investigative journalists are better at compiling research to make an interesting case for weird topics than are zoologists. But I'm going to have to read more narrative non-fiction by zoologists before I can confirm."

Bill Schutt infuses dark humor with fact, relating what is known about cannibalism throughout species, from insects to humans. Being someone who has not eaten meat of any kind for 23 years, I could not help but feel grossed out throughout much of the book. However, I tried to keep an open mind, in spite of my queasy stomach, and found the book to be quite interesting for the most part. My science-loving, anthropologically-interested brain won out over my easily-grossed-out vegan self. Kudos to Bill Schutt for turning a dark and gruesome subject into a fascinating book, covering everything from female spiders eating their male partners after sex, to famine-induced cannibalism amongst many species (including humans); from modern-day American placenta eaters to the Kuru-infected Fore people of New Guinea who ritually consumed their dead. ""Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History"" is probably not for everyone, but those not easily disgusted and interested in a wide array of topics that are covered in this book, or just with a love of the macabre, will probably enjoy this book."

It's such an interesting topic in biology, and I find it even more so when it is dealt with in a scientific and not specifically scintillating manner. This book meant those expectations and surprised me at many turns. Anyone that has been into pop-sci books for any length of time will recognize many examples used in this book, but I was really happy to see him find even more that I had not learned about yet.The last section on Prions was especially interesting because it is letting a general audience know that what we thought we knew about that disease may be all wrong.

30,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"Really enjoyable read! Remember all of those awesome studies from animal behavior class, like the ones that demonstrated how many animals avoid having sex with their father, mother, sister, or brother -- chemicals inside their noses and brains help them identify ""self"" and ""non-self"", instructing them not to have sex with anything too similar to ""self"" -- or the studies that demonstrated how sexual selection could spell death for sexy males -- female fish preferred the most orange males, which drove selection toward fish so orange, they were easily spotted and gobbled up by predators -- or the other studies that outlined the many shocking behaviors and likely motivations of various animals? Well, this book is chock full of those types of studies, only they are geared solely at understanding why animals might or might not eat each other instead of why they might or might not mate with each other. Here is a sampling of the intensely interesting things you will find in well researched chapters. Black Widows:Contrary to the well held belief that female Black Widows spiders and female Preying Mantis devour their males when mating, these cannibalistic behaviors are reserved for times of great stress, such as when there is a food shortage or these animals are in captivity. Since they had only been studied in captivity, researchers were only privy to the behaviors associated with that stressor. If the Black Widow had been observed in natural conditions, when food supplies were sufficient, she would have never gotten the name ""Black Widow"". In truth, females spiders are far more often the victims of cannibalism than the perpetrators. In at least one species of spider, the females do a dance to make the males notice them and choose them to mate with. Instead of having sex, as the female intended, she made herself noticed and became a tasty treat for a male spider who, with the energy gained from eating her, moved on to court another female spider who he did choose to mate with. When times are really lean, there is a spider species who eats its own limbs! Spiders and Praying Mantis are not the only animals who do not usually practice cannibalism but turn to that behavior when they are exposed to stressful or unusual conditions. Cats, mice, rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits are all driven to cannibalism when facing similar conditions, but the hamster seems to be more prone to cannibalism than most species. If hamster siblings are kept in the same cage, they will often fight to the death at 4 weeks old, when they reach sexual maturity. The winner will eat the carcass of the loser. Though the behavior is common to many mothers, mother hamsters engage far more often in eating their young when the mother herself is handled close to the time when she gives birth or when her babies are handled when they are little. Apes:Cannibalism is generally rarer in ape species, including humans. However, when they engage in the practice, they are like other animals in that it is usually in times of stress, but not always. There have been serial killers who seem to enjoy eating their victims. There even seem to a pair of mother daughter serial killer chimpanzees, named Passion and Pom, who ate between 5 and 10 infants after attacking the new mothers. It seems it was all in an effort to obtain food. So, perhaps Passion and Pom's actions are not as unexplainable as Jeffery Dahmer's. Carnassial Dentation:The shape of teeth can tell us a lot about the evolution of various species. Schutt discussed the evolution of polar bear teeth to talk in general about how teeth, such as carnassial teeth, help meat eating species rip chunks of meet off their prey. Even though I have read a fair amount about this subject, I wasn't bored at all. In fact, I thought it was one of the better discussions on teeth and evolution. If you enjoy reading about ripping pieces of meat into smaller pieces, in order to aid digestion, I suggest you read, I Contain Multitudes as well. The author of that book, Ed Yong, gave a good bit of detail about gut microbes-- where they are placed in the gut, in front or behind -- so that the animals and the microbes both enjoy a wonderful meal. Yong discussed the types of microbes needed for a meat eating diet vs. a vegetable diet. I could not stop thinking about what Yong wrote when reading this section of Schutt's Cannibalism book. Schutt also used the polar bear section to satisfyingly discuss climate change and the stupidity of the media. Definitely worth reading. Hyenas and infanticide:Who doesn't love to eat babies? It seems that most animals who eat meat, love to eat the babies most. This seems to hold true whether it is a different species or a different species from the animal doing the eating. Chimps patrol their borders and when they encounter a female and her baby, they kill the baby and try to hook up with the female. Nothing says love like murdering her offspring. Chimps are not alone. Males from many different animal species eat babies in order to push females into estrus, so they can mate with them. One female species has evolved a protection against infanticide, and as a result is a dominant member of their clan-- the hyena. To really understand the magic of female hyena biology, it's important to understand sexual development in embryos. Embryos are genderless but have precursors to mammary glands and penises. If an embryo gets an XY chromosome the penis bud will grow, but the memory glands will not. . If the embryo receives XX, the embryo will still grow the penis bud but then get the signal to stop the growth when it is very small, leaving behind a clitoris instead of a large penis. The XX will also send a signal to grow the mammary glands. Males have nipples but cannot feed a baby. This is because they do not have XX, which makes mammary glands that allows milk to flow through the nipples. XY and XX chromosomes use hormones to signal which morphology a body should have. The XY chromosome contains testosterone, which signals the penis bud to grow into a penis . The XX chromosome contains estrogen, which is what signals the growth of mammary glands.In spotted hyenas, researchers believe a mutation developed to provide the female spotted hyena with more testosterone, resulting in a signal to grow the penis bud out more. Thus, female hyenas have a very large clitoris (elongated penis bud). Their vulva is fused shut, allowing them to pee through their clitoris/penis bud, just like a male pees through their penis. When a male wants to have sex with a female, she really has to be receptive, just as a male would have to be receptive to have sex. This is because it's actually like inserting a penis into a penis, making it virtually impossible to force a female to have sex. While evolution did them a favor in not allowing them to be raped by males, it was unkind to them in regards to birthing offspring (I am so glad that I am not a female hyena!). The cub has to come out somewhere and unfortunately it rips the vulva. That was painful to even read about. I do have to say though, this was absolutely the best discussion on hyena biology of any book I have read so far. The rest of the book:The last part of the book veered away from animal behavior and examined the more sociological aspects of cannibalism-- where the word originated, how it appeared in literature throughout the ages, and what our current conception of cannibalism is. Those aspects went on a little too long for my taste, but I can imagine other people enjoying those sections. "
31,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,4,"What an unexpectedly decent read. Unlike many others fascinated by this topic and other types of violence so prevalent on screen, I'm pretty chicken and would like to steer clear from those. Yet an article on National Geographic persuaded me to pick it up since the book seems a lot more scientific and less sensational. And I love reading about animals, and so was hoping for some light entertainment and instead got pretty educated. Writing in a conversational tone, yet packed with a lot of knowledge and terminologies that it's first time since ever that I have to repeatedly look words up, Schutt casually discusses cannibalism in the animal kingdom then gradually move to more difficult and gory scenes in human society. His presentation of China, admittedly, still hasn't convinced me, it feels like his research in China both ancient and modern time isn't rigorous enough. Yet it motivates me to read a book currently on my reading shelf about the Great Leap Forward.The book doesn't stop with cannibalism and definitely isn't a simple ""objective"" piece of writing describing the phenomenon. Schutt inserts his argument on religion, colonialism, on climate change, on modern obsession with violence, on the government and the economy. He talks bluntly about unsolved issue in the study of some infectious disease. All in all, the book leaves me with goose bumps, some fear, certainly aroused neocortex.And fun fact, now I really know the origin of ""Soylent"", my favorite meal replacement these days. What an ironic naming."

Throughout history we have engaged in cannibalism for reasons of famine, burial rites, and medicinal remedies; it’s been used as a way to terrorize and even a way to show filial piety. Today, the subject of humans consuming one another has been relegated to the realm of horror movies, fiction, and the occasional psychopath, but be forewarned: As climate change progresses and humans see more famine, disease, and overcrowding, biological and cultural constraints may well disappear. I listened to the audiobook which was well narrated by Tom Perkins.One of my fave questions to ask at parties (I kid you not): Say you are starving and your survival is at stake. Do you feel differently about eating a person who is already dead, as opposed to killing someone to eat? Try it at your next gathering and report back.This book hits my sweet spot on so many levels. Most people tend to be really squeamish about the topic, but if you're not a vegetarian, what's all the fuss about? Who decided that we can eat some animals and not others? Besides, if you think that cannibalism is awful, you might want to put it in perspective. Considering the horrid historical accounts of human behavior, eating your fellow Sapiens doesn't really seem all that bad.This is a fun, informative, and eye opening book, and I learned so many things about the animal kingdom I had no idea about. I'll bet school would be much more interesting if some of these topics were incorporated into the curriculum. I could talk about some of the specifics, but then that'd spoil all the fun for you. I assure you that it's full of fascinating and juicy tidbits. The author stays away from sensational crime stories, so if you are looking for recipes, look elsewhere, but if you are willing to have ""no way!"" moments, and are willing to annoy your loved ones by constantly saying ""did you know?"", move this up your TBR.This will end up on my best of 2017 reads, and the only reason I docked a star is due to the fact that there are sections, like the final chapters, where the author gets side tracked and wanders off topic."
33,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3078602-peacegal,4,"Fans of Mary Roach's popular science books will devour CANNIBALISM, a tour of the taboo topic throughout the natural world and human history. From Tyrannosaurus rex to the Donner Party, from tadpoles who eat their siblings to American uberbreeders who dine on placenta, readers will at turns be entertained, saddened, and disgusted by the facts within--but they will always be educated. There is one point on which I'd like to add something to the text on chicken cannibalism within factory farm conditions. The author writes that pecking deaths became a widespread concern when intensive chicken farming first took hold in the 1940s. Thus, the chicken industry developed the practice of debeaking, in which the end of each chick's beak is cut or seared off to hobble them from aggressively pecking one another. The author writes that chicken ""blinder"" masks were invented in the 40s as a supposedly more humane alternative, and words it in such a way that these masks have replaced debeaking in the poultry industry today. Erm, no. While blinders are occasionally used, most notably in the intensive rearing of pheasants for release-and-shoot canned hunts, debeaking remains the rule of the day for billions of hens raised for meat and egg production. (The sheer amount of birds raised coupled with the rapidity with which beaks can be cut or seared ensures this.) Not to say that blinder masks are such a pleasant alternative. They are frequently affixed by shoving a bar through the animal's nostrils. "

Looks like that 1% of the total population could have cannibalistic tendencies but on disasters time, everybody becomes one. "
36,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,5,"Bill Schutt is a writer I really appreciate and enjoy. I read Dark Banquet a few years ago and loved it. He is for me sort of the Neil DeGrasse tyson of biology/animal behavior (human animals included). He is a wonderful storyteller and the structures of his books are clear and accessible and well-organized but also scientifically and sociologically and culturally incisive, and meandering in nice ways. He takes on a specific topic and stays with it in his way, but at the same time, explores it from many angles. He is curious and his interest and curiosity are evident in his writing. He clearly relishes exploring ideas, behaviors and histories and does not look away from the absurdity and violence of human cultures. In this book, in addition to providing insight into various and common cannibalistic behaviors throughout the animal kingdom, he interrogates human cultural and ideological relationships to cannibalism. He asks the question: are our monotheistic western cultures' ideas about and fear and hatred of cannibalism of a genetic origin in any way, or purely cultural. He talks of the devastating irony--how Europeans used the idea of the inherent evil of cannibalism to justify the brutal massacre of unnumbered non-European peoples who may or may not have engaged in cannibalistic rituals. I love the illustrations in the book. I love how Schutt takes myths and legends about certain animals acts or habits of cannibalism and offers a much more complex and nuanced picture. He puts some myths to rest. He offers many fascinating particulars in their places, including stories of physiological changes (epigenetic?) in certain aquatic and semiaquatic (and maybe other? can't recall) animals who engage in filial cannibalism. Also, there's a fantastic section about some messy, dart-throwing gastropods. Clearly, I am a fan of the book and recommend it highly.here's a quote from intro:Is it really a surprise, though, that our greatest cinematic villain is a man-eating psychiatrist while the mild-mannered runner-up is based on a real-life cannibal killer? Perhaps not, if one considers that many cultures share the belief that consuming another human is the worst (or close to the worst) behavior that a person can undertake. As a result, real-life cannibalistic psychopaths like Jeffrey Dahmer (another Wisconsin native) and his Russian counterpart, Andrei Chikatilo, have attained something akin to mythical status in the annals of history’s most notorious murderers. Whether through a filter of fictionalization, where man-eating deviants are transformed into powerful antiheroes, or through tabloids sensationalizing the crimes of real-life cannibals, these tales feed our obsession with all things gruesome—an obsession that is now an acceptable facet of our society.A different attitude was taken toward “primitive” social or ethnic groups whose members might not have shared the Western take on cannibalism taboos. At best, these “savages” were pegged as souls to be saved, but only if they met certain requirements. In the first half of the 20th century, for example, explorers and the missionaries who followed them ventured into the foreboding New Guinea highlands and quickly imposed one hard-and-fast rule for the locals: Cannibalism in any form was strictly forbidden.But far worse instances of cultural intrusion occurred elsewhere and throughout history, as those accused of consuming other humans, for any reason, were brutalized, enslaved, and murdered. The most infamous example of this practice began during the last years of the 15th century when millions of indigenous people living in the Caribbean and Mexico were summarily reclassified as cannibals for reasons that had little to do with people-eating. Instead, it paved the way for them to be robbed, beaten, conquered, and slain, all at the whim of their new Spanish masters.Similar atrocities were carried out on a massive scale by a succession of flag-planting European powers who (if one believes their accounts) wrested South America, Africa, and the Indo-Pacific away from man-eating savages, whose behavior placed them beyond the pale of anything that could remotely be described as human.So were European fears about cannibalism simply an invention used to justify conquest, or were there cultures, including those encountered by the Spaniards, where the consumption of humans was regarded as normal behavior? Although defining someone as a cannibal became an effective way to dehumanize them, there is also evidence that ritual cannibalism, as embodied in various customs related to funerary rites and warfare, occurred throughout history.As I began studying these forms of cannibalism, I sought to determine not only their perceived functions, but just how widespread they were or weren’t. Surprisingly—or perhaps not surprisingly given the subject matter—there is disagreement among anthropologists regarding ritual cannibalism. Some deny that it ever occurred, while others claim that the behavior did occur but was uncommon. Still others claim that cannibalism was practiced by many cultures throughout history and for a variety of reasons. One such body of evidence led me straight back to European history, where I learned that a particularly macabre form of cannibalism had been practiced for hundreds of years by nobility, physicians, and commoners alike, even into the 20th century.As a zoologist, I was, of course, intrigued at the prospect of documenting cases of non-human cannibalism. Looking back now, I can see that I’d started my inquiry with something less than a completely open mind. Part of me reasoned that since cannibalism was presumably a rare occurrence in humans (at least in modern times), it would likely be similarly rare in the animal kingdom.Once I dug further, though, I discovered that cannibalism differs in frequency between major animal groups—nonexistent in some and common in others. It varies from species to species and even within the same species, depending on local environmental conditions. Cannibalism also serves a variety of functions, depending on the cannibal. There are even examples in which an individual being cannibalized receives a benefit.In several instances, cannibalism appears to have arisen only recently in a species, and human activity might be the cause. In one such case, news reports informed horrified audiences that some of the most highly recognizable animals on the planet were suddenly consuming their own young. “Polar bears resort to cannibalism as Arctic ice shrinks,” reported CNN, while the Times of London echoed the sentiment: “Climate Change Forcing Polar Bears to Become Cannibals.” It was Reuters, though, that scored a perfect ten on the gruesome scale with an online slide show in which an adult polar bear was seen carrying around the still cute-as-a button head of a dead cub, the remains of its spinal cord trailing behind like a red streamer.The real story behind polar bear [contextualized in book...] cannibalism turned out to be just as fascinating, though it would also serve as a perfect example of how many accusations of and stories about cannibalism throughout history were untrue, unproven, or exaggerated—distorted by sensationalism, deception, a lack of scientific knowledge, and just plain bad writing. With the passage of time, these accounts too often become part of the historical record, their errors long forgotten. Part of my job would be to expose those errors.I was also extremely curious to see if the origin of cannibalism taboos could be traced back to the natural world, so I developed a pair of alternative hypotheses. Perhaps our aversion to consuming our own kind is hardwired into our brains and as such is a part of our genetic blueprint—a gene or two whose expression selects against such behavior. I reasoned that if such a built-in deterrent exists, then humans and most non-humans (with the exception of a few well-known anomalies such as black widow spiders and praying mantises) would avoid cannibalism at all costs. Thus, the taboo would have a biological foundation.Conversely, I weighed the possibility that the revulsion most people have at the very mention of cannibalism might stem solely from our culture. Of course, this led to even more questions. What are the cultural roots of the cannibalism taboo and how has it become so widespread? I also wondered why, as disgusted as we are at the very thought of cannibalism, we’re so utterly fascinated by it? Might cannibalism have been more common in our ancestors, before societal rules turned it into something abhorrent? I looked for evidence in the fossil record and elsewhere.Finally, I considered what it would take to break down the biological or cultural constraints that prevent us from eating each other on a regular basis. Could there come a time, in our not-so-distant future, when human cannibalism becomes commonplace? And for that matter, was it already becoming a more frequent occurrence? The answers to these questions are far from certain but, then again, there is much about the topic of cannibalism that cannot be neatly divided into black and white. Likely or not, though, the circumstances that might lead to outbreaks of widespread cannibalism in the 21st century are grounded in science, not science fiction.My aim was to stay away from the clichéd ideas about cannibalism that are already ingrained in our collective psyche and, with such a wealth of relevant material to explore, I quickly realized that this wouldn’t be difficult. Even the most famous cannibal stories, it turned out, had factual gaps that are only now being filled. In the case of the Donner Party, for example, I joined researchers whose scientific approach to the most infamous cannibalism-related event in American history had shed new light on this 19th-century tale of stranded pioneers.I’ve tried to approach each example from a scientific viewpoint, delving into what I considered the most intriguing aspects of anthropology, evolution, and biology to provide the broadest yet most engaging natural history of this behavior. What happens to our bodies and minds under starvation conditions? Why are women better equipped to survive starvation than men? And what physiological extremes would compel someone to consume the body of a friend or even a family member?But it’s not just the abundance of eggs and young that makes fish such a popular menu item for members of their own species. Many terrestrial vertebrates produce few or even a single offspring, and most of these newly born or newly hatched individuals already exhibit considerable body size. In many fish species, the extraordinary number of eggs produced imposes a limit on their size, and so a full-grown cod might be a million times (or six orders of magnitude) larger than its own eggs. This fact goes a long way to explain why the majority of them exhibit about as much individual recognition of their offspring as humans do for a handful of raisins. Fish eggs, larvae, and fry (i.e., young fish) are vast in number, minute in size, and high in nutritional value. This makes them an abundant, nonthreatening, and easily collected food source. It’s also why ichthyologists consider the absence of cannibalism in fishes, rather than its presence, to be the exceptional case."

I believed this book would focus more on canabalism in the animal world and then BRIEFLY connect this to human cannibalism. It didnt happen this way. I was so fascinated by the instances of cannabilism in the animal world and, surprisingly, the sections I read on human cannibalism were dull. This could have been due to it focusing mostly on references to cannibalism in early literature and focusing so heavily on the story of the Donner's. I lost interest at this point and just never picked it back up. Cool words I learned:Conspecific AdelphophagyDermatophagyAnthropophagyAnthropophagus phobiaOophagyTheophagy Placentophagy Apophallation which is the biting off of a penis (exhibited in terrestrial slugs)."

There are no sensationalized accounts of cannabalism through serial killers or the like. It was well written and easy to understand. I found the incidences of humans more interesting than the insects or animals. My two favorite sections were about the Donnor Party and the placenta. Props to the author for doing what he did for the research! That is some first hand knowledge there!

I did both the whole day).Cannibalism is a history and an explanation of the act. But don't worry, the author doesn't start with the stomach churning human eating human stuff right away. He starts with the 'lighter' stuff - cannibalism by non-humans.The book starts by defining the various types of cannibalism - of which I remember two: eating your family members and eating people of your species who aren't related to you. Then it gets defined even further, to things like filial cannibalism (parents eating children or vice versa), cannibalism during mating (turns out the Black Widow Spider has been maligned.After going through all these decidedly non-humans, the author slowly makes his way back to us.If I were to generalise, I'd say that the book says that cannibalism tends to be a response to specific conditions (overcrowding, lack of nutrition, etc). Although in humans, there are ritual cannibals. Oh, and grey areas like breastfeeding (if skin cells come off) and I can't remember what else. (For the record, I am in no way justifying cannibalism in the whole 'eat literal human flesh' form)Although I was really surprised about the fact that ritual cannibalism existed in Chinese culture, especially as an act of filial piety. Then I remembered stories about sons cutting their thighs to feed their parents (though I can't remember from where) and I realised that IS cannibalism "
40,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34493714-yasaman,3,"An interesting read. Schutt's overall take on cannibalism - especially in non-human species - is that it essentially occurs either as a mechanism for passing on genetic information to the next generation, or to ensure your and/or your offspring's survival and conservation of energy, which again goes back to making sure genetic information is passed on. So, from an evolutionary standpoint, it makes perfect sense, especially considering that most species do not rely on behaviors/methods such as altruism and Kin selection for their fitness rates. When the topic is discussed in regards to humans, there is also ritualistic and medicinal cannibalism to consider, which Schutt explains is a lot more common than expected. What I liked about Schutt's discussion on the topic is that he shows the hypocrisy of viewpoints regarding ritualistic cannibalism based on which group of people is practicing it (i.e. indigenous people or white European Christians?). But, interestingly, it was also what I didn't like about the book in general: Firstly, Schutt oversimplifies the practice based on strict definitions (I hardly think biting fingernails and eating organs such as liver should fall under the same category,) and, secondly, he doesn't seem overly concerned about explaining that just because something is a cultural influence and seemingly widespread, it doesn't make it any less wrong to do."
41,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6314574-allisonlcarter,3,"While starting in the animal kingdom seems a logical place to start a conversation about cannibalism, this book gets bogged down in the world of weird sex snails and spiders for far too long. What makes cannibalism of such enduring interest is that it's fundamentally a question of whether it is moral to eat a human body under any circumstances. Since morality is, in most cases, relative, this is an endlessly fascinating question for homo sapiens and varies widely from culture to culture. Since animals do not have ethical frameworks that we are aware of, knowing that this invertebrate or that eats each other is less interesting, except in the broadest way.When Schutt does get to human consumption, he mostly covers familiar ground -- the Donner Party, Papua New Guinea, etc. The book shines in a few chapters that skirt the issue of why cannibalism is taboo in Western culture and examines the practice in China. The book is capped off with a long exploration of mad cow disease, which, since the cows didn't choose to engage in cannibalism or derive an evolutionary advantage from it, seems out of place.Still, the book is immaculately researched and Schutt has an amusingly wry sense of humor."
42,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63058444-joshua,5,"The following review will contain no references and/or bad puns of Hannibal Lecter. I'm just putting that out there now because the only really interesting Cannibal was Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The dude wore ties to work. That's class.The taboo of cannibalism is exactly what lead me to this book. Working in a library I regularly stock the ""New Books"" section and everyday I saw the book with it's distinct cover. Curiosity got the better of me and I checked the book out and read it in a week. The reader may not think themselves terribly interested in the idea of reading about the history and practice of cannibalism as an act, but they're missing out because there's also loads of biology.Schutt manages to write an easy, approachable book about an act that many people would rather not discuss, but as he points out in his introduction the fact that nobody wants to talk about is reason enough to discuss it. Schutt approaches the book at the start as a biologist, a zoologist to be specific, and just tries to understand biologically why cannibalism takes place in the wild in natural conditions. Once this is done he tackles the human element and it's here that the reader will be able to see that the issue becomes complicated. I won't lie, there are some elements of this book hat can be troubling (the eating of kids during the siege of Stalingrad just about broke me), but this book was approachable and enjoyable to read. It was only in the last three chapters that the writing began to grow a little tiresome, but even in these closing pages the book still felt strong and by it's end I felt as if I had really learned something about the natural world while also being warned about the possible future.Cannibalism isn't a fun topic unless it involves Anthony Hopkins (damn I broke my first rule) but it is an important topic and Schott succeeds in demonstrating that, yes, it does deserve an entire book to itself."

But I thought this one sounded interesting, and it turns out I really loved it! Bill Schutt has a great style that alternates between clear, concise explanations of biological concepts, overviews of research fields and more personal narratives and interviews he had with other scientists. To be clear, this is emphatically not a book about cannibal crimes (in fact, the author devotes only a few paragraphs to such murderers, and states that he both feels that fields has been covered more than enough, and that he doesn't want to be disrespectful towards victims and their families). What it is, is a journey through cannibalism as a biological and social mechanism, starting from examples of various animals and the research done on different species, before moving on to an investigation whether those same mechanisms come into play for humans and how different human cultures have viewed cannibalism throughout history. I actually feel like I've learned a lot about topics I didn't know much about, and had good time while acquiring that knowledge - a perfect combination!"
44,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24590339-k-willows,4,"This is informative & well rounded, but leans heavily on the side of serious science writing (as opposed to more casual/humorous science writing). It does have its bits of humor but overall this is a book I'd recommend to science minded people interested in learning more about the cultural taboo of cannibalism. I felt that the final 3 chapters could have been condensed down. I would have liked to read more about the Aghori of India but they were surprisingly unmentioned. Finally, for true crime nerds, this book does not go into depth regarding the cannibalistic killers, but I felt the author had good reason for avoiding that subject and the sensationalism that comes with it."
45,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46502154-anna,4,"Obviously, it's not for everyone but as someone who's been interested in cannibalism for a very long time (don't ask me why) I found it both interesting and informative. It's certainly the best and the most scientific book I've read on the subject so far. I was a bit worried that my English might fail me because the author is a biologist but luckily I had no problems understanding what he was talking about. What I liked the most was that Bill Schutt covered a very wide range of types of cannibalism and - unlike many other authors - didn't focus on serial killers/psychopaths (they are mentioned at the beginning so it might be a disappointment to those readers who were hoping for more) and sensational stories about tribes consuming human flesh like it's tacos. As an avid fan of animal documentaries I was the most interested in the first part of the book (even though I knew many of the facts Schutt talked about) and I was slightly bored towards the end when he focused on diseases (ones rumoured to be transmitted through infected human meat). But I honestly appreciate how thorough and detailed the research was."
46,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12256655-alisa,4,"I found this to be a very interesting book. I understand the subject matter isn't for everyone but it's not done is a sensational way. The books take a more scientific and anthropological look at cannibalism. There is only a small amount of coverage of human cannibalism. Much more is on the animal kingdom. I found this super interesting and I definitely recommend it to those of you interested in science, anthropology and history. **ARC provided through Netgalley**"

48,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1702050-fox,5,"I've been eagerly awaiting this book since I first became aware of its release, which was likely due to Daphne's review. Cannibalism is an undeniably fascinating subject, and  Bill Schutt tackles it with grace and humor, as long for a disdain for the sensationalism that has too long colored all publications on the topic. The book was fascinating from cover to cover, and is extremely well-organized. It begins with the study of it in the animal kingdom, and ends with the much needed topic of prion diseases, their spread, and how poorly understood they are. Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History is destined to become the go-to book on the topic. Well sourced, entertainingly written, and scattered throughout with just enough humor and a large dose of respect, it does its topic justice.  Bill Schutt writes with a deft hand that does much to dispel many of the sensationalized myths that surround some of the better known cases (i.e. Donner Party, Praying Mantises, Black Widows, etc.) and does a good job explaining topics that have never really gotten enough focus (i.e. prion diseases, kuru) or have suffered from the wrong type of focus.This book was immensely readable, and more in depth and well-sourced than I expected a pop-science book to be. It definitely opened my eyes to the complexity of the topic, and added to disdain I already felt towards one Jared Diamond and his tendency to over simplify nearly everything. I'm very much looking forward to more being published in regards to the Neanderthal hypotheses presented in this book, as well as for more studies being done on the truly terrifying prion diseases. Nothing terrifies me more than the section on prion diseases in this book, and what it may hold in store for our future."
49,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1424908-map,4,"I won a kindle version of this book as a Goodreads Giveaway.I've seen some reviews on here claiming that this book is dry and overly scientific, but I have to disagree. As a psychologist who got my start in animal behaviorism, I appreciated Schutt's precise and behavioral descriptions of animals as opposed to engaging in anthropomorphism. I also found him to have a very dry wit that livened up the chapters without making them unscientific.The first few chapters, focusing primarily on animals, felt less cohesive than the ones focused on humans, which seemed more clearly delineated into categories of cannibalism or specific instances. But all of it was entertaining and engaging.On the downside, as my husband lived in England between 1988-1990, I'm relatively sure he'll die of Mad Cow Disease any day now. When I mentioned this to him, his response was, ""Oh yes, I'm actually not allowed to donate blood because I lived in England during that time."" Wonderful."
50,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61034045-chuy-ruiz,4,"I was given this book as a gift and I definitely enjoyed reading it. It isn't a book that I would have probably picked out myself, so it was great to still learn plenty and find it interesting. It explores the topic of cannibalism in non-human animals at first, then moves on to the social taboos in most cultures around the practice. It takes a skeptical approach to the claims of cannibalism in any culture and looks for actual hard evidence of it, instead of just second hand claims and anecdotal claims. It also explores the potential causes and ramifications of cannibalism in an interesting and engaging way."
51,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1961913-na-amen,4,"Overall I really liked this book. There were some small moments of throwaway lines where I felt the objectivity of the author slipped and some cultural/biological prejudices reared their heads. A good study of cannibalism in nature across species that stayed away from sensationalism, even while discussing the Donner party."
52,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3237385-melissa,5,"4.5* I flew through this! I can't remember the last time I struggled to put down nonfiction. Schutt makes a point of avoiding the sensational, but that doesn't prevent his book from being fascinating and engrossing. I also appreciated how he pointed out conflicting points of view / arguments between scholars, especially when it came to human cannibalistic behaviors."
53,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8071101-jeanne,2,"I found this book a difficult read. It read more like a science proof paper than general interest book.

55,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49782194-conor-ahern,4,"There are very few things I find myself getting squeamish about, but cannibalism is one of them. It's not so much the Donner-Party, necessity-of-survival type cannibalism that bothers me, either--hunger knows no morality and forces normal people to do things that they might ordinarily find horrific. It's more of the victim-of-cannibalization type that makes me shudder. I suppose on some fundamental level, I believe that it's wrong for humans to be used as means to an end, and succumbing by way of cannibalization seems to be the ultimate example of that; your life and your body reduced to the fulfillment of some fetish that by its very nature assigns you no greater value than a head of cattle. These were probably the hardest parts of this book for me. Stories of cannibalism in the animal kingdom and its evolutionary advantages were much more interesting than unsettling. This book got me thinking of other taboos, things that are so ingrained that logic alone can't account for the aversion. The only others that came to mind were incest and pedophilia, but at least by degree those things operate in contemporary societies as norms, and certainly have done so to a greater extent in the past. But it's not like the British or the Yoruba have a tradition of eating, say, an arm but would draw the line there; unlike with the other two types of taboos I mentioned, cannibalism seems much more to be an all-or-nothing type of convention. While societies all over the world permit relationships that we might regard as incestuous or pedophilic, it seems that societies that countenance what we would describe as cannibalism are few and far between. And I guess it's Schutt's goal to show that this is more of a Western taboo, which is interesting. He points to our Greek and Shakespearean cautionary tales as powerfully inculcating the supposed evil of cannibalism, and then looks to China for examples that, at the very least, cannibalism wasn't regarded there in such black-and-white terms, citing Imperial delicacies including human flesh and conventions whereby parents would trade children with other families during times of hunger so as to avoid having to consume their own children. China is a big place with a lot of people and a ton of recorded history, though, so you're bound to come across anything sooner or later, right?I think the interesting thing for me has been that I gave it a fair shot but in the end I simply can't get over the taboo. Much as I try, and Chinese evidence to the contrary placed before me, I cannot get past the idea that it's wrong, with nothing more articulate than that to say about it! Oh well, I'm only human. This book was often funny and takes a light touch. Very worth chewing over, if you can stomach it!"
56,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/616321-juushika,3,"This is a decent overview of the history and biology of cannibalism. The zoological studies are diverse and broad, and make effective arguments about the causes and therefore evolutionary benefits of cannibalism. It lines up nicely with the human studies which investigate these same causes, particularly privation. The issue of evolutionary benefit for humans is of course more complicated, and Schutt takes a variety of approaches, looking at cannibalism both as an act and as a social concept, and this latter--particular the role of (accusations of) cannibalism in justifications for genocide--gives the book depth.But I have too many unanswered questions: What are the ethics of murder versus eating the already-dead versus cannibalism as a social taboo--how does sapience factor into the erstwhile benefits of survival cannibalism? What is it that makes the taboo of cannibalism compelling in the public consciousness, and how does this intersect with cases of criminal cannibalism? I respect the decision to avoid sensationalism and over-reported criminal cases, but the lack here is conspicuous; meanwhile, using Freud to discuss taboo is cliché and, frankly, problematic. What is the cost/benefit for the evolutionary benefits versus health risks of cannibalism; where's the tipping point in that equation and what protective measures exist? Many of these answers exist by implication, and most of them are ""it's complicated,"" but I wish Schutt were bolder & reached further. The only bold conclusion he draws is a warning about the intersection of desensitization and survival cannibalism in near-future disaster situations--a lazy argument that directly conflicts the desensitized genocidal/cannibalistic human past. (All cultures are desensitized in their own special way.) I liked this well enough, the breadth of it is interesting, the science accessible; Schutt's humor conflicts sometimes with the deceptive gravity of his topic, but it makes for a readable text. But I wanted more, more depth, more asked but unanswerable questions, and that's not present here."
57,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5790437-aj-sterkel,4,"Likes: This book gave me nightmares about dying from mad cow disease. Nightmares probably don’t sound like a good thing, but if I’m thinking about a book in my sleep, it must be doing something right. Mad cow disease is especially terrifying because the British government tried to suppress info about it to protect the beef industry. Yeah . . . we’re all screwed.Anyway, I appreciate that the author looks at cannibalism from a scientific point-of-view instead of a sensationalist point-of-view. He avoids most of the serial killer talk and focuses on nature. Which animals are cannibals and why? If it’s common for animals to eat their friends, why is it rare for modern humans to do the same? Where did the taboo against cannibalism come from? (Hint: Christianity and authors with over-active imaginations.)I enjoyed most of the chapters in this book. The writing style is funnier than I expected. My favorite chapters are the ones about Christopher Columbus. I knew about the damage he did to the places he “explored,” but I didn’t know his connection to cannibalism. Queen Isabella decided that only New World cannibals could be enslaved. Selling slaves was big business, so Columbus and his followers slapped the cannibal label on pretty much everybody. I love that the author examines the history of cannibalism and how our (often irrational) fears of it have shaped the modern world. It’s a unique approach to the subject.“[T]he idea of cannibalism had become a handy symbol for unacceptable behavior practiced by “Others”—a broad and malleable category of evildoers that included enemies, followers of non-Christian religions, and any groups determined to retain their “uncivilized” customs.” – CannibalismDislikes: Since there are frogs on the cover, I expected to learn more about animal cannibalism. The first few chapters are about animals, but then the focus shifts to humans and mostly stays on humans. I wanted more animals.The author is clearly a scientist. I am definitely not a scientist. For me, the writing is too dry and sciencey (totally a real word) at times. The author goes into too much detail about a few subjects—such as kuru, a disease that humans get from eating their families. The science behind Kuru takes up so many pages that I got bored with it. The Bottom Line: One of the most educational books I’ve read this year. If you’re interested in learning about cannibalism, I recommend it. (Just prepare yourself for mad cow nightmares.)Do you like reviews, giveaways, and bookish nonsense? Good news! I have a blog for that. "
58,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4876063-elphareads,4,"I mean, just look at the title of this. CANNIBALISM: A PERFECTLY NATURAL HISTORY? How could I not? I don't know who Bill Schutt is, but man does he know how to take a pretty morbid and kind of yucky topic and turn it into something palatable. SEE WHAT I DID?Bill Schutt examines cannibalism in this world, be it in the animal kingdom, in cultural practice, or survival situations. He talks about all kinds of cannibals, from tadpoles to the Donner Party to Papua New Guinea, and puts them into a scientific and cultural context. Usually with some pretty funny anecdotes or quips to go along with it. While the sociological examinations were a bit easier for me to swallow than the scientific explanations, I quite enjoyed CANNIBALISM: A PERFECTLY NATURAL HISTORY. Schutt did a very good job of making all of these sometimes yucky and always fascinating realities very easy to understand, and didn't try to sensationalize anything around the practice of cannibalism. He also did some really interesting chapters about Mad Cow Disease and modern farming practices, which is just another example of 'progress' coming back and biting us on the butt. True, sometimes it's not for the squeamish, but Schutt delivers all this information with charm and aplomb (and even details his experience eating placenta, given to him by some enthusiastic parents). Super interesting and kind of gross too, CANNIBALISM: A PERFECTLY NATURAL HISTORY is a book I'm glad I picked up. "
59,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"This is an interesting little book. Schutt begins with detailing the frequently fascinating ways that cannibalism occurs in the natural world, and then he moves on to the history of cannibalism among the human animals. People have been eating people for a long time. When a city is under siege, or people find themselves adrift at sea without food for weeks... human beings are going to start looking increasingly delicious despite the taboos (see: Kramer in Newman's imagination in that episode of Seinfeld where he accidentally cooks himself with butter). Shutt also explores cultures where that taboo doesn't exist, and where people eat people ritualistically or simply because they taste delicious (the flavor of humans, if you were wondering, gets compared by various people to tuna, pork, and veal).And if we think the Western world is too civilized for Cannibalism, Schutt reminds us that Europeans were eating mummia (ground up Egyptian mummies, or counterfeit ground up mummies) for medicinal reasons right through the end of the Victorian age, and that the practice of placenta eating has actually been growing in recent years."
60,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"Really enjoyable read! Remember all of those awesome studies from animal behavior class, like the ones that demonstrated how many animals avoid having sex with their father, mother, sister, or brother -- chemicals inside their noses and brains help them identify ""self"" and ""non-self"", instructing them not to have sex with anything too similar to ""self"" -- or the studies that demonstrated how sexual selection could spell death for sexy males -- female fish preferred the most orange males, which drove selection toward fish so orange, they were easily spotted and gobbled up by predators -- or the other studies that outlined the many shocking behaviors and likely motivations of various animals? Well, this book is chock full of those types of studies, only they are geared solely at understanding why animals might or might not eat each other instead of why they might or might not mate with each other. Here is a sampling of the intensely interesting things you will find in well researched chapters. Black Widows:Contrary to the well held belief that female Black Widows spiders and female Preying Mantis devour their males when mating, these cannibalistic behaviors are reserved for times of great stress, such as when there is a food shortage or these animals are in captivity. Since they had only been studied in captivity, researchers were only privy to the behaviors associated with that stressor. If the Black Widow had been observed in natural conditions, when food supplies were sufficient, she would have never gotten the name ""Black Widow"". In truth, females spiders are far more often the victims of cannibalism than the perpetrators. In at least one species of spider, the females do a dance to make the males notice them and choose them to mate with. Instead of having sex, as the female intended, she made herself noticed and became a tasty treat for a male spider who, with the energy gained from eating her, moved on to court another female spider who he did choose to mate with. When times are really lean, there is a spider species who eats its own limbs! Spiders and Praying Mantis are not the only animals who do not usually practice cannibalism but turn to that behavior when they are exposed to stressful or unusual conditions. Cats, mice, rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits are all driven to cannibalism when facing similar conditions, but the hamster seems to be more prone to cannibalism than most species. If hamster siblings are kept in the same cage, they will often fight to the death at 4 weeks old, when they reach sexual maturity. The winner will eat the carcass of the loser. Though the behavior is common to many mothers, mother hamsters engage far more often in eating their young when the mother herself is handled close to the time when she gives birth or when her babies are handled when they are little. Apes:Cannibalism is generally rarer in ape species, including humans. However, when they engage in the practice, they are like other animals in that it is usually in times of stress, but not always. There have been serial killers who seem to enjoy eating their victims. There even seem to a pair of mother daughter serial killer chimpanzees, named Passion and Pom, who ate between 5 and 10 infants after attacking the new mothers. It seems it was all in an effort to obtain food. So, perhaps Passion and Pom's actions are not as unexplainable as Jeffery Dahmer's. Carnassial Dentation:The shape of teeth can tell us a lot about the evolution of various species. Schutt discussed the evolution of polar bear teeth to talk in general about how teeth, such as carnassial teeth, help meat eating species rip chunks of meet off their prey. Even though I have read a fair amount about this subject, I wasn't bored at all. In fact, I thought it was one of the better discussions on teeth and evolution. If you enjoy reading about ripping pieces of meat into smaller pieces, in order to aid digestion, I suggest you read, I Contain Multitudes as well. The author of that book, Ed Yong, gave a good bit of detail about gut microbes-- where they are placed in the gut, in front or behind -- so that the animals and the microbes both enjoy a wonderful meal. Yong discussed the types of microbes needed for a meat eating diet vs. a vegetable diet. I could not stop thinking about what Yong wrote when reading this section of Schutt's Cannibalism book. Schutt also used the polar bear section to satisfyingly discuss climate change and the stupidity of the media. Definitely worth reading. Hyenas and infanticide:Who doesn't love to eat babies? It seems that most animals who eat meat, love to eat the babies most. This seems to hold true whether it is a different species or a different species from the animal doing the eating. Chimps patrol their borders and when they encounter a female and her baby, they kill the baby and try to hook up with the female. Nothing says love like murdering her offspring. Chimps are not alone. Males from many different animal species eat babies in order to push females into estrus, so they can mate with them. One female species has evolved a protection against infanticide, and as a result is a dominant member of their clan-- the hyena. To really understand the magic of female hyena biology, it's important to understand sexual development in embryos. Embryos are genderless but have precursors to mammary glands and penises. If an embryo gets an XY chromosome the penis bud will grow, but the memory glands will not. . If the embryo receives XX, the embryo will still grow the penis bud but then get the signal to stop the growth when it is very small, leaving behind a clitoris instead of a large penis. The XX will also send a signal to grow the mammary glands. Males have nipples but cannot feed a baby. This is because they do not have XX, which makes mammary glands that allows milk to flow through the nipples. XY and XX chromosomes use hormones to signal which morphology a body should have. The XY chromosome contains testosterone, which signals the penis bud to grow into a penis . The XX chromosome contains estrogen, which is what signals the growth of mammary glands.In spotted hyenas, researchers believe a mutation developed to provide the female spotted hyena with more testosterone, resulting in a signal to grow the penis bud out more. Thus, female hyenas have a very large clitoris (elongated penis bud). Their vulva is fused shut, allowing them to pee through their clitoris/penis bud, just like a male pees through their penis. When a male wants to have sex with a female, she really has to be receptive, just as a male would have to be receptive to have sex. This is because it's actually like inserting a penis into a penis, making it virtually impossible to force a female to have sex. While evolution did them a favor in not allowing them to be raped by males, it was unkind to them in regards to birthing offspring (I am so glad that I am not a female hyena!). The cub has to come out somewhere and unfortunately it rips the vulva. That was painful to even read about. I do have to say though, this was absolutely the best discussion on hyena biology of any book I have read so far. The rest of the book:The last part of the book veered away from animal behavior and examined the more sociological aspects of cannibalism-- where the word originated, how it appeared in literature throughout the ages, and what our current conception of cannibalism is. Those aspects went on a little too long for my taste, but I can imagine other people enjoying those sections. "
61,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,4,"What an unexpectedly decent read. Unlike many others fascinated by this topic and other types of violence so prevalent on screen, I'm pretty chicken and would like to steer clear from those. Yet an article on National Geographic persuaded me to pick it up since the book seems a lot more scientific and less sensational. And I love reading about animals, and so was hoping for some light entertainment and instead got pretty educated. Writing in a conversational tone, yet packed with a lot of knowledge and terminologies that it's first time since ever that I have to repeatedly look words up, Schutt casually discusses cannibalism in the animal kingdom then gradually move to more difficult and gory scenes in human society. His presentation of China, admittedly, still hasn't convinced me, it feels like his research in China both ancient and modern time isn't rigorous enough. Yet it motivates me to read a book currently on my reading shelf about the Great Leap Forward.The book doesn't stop with cannibalism and definitely isn't a simple ""objective"" piece of writing describing the phenomenon. Schutt inserts his argument on religion, colonialism, on climate change, on modern obsession with violence, on the government and the economy. He talks bluntly about unsolved issue in the study of some infectious disease. All in all, the book leaves me with goose bumps, some fear, certainly aroused neocortex.And fun fact, now I really know the origin of ""Soylent"", my favorite meal replacement these days. What an ironic naming."
62,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3123067-elizabeth-a,4,"Book blurb: Eating one’s own kind is completely natural behavior in thousands of species, including humans. Throughout history we have engaged in cannibalism for reasons of famine, burial rites, and medicinal remedies; it’s been used as a way to terrorize and even a way to show filial piety. Today, the subject of humans consuming one another has been relegated to the realm of horror movies, fiction, and the occasional psychopath, but be forewarned: As climate change progresses and humans see more famine, disease, and overcrowding, biological and cultural constraints may well disappear. I listened to the audiobook which was well narrated by Tom Perkins.One of my fave questions to ask at parties (I kid you not): Say you are starving and your survival is at stake. Do you feel differently about eating a person who is already dead, as opposed to killing someone to eat? Try it at your next gathering and report back.This book hits my sweet spot on so many levels. Most people tend to be really squeamish about the topic, but if you're not a vegetarian, what's all the fuss about? Who decided that we can eat some animals and not others? Besides, if you think that cannibalism is awful, you might want to put it in perspective. Considering the horrid historical accounts of human behavior, eating your fellow Sapiens doesn't really seem all that bad.This is a fun, informative, and eye opening book, and I learned so many things about the animal kingdom I had no idea about. I'll bet school would be much more interesting if some of these topics were incorporated into the curriculum. I could talk about some of the specifics, but then that'd spoil all the fun for you. I assure you that it's full of fascinating and juicy tidbits. The author stays away from sensational crime stories, so if you are looking for recipes, look elsewhere, but if you are willing to have ""no way!"" moments, and are willing to annoy your loved ones by constantly saying ""did you know?"", move this up your TBR.This will end up on my best of 2017 reads, and the only reason I docked a star is due to the fact that there are sections, like the final chapters, where the author gets side tracked and wanders off topic."
63,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3078602-peacegal,4,"Fans of Mary Roach's popular science books will devour CANNIBALISM, a tour of the taboo topic throughout the natural world and human history. From Tyrannosaurus rex to the Donner Party, from tadpoles who eat their siblings to American uberbreeders who dine on placenta, readers will at turns be entertained, saddened, and disgusted by the facts within--but they will always be educated. There is one point on which I'd like to add something to the text on chicken cannibalism within factory farm conditions. The author writes that pecking deaths became a widespread concern when intensive chicken farming first took hold in the 1940s. Thus, the chicken industry developed the practice of debeaking, in which the end of each chick's beak is cut or seared off to hobble them from aggressively pecking one another. The author writes that chicken ""blinder"" masks were invented in the 40s as a supposedly more humane alternative, and words it in such a way that these masks have replaced debeaking in the poultry industry today. Erm, no. While blinders are occasionally used, most notably in the intensive rearing of pheasants for release-and-shoot canned hunts, debeaking remains the rule of the day for billions of hens raised for meat and egg production. (The sheer amount of birds raised coupled with the rapidity with which beaks can be cut or seared ensures this.) Not to say that blinder masks are such a pleasant alternative. They are frequently affixed by shoving a bar through the animal's nostrils. "

This book did not disappoint! So much good and interesting information with lots of discussion on the current disagreements between scientists on such topics as the Donner Party, Mad Cow Disease, and the mysteries of insect mating. This is a fascinating look at a taboo subject, and I loved every minute of it."

Otherwise, starts from the smaller animals or insects mainly, like spiders and covers also humans. The placenta business sounded so disgusting, people wanting to eat part of another human. Looks like that 1% of the total population could have cannibalistic tendencies but on disasters time, everybody becomes one. "
66,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,5,"Bill Schutt is a writer I really appreciate and enjoy. I read Dark Banquet a few years ago and loved it. He is for me sort of the Neil DeGrasse tyson of biology/animal behavior (human animals included). He is a wonderful storyteller and the structures of his books are clear and accessible and well-organized but also scientifically and sociologically and culturally incisive, and meandering in nice ways. He takes on a specific topic and stays with it in his way, but at the same time, explores it from many angles. He is curious and his interest and curiosity are evident in his writing. He clearly relishes exploring ideas, behaviors and histories and does not look away from the absurdity and violence of human cultures. In this book, in addition to providing insight into various and common cannibalistic behaviors throughout the animal kingdom, he interrogates human cultural and ideological relationships to cannibalism. He asks the question: are our monotheistic western cultures' ideas about and fear and hatred of cannibalism of a genetic origin in any way, or purely cultural. He talks of the devastating irony--how Europeans used the idea of the inherent evil of cannibalism to justify the brutal massacre of unnumbered non-European peoples who may or may not have engaged in cannibalistic rituals. I love the illustrations in the book. I love how Schutt takes myths and legends about certain animals acts or habits of cannibalism and offers a much more complex and nuanced picture. He puts some myths to rest. He offers many fascinating particulars in their places, including stories of physiological changes (epigenetic?) in certain aquatic and semiaquatic (and maybe other? can't recall) animals who engage in filial cannibalism. Also, there's a fantastic section about some messy, dart-throwing gastropods. Clearly, I am a fan of the book and recommend it highly.here's a quote from intro:Is it really a surprise, though, that our greatest cinematic villain is a man-eating psychiatrist while the mild-mannered runner-up is based on a real-life cannibal killer? Perhaps not, if one considers that many cultures share the belief that consuming another human is the worst (or close to the worst) behavior that a person can undertake. As a result, real-life cannibalistic psychopaths like Jeffrey Dahmer (another Wisconsin native) and his Russian counterpart, Andrei Chikatilo, have attained something akin to mythical status in the annals of history’s most notorious murderers. Whether through a filter of fictionalization, where man-eating deviants are transformed into powerful antiheroes, or through tabloids sensationalizing the crimes of real-life cannibals, these tales feed our obsession with all things gruesome—an obsession that is now an acceptable facet of our society.A different attitude was taken toward “primitive” social or ethnic groups whose members might not have shared the Western take on cannibalism taboos. At best, these “savages” were pegged as souls to be saved, but only if they met certain requirements. In the first half of the 20th century, for example, explorers and the missionaries who followed them ventured into the foreboding New Guinea highlands and quickly imposed one hard-and-fast rule for the locals: Cannibalism in any form was strictly forbidden.But far worse instances of cultural intrusion occurred elsewhere and throughout history, as those accused of consuming other humans, for any reason, were brutalized, enslaved, and murdered. The most infamous example of this practice began during the last years of the 15th century when millions of indigenous people living in the Caribbean and Mexico were summarily reclassified as cannibals for reasons that had little to do with people-eating. Instead, it paved the way for them to be robbed, beaten, conquered, and slain, all at the whim of their new Spanish masters.Similar atrocities were carried out on a massive scale by a succession of flag-planting European powers who (if one believes their accounts) wrested South America, Africa, and the Indo-Pacific away from man-eating savages, whose behavior placed them beyond the pale of anything that could remotely be described as human.So were European fears about cannibalism simply an invention used to justify conquest, or were there cultures, including those encountered by the Spaniards, where the consumption of humans was regarded as normal behavior? Although defining someone as a cannibal became an effective way to dehumanize them, there is also evidence that ritual cannibalism, as embodied in various customs related to funerary rites and warfare, occurred throughout history.As I began studying these forms of cannibalism, I sought to determine not only their perceived functions, but just how widespread they were or weren’t. Surprisingly—or perhaps not surprisingly given the subject matter—there is disagreement among anthropologists regarding ritual cannibalism. Some deny that it ever occurred, while others claim that the behavior did occur but was uncommon. Still others claim that cannibalism was practiced by many cultures throughout history and for a variety of reasons. One such body of evidence led me straight back to European history, where I learned that a particularly macabre form of cannibalism had been practiced for hundreds of years by nobility, physicians, and commoners alike, even into the 20th century.As a zoologist, I was, of course, intrigued at the prospect of documenting cases of non-human cannibalism. Looking back now, I can see that I’d started my inquiry with something less than a completely open mind. Part of me reasoned that since cannibalism was presumably a rare occurrence in humans (at least in modern times), it would likely be similarly rare in the animal kingdom.Once I dug further, though, I discovered that cannibalism differs in frequency between major animal groups—nonexistent in some and common in others. It varies from species to species and even within the same species, depending on local environmental conditions. Cannibalism also serves a variety of functions, depending on the cannibal. There are even examples in which an individual being cannibalized receives a benefit.In several instances, cannibalism appears to have arisen only recently in a species, and human activity might be the cause. In one such case, news reports informed horrified audiences that some of the most highly recognizable animals on the planet were suddenly consuming their own young. “Polar bears resort to cannibalism as Arctic ice shrinks,” reported CNN, while the Times of London echoed the sentiment: “Climate Change Forcing Polar Bears to Become Cannibals.” It was Reuters, though, that scored a perfect ten on the gruesome scale with an online slide show in which an adult polar bear was seen carrying around the still cute-as-a button head of a dead cub, the remains of its spinal cord trailing behind like a red streamer.The real story behind polar bear [contextualized in book...] cannibalism turned out to be just as fascinating, though it would also serve as a perfect example of how many accusations of and stories about cannibalism throughout history were untrue, unproven, or exaggerated—distorted by sensationalism, deception, a lack of scientific knowledge, and just plain bad writing. With the passage of time, these accounts too often become part of the historical record, their errors long forgotten. Part of my job would be to expose those errors.I was also extremely curious to see if the origin of cannibalism taboos could be traced back to the natural world, so I developed a pair of alternative hypotheses. Perhaps our aversion to consuming our own kind is hardwired into our brains and as such is a part of our genetic blueprint—a gene or two whose expression selects against such behavior. I reasoned that if such a built-in deterrent exists, then humans and most non-humans (with the exception of a few well-known anomalies such as black widow spiders and praying mantises) would avoid cannibalism at all costs. Thus, the taboo would have a biological foundation.Conversely, I weighed the possibility that the revulsion most people have at the very mention of cannibalism might stem solely from our culture. Of course, this led to even more questions. What are the cultural roots of the cannibalism taboo and how has it become so widespread? I also wondered why, as disgusted as we are at the very thought of cannibalism, we’re so utterly fascinated by it? Might cannibalism have been more common in our ancestors, before societal rules turned it into something abhorrent? I looked for evidence in the fossil record and elsewhere.Finally, I considered what it would take to break down the biological or cultural constraints that prevent us from eating each other on a regular basis. Could there come a time, in our not-so-distant future, when human cannibalism becomes commonplace? And for that matter, was it already becoming a more frequent occurrence? The answers to these questions are far from certain but, then again, there is much about the topic of cannibalism that cannot be neatly divided into black and white. Likely or not, though, the circumstances that might lead to outbreaks of widespread cannibalism in the 21st century are grounded in science, not science fiction.My aim was to stay away from the clichéd ideas about cannibalism that are already ingrained in our collective psyche and, with such a wealth of relevant material to explore, I quickly realized that this wouldn’t be difficult. Even the most famous cannibal stories, it turned out, had factual gaps that are only now being filled. In the case of the Donner Party, for example, I joined researchers whose scientific approach to the most infamous cannibalism-related event in American history had shed new light on this 19th-century tale of stranded pioneers.I’ve tried to approach each example from a scientific viewpoint, delving into what I considered the most intriguing aspects of anthropology, evolution, and biology to provide the broadest yet most engaging natural history of this behavior. What happens to our bodies and minds under starvation conditions? Why are women better equipped to survive starvation than men? And what physiological extremes would compel someone to consume the body of a friend or even a family member?But it’s not just the abundance of eggs and young that makes fish such a popular menu item for members of their own species. Many terrestrial vertebrates produce few or even a single offspring, and most of these newly born or newly hatched individuals already exhibit considerable body size. In many fish species, the extraordinary number of eggs produced imposes a limit on their size, and so a full-grown cod might be a million times (or six orders of magnitude) larger than its own eggs. This fact goes a long way to explain why the majority of them exhibit about as much individual recognition of their offspring as humans do for a handful of raisins. Fish eggs, larvae, and fry (i.e., young fish) are vast in number, minute in size, and high in nutritional value. This makes them an abundant, nonthreatening, and easily collected food source. It’s also why ichthyologists consider the absence of cannibalism in fishes, rather than its presence, to be the exceptional case."

I believed this book would focus more on canabalism in the animal world and then BRIEFLY connect this to human cannibalism. It didnt happen this way. I was so fascinated by the instances of cannabilism in the animal world and, surprisingly, the sections I read on human cannibalism were dull. This could have been due to it focusing mostly on references to cannibalism in early literature and focusing so heavily on the story of the Donner's. I lost interest at this point and just never picked it back up. Cool words I learned:Conspecific AdelphophagyDermatophagyAnthropophagyAnthropophagus phobiaOophagyTheophagy Placentophagy Apophallation which is the biting off of a penis (exhibited in terrestrial slugs)."

There are no sensationalized accounts of cannabalism through serial killers or the like. It was well written and easy to understand. I found the incidences of humans more interesting than the insects or animals. My two favorite sections were about the Donnor Party and the placenta. Props to the author for doing what he did for the research! That is some first hand knowledge there! I am not sure how much of this information I will be able to retain, but it was an informative and entertaining read. "

I did both the whole day).Cannibalism is a history and an explanation of the act. But don't worry, the author doesn't start with the stomach churning human eating human stuff right away. He starts with the 'lighter' stuff - cannibalism by non-humans.The book starts by defining the various types of cannibalism - of which I remember two: eating your family members and eating people of your species who aren't related to you. Then it gets defined even further, to things like filial cannibalism (parents eating children or vice versa), cannibalism during mating (turns out the Black Widow Spider has been maligned.After going through all these decidedly non-humans, the author slowly makes his way back to us.If I were to generalise, I'd say that the book says that cannibalism tends to be a response to specific conditions (overcrowding, lack of nutrition, etc). Although in humans, there are ritual cannibals. Oh, and grey areas like breastfeeding (if skin cells come off) and I can't remember what else. (For the record, I am in no way justifying cannibalism in the whole 'eat literal human flesh' form)Although I was really surprised about the fact that ritual cannibalism existed in Chinese culture, especially as an act of filial piety. Then I remembered stories about sons cutting their thighs to feed their parents (though I can't remember from where) and I realised that IS cannibalism "
70,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34493714-yasaman,3,"An interesting read. Schutt's overall take on cannibalism - especially in non-human species - is that it essentially occurs either as a mechanism for passing on genetic information to the next generation, or to ensure your and/or your offspring's survival and conservation of energy, which again goes back to making sure genetic information is passed on. So, from an evolutionary standpoint, it makes perfect sense, especially considering that most species do not rely on behaviors/methods such as altruism and Kin selection for their fitness rates. When the topic is discussed in regards to humans, there is also ritualistic and medicinal cannibalism to consider, which Schutt explains is a lot more common than expected. What I liked about Schutt's discussion on the topic is that he shows the hypocrisy of viewpoints regarding ritualistic cannibalism based on which group of people is practicing it (i.e. indigenous people or white European Christians?). But, interestingly, it was also what I didn't like about the book in general: Firstly, Schutt oversimplifies the practice based on strict definitions (I hardly think biting fingernails and eating organs such as liver should fall under the same category,) and, secondly, he doesn't seem overly concerned about explaining that just because something is a cultural influence and seemingly widespread, it doesn't make it any less wrong to do."
71,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6314574-allisonlcarter,3,"While starting in the animal kingdom seems a logical place to start a conversation about cannibalism, this book gets bogged down in the world of weird sex snails and spiders for far too long. What makes cannibalism of such enduring interest is that it's fundamentally a question of whether it is moral to eat a human body under any circumstances. Since morality is, in most cases, relative, this is an endlessly fascinating question for homo sapiens and varies widely from culture to culture. Since animals do not have ethical frameworks that we are aware of, knowing that this invertebrate or that eats each other is less interesting, except in the broadest way.When Schutt does get to human consumption, he mostly covers familiar ground -- the Donner Party, Papua New Guinea, etc. The book shines in a few chapters that skirt the issue of why cannibalism is taboo in Western culture and examines the practice in China. The book is capped off with a long exploration of mad cow disease, which, since the cows didn't choose to engage in cannibalism or derive an evolutionary advantage from it, seems out of place.Still, the book is immaculately researched and Schutt has an amusingly wry sense of humor."
72,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63058444-joshua,5,"The following review will contain no references and/or bad puns of Hannibal Lecter. I'm just putting that out there now because the only really interesting Cannibal was Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The dude wore ties to work. That's class.The taboo of cannibalism is exactly what lead me to this book. Working in a library I regularly stock the ""New Books"" section and everyday I saw the book with it's distinct cover. Curiosity got the better of me and I checked the book out and read it in a week. The reader may not think themselves terribly interested in the idea of reading about the history and practice of cannibalism as an act, but they're missing out because there's also loads of biology.Schutt manages to write an easy, approachable book about an act that many people would rather not discuss, but as he points out in his introduction the fact that nobody wants to talk about is reason enough to discuss it. Schutt approaches the book at the start as a biologist, a zoologist to be specific, and just tries to understand biologically why cannibalism takes place in the wild in natural conditions. Once this is done he tackles the human element and it's here that the reader will be able to see that the issue becomes complicated. I won't lie, there are some elements of this book hat can be troubling (the eating of kids during the siege of Stalingrad just about broke me), but this book was approachable and enjoyable to read. It was only in the last three chapters that the writing began to grow a little tiresome, but even in these closing pages the book still felt strong and by it's end I felt as if I had really learned something about the natural world while also being warned about the possible future.Cannibalism isn't a fun topic unless it involves Anthony Hopkins (damn I broke my first rule) but it is an important topic and Schott succeeds in demonstrating that, yes, it does deserve an entire book to itself."

But I thought this one sounded interesting, and it turns out I really loved it! Bill Schutt has a great style that alternates between clear, concise explanations of biological concepts, overviews of research fields and more personal narratives and interviews he had with other scientists. To be clear, this is emphatically not a book about cannibal crimes (in fact, the author devotes only a few paragraphs to such murderers, and states that he both feels that fields has been covered more than enough, and that he doesn't want to be disrespectful towards victims and their families). What it is, is a journey through cannibalism as a biological and social mechanism, starting from examples of various animals and the research done on different species, before moving on to an investigation whether those same mechanisms come into play for humans and how different human cultures have viewed cannibalism throughout history. I actually feel like I've learned a lot about topics I didn't know much about, and had good time while acquiring that knowledge - a perfect combination!"
74,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24590339-k-willows,4,"This is informative & well rounded, but leans heavily on the side of serious science writing (as opposed to more casual/humorous science writing). It does have its bits of humor but overall this is a book I'd recommend to science minded people interested in learning more about the cultural taboo of cannibalism. I felt that the final 3 chapters could have been condensed down. I would have liked to read more about the Aghori of India but they were surprisingly unmentioned. Finally, for true crime nerds, this book does not go into depth regarding the cannibalistic killers, but I felt the author had good reason for avoiding that subject and the sensationalism that comes with it."
75,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46502154-anna,4,"Obviously, it's not for everyone but as someone who's been interested in cannibalism for a very long time (don't ask me why) I found it both interesting and informative. It's certainly the best and the most scientific book I've read on the subject so far. I was a bit worried that my English might fail me because the author is a biologist but luckily I had no problems understanding what he was talking about. What I liked the most was that Bill Schutt covered a very wide range of types of cannibalism and - unlike many other authors - didn't focus on serial killers/psychopaths (they are mentioned at the beginning so it might be a disappointment to those readers who were hoping for more) and sensational stories about tribes consuming human flesh like it's tacos. As an avid fan of animal documentaries I was the most interested in the first part of the book (even though I knew many of the facts Schutt talked about) and I was slightly bored towards the end when he focused on diseases (ones rumoured to be transmitted through infected human meat). But I honestly appreciate how thorough and detailed the research was."

The books take a more scientific and anthropological look at cannibalism. There is only a small amount of coverage of human cannibalism. Much more is on the animal kingdom. I found this super interesting and I definitely recommend it to those of you interested in science, anthropology and history. **ARC provided through Netgalley**"

78,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1702050-fox,5,"I've been eagerly awaiting this book since I first became aware of its release, which was likely due to Daphne's review. Cannibalism is an undeniably fascinating subject, and  Bill Schutt tackles it with grace and humor, as long for a disdain for the sensationalism that has too long colored all publications on the topic. The book was fascinating from cover to cover, and is extremely well-organized. It begins with the study of it in the animal kingdom, and ends with the much needed topic of prion diseases, their spread, and how poorly understood they are. Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History is destined to become the go-to book on the topic. Well sourced, entertainingly written, and scattered throughout with just enough humor and a large dose of respect, it does its topic justice.  Bill Schutt writes with a deft hand that does much to dispel many of the sensationalized myths that surround some of the better known cases (i.e. Donner Party, Praying Mantises, Black Widows, etc.) and does a good job explaining topics that have never really gotten enough focus (i.e. prion diseases, kuru) or have suffered from the wrong type of focus.This book was immensely readable, and more in depth and well-sourced than I expected a pop-science book to be. It definitely opened my eyes to the complexity of the topic, and added to disdain I already felt towards one Jared Diamond and his tendency to over simplify nearly everything. I'm very much looking forward to more being published in regards to the Neanderthal hypotheses presented in this book, as well as for more studies being done on the truly terrifying prion diseases. Nothing terrifies me more than the section on prion diseases in this book, and what it may hold in store for our future."
79,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1424908-map,4,"I won a kindle version of this book as a Goodreads Giveaway.I've seen some reviews on here claiming that this book is dry and overly scientific, but I have to disagree. As a psychologist who got my start in animal behaviorism, I appreciated Schutt's precise and behavioral descriptions of animals as opposed to engaging in anthropomorphism. I also found him to have a very dry wit that livened up the chapters without making them unscientific.The first few chapters, focusing primarily on animals, felt less cohesive than the ones focused on humans, which seemed more clearly delineated into categories of cannibalism or specific instances. But all of it was entertaining and engaging.On the downside, as my husband lived in England between 1988-1990, I'm relatively sure he'll die of Mad Cow Disease any day now. When I mentioned this to him, his response was, ""Oh yes, I'm actually not allowed to donate blood because I lived in England during that time."" Wonderful."

It isn't a book that I would have probably picked out myself, so it was great to still learn plenty and find it interesting. It explores the topic of cannibalism in non-human animals at first, then moves on to the social taboos in most cultures around the practice. It takes a skeptical approach to the claims of cannibalism in any culture and looks for actual hard evidence of it, instead of just second hand claims and anecdotal claims. It also explores the potential causes and ramifications of cannibalism in an interesting and engaging way."

Schutt makes a point of avoiding the sensational, but that doesn't prevent his book from being fascinating and engrossing.

83,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8071101-jeanne,2,"I found this book a difficult read. It read more like a science proof paper than general interest book.

85,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49782194-conor-ahern,4,"There are very few things I find myself getting squeamish about, but cannibalism is one of them. It's not so much the Donner-Party, necessity-of-survival type cannibalism that bothers me, either--hunger knows no morality and forces normal people to do things that they might ordinarily find horrific. It's more of the victim-of-cannibalization type that makes me shudder. I suppose on some fundamental level, I believe that it's wrong for humans to be used as means to an end, and succumbing by way of cannibalization seems to be the ultimate example of that; your life and your body reduced to the fulfillment of some fetish that by its very nature assigns you no greater value than a head of cattle. These were probably the hardest parts of this book for me. Stories of cannibalism in the animal kingdom and its evolutionary advantages were much more interesting than unsettling. This book got me thinking of other taboos, things that are so ingrained that logic alone can't account for the aversion. The only others that came to mind were incest and pedophilia, but at least by degree those things operate in contemporary societies as norms, and certainly have done so to a greater extent in the past. But it's not like the British or the Yoruba have a tradition of eating, say, an arm but would draw the line there; unlike with the other two types of taboos I mentioned, cannibalism seems much more to be an all-or-nothing type of convention. While societies all over the world permit relationships that we might regard as incestuous or pedophilic, it seems that societies that countenance what we would describe as cannibalism are few and far between. And I guess it's Schutt's goal to show that this is more of a Western taboo, which is interesting. He points to our Greek and Shakespearean cautionary tales as powerfully inculcating the supposed evil of cannibalism, and then looks to China for examples that, at the very least, cannibalism wasn't regarded there in such black-and-white terms, citing Imperial delicacies including human flesh and conventions whereby parents would trade children with other families during times of hunger so as to avoid having to consume their own children. China is a big place with a lot of people and a ton of recorded history, though, so you're bound to come across anything sooner or later, right?I think the interesting thing for me has been that I gave it a fair shot but in the end I simply can't get over the taboo. Much as I try, and Chinese evidence to the contrary placed before me, I cannot get past the idea that it's wrong, with nothing more articulate than that to say about it! Oh well, I'm only human. This book was often funny and takes a light touch. Very worth chewing over, if you can stomach it!"
86,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/616321-juushika,3,"This is a decent overview of the history and biology of cannibalism. The zoological studies are diverse and broad, and make effective arguments about the causes and therefore evolutionary benefits of cannibalism. It lines up nicely with the human studies which investigate these same causes, particularly privation. The issue of evolutionary benefit for humans is of course more complicated, and Schutt takes a variety of approaches, looking at cannibalism both as an act and as a social concept, and this latter--particular the role of (accusations of) cannibalism in justifications for genocide--gives the book depth.But I have too many unanswered questions: What are the ethics of murder versus eating the already-dead versus cannibalism as a social taboo--how does sapience factor into the erstwhile benefits of survival cannibalism? What is it that makes the taboo of cannibalism compelling in the public consciousness, and how does this intersect with cases of criminal cannibalism? I respect the decision to avoid sensationalism and over-reported criminal cases, but the lack here is conspicuous; meanwhile, using Freud to discuss taboo is cliché and, frankly, problematic. What is the cost/benefit for the evolutionary benefits versus health risks of cannibalism; where's the tipping point in that equation and what protective measures exist? Many of these answers exist by implication, and most of them are ""it's complicated,"" but I wish Schutt were bolder & reached further. The only bold conclusion he draws is a warning about the intersection of desensitization and survival cannibalism in near-future disaster situations--a lazy argument that directly conflicts the desensitized genocidal/cannibalistic human past. (All cultures are desensitized in their own special way.) I liked this well enough, the breadth of it is interesting, the science accessible; Schutt's humor conflicts sometimes with the deceptive gravity of his topic, but it makes for a readable text. But I wanted more, more depth, more asked but unanswerable questions, and that's not present here."
87,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5790437-aj-sterkel,4,"Likes: This book gave me nightmares about dying from mad cow disease. Nightmares probably don’t sound like a good thing, but if I’m thinking about a book in my sleep, it must be doing something right. Mad cow disease is especially terrifying because the British government tried to suppress info about it to protect the beef industry. Yeah . . . we’re all screwed.Anyway, I appreciate that the author looks at cannibalism from a scientific point-of-view instead of a sensationalist point-of-view. He avoids most of the serial killer talk and focuses on nature. Which animals are cannibals and why? If it’s common for animals to eat their friends, why is it rare for modern humans to do the same? Where did the taboo against cannibalism come from? (Hint: Christianity and authors with over-active imaginations.)I enjoyed most of the chapters in this book. The writing style is funnier than I expected. My favorite chapters are the ones about Christopher Columbus. I knew about the damage he did to the places he “explored,” but I didn’t know his connection to cannibalism. Queen Isabella decided that only New World cannibals could be enslaved. Selling slaves was big business, so Columbus and his followers slapped the cannibal label on pretty much everybody. I love that the author examines the history of cannibalism and how our (often irrational) fears of it have shaped the modern world. It’s a unique approach to the subject.“[T]he idea of cannibalism had become a handy symbol for unacceptable behavior practiced by “Others”—a broad and malleable category of evildoers that included enemies, followers of non-Christian religions, and any groups determined to retain their “uncivilized” customs.” – CannibalismDislikes: Since there are frogs on the cover, I expected to learn more about animal cannibalism. The first few chapters are about animals, but then the focus shifts to humans and mostly stays on humans. I wanted more animals.The author is clearly a scientist. I am definitely not a scientist. For me, the writing is too dry and sciencey (totally a real word) at times. The author goes into too much detail about a few subjects—such as kuru, a disease that humans get from eating their families. The science behind Kuru takes up so many pages that I got bored with it. The Bottom Line: One of the most educational books I’ve read this year. If you’re interested in learning about cannibalism, I recommend it. (Just prepare yourself for mad cow nightmares.)Do you like reviews, giveaways, and bookish nonsense? Good news! I have a blog for that. "

I don't know who Bill Schutt is, but man does he know how to take a pretty morbid and kind of yucky topic and turn it into something palatable. SEE WHAT I DID?Bill Schutt examines cannibalism in this world, be it in the animal kingdom, in cultural practice, or survival situations. He talks about all kinds of cannibals, from tadpoles to the Donner Party to Papua New Guinea, and puts them into a scientific and cultural context. Usually with some pretty funny anecdotes or quips to go along with it. While the sociological examinations were a bit easier for me to swallow than the scientific explanations, I quite enjoyed CANNIBALISM: A PERFECTLY NATURAL HISTORY. Schutt did a very good job of making all of these sometimes yucky and always fascinating realities very easy to understand, and didn't try to sensationalize anything around the practice of cannibalism. He also did some really interesting chapters about Mad Cow Disease and modern farming practices, which is just another example of 'progress' coming back and biting us on the butt. True, sometimes it's not for the squeamish, but Schutt delivers all this information with charm and aplomb (and even details his experience eating placenta, given to him by some enthusiastic parents). Super interesting and kind of gross too, CANNIBALISM: A PERFECTLY NATURAL HISTORY is a book I'm glad I picked up. "
89,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"This is an interesting little book. Schutt begins with detailing the frequently fascinating ways that cannibalism occurs in the natural world, and then he moves on to the history of cannibalism among the human animals. People have been eating people for a long time. When a city is under siege, or people find themselves adrift at sea without food for weeks... human beings are going to start looking increasingly delicious despite the taboos (see: Kramer in Newman's imagination in that episode of Seinfeld where he accidentally cooks himself with butter). Shutt also explores cultures where that taboo doesn't exist, and where people eat people ritualistically or simply because they taste delicious (the flavor of humans, if you were wondering, gets compared by various people to tuna, pork, and veal).And if we think the Western world is too civilized for Cannibalism, Schutt reminds us that Europeans were eating mummia (ground up Egyptian mummies, or counterfeit ground up mummies) for medicinal reasons right through the end of the Victorian age, and that the practice of placenta eating has actually been growing in recent years."
90,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"Really enjoyable read! Remember all of those awesome studies from animal behavior class, like the ones that demonstrated how many animals avoid having sex with their father, mother, sister, or brother -- chemicals inside their noses and brains help them identify ""self"" and ""non-self"", instructing them not to have sex with anything too similar to ""self"" -- or the studies that demonstrated how sexual selection could spell death for sexy males -- female fish preferred the most orange males, which drove selection toward fish so orange, they were easily spotted and gobbled up by predators -- or the other studies that outlined the many shocking behaviors and likely motivations of various animals? Well, this book is chock full of those types of studies, only they are geared solely at understanding why animals might or might not eat each other instead of why they might or might not mate with each other. Here is a sampling of the intensely interesting things you will find in well researched chapters. Black Widows:Contrary to the well held belief that female Black Widows spiders and female Preying Mantis devour their males when mating, these cannibalistic behaviors are reserved for times of great stress, such as when there is a food shortage or these animals are in captivity. Since they had only been studied in captivity, researchers were only privy to the behaviors associated with that stressor. If the Black Widow had been observed in natural conditions, when food supplies were sufficient, she would have never gotten the name ""Black Widow"". In truth, females spiders are far more often the victims of cannibalism than the perpetrators. In at least one species of spider, the females do a dance to make the males notice them and choose them to mate with. Instead of having sex, as the female intended, she made herself noticed and became a tasty treat for a male spider who, with the energy gained from eating her, moved on to court another female spider who he did choose to mate with. When times are really lean, there is a spider species who eats its own limbs! Spiders and Praying Mantis are not the only animals who do not usually practice cannibalism but turn to that behavior when they are exposed to stressful or unusual conditions. Cats, mice, rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits are all driven to cannibalism when facing similar conditions, but the hamster seems to be more prone to cannibalism than most species. If hamster siblings are kept in the same cage, they will often fight to the death at 4 weeks old, when they reach sexual maturity. The winner will eat the carcass of the loser. Though the behavior is common to many mothers, mother hamsters engage far more often in eating their young when the mother herself is handled close to the time when she gives birth or when her babies are handled when they are little. Apes:Cannibalism is generally rarer in ape species, including humans. However, when they engage in the practice, they are like other animals in that it is usually in times of stress, but not always. There have been serial killers who seem to enjoy eating their victims. There even seem to a pair of mother daughter serial killer chimpanzees, named Passion and Pom, who ate between 5 and 10 infants after attacking the new mothers. It seems it was all in an effort to obtain food. So, perhaps Passion and Pom's actions are not as unexplainable as Jeffery Dahmer's. Carnassial Dentation:The shape of teeth can tell us a lot about the evolution of various species. Schutt discussed the evolution of polar bear teeth to talk in general about how teeth, such as carnassial teeth, help meat eating species rip chunks of meet off their prey. Even though I have read a fair amount about this subject, I wasn't bored at all. In fact, I thought it was one of the better discussions on teeth and evolution. If you enjoy reading about ripping pieces of meat into smaller pieces, in order to aid digestion, I suggest you read, I Contain Multitudes as well. The author of that book, Ed Yong, gave a good bit of detail about gut microbes-- where they are placed in the gut, in front or behind -- so that the animals and the microbes both enjoy a wonderful meal. Yong discussed the types of microbes needed for a meat eating diet vs. a vegetable diet. I could not stop thinking about what Yong wrote when reading this section of Schutt's Cannibalism book. Schutt also used the polar bear section to satisfyingly discuss climate change and the stupidity of the media. Definitely worth reading. Hyenas and infanticide:Who doesn't love to eat babies? It seems that most animals who eat meat, love to eat the babies most. This seems to hold true whether it is a different species or a different species from the animal doing the eating. Chimps patrol their borders and when they encounter a female and her baby, they kill the baby and try to hook up with the female. Nothing says love like murdering her offspring. Chimps are not alone. Males from many different animal species eat babies in order to push females into estrus, so they can mate with them. One female species has evolved a protection against infanticide, and as a result is a dominant member of their clan-- the hyena. To really understand the magic of female hyena biology, it's important to understand sexual development in embryos. Embryos are genderless but have precursors to mammary glands and penises. If an embryo gets an XY chromosome the penis bud will grow, but the memory glands will not. . If the embryo receives XX, the embryo will still grow the penis bud but then get the signal to stop the growth when it is very small, leaving behind a clitoris instead of a large penis. The XX will also send a signal to grow the mammary glands. Males have nipples but cannot feed a baby. This is because they do not have XX, which makes mammary glands that allows milk to flow through the nipples. XY and XX chromosomes use hormones to signal which morphology a body should have. The XY chromosome contains testosterone, which signals the penis bud to grow into a penis . The XX chromosome contains estrogen, which is what signals the growth of mammary glands.In spotted hyenas, researchers believe a mutation developed to provide the female spotted hyena with more testosterone, resulting in a signal to grow the penis bud out more. Thus, female hyenas have a very large clitoris (elongated penis bud). Their vulva is fused shut, allowing them to pee through their clitoris/penis bud, just like a male pees through their penis. When a male wants to have sex with a female, she really has to be receptive, just as a male would have to be receptive to have sex. This is because it's actually like inserting a penis into a penis, making it virtually impossible to force a female to have sex. While evolution did them a favor in not allowing them to be raped by males, it was unkind to them in regards to birthing offspring (I am so glad that I am not a female hyena!). The cub has to come out somewhere and unfortunately it rips the vulva. That was painful to even read about. I do have to say though, this was absolutely the best discussion on hyena biology of any book I have read so far. The rest of the book:The last part of the book veered away from animal behavior and examined the more sociological aspects of cannibalism-- where the word originated, how it appeared in literature throughout the ages, and what our current conception of cannibalism is. Those aspects went on a little too long for my taste, but I can imagine other people enjoying those sections. "
91,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,4,"What an unexpectedly decent read. Unlike many others fascinated by this topic and other types of violence so prevalent on screen, I'm pretty chicken and would like to steer clear from those. Yet an article on National Geographic persuaded me to pick it up since the book seems a lot more scientific and less sensational. And I love reading about animals, and so was hoping for some light entertainment and instead got pretty educated. Writing in a conversational tone, yet packed with a lot of knowledge and terminologies that it's first time since ever that I have to repeatedly look words up, Schutt casually discusses cannibalism in the animal kingdom then gradually move to more difficult and gory scenes in human society. His presentation of China, admittedly, still hasn't convinced me, it feels like his research in China both ancient and modern time isn't rigorous enough. Yet it motivates me to read a book currently on my reading shelf about the Great Leap Forward.The book doesn't stop with cannibalism and definitely isn't a simple ""objective"" piece of writing describing the phenomenon. Schutt inserts his argument on religion, colonialism, on climate change, on modern obsession with violence, on the government and the economy. He talks bluntly about unsolved issue in the study of some infectious disease. All in all, the book leaves me with goose bumps, some fear, certainly aroused neocortex.And fun fact, now I really know the origin of ""Soylent"", my favorite meal replacement these days. What an ironic naming."
92,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3123067-elizabeth-a,4,"Book blurb: Eating one’s own kind is completely natural behavior in thousands of species, including humans. Throughout history we have engaged in cannibalism for reasons of famine, burial rites, and medicinal remedies; it’s been used as a way to terrorize and even a way to show filial piety. Today, the subject of humans consuming one another has been relegated to the realm of horror movies, fiction, and the occasional psychopath, but be forewarned: As climate change progresses and humans see more famine, disease, and overcrowding, biological and cultural constraints may well disappear. I listened to the audiobook which was well narrated by Tom Perkins.One of my fave questions to ask at parties (I kid you not): Say you are starving and your survival is at stake. Do you feel differently about eating a person who is already dead, as opposed to killing someone to eat? Try it at your next gathering and report back.This book hits my sweet spot on so many levels. Most people tend to be really squeamish about the topic, but if you're not a vegetarian, what's all the fuss about? Who decided that we can eat some animals and not others? Besides, if you think that cannibalism is awful, you might want to put it in perspective. Considering the horrid historical accounts of human behavior, eating your fellow Sapiens doesn't really seem all that bad.This is a fun, informative, and eye opening book, and I learned so many things about the animal kingdom I had no idea about. I'll bet school would be much more interesting if some of these topics were incorporated into the curriculum. I could talk about some of the specifics, but then that'd spoil all the fun for you. I assure you that it's full of fascinating and juicy tidbits. The author stays away from sensational crime stories, so if you are looking for recipes, look elsewhere, but if you are willing to have ""no way!"" moments, and are willing to annoy your loved ones by constantly saying ""did you know?"", move this up your TBR.This will end up on my best of 2017 reads, and the only reason I docked a star is due to the fact that there are sections, like the final chapters, where the author gets side tracked and wanders off topic."
93,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3078602-peacegal,4,"Fans of Mary Roach's popular science books will devour CANNIBALISM, a tour of the taboo topic throughout the natural world and human history. From Tyrannosaurus rex to the Donner Party, from tadpoles who eat their siblings to American uberbreeders who dine on placenta, readers will at turns be entertained, saddened, and disgusted by the facts within--but they will always be educated. There is one point on which I'd like to add something to the text on chicken cannibalism within factory farm conditions. The author writes that pecking deaths became a widespread concern when intensive chicken farming first took hold in the 1940s. Thus, the chicken industry developed the practice of debeaking, in which the end of each chick's beak is cut or seared off to hobble them from aggressively pecking one another. The author writes that chicken ""blinder"" masks were invented in the 40s as a supposedly more humane alternative, and words it in such a way that these masks have replaced debeaking in the poultry industry today. Erm, no. While blinders are occasionally used, most notably in the intensive rearing of pheasants for release-and-shoot canned hunts, debeaking remains the rule of the day for billions of hens raised for meat and egg production. (The sheer amount of birds raised coupled with the rapidity with which beaks can be cut or seared ensures this.) Not to say that blinder masks are such a pleasant alternative. They are frequently affixed by shoving a bar through the animal's nostrils. "

Looks like that 1% of the total population could have cannibalistic tendencies but on disasters time, everybody becomes one. "
96,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,5,"Bill Schutt is a writer I really appreciate and enjoy. I read Dark Banquet a few years ago and loved it. He is for me sort of the Neil DeGrasse tyson of biology/animal behavior (human animals included). He is a wonderful storyteller and the structures of his books are clear and accessible and well-organized but also scientifically and sociologically and culturally incisive, and meandering in nice ways. He takes on a specific topic and stays with it in his way, but at the same time, explores it from many angles. He is curious and his interest and curiosity are evident in his writing. He clearly relishes exploring ideas, behaviors and histories and does not look away from the absurdity and violence of human cultures. In this book, in addition to providing insight into various and common cannibalistic behaviors throughout the animal kingdom, he interrogates human cultural and ideological relationships to cannibalism. He asks the question: are our monotheistic western cultures' ideas about and fear and hatred of cannibalism of a genetic origin in any way, or purely cultural. He talks of the devastating irony--how Europeans used the idea of the inherent evil of cannibalism to justify the brutal massacre of unnumbered non-European peoples who may or may not have engaged in cannibalistic rituals. I love the illustrations in the book. I love how Schutt takes myths and legends about certain animals acts or habits of cannibalism and offers a much more complex and nuanced picture. He puts some myths to rest. He offers many fascinating particulars in their places, including stories of physiological changes (epigenetic?) in certain aquatic and semiaquatic (and maybe other? can't recall) animals who engage in filial cannibalism. Also, there's a fantastic section about some messy, dart-throwing gastropods. Clearly, I am a fan of the book and recommend it highly.here's a quote from intro:Is it really a surprise, though, that our greatest cinematic villain is a man-eating psychiatrist while the mild-mannered runner-up is based on a real-life cannibal killer? Perhaps not, if one considers that many cultures share the belief that consuming another human is the worst (or close to the worst) behavior that a person can undertake. As a result, real-life cannibalistic psychopaths like Jeffrey Dahmer (another Wisconsin native) and his Russian counterpart, Andrei Chikatilo, have attained something akin to mythical status in the annals of history’s most notorious murderers. Whether through a filter of fictionalization, where man-eating deviants are transformed into powerful antiheroes, or through tabloids sensationalizing the crimes of real-life cannibals, these tales feed our obsession with all things gruesome—an obsession that is now an acceptable facet of our society.A different attitude was taken toward “primitive” social or ethnic groups whose members might not have shared the Western take on cannibalism taboos. At best, these “savages” were pegged as souls to be saved, but only if they met certain requirements. In the first half of the 20th century, for example, explorers and the missionaries who followed them ventured into the foreboding New Guinea highlands and quickly imposed one hard-and-fast rule for the locals: Cannibalism in any form was strictly forbidden.But far worse instances of cultural intrusion occurred elsewhere and throughout history, as those accused of consuming other humans, for any reason, were brutalized, enslaved, and murdered. The most infamous example of this practice began during the last years of the 15th century when millions of indigenous people living in the Caribbean and Mexico were summarily reclassified as cannibals for reasons that had little to do with people-eating. Instead, it paved the way for them to be robbed, beaten, conquered, and slain, all at the whim of their new Spanish masters.Similar atrocities were carried out on a massive scale by a succession of flag-planting European powers who (if one believes their accounts) wrested South America, Africa, and the Indo-Pacific away from man-eating savages, whose behavior placed them beyond the pale of anything that could remotely be described as human.So were European fears about cannibalism simply an invention used to justify conquest, or were there cultures, including those encountered by the Spaniards, where the consumption of humans was regarded as normal behavior? Although defining someone as a cannibal became an effective way to dehumanize them, there is also evidence that ritual cannibalism, as embodied in various customs related to funerary rites and warfare, occurred throughout history.As I began studying these forms of cannibalism, I sought to determine not only their perceived functions, but just how widespread they were or weren’t. Surprisingly—or perhaps not surprisingly given the subject matter—there is disagreement among anthropologists regarding ritual cannibalism. Some deny that it ever occurred, while others claim that the behavior did occur but was uncommon. Still others claim that cannibalism was practiced by many cultures throughout history and for a variety of reasons. One such body of evidence led me straight back to European history, where I learned that a particularly macabre form of cannibalism had been practiced for hundreds of years by nobility, physicians, and commoners alike, even into the 20th century.As a zoologist, I was, of course, intrigued at the prospect of documenting cases of non-human cannibalism. Looking back now, I can see that I’d started my inquiry with something less than a completely open mind. Part of me reasoned that since cannibalism was presumably a rare occurrence in humans (at least in modern times), it would likely be similarly rare in the animal kingdom.Once I dug further, though, I discovered that cannibalism differs in frequency between major animal groups—nonexistent in some and common in others. It varies from species to species and even within the same species, depending on local environmental conditions. Cannibalism also serves a variety of functions, depending on the cannibal. There are even examples in which an individual being cannibalized receives a benefit.In several instances, cannibalism appears to have arisen only recently in a species, and human activity might be the cause. In one such case, news reports informed horrified audiences that some of the most highly recognizable animals on the planet were suddenly consuming their own young. “Polar bears resort to cannibalism as Arctic ice shrinks,” reported CNN, while the Times of London echoed the sentiment: “Climate Change Forcing Polar Bears to Become Cannibals.” It was Reuters, though, that scored a perfect ten on the gruesome scale with an online slide show in which an adult polar bear was seen carrying around the still cute-as-a button head of a dead cub, the remains of its spinal cord trailing behind like a red streamer.The real story behind polar bear [contextualized in book...] cannibalism turned out to be just as fascinating, though it would also serve as a perfect example of how many accusations of and stories about cannibalism throughout history were untrue, unproven, or exaggerated—distorted by sensationalism, deception, a lack of scientific knowledge, and just plain bad writing. With the passage of time, these accounts too often become part of the historical record, their errors long forgotten. Part of my job would be to expose those errors.I was also extremely curious to see if the origin of cannibalism taboos could be traced back to the natural world, so I developed a pair of alternative hypotheses. Perhaps our aversion to consuming our own kind is hardwired into our brains and as such is a part of our genetic blueprint—a gene or two whose expression selects against such behavior. I reasoned that if such a built-in deterrent exists, then humans and most non-humans (with the exception of a few well-known anomalies such as black widow spiders and praying mantises) would avoid cannibalism at all costs. Thus, the taboo would have a biological foundation.Conversely, I weighed the possibility that the revulsion most people have at the very mention of cannibalism might stem solely from our culture. Of course, this led to even more questions. What are the cultural roots of the cannibalism taboo and how has it become so widespread? I also wondered why, as disgusted as we are at the very thought of cannibalism, we’re so utterly fascinated by it? Might cannibalism have been more common in our ancestors, before societal rules turned it into something abhorrent? I looked for evidence in the fossil record and elsewhere.Finally, I considered what it would take to break down the biological or cultural constraints that prevent us from eating each other on a regular basis. Could there come a time, in our not-so-distant future, when human cannibalism becomes commonplace? And for that matter, was it already becoming a more frequent occurrence? The answers to these questions are far from certain but, then again, there is much about the topic of cannibalism that cannot be neatly divided into black and white. Likely or not, though, the circumstances that might lead to outbreaks of widespread cannibalism in the 21st century are grounded in science, not science fiction.My aim was to stay away from the clichéd ideas about cannibalism that are already ingrained in our collective psyche and, with such a wealth of relevant material to explore, I quickly realized that this wouldn’t be difficult. Even the most famous cannibal stories, it turned out, had factual gaps that are only now being filled. In the case of the Donner Party, for example, I joined researchers whose scientific approach to the most infamous cannibalism-related event in American history had shed new light on this 19th-century tale of stranded pioneers.I’ve tried to approach each example from a scientific viewpoint, delving into what I considered the most intriguing aspects of anthropology, evolution, and biology to provide the broadest yet most engaging natural history of this behavior. What happens to our bodies and minds under starvation conditions? Why are women better equipped to survive starvation than men? And what physiological extremes would compel someone to consume the body of a friend or even a family member?But it’s not just the abundance of eggs and young that makes fish such a popular menu item for members of their own species. Many terrestrial vertebrates produce few or even a single offspring, and most of these newly born or newly hatched individuals already exhibit considerable body size. In many fish species, the extraordinary number of eggs produced imposes a limit on their size, and so a full-grown cod might be a million times (or six orders of magnitude) larger than its own eggs. This fact goes a long way to explain why the majority of them exhibit about as much individual recognition of their offspring as humans do for a handful of raisins. Fish eggs, larvae, and fry (i.e., young fish) are vast in number, minute in size, and high in nutritional value. This makes them an abundant, nonthreatening, and easily collected food source. It’s also why ichthyologists consider the absence of cannibalism in fishes, rather than its presence, to be the exceptional case."

I believed this book would focus more on canabalism in the animal world and then BRIEFLY connect this to human cannibalism. It didnt happen this way. I was so fascinated by the instances of cannabilism in the animal world and, surprisingly, the sections I read on human cannibalism were dull. This could have been due to it focusing mostly on references to cannibalism in early literature and focusing so heavily on the story of the Donner's. I lost interest at this point and just never picked it back up.

I did both the whole day).Cannibalism is a history and an explanation of the act. But don't worry, the author doesn't start with the stomach churning human eating human stuff right away. He starts with the 'lighter' stuff - cannibalism by non-humans.The book starts by defining the various types of cannibalism - of which I remember two: eating your family members and eating people of your species who aren't related to you. Then it gets defined even further, to things like filial cannibalism (parents eating children or vice versa), cannibalism during mating (turns out the Black Widow Spider has been maligned.After going through all these decidedly non-humans, the author slowly makes his way back to us.If I were to generalise, I'd say that the book says that cannibalism tends to be a response to specific conditions (overcrowding, lack of nutrition, etc). Although in humans, there are ritual cannibals. Oh, and grey areas like breastfeeding (if skin cells come off) and I can't remember what else. (For the record, I am in no way justifying cannibalism in the whole 'eat literal human flesh' form)Although I was really surprised about the fact that ritual cannibalism existed in Chinese culture, especially as an act of filial piety. Then I remembered stories about sons cutting their thighs to feed their parents (though I can't remember from where) and I realised that IS cannibalism "
100,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34493714-yasaman,3,"An interesting read. Schutt's overall take on cannibalism - especially in non-human species - is that it essentially occurs either as a mechanism for passing on genetic information to the next generation, or to ensure your and/or your offspring's survival and conservation of energy, which again goes back to making sure genetic information is passed on. So, from an evolutionary standpoint, it makes perfect sense, especially considering that most species do not rely on behaviors/methods such as altruism and Kin selection for their fitness rates. When the topic is discussed in regards to humans, there is also ritualistic and medicinal cannibalism to consider, which Schutt explains is a lot more common than expected. What I liked about Schutt's discussion on the topic is that he shows the hypocrisy of viewpoints regarding ritualistic cannibalism based on which group of people is practicing it (i.e. indigenous people or white European Christians?). But, interestingly, it was also what I didn't like about the book in general: Firstly, Schutt oversimplifies the practice based on strict definitions (I hardly think biting fingernails and eating organs such as liver should fall under the same category,) and, secondly, he doesn't seem overly concerned about explaining that just because something is a cultural influence and seemingly widespread, it doesn't make it any less wrong to do."
101,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6314574-allisonlcarter,3,"While starting in the animal kingdom seems a logical place to start a conversation about cannibalism, this book gets bogged down in the world of weird sex snails and spiders for far too long. What makes cannibalism of such enduring interest is that it's fundamentally a question of whether it is moral to eat a human body under any circumstances. Since morality is, in most cases, relative, this is an endlessly fascinating question for homo sapiens and varies widely from culture to culture. Since animals do not have ethical frameworks that we are aware of, knowing that this invertebrate or that eats each other is less interesting, except in the broadest way.When Schutt does get to human consumption, he mostly covers familiar ground -- the Donner Party, Papua New Guinea, etc. The book shines in a few chapters that skirt the issue of why cannibalism is taboo in Western culture and examines the practice in China. The book is capped off with a long exploration of mad cow disease, which, since the cows didn't choose to engage in cannibalism or derive an evolutionary advantage from it, seems out of place.Still, the book is immaculately researched and Schutt has an amusingly wry sense of humor."

I'm just putting that out there now because the only really interesting Cannibal was Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The dude wore ties to work. That's class.The taboo of cannibalism is exactly what lead me to this book. Working in a library I regularly stock the ""New Books"" section and everyday I saw the book with it's distinct cover. Curiosity got the better of me and I checked the book out and read it in a week. The reader may not think themselves terribly interested in the idea of reading about the history and practice of cannibalism as an act, but they're missing out because there's also loads of biology.Schutt manages to write an easy, approachable book about an act that many people would rather not discuss, but as he points out in his introduction the fact that nobody wants to talk about is reason enough to discuss it. Schutt approaches the book at the start as a biologist, a zoologist to be specific, and just tries to understand biologically why cannibalism takes place in the wild in natural conditions. Once this is done he tackles the human element and it's here that the reader will be able to see that the issue becomes complicated. I won't lie, there are some elements of this book hat can be troubling (the eating of kids during the siege of Stalingrad just about broke me), but this book was approachable and enjoyable to read. It was only in the last three chapters that the writing began to grow a little tiresome, but even in these closing pages the book still felt strong and by it's end I felt as if I had really learned something about the natural world while also being warned about the possible future.Cannibalism isn't a fun topic unless it involves Anthony Hopkins (damn I broke my first rule) but it is an important topic and Schott succeeds in demonstrating that, yes, it does deserve an entire book to itself."

But I thought this one sounded interesting, and it turns out I really loved it! Bill Schutt has a great style that alternates between clear, concise explanations of biological concepts, overviews of research fields and more personal narratives and interviews he had with other scientists. To be clear, this is emphatically not a book about cannibal crimes (in fact, the author devotes only a few paragraphs to such murderers, and states that he both feels that fields has been covered more than enough, and that he doesn't want to be disrespectful towards victims and their families). What it is, is a journey through cannibalism as a biological and social mechanism, starting from examples of various animals and the research done on different species, before moving on to an investigation whether those same mechanisms come into play for humans and how different human cultures have viewed cannibalism throughout history. I actually feel like I've learned a lot about topics I didn't know much about, and had good time while acquiring that knowledge - a perfect combination!"
104,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24590339-k-willows,4,"This is informative & well rounded, but leans heavily on the side of serious science writing (as opposed to more casual/humorous science writing). It does have its bits of humor but overall this is a book I'd recommend to science minded people interested in learning more about the cultural taboo of cannibalism. I felt that the final 3 chapters could have been condensed down. I would have liked to read more about the Aghori of India but they were surprisingly unmentioned. Finally, for true crime nerds, this book does not go into depth regarding the cannibalistic killers, but I felt the author had good reason for avoiding that subject and the sensationalism that comes with it."
105,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46502154-anna,4,"Obviously, it's not for everyone but as someone who's been interested in cannibalism for a very long time (don't ask me why) I found it both interesting and informative. It's certainly the best and the most scientific book I've read on the subject so far. I was a bit worried that my English might fail me because the author is a biologist but luckily I had no problems understanding what he was talking about. What I liked the most was that Bill Schutt covered a very wide range of types of cannibalism and - unlike many other authors - didn't focus on serial killers/psychopaths (they are mentioned at the beginning so it might be a disappointment to those readers who were hoping for more) and sensational stories about tribes consuming human flesh like it's tacos. As an avid fan of animal documentaries I was the most interested in the first part of the book (even though I knew many of the facts Schutt talked about) and I was slightly bored towards the end when he focused on diseases (ones rumoured to be transmitted through infected human meat). But I honestly appreciate how thorough and detailed the research was."
106,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12256655-alisa,4,"I found this to be a very interesting book. I understand the subject matter isn't for everyone but it's not done is a sensational way. The books take a more scientific and anthropological look at cannibalism. There is only a small amount of coverage of human cannibalism. Much more is on the animal kingdom. I found this super interesting and I definitely recommend it to those of you interested in science, anthropology and history. **ARC provided through Netgalley**"

108,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1702050-fox,5,"I've been eagerly awaiting this book since I first became aware of its release, which was likely due to Daphne's review. Cannibalism is an undeniably fascinating subject, and  Bill Schutt tackles it with grace and humor, as long for a disdain for the sensationalism that has too long colored all publications on the topic. The book was fascinating from cover to cover, and is extremely well-organized. It begins with the study of it in the animal kingdom, and ends with the much needed topic of prion diseases, their spread, and how poorly understood they are. Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History is destined to become the go-to book on the topic. Well sourced, entertainingly written, and scattered throughout with just enough humor and a large dose of respect, it does its topic justice.  Bill Schutt writes with a deft hand that does much to dispel many of the sensationalized myths that surround some of the better known cases (i.e. Donner Party, Praying Mantises, Black Widows, etc.) and does a good job explaining topics that have never really gotten enough focus (i.e. prion diseases, kuru) or have suffered from the wrong type of focus.This book was immensely readable, and more in depth and well-sourced than I expected a pop-science book to be. It definitely opened my eyes to the complexity of the topic, and added to disdain I already felt towards one Jared Diamond and his tendency to over simplify nearly everything. I'm very much looking forward to more being published in regards to the Neanderthal hypotheses presented in this book, as well as for more studies being done on the truly terrifying prion diseases. Nothing terrifies me more than the section on prion diseases in this book, and what it may hold in store for our future."
109,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1424908-map,4,"I won a kindle version of this book as a Goodreads Giveaway.I've seen some reviews on here claiming that this book is dry and overly scientific, but I have to disagree. As a psychologist who got my start in animal behaviorism, I appreciated Schutt's precise and behavioral descriptions of animals as opposed to engaging in anthropomorphism. I also found him to have a very dry wit that livened up the chapters without making them unscientific.The first few chapters, focusing primarily on animals, felt less cohesive than the ones focused on humans, which seemed more clearly delineated into categories of cannibalism or specific instances. But all of it was entertaining and engaging.On the downside, as my husband lived in England between 1988-1990, I'm relatively sure he'll die of Mad Cow Disease any day now. When I mentioned this to him, his response was, ""Oh yes, I'm actually not allowed to donate blood because I lived in England during that time."" Wonderful."
110,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61034045-chuy-ruiz,4,"I was given this book as a gift and I definitely enjoyed reading it. It isn't a book that I would have probably picked out myself, so it was great to still learn plenty and find it interesting. It explores the topic of cannibalism in non-human animals at first, then moves on to the social taboos in most cultures around the practice. It takes a skeptical approach to the claims of cannibalism in any culture and looks for actual hard evidence of it, instead of just second hand claims and anecdotal claims. It also explores the potential causes and ramifications of cannibalism in an interesting and engaging way."
111,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1961913-na-amen,4,"Overall I really liked this book. There were some small moments of throwaway lines where I felt the objectivity of the author slipped and some cultural/biological prejudices reared their heads. A good study of cannibalism in nature across species that stayed away from sensationalism, even while discussing the Donner party."
112,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3237385-melissa,5,"4.5* I flew through this! I can't remember the last time I struggled to put down nonfiction. Schutt makes a point of avoiding the sensational, but that doesn't prevent his book from being fascinating and engrossing. I also appreciated how he pointed out conflicting points of view / arguments between scholars, especially when it came to human cannibalistic behaviors."
113,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8071101-jeanne,2,"I found this book a difficult read. It read more like a science proof paper than general interest book.

115,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49782194-conor-ahern,4,"There are very few things I find myself getting squeamish about, but cannibalism is one of them. It's not so much the Donner-Party, necessity-of-survival type cannibalism that bothers me, either--hunger knows no morality and forces normal people to do things that they might ordinarily find horrific. It's more of the victim-of-cannibalization type that makes me shudder. I suppose on some fundamental level, I believe that it's wrong for humans to be used as means to an end, and succumbing by way of cannibalization seems to be the ultimate example of that; your life and your body reduced to the fulfillment of some fetish that by its very nature assigns you no greater value than a head of cattle. These were probably the hardest parts of this book for me. Stories of cannibalism in the animal kingdom and its evolutionary advantages were much more interesting than unsettling. This book got me thinking of other taboos, things that are so ingrained that logic alone can't account for the aversion. The only others that came to mind were incest and pedophilia, but at least by degree those things operate in contemporary societies as norms, and certainly have done so to a greater extent in the past. But it's not like the British or the Yoruba have a tradition of eating, say, an arm but would draw the line there; unlike with the other two types of taboos I mentioned, cannibalism seems much more to be an all-or-nothing type of convention. While societies all over the world permit relationships that we might regard as incestuous or pedophilic, it seems that societies that countenance what we would describe as cannibalism are few and far between. And I guess it's Schutt's goal to show that this is more of a Western taboo, which is interesting. He points to our Greek and Shakespearean cautionary tales as powerfully inculcating the supposed evil of cannibalism, and then looks to China for examples that, at the very least, cannibalism wasn't regarded there in such black-and-white terms, citing Imperial delicacies including human flesh and conventions whereby parents would trade children with other families during times of hunger so as to avoid having to consume their own children. China is a big place with a lot of people and a ton of recorded history, though, so you're bound to come across anything sooner or later, right?I think the interesting thing for me has been that I gave it a fair shot but in the end I simply can't get over the taboo. Much as I try, and Chinese evidence to the contrary placed before me, I cannot get past the idea that it's wrong, with nothing more articulate than that to say about it! Oh well, I'm only human. This book was often funny and takes a light touch. Very worth chewing over, if you can stomach it!"
116,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/616321-juushika,3,"This is a decent overview of the history and biology of cannibalism. The zoological studies are diverse and broad, and make effective arguments about the causes and therefore evolutionary benefits of cannibalism. It lines up nicely with the human studies which investigate these same causes, particularly privation. The issue of evolutionary benefit for humans is of course more complicated, and Schutt takes a variety of approaches, looking at cannibalism both as an act and as a social concept, and this latter--particular the role of (accusations of) cannibalism in justifications for genocide--gives the book depth.But I have too many unanswered questions: What are the ethics of murder versus eating the already-dead versus cannibalism as a social taboo--how does sapience factor into the erstwhile benefits of survival cannibalism? What is it that makes the taboo of cannibalism compelling in the public consciousness, and how does this intersect with cases of criminal cannibalism? I respect the decision to avoid sensationalism and over-reported criminal cases, but the lack here is conspicuous; meanwhile, using Freud to discuss taboo is cliché and, frankly, problematic. What is the cost/benefit for the evolutionary benefits versus health risks of cannibalism; where's the tipping point in that equation and what protective measures exist? Many of these answers exist by implication, and most of them are ""it's complicated,"" but I wish Schutt were bolder & reached further. The only bold conclusion he draws is a warning about the intersection of desensitization and survival cannibalism in near-future disaster situations--a lazy argument that directly conflicts the desensitized genocidal/cannibalistic human past. (All cultures are desensitized in their own special way.) I liked this well enough, the breadth of it is interesting, the science accessible; Schutt's humor conflicts sometimes with the deceptive gravity of his topic, but it makes for a readable text. But I wanted more, more depth, more asked but unanswerable questions, and that's not present here."
117,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5790437-aj-sterkel,4,"Likes: This book gave me nightmares about dying from mad cow disease. Nightmares probably don’t sound like a good thing, but if I’m thinking about a book in my sleep, it must be doing something right. Mad cow disease is especially terrifying because the British government tried to suppress info about it to protect the beef industry. Yeah . . . we’re all screwed.Anyway, I appreciate that the author looks at cannibalism from a scientific point-of-view instead of a sensationalist point-of-view. He avoids most of the serial killer talk and focuses on nature. Which animals are cannibals and why? If it’s common for animals to eat their friends, why is it rare for modern humans to do the same? Where did the taboo against cannibalism come from? (Hint: Christianity and authors with over-active imaginations.)I enjoyed most of the chapters in this book. The writing style is funnier than I expected. My favorite chapters are the ones about Christopher Columbus. I knew about the damage he did to the places he “explored,” but I didn’t know his connection to cannibalism. Queen Isabella decided that only New World cannibals could be enslaved. Selling slaves was big business, so Columbus and his followers slapped the cannibal label on pretty much everybody. I love that the author examines the history of cannibalism and how our (often irrational) fears of it have shaped the modern world. It’s a unique approach to the subject.“[T]he idea of cannibalism had become a handy symbol for unacceptable behavior practiced by “Others”—a broad and malleable category of evildoers that included enemies, followers of non-Christian religions, and any groups determined to retain their “uncivilized” customs.” – CannibalismDislikes: Since there are frogs on the cover, I expected to learn more about animal cannibalism. The first few chapters are about animals, but then the focus shifts to humans and mostly stays on humans. I wanted more animals.The author is clearly a scientist. I am definitely not a scientist. For me, the writing is too dry and sciencey (totally a real word) at times. The author goes into too much detail about a few subjects—such as kuru, a disease that humans get from eating their families. The science behind Kuru takes up so many pages that I got bored with it. The Bottom Line: One of the most educational books I’ve read this year. If you’re interested in learning about cannibalism, I recommend it. (Just prepare yourself for mad cow nightmares.)Do you like reviews, giveaways, and bookish nonsense? Good news! I have a blog for that. "
118,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4876063-elphareads,4,"I mean, just look at the title of this. CANNIBALISM: A PERFECTLY NATURAL HISTORY? How could I not? I don't know who Bill Schutt is, but man does he know how to take a pretty morbid and kind of yucky topic and turn it into something palatable. SEE WHAT I DID?Bill Schutt examines cannibalism in this world, be it in the animal kingdom, in cultural practice, or survival situations. He talks about all kinds of cannibals, from tadpoles to the Donner Party to Papua New Guinea, and puts them into a scientific and cultural context. Usually with some pretty funny anecdotes or quips to go along with it. While the sociological examinations were a bit easier for me to swallow than the scientific explanations, I quite enjoyed CANNIBALISM: A PERFECTLY NATURAL HISTORY. Schutt did a very good job of making all of these sometimes yucky and always fascinating realities very easy to understand, and didn't try to sensationalize anything around the practice of cannibalism. He also did some really interesting chapters about Mad Cow Disease and modern farming practices, which is just another example of 'progress' coming back and biting us on the butt. True, sometimes it's not for the squeamish, but Schutt delivers all this information with charm and aplomb (and even details his experience eating placenta, given to him by some enthusiastic parents). Super interesting and kind of gross too, CANNIBALISM: A PERFECTLY NATURAL HISTORY is a book I'm glad I picked up. "
119,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"This is an interesting little book. Schutt begins with detailing the frequently fascinating ways that cannibalism occurs in the natural world, and then he moves on to the history of cannibalism among the human animals. People have been eating people for a long time. When a city is under siege, or people find themselves adrift at sea without food for weeks... human beings are going to start looking increasingly delicious despite the taboos (see: Kramer in Newman's imagination in that episode of Seinfeld where he accidentally cooks himself with butter). Shutt also explores cultures where that taboo doesn't exist, and where people eat people ritualistically or simply because they taste delicious (the flavor of humans, if you were wondering, gets compared by various people to tuna, pork, and veal).And if we think the Western world is too civilized for Cannibalism, Schutt reminds us that Europeans were eating mummia (ground up Egyptian mummies, or counterfeit ground up mummies) for medicinal reasons right through the end of the Victorian age, and that the practice of placenta eating has actually been growing in recent years."
120,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"Really enjoyable read! Remember all of those awesome studies from animal behavior class, like the ones that demonstrated how many animals avoid having sex with their father, mother, sister, or brother -- chemicals inside their noses and brains help them identify ""self"" and ""non-self"", instructing them not to have sex with anything too similar to ""self"" -- or the studies that demonstrated how sexual selection could spell death for sexy males -- female fish preferred the most orange males, which drove selection toward fish so orange, they were easily spotted and gobbled up by predators -- or the other studies that outlined the many shocking behaviors and likely motivations of various animals? Well, this book is chock full of those types of studies, only they are geared solely at understanding why animals might or might not eat each other instead of why they might or might not mate with each other. Here is a sampling of the intensely interesting things you will find in well researched chapters. Black Widows:Contrary to the well held belief that female Black Widows spiders and female Preying Mantis devour their males when mating, these cannibalistic behaviors are reserved for times of great stress, such as when there is a food shortage or these animals are in captivity. Since they had only been studied in captivity, researchers were only privy to the behaviors associated with that stressor. If the Black Widow had been observed in natural conditions, when food supplies were sufficient, she would have never gotten the name ""Black Widow"". In truth, females spiders are far more often the victims of cannibalism than the perpetrators. In at least one species of spider, the females do a dance to make the males notice them and choose them to mate with. Instead of having sex, as the female intended, she made herself noticed and became a tasty treat for a male spider who, with the energy gained from eating her, moved on to court another female spider who he did choose to mate with. When times are really lean, there is a spider species who eats its own limbs! Spiders and Praying Mantis are not the only animals who do not usually practice cannibalism but turn to that behavior when they are exposed to stressful or unusual conditions. Cats, mice, rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits are all driven to cannibalism when facing similar conditions, but the hamster seems to be more prone to cannibalism than most species. If hamster siblings are kept in the same cage, they will often fight to the death at 4 weeks old, when they reach sexual maturity. The winner will eat the carcass of the loser. Though the behavior is common to many mothers, mother hamsters engage far more often in eating their young when the mother herself is handled close to the time when she gives birth or when her babies are handled when they are little. Apes:Cannibalism is generally rarer in ape species, including humans. However, when they engage in the practice, they are like other animals in that it is usually in times of stress, but not always. There have been serial killers who seem to enjoy eating their victims. There even seem to a pair of mother daughter serial killer chimpanzees, named Passion and Pom, who ate between 5 and 10 infants after attacking the new mothers. It seems it was all in an effort to obtain food. So, perhaps Passion and Pom's actions are not as unexplainable as Jeffery Dahmer's. Carnassial Dentation:The shape of teeth can tell us a lot about the evolution of various species. Schutt discussed the evolution of polar bear teeth to talk in general about how teeth, such as carnassial teeth, help meat eating species rip chunks of meet off their prey. Even though I have read a fair amount about this subject, I wasn't bored at all. In fact, I thought it was one of the better discussions on teeth and evolution. If you enjoy reading about ripping pieces of meat into smaller pieces, in order to aid digestion, I suggest you read, I Contain Multitudes as well. The author of that book, Ed Yong, gave a good bit of detail about gut microbes-- where they are placed in the gut, in front or behind -- so that the animals and the microbes both enjoy a wonderful meal. Yong discussed the types of microbes needed for a meat eating diet vs. a vegetable diet. I could not stop thinking about what Yong wrote when reading this section of Schutt's Cannibalism book. Schutt also used the polar bear section to satisfyingly discuss climate change and the stupidity of the media. Definitely worth reading. Hyenas and infanticide:Who doesn't love to eat babies? It seems that most animals who eat meat, love to eat the babies most. This seems to hold true whether it is a different species or a different species from the animal doing the eating. Chimps patrol their borders and when they encounter a female and her baby, they kill the baby and try to hook up with the female. Nothing says love like murdering her offspring. Chimps are not alone. Males from many different animal species eat babies in order to push females into estrus, so they can mate with them. One female species has evolved a protection against infanticide, and as a result is a dominant member of their clan-- the hyena. To really understand the magic of female hyena biology, it's important to understand sexual development in embryos. Embryos are genderless but have precursors to mammary glands and penises. If an embryo gets an XY chromosome the penis bud will grow, but the memory glands will not. . If the embryo receives XX, the embryo will still grow the penis bud but then get the signal to stop the growth when it is very small, leaving behind a clitoris instead of a large penis. The XX will also send a signal to grow the mammary glands. Males have nipples but cannot feed a baby. This is because they do not have XX, which makes mammary glands that allows milk to flow through the nipples. XY and XX chromosomes use hormones to signal which morphology a body should have. The XY chromosome contains testosterone, which signals the penis bud to grow into a penis . The XX chromosome contains estrogen, which is what signals the growth of mammary glands.In spotted hyenas, researchers believe a mutation developed to provide the female spotted hyena with more testosterone, resulting in a signal to grow the penis bud out more. Thus, female hyenas have a very large clitoris (elongated penis bud). Their vulva is fused shut, allowing them to pee through their clitoris/penis bud, just like a male pees through their penis. When a male wants to have sex with a female, she really has to be receptive, just as a male would have to be receptive to have sex. This is because it's actually like inserting a penis into a penis, making it virtually impossible to force a female to have sex. While evolution did them a favor in not allowing them to be raped by males, it was unkind to them in regards to birthing offspring (I am so glad that I am not a female hyena!). The cub has to come out somewhere and unfortunately it rips the vulva. That was painful to even read about. I do have to say though, this was absolutely the best discussion on hyena biology of any book I have read so far. The rest of the book:The last part of the book veered away from animal behavior and examined the more sociological aspects of cannibalism-- where the word originated, how it appeared in literature throughout the ages, and what our current conception of cannibalism is. Those aspects went on a little too long for my taste, but I can imagine other people enjoying those sections. "
121,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,4,"What an unexpectedly decent read. Unlike many others fascinated by this topic and other types of violence so prevalent on screen, I'm pretty chicken and would like to steer clear from those. Yet an article on National Geographic persuaded me to pick it up since the book seems a lot more scientific and less sensational. And I love reading about animals, and so was hoping for some light entertainment and instead got pretty educated. Writing in a conversational tone, yet packed with a lot of knowledge and terminologies that it's first time since ever that I have to repeatedly look words up, Schutt casually discusses cannibalism in the animal kingdom then gradually move to more difficult and gory scenes in human society. His presentation of China, admittedly, still hasn't convinced me, it feels like his research in China both ancient and modern time isn't rigorous enough. Yet it motivates me to read a book currently on my reading shelf about the Great Leap Forward.The book doesn't stop with cannibalism and definitely isn't a simple ""objective"" piece of writing describing the phenomenon. Schutt inserts his argument on religion, colonialism, on climate change, on modern obsession with violence, on the government and the economy. He talks bluntly about unsolved issue in the study of some infectious disease. All in all, the book leaves me with goose bumps, some fear, certainly aroused neocortex.And fun fact, now I really know the origin of ""Soylent"", my favorite meal replacement these days. What an ironic naming."
122,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3123067-elizabeth-a,4,"Book blurb: Eating one’s own kind is completely natural behavior in thousands of species, including humans. Throughout history we have engaged in cannibalism for reasons of famine, burial rites, and medicinal remedies; it’s been used as a way to terrorize and even a way to show filial piety. Today, the subject of humans consuming one another has been relegated to the realm of horror movies, fiction, and the occasional psychopath, but be forewarned: As climate change progresses and humans see more famine, disease, and overcrowding, biological and cultural constraints may well disappear. I listened to the audiobook which was well narrated by Tom Perkins.One of my fave questions to ask at parties (I kid you not): Say you are starving and your survival is at stake. Do you feel differently about eating a person who is already dead, as opposed to killing someone to eat? Try it at your next gathering and report back.This book hits my sweet spot on so many levels. Most people tend to be really squeamish about the topic, but if you're not a vegetarian, what's all the fuss about? Who decided that we can eat some animals and not others? Besides, if you think that cannibalism is awful, you might want to put it in perspective. Considering the horrid historical accounts of human behavior, eating your fellow Sapiens doesn't really seem all that bad.This is a fun, informative, and eye opening book, and I learned so many things about the animal kingdom I had no idea about. I'll bet school would be much more interesting if some of these topics were incorporated into the curriculum. I could talk about some of the specifics, but then that'd spoil all the fun for you. I assure you that it's full of fascinating and juicy tidbits. The author stays away from sensational crime stories, so if you are looking for recipes, look elsewhere, but if you are willing to have ""no way!"" moments, and are willing to annoy your loved ones by constantly saying ""did you know?"", move this up your TBR.This will end up on my best of 2017 reads, and the only reason I docked a star is due to the fact that there are sections, like the final chapters, where the author gets side tracked and wanders off topic."
123,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3078602-peacegal,4,"Fans of Mary Roach's popular science books will devour CANNIBALISM, a tour of the taboo topic throughout the natural world and human history. From Tyrannosaurus rex to the Donner Party, from tadpoles who eat their siblings to American uberbreeders who dine on placenta, readers will at turns be entertained, saddened, and disgusted by the facts within--but they will always be educated. There is one point on which I'd like to add something to the text on chicken cannibalism within factory farm conditions. The author writes that pecking deaths became a widespread concern when intensive chicken farming first took hold in the 1940s. Thus, the chicken industry developed the practice of debeaking, in which the end of each chick's beak is cut or seared off to hobble them from aggressively pecking one another. The author writes that chicken ""blinder"" masks were invented in the 40s as a supposedly more humane alternative, and words it in such a way that these masks have replaced debeaking in the poultry industry today. Erm, no. While blinders are occasionally used, most notably in the intensive rearing of pheasants for release-and-shoot canned hunts, debeaking remains the rule of the day for billions of hens raised for meat and egg production. (The sheer amount of birds raised coupled with the rapidity with which beaks can be cut or seared ensures this.) Not to say that blinder masks are such a pleasant alternative. They are frequently affixed by shoving a bar through the animal's nostrils. "

This book did not disappoint! So much good and interesting information with lots of discussion on the current disagreements between scientists on such topics as the Donner Party, Mad Cow Disease, and the mysteries of insect mating. This is a fascinating look at a taboo subject, and I loved every minute of it."

Otherwise, starts from the smaller animals or insects mainly, like spiders and covers also humans. The placenta business sounded so disgusting, people wanting to eat part of another human. Looks like that 1% of the total population could have cannibalistic tendencies but on disasters time, everybody becomes one. "
126,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,5,"Bill Schutt is a writer I really appreciate and enjoy. I read Dark Banquet a few years ago and loved it. He is for me sort of the Neil DeGrasse tyson of biology/animal behavior (human animals included). He is a wonderful storyteller and the structures of his books are clear and accessible and well-organized but also scientifically and sociologically and culturally incisive, and meandering in nice ways. He takes on a specific topic and stays with it in his way, but at the same time, explores it from many angles. He is curious and his interest and curiosity are evident in his writing. He clearly relishes exploring ideas, behaviors and histories and does not look away from the absurdity and violence of human cultures. In this book, in addition to providing insight into various and common cannibalistic behaviors throughout the animal kingdom, he interrogates human cultural and ideological relationships to cannibalism. He asks the question: are our monotheistic western cultures' ideas about and fear and hatred of cannibalism of a genetic origin in any way, or purely cultural. He talks of the devastating irony--how Europeans used the idea of the inherent evil of cannibalism to justify the brutal massacre of unnumbered non-European peoples who may or may not have engaged in cannibalistic rituals. I love the illustrations in the book. I love how Schutt takes myths and legends about certain animals acts or habits of cannibalism and offers a much more complex and nuanced picture. He puts some myths to rest. He offers many fascinating particulars in their places, including stories of physiological changes (epigenetic?) in certain aquatic and semiaquatic (and maybe other? can't recall) animals who engage in filial cannibalism. Also, there's a fantastic section about some messy, dart-throwing gastropods. Clearly, I am a fan of the book and recommend it highly.here's a quote from intro:Is it really a surprise, though, that our greatest cinematic villain is a man-eating psychiatrist while the mild-mannered runner-up is based on a real-life cannibal killer? Perhaps not, if one considers that many cultures share the belief that consuming another human is the worst (or close to the worst) behavior that a person can undertake. As a result, real-life cannibalistic psychopaths like Jeffrey Dahmer (another Wisconsin native) and his Russian counterpart, Andrei Chikatilo, have attained something akin to mythical status in the annals of history’s most notorious murderers. Whether through a filter of fictionalization, where man-eating deviants are transformed into powerful antiheroes, or through tabloids sensationalizing the crimes of real-life cannibals, these tales feed our obsession with all things gruesome—an obsession that is now an acceptable facet of our society.A different attitude was taken toward “primitive” social or ethnic groups whose members might not have shared the Western take on cannibalism taboos. At best, these “savages” were pegged as souls to be saved, but only if they met certain requirements. In the first half of the 20th century, for example, explorers and the missionaries who followed them ventured into the foreboding New Guinea highlands and quickly imposed one hard-and-fast rule for the locals: Cannibalism in any form was strictly forbidden.But far worse instances of cultural intrusion occurred elsewhere and throughout history, as those accused of consuming other humans, for any reason, were brutalized, enslaved, and murdered. The most infamous example of this practice began during the last years of the 15th century when millions of indigenous people living in the Caribbean and Mexico were summarily reclassified as cannibals for reasons that had little to do with people-eating. Instead, it paved the way for them to be robbed, beaten, conquered, and slain, all at the whim of their new Spanish masters.Similar atrocities were carried out on a massive scale by a succession of flag-planting European powers who (if one believes their accounts) wrested South America, Africa, and the Indo-Pacific away from man-eating savages, whose behavior placed them beyond the pale of anything that could remotely be described as human.So were European fears about cannibalism simply an invention used to justify conquest, or were there cultures, including those encountered by the Spaniards, where the consumption of humans was regarded as normal behavior? Although defining someone as a cannibal became an effective way to dehumanize them, there is also evidence that ritual cannibalism, as embodied in various customs related to funerary rites and warfare, occurred throughout history.As I began studying these forms of cannibalism, I sought to determine not only their perceived functions, but just how widespread they were or weren’t. Surprisingly—or perhaps not surprisingly given the subject matter—there is disagreement among anthropologists regarding ritual cannibalism. Some deny that it ever occurred, while others claim that the behavior did occur but was uncommon. Still others claim that cannibalism was practiced by many cultures throughout history and for a variety of reasons. One such body of evidence led me straight back to European history, where I learned that a particularly macabre form of cannibalism had been practiced for hundreds of years by nobility, physicians, and commoners alike, even into the 20th century.As a zoologist, I was, of course, intrigued at the prospect of documenting cases of non-human cannibalism. Looking back now, I can see that I’d started my inquiry with something less than a completely open mind. Part of me reasoned that since cannibalism was presumably a rare occurrence in humans (at least in modern times), it would likely be similarly rare in the animal kingdom.Once I dug further, though, I discovered that cannibalism differs in frequency between major animal groups—nonexistent in some and common in others. It varies from species to species and even within the same species, depending on local environmental conditions. Cannibalism also serves a variety of functions, depending on the cannibal. There are even examples in which an individual being cannibalized receives a benefit.In several instances, cannibalism appears to have arisen only recently in a species, and human activity might be the cause. In one such case, news reports informed horrified audiences that some of the most highly recognizable animals on the planet were suddenly consuming their own young. “Polar bears resort to cannibalism as Arctic ice shrinks,” reported CNN, while the Times of London echoed the sentiment: “Climate Change Forcing Polar Bears to Become Cannibals.” It was Reuters, though, that scored a perfect ten on the gruesome scale with an online slide show in which an adult polar bear was seen carrying around the still cute-as-a button head of a dead cub, the remains of its spinal cord trailing behind like a red streamer.The real story behind polar bear [contextualized in book...] cannibalism turned out to be just as fascinating, though it would also serve as a perfect example of how many accusations of and stories about cannibalism throughout history were untrue, unproven, or exaggerated—distorted by sensationalism, deception, a lack of scientific knowledge, and just plain bad writing. With the passage of time, these accounts too often become part of the historical record, their errors long forgotten. Part of my job would be to expose those errors.I was also extremely curious to see if the origin of cannibalism taboos could be traced back to the natural world, so I developed a pair of alternative hypotheses. Perhaps our aversion to consuming our own kind is hardwired into our brains and as such is a part of our genetic blueprint—a gene or two whose expression selects against such behavior. I reasoned that if such a built-in deterrent exists, then humans and most non-humans (with the exception of a few well-known anomalies such as black widow spiders and praying mantises) would avoid cannibalism at all costs. Thus, the taboo would have a biological foundation.Conversely, I weighed the possibility that the revulsion most people have at the very mention of cannibalism might stem solely from our culture. Of course, this led to even more questions. What are the cultural roots of the cannibalism taboo and how has it become so widespread? I also wondered why, as disgusted as we are at the very thought of cannibalism, we’re so utterly fascinated by it? Might cannibalism have been more common in our ancestors, before societal rules turned it into something abhorrent? I looked for evidence in the fossil record and elsewhere.Finally, I considered what it would take to break down the biological or cultural constraints that prevent us from eating each other on a regular basis. Could there come a time, in our not-so-distant future, when human cannibalism becomes commonplace? And for that matter, was it already becoming a more frequent occurrence? The answers to these questions are far from certain but, then again, there is much about the topic of cannibalism that cannot be neatly divided into black and white. Likely or not, though, the circumstances that might lead to outbreaks of widespread cannibalism in the 21st century are grounded in science, not science fiction.My aim was to stay away from the clichéd ideas about cannibalism that are already ingrained in our collective psyche and, with such a wealth of relevant material to explore, I quickly realized that this wouldn’t be difficult. Even the most famous cannibal stories, it turned out, had factual gaps that are only now being filled. In the case of the Donner Party, for example, I joined researchers whose scientific approach to the most infamous cannibalism-related event in American history had shed new light on this 19th-century tale of stranded pioneers.I’ve tried to approach each example from a scientific viewpoint, delving into what I considered the most intriguing aspects of anthropology, evolution, and biology to provide the broadest yet most engaging natural history of this behavior. What happens to our bodies and minds under starvation conditions? Why are women better equipped to survive starvation than men? And what physiological extremes would compel someone to consume the body of a friend or even a family member?But it’s not just the abundance of eggs and young that makes fish such a popular menu item for members of their own species. Many terrestrial vertebrates produce few or even a single offspring, and most of these newly born or newly hatched individuals already exhibit considerable body size. In many fish species, the extraordinary number of eggs produced imposes a limit on their size, and so a full-grown cod might be a million times (or six orders of magnitude) larger than its own eggs. This fact goes a long way to explain why the majority of them exhibit about as much individual recognition of their offspring as humans do for a handful of raisins. Fish eggs, larvae, and fry (i.e., young fish) are vast in number, minute in size, and high in nutritional value. This makes them an abundant, nonthreatening, and easily collected food source. It’s also why ichthyologists consider the absence of cannibalism in fishes, rather than its presence, to be the exceptional case."

I believed this book would focus more on canabalism in the animal world and then BRIEFLY connect this to human cannibalism. It didnt happen this way. I was so fascinated by the instances of cannabilism in the animal world and, surprisingly, the sections I read on human cannibalism were dull. This could have been due to it focusing mostly on references to cannibalism in early literature and focusing so heavily on the story of the Donner's. I lost interest at this point and just never picked it back up. Cool words I learned:Conspecific AdelphophagyDermatophagyAnthropophagyAnthropophagus phobiaOophagyTheophagy Placentophagy Apophallation which is the biting off of a penis (exhibited in terrestrial slugs)."

There are no sensationalized accounts of cannabalism through serial killers or the like. It was well written and easy to understand. I found the incidences of humans more interesting than the insects or animals. My two favorite sections were about the Donnor Party and the placenta. Props to the author for doing what he did for the research! That is some first hand knowledge there! I am not sure how much of this information I will be able to retain, but it was an informative and entertaining read. "
129,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6609117-eustacia-tan,4,"I started this book before a 1am flight because, I don't know, I subconsciously never want to eat or sleep again (just joking. I did both the whole day).Cannibalism is a history and an explanation of the act. But don't worry, the author doesn't start with the stomach churning human eating human stuff right away. He starts with the 'lighter' stuff - cannibalism by non-humans.The book starts by defining the various types of cannibalism - of which I remember two: eating your family members and eating people of your species who aren't related to you. Then it gets defined even further, to things like filial cannibalism (parents eating children or vice versa), cannibalism during mating (turns out the Black Widow Spider has been maligned.After going through all these decidedly non-humans, the author slowly makes his way back to us.If I were to generalise, I'd say that the book says that cannibalism tends to be a response to specific conditions (overcrowding, lack of nutrition, etc). Although in humans, there are ritual cannibals. Oh, and grey areas like breastfeeding (if skin cells come off) and I can't remember what else. (For the record, I am in no way justifying cannibalism in the whole 'eat literal human flesh' form)Although I was really surprised about the fact that ritual cannibalism existed in Chinese culture, especially as an act of filial piety. Then I remembered stories about sons cutting their thighs to feed their parents (though I can't remember from where) and I realised that IS cannibalism "
130,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34493714-yasaman,3,"An interesting read. Schutt's overall take on cannibalism - especially in non-human species - is that it essentially occurs either as a mechanism for passing on genetic information to the next generation, or to ensure your and/or your offspring's survival and conservation of energy, which again goes back to making sure genetic information is passed on. So, from an evolutionary standpoint, it makes perfect sense, especially considering that most species do not rely on behaviors/methods such as altruism and Kin selection for their fitness rates. When the topic is discussed in regards to humans, there is also ritualistic and medicinal cannibalism to consider, which Schutt explains is a lot more common than expected. What I liked about Schutt's discussion on the topic is that he shows the hypocrisy of viewpoints regarding ritualistic cannibalism based on which group of people is practicing it (i.e. indigenous people or white European Christians?). But, interestingly, it was also what I didn't like about the book in general: Firstly, Schutt oversimplifies the practice based on strict definitions (I hardly think biting fingernails and eating organs such as liver should fall under the same category,) and, secondly, he doesn't seem overly concerned about explaining that just because something is a cultural influence and seemingly widespread, it doesn't make it any less wrong to do."
131,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6314574-allisonlcarter,3,"While starting in the animal kingdom seems a logical place to start a conversation about cannibalism, this book gets bogged down in the world of weird sex snails and spiders for far too long. What makes cannibalism of such enduring interest is that it's fundamentally a question of whether it is moral to eat a human body under any circumstances. Since morality is, in most cases, relative, this is an endlessly fascinating question for homo sapiens and varies widely from culture to culture. Since animals do not have ethical frameworks that we are aware of, knowing that this invertebrate or that eats each other is less interesting, except in the broadest way.When Schutt does get to human consumption, he mostly covers familiar ground -- the Donner Party, Papua New Guinea, etc. The book shines in a few chapters that skirt the issue of why cannibalism is taboo in Western culture and examines the practice in China. The book is capped off with a long exploration of mad cow disease, which, since the cows didn't choose to engage in cannibalism or derive an evolutionary advantage from it, seems out of place.Still, the book is immaculately researched and Schutt has an amusingly wry sense of humor."
132,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63058444-joshua,5,"The following review will contain no references and/or bad puns of Hannibal Lecter. I'm just putting that out there now because the only really interesting Cannibal was Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The dude wore ties to work. That's class.The taboo of cannibalism is exactly what lead me to this book. Working in a library I regularly stock the ""New Books"" section and everyday I saw the book with it's distinct cover. Curiosity got the better of me and I checked the book out and read it in a week. The reader may not think themselves terribly interested in the idea of reading about the history and practice of cannibalism as an act, but they're missing out because there's also loads of biology.Schutt manages to write an easy, approachable book about an act that many people would rather not discuss, but as he points out in his introduction the fact that nobody wants to talk about is reason enough to discuss it. Schutt approaches the book at the start as a biologist, a zoologist to be specific, and just tries to understand biologically why cannibalism takes place in the wild in natural conditions. Once this is done he tackles the human element and it's here that the reader will be able to see that the issue becomes complicated. I won't lie, there are some elements of this book hat can be troubling (the eating of kids during the siege of Stalingrad just about broke me), but this book was approachable and enjoyable to read. It was only in the last three chapters that the writing began to grow a little tiresome, but even in these closing pages the book still felt strong and by it's end I felt as if I had really learned something about the natural world while also being warned about the possible future.Cannibalism isn't a fun topic unless it involves Anthony Hopkins (damn I broke my first rule) but it is an important topic and Schott succeeds in demonstrating that, yes, it does deserve an entire book to itself."

But I thought this one sounded interesting, and it turns out I really loved it! Bill Schutt has a great style that alternates between clear, concise explanations of biological concepts, overviews of research fields and more personal narratives and interviews he had with other scientists. To be clear, this is emphatically not a book about cannibal crimes (in fact, the author devotes only a few paragraphs to such murderers, and states that he both feels that fields has been covered more than enough, and that he doesn't want to be disrespectful towards victims and their families). What it is, is a journey through cannibalism as a biological and social mechanism, starting from examples of various animals and the research done on different species, before moving on to an investigation whether those same mechanisms come into play for humans and how different human cultures have viewed cannibalism throughout history. I actually feel like I've learned a lot about topics I didn't know much about, and had good time while acquiring that knowledge - a perfect combination!"
134,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24590339-k-willows,4,"This is informative & well rounded, but leans heavily on the side of serious science writing (as opposed to more casual/humorous science writing). It does have its bits of humor but overall this is a book I'd recommend to science minded people interested in learning more about the cultural taboo of cannibalism. I felt that the final 3 chapters could have been condensed down. I would have liked to read more about the Aghori of India but they were surprisingly unmentioned. Finally, for true crime nerds, this book does not go into depth regarding the cannibalistic killers, but I felt the author had good reason for avoiding that subject and the sensationalism that comes with it."
135,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46502154-anna,4,"Obviously, it's not for everyone but as someone who's been interested in cannibalism for a very long time (don't ask me why) I found it both interesting and informative. It's certainly the best and the most scientific book I've read on the subject so far. I was a bit worried that my English might fail me because the author is a biologist but luckily I had no problems understanding what he was talking about. What I liked the most was that Bill Schutt covered a very wide range of types of cannibalism and - unlike many other authors - didn't focus on serial killers/psychopaths (they are mentioned at the beginning so it might be a disappointment to those readers who were hoping for more) and sensational stories about tribes consuming human flesh like it's tacos. As an avid fan of animal documentaries I was the most interested in the first part of the book (even though I knew many of the facts Schutt talked about) and I was slightly bored towards the end when he focused on diseases (ones rumoured to be transmitted through infected human meat). But I honestly appreciate how thorough and detailed the research was."

The books take a more scientific and anthropological look at cannibalism. There is only a small amount of coverage of human cannibalism. Much more is on the animal kingdom. I found this super interesting and I definitely recommend it to those of you interested in science, anthropology and history. **ARC provided through Netgalley**"

138,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1702050-fox,5,"I've been eagerly awaiting this book since I first became aware of its release, which was likely due to Daphne's review. Cannibalism is an undeniably fascinating subject, and  Bill Schutt tackles it with grace and humor, as long for a disdain for the sensationalism that has too long colored all publications on the topic. The book was fascinating from cover to cover, and is extremely well-organized. It begins with the study of it in the animal kingdom, and ends with the much needed topic of prion diseases, their spread, and how poorly understood they are. Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History is destined to become the go-to book on the topic. Well sourced, entertainingly written, and scattered throughout with just enough humor and a large dose of respect, it does its topic justice.  Bill Schutt writes with a deft hand that does much to dispel many of the sensationalized myths that surround some of the better known cases (i.e. Donner Party, Praying Mantises, Black Widows, etc.) and does a good job explaining topics that have never really gotten enough focus (i.e. prion diseases, kuru) or have suffered from the wrong type of focus.This book was immensely readable, and more in depth and well-sourced than I expected a pop-science book to be. It definitely opened my eyes to the complexity of the topic, and added to disdain I already felt towards one Jared Diamond and his tendency to over simplify nearly everything. I'm very much looking forward to more being published in regards to the Neanderthal hypotheses presented in this book, as well as for more studies being done on the truly terrifying prion diseases. Nothing terrifies me more than the section on prion diseases in this book, and what it may hold in store for our future."
139,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1424908-map,4,"I won a kindle version of this book as a Goodreads Giveaway.I've seen some reviews on here claiming that this book is dry and overly scientific, but I have to disagree. As a psychologist who got my start in animal behaviorism, I appreciated Schutt's precise and behavioral descriptions of animals as opposed to engaging in anthropomorphism. I also found him to have a very dry wit that livened up the chapters without making them unscientific.The first few chapters, focusing primarily on animals, felt less cohesive than the ones focused on humans, which seemed more clearly delineated into categories of cannibalism or specific instances. But all of it was entertaining and engaging.On the downside, as my husband lived in England between 1988-1990, I'm relatively sure he'll die of Mad Cow Disease any day now. When I mentioned this to him, his response was, ""Oh yes, I'm actually not allowed to donate blood because I lived in England during that time."" Wonderful."

It isn't a book that I would have probably picked out myself, so it was great to still learn plenty and find it interesting. It explores the topic of cannibalism in non-human animals at first, then moves on to the social taboos in most cultures around the practice. It takes a skeptical approach to the claims of cannibalism in any culture and looks for actual hard evidence of it, instead of just second hand claims and anecdotal claims. It also explores the potential causes and ramifications of cannibalism in an interesting and engaging way."

Schutt makes a point of avoiding the sensational, but that doesn't prevent his book from being fascinating and engrossing.

143,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8071101-jeanne,2,"I found this book a difficult read. It read more like a science proof paper than general interest book.

145,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49782194-conor-ahern,4,"There are very few things I find myself getting squeamish about, but cannibalism is one of them. It's not so much the Donner-Party, necessity-of-survival type cannibalism that bothers me, either--hunger knows no morality and forces normal people to do things that they might ordinarily find horrific. It's more of the victim-of-cannibalization type that makes me shudder. I suppose on some fundamental level, I believe that it's wrong for humans to be used as means to an end, and succumbing by way of cannibalization seems to be the ultimate example of that; your life and your body reduced to the fulfillment of some fetish that by its very nature assigns you no greater value than a head of cattle. These were probably the hardest parts of this book for me. Stories of cannibalism in the animal kingdom and its evolutionary advantages were much more interesting than unsettling. This book got me thinking of other taboos, things that are so ingrained that logic alone can't account for the aversion. The only others that came to mind were incest and pedophilia, but at least by degree those things operate in contemporary societies as norms, and certainly have done so to a greater extent in the past. But it's not like the British or the Yoruba have a tradition of eating, say, an arm but would draw the line there; unlike with the other two types of taboos I mentioned, cannibalism seems much more to be an all-or-nothing type of convention. While societies all over the world permit relationships that we might regard as incestuous or pedophilic, it seems that societies that countenance what we would describe as cannibalism are few and far between. And I guess it's Schutt's goal to show that this is more of a Western taboo, which is interesting. He points to our Greek and Shakespearean cautionary tales as powerfully inculcating the supposed evil of cannibalism, and then looks to China for examples that, at the very least, cannibalism wasn't regarded there in such black-and-white terms, citing Imperial delicacies including human flesh and conventions whereby parents would trade children with other families during times of hunger so as to avoid having to consume their own children. China is a big place with a lot of people and a ton of recorded history, though, so you're bound to come across anything sooner or later, right?I think the interesting thing for me has been that I gave it a fair shot but in the end I simply can't get over the taboo. Much as I try, and Chinese evidence to the contrary placed before me, I cannot get past the idea that it's wrong, with nothing more articulate than that to say about it! Oh well, I'm only human. This book was often funny and takes a light touch. Very worth chewing over, if you can stomach it!"
146,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/616321-juushika,3,"This is a decent overview of the history and biology of cannibalism. The zoological studies are diverse and broad, and make effective arguments about the causes and therefore evolutionary benefits of cannibalism. It lines up nicely with the human studies which investigate these same causes, particularly privation. The issue of evolutionary benefit for humans is of course more complicated, and Schutt takes a variety of approaches, looking at cannibalism both as an act and as a social concept, and this latter--particular the role of (accusations of) cannibalism in justifications for genocide--gives the book depth.But I have too many unanswered questions: What are the ethics of murder versus eating the already-dead versus cannibalism as a social taboo--how does sapience factor into the erstwhile benefits of survival cannibalism? What is it that makes the taboo of cannibalism compelling in the public consciousness, and how does this intersect with cases of criminal cannibalism? I respect the decision to avoid sensationalism and over-reported criminal cases, but the lack here is conspicuous; meanwhile, using Freud to discuss taboo is cliché and, frankly, problematic. What is the cost/benefit for the evolutionary benefits versus health risks of cannibalism; where's the tipping point in that equation and what protective measures exist? Many of these answers exist by implication, and most of them are ""it's complicated,"" but I wish Schutt were bolder & reached further. The only bold conclusion he draws is a warning about the intersection of desensitization and survival cannibalism in near-future disaster situations--a lazy argument that directly conflicts the desensitized genocidal/cannibalistic human past. (All cultures are desensitized in their own special way.) I liked this well enough, the breadth of it is interesting, the science accessible; Schutt's humor conflicts sometimes with the deceptive gravity of his topic, but it makes for a readable text. But I wanted more, more depth, more asked but unanswerable questions, and that's not present here."
147,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5790437-aj-sterkel,4,"Likes: This book gave me nightmares about dying from mad cow disease. Nightmares probably don’t sound like a good thing, but if I’m thinking about a book in my sleep, it must be doing something right. Mad cow disease is especially terrifying because the British government tried to suppress info about it to protect the beef industry. Yeah . . . we’re all screwed.Anyway, I appreciate that the author looks at cannibalism from a scientific point-of-view instead of a sensationalist point-of-view. He avoids most of the serial killer talk and focuses on nature. Which animals are cannibals and why? If it’s common for animals to eat their friends, why is it rare for modern humans to do the same? Where did the taboo against cannibalism come from? (Hint: Christianity and authors with over-active imaginations.)I enjoyed most of the chapters in this book. The writing style is funnier than I expected. My favorite chapters are the ones about Christopher Columbus. I knew about the damage he did to the places he “explored,” but I didn’t know his connection to cannibalism. Queen Isabella decided that only New World cannibals could be enslaved. Selling slaves was big business, so Columbus and his followers slapped the cannibal label on pretty much everybody. I love that the author examines the history of cannibalism and how our (often irrational) fears of it have shaped the modern world. It’s a unique approach to the subject.“[T]he idea of cannibalism had become a handy symbol for unacceptable behavior practiced by “Others”—a broad and malleable category of evildoers that included enemies, followers of non-Christian religions, and any groups determined to retain their “uncivilized” customs.” – CannibalismDislikes: Since there are frogs on the cover, I expected to learn more about animal cannibalism. The first few chapters are about animals, but then the focus shifts to humans and mostly stays on humans. I wanted more animals.The author is clearly a scientist. I am definitely not a scientist. For me, the writing is too dry and sciencey (totally a real word) at times. The author goes into too much detail about a few subjects—such as kuru, a disease that humans get from eating their families. The science behind Kuru takes up so many pages that I got bored with it. The Bottom Line: One of the most educational books I’ve read this year. If you’re interested in learning about cannibalism, I recommend it. (Just prepare yourself for mad cow nightmares.)Do you like reviews, giveaways, and bookish nonsense? Good news! I have a blog for that. "

I don't know who Bill Schutt is, but man does he know how to take a pretty morbid and kind of yucky topic and turn it into something palatable. SEE WHAT I DID?Bill Schutt examines cannibalism in this world, be it in the animal kingdom, in cultural practice, or survival situations. He talks about all kinds of cannibals, from tadpoles to the Donner Party to Papua New Guinea, and puts them into a scientific and cultural context. Usually with some pretty funny anecdotes or quips to go along with it. While the sociological examinations were a bit easier for me to swallow than the scientific explanations, I quite enjoyed CANNIBALISM: A PERFECTLY NATURAL HISTORY. Schutt did a very good job of making all of these sometimes yucky and always fascinating realities very easy to understand, and didn't try to sensationalize anything around the practice of cannibalism. He also did some really interesting chapters about Mad Cow Disease and modern farming practices, which is just another example of 'progress' coming back and biting us on the butt. True, sometimes it's not for the squeamish, but Schutt delivers all this information with charm and aplomb (and even details his experience eating placenta, given to him by some enthusiastic parents). Super interesting and kind of gross too, CANNIBALISM: A PERFECTLY NATURAL HISTORY is a book I'm glad I picked up. "
149,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"This is an interesting little book. Schutt begins with detailing the frequently fascinating ways that cannibalism occurs in the natural world, and then he moves on to the history of cannibalism among the human animals. People have been eating people for a long time. When a city is under siege, or people find themselves adrift at sea without food for weeks... human beings are going to start looking increasingly delicious despite the taboos (see: Kramer in Newman's imagination in that episode of Seinfeld where he accidentally cooks himself with butter). Shutt also explores cultures where that taboo doesn't exist, and where people eat people ritualistically or simply because they taste delicious (the flavor of humans, if you were wondering, gets compared by various people to tuna, pork, and veal).And if we think the Western world is too civilized for Cannibalism, Schutt reminds us that Europeans were eating mummia (ground up Egyptian mummies, or counterfeit ground up mummies) for medicinal reasons right through the end of the Victorian age, and that the practice of placenta eating has actually been growing in recent years."
150,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"Really enjoyable read! Remember all of those awesome studies from animal behavior class, like the ones that demonstrated how many animals avoid having sex with their father, mother, sister, or brother -- chemicals inside their noses and brains help them identify ""self"" and ""non-self"", instructing them not to have sex with anything too similar to ""self"" -- or the studies that demonstrated how sexual selection could spell death for sexy males -- female fish preferred the most orange males, which drove selection toward fish so orange, they were easily spotted and gobbled up by predators -- or the other studies that outlined the many shocking behaviors and likely motivations of various animals? Well, this book is chock full of those types of studies, only they are geared solely at understanding why animals might or might not eat each other instead of why they might or might not mate with each other. Here is a sampling of the intensely interesting things you will find in well researched chapters. Black Widows:Contrary to the well held belief that female Black Widows spiders and female Preying Mantis devour their males when mating, these cannibalistic behaviors are reserved for times of great stress, such as when there is a food shortage or these animals are in captivity. Since they had only been studied in captivity, researchers were only privy to the behaviors associated with that stressor. If the Black Widow had been observed in natural conditions, when food supplies were sufficient, she would have never gotten the name ""Black Widow"". In truth, females spiders are far more often the victims of cannibalism than the perpetrators. In at least one species of spider, the females do a dance to make the males notice them and choose them to mate with. Instead of having sex, as the female intended, she made herself noticed and became a tasty treat for a male spider who, with the energy gained from eating her, moved on to court another female spider who he did choose to mate with. When times are really lean, there is a spider species who eats its own limbs! Spiders and Praying Mantis are not the only animals who do not usually practice cannibalism but turn to that behavior when they are exposed to stressful or unusual conditions. Cats, mice, rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits are all driven to cannibalism when facing similar conditions, but the hamster seems to be more prone to cannibalism than most species. If hamster siblings are kept in the same cage, they will often fight to the death at 4 weeks old, when they reach sexual maturity. The winner will eat the carcass of the loser. Though the behavior is common to many mothers, mother hamsters engage far more often in eating their young when the mother herself is handled close to the time when she gives birth or when her babies are handled when they are little. Apes:Cannibalism is generally rarer in ape species, including humans. However, when they engage in the practice, they are like other animals in that it is usually in times of stress, but not always. There have been serial killers who seem to enjoy eating their victims. There even seem to a pair of mother daughter serial killer chimpanzees, named Passion and Pom, who ate between 5 and 10 infants after attacking the new mothers. It seems it was all in an effort to obtain food. So, perhaps Passion and Pom's actions are not as unexplainable as Jeffery Dahmer's. Carnassial Dentation:The shape of teeth can tell us a lot about the evolution of various species. Schutt discussed the evolution of polar bear teeth to talk in general about how teeth, such as carnassial teeth, help meat eating species rip chunks of meet off their prey. Even though I have read a fair amount about this subject, I wasn't bored at all. In fact, I thought it was one of the better discussions on teeth and evolution. If you enjoy reading about ripping pieces of meat into smaller pieces, in order to aid digestion, I suggest you read, I Contain Multitudes as well. The author of that book, Ed Yong, gave a good bit of detail about gut microbes-- where they are placed in the gut, in front or behind -- so that the animals and the microbes both enjoy a wonderful meal. Yong discussed the types of microbes needed for a meat eating diet vs. a vegetable diet. I could not stop thinking about what Yong wrote when reading this section of Schutt's Cannibalism book. Schutt also used the polar bear section to satisfyingly discuss climate change and the stupidity of the media. Definitely worth reading. Hyenas and infanticide:Who doesn't love to eat babies? It seems that most animals who eat meat, love to eat the babies most. This seems to hold true whether it is a different species or a different species from the animal doing the eating. Chimps patrol their borders and when they encounter a female and her baby, they kill the baby and try to hook up with the female. Nothing says love like murdering her offspring. Chimps are not alone. Males from many different animal species eat babies in order to push females into estrus, so they can mate with them. One female species has evolved a protection against infanticide, and as a result is a dominant member of their clan-- the hyena. To really understand the magic of female hyena biology, it's important to understand sexual development in embryos. Embryos are genderless but have precursors to mammary glands and penises. If an embryo gets an XY chromosome the penis bud will grow, but the memory glands will not. . If the embryo receives XX, the embryo will still grow the penis bud but then get the signal to stop the growth when it is very small, leaving behind a clitoris instead of a large penis. The XX will also send a signal to grow the mammary glands. Males have nipples but cannot feed a baby. This is because they do not have XX, which makes mammary glands that allows milk to flow through the nipples. XY and XX chromosomes use hormones to signal which morphology a body should have. The XY chromosome contains testosterone, which signals the penis bud to grow into a penis . The XX chromosome contains estrogen, which is what signals the growth of mammary glands.In spotted hyenas, researchers believe a mutation developed to provide the female spotted hyena with more testosterone, resulting in a signal to grow the penis bud out more. Thus, female hyenas have a very large clitoris (elongated penis bud). Their vulva is fused shut, allowing them to pee through their clitoris/penis bud, just like a male pees through their penis. When a male wants to have sex with a female, she really has to be receptive, just as a male would have to be receptive to have sex. This is because it's actually like inserting a penis into a penis, making it virtually impossible to force a female to have sex. While evolution did them a favor in not allowing them to be raped by males, it was unkind to them in regards to birthing offspring (I am so glad that I am not a female hyena!). The cub has to come out somewhere and unfortunately it rips the vulva. That was painful to even read about. I do have to say though, this was absolutely the best discussion on hyena biology of any book I have read so far. The rest of the book:The last part of the book veered away from animal behavior and examined the more sociological aspects of cannibalism-- where the word originated, how it appeared in literature throughout the ages, and what our current conception of cannibalism is. Those aspects went on a little too long for my taste, but I can imagine other people enjoying those sections. "
151,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,4,"What an unexpectedly decent read. Unlike many others fascinated by this topic and other types of violence so prevalent on screen, I'm pretty chicken and would like to steer clear from those. Yet an article on National Geographic persuaded me to pick it up since the book seems a lot more scientific and less sensational. And I love reading about animals, and so was hoping for some light entertainment and instead got pretty educated. Writing in a conversational tone, yet packed with a lot of knowledge and terminologies that it's first time since ever that I have to repeatedly look words up, Schutt casually discusses cannibalism in the animal kingdom then gradually move to more difficult and gory scenes in human society. His presentation of China, admittedly, still hasn't convinced me, it feels like his research in China both ancient and modern time isn't rigorous enough. Yet it motivates me to read a book currently on my reading shelf about the Great Leap Forward.The book doesn't stop with cannibalism and definitely isn't a simple ""objective"" piece of writing describing the phenomenon. Schutt inserts his argument on religion, colonialism, on climate change, on modern obsession with violence, on the government and the economy. He talks bluntly about unsolved issue in the study of some infectious disease. All in all, the book leaves me with goose bumps, some fear, certainly aroused neocortex.And fun fact, now I really know the origin of ""Soylent"", my favorite meal replacement these days. What an ironic naming."
152,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3123067-elizabeth-a,4,"Book blurb: Eating one’s own kind is completely natural behavior in thousands of species, including humans. Throughout history we have engaged in cannibalism for reasons of famine, burial rites, and medicinal remedies; it’s been used as a way to terrorize and even a way to show filial piety. Today, the subject of humans consuming one another has been relegated to the realm of horror movies, fiction, and the occasional psychopath, but be forewarned: As climate change progresses and humans see more famine, disease, and overcrowding, biological and cultural constraints may well disappear. I listened to the audiobook which was well narrated by Tom Perkins.One of my fave questions to ask at parties (I kid you not): Say you are starving and your survival is at stake. Do you feel differently about eating a person who is already dead, as opposed to killing someone to eat? Try it at your next gathering and report back.This book hits my sweet spot on so many levels. Most people tend to be really squeamish about the topic, but if you're not a vegetarian, what's all the fuss about? Who decided that we can eat some animals and not others? Besides, if you think that cannibalism is awful, you might want to put it in perspective. Considering the horrid historical accounts of human behavior, eating your fellow Sapiens doesn't really seem all that bad.This is a fun, informative, and eye opening book, and I learned so many things about the animal kingdom I had no idea about. I'll bet school would be much more interesting if some of these topics were incorporated into the curriculum. I could talk about some of the specifics, but then that'd spoil all the fun for you. I assure you that it's full of fascinating and juicy tidbits. The author stays away from sensational crime stories, so if you are looking for recipes, look elsewhere, but if you are willing to have ""no way!"" moments, and are willing to annoy your loved ones by constantly saying ""did you know?"", move this up your TBR.This will end up on my best of 2017 reads, and the only reason I docked a star is due to the fact that there are sections, like the final chapters, where the author gets side tracked and wanders off topic."
153,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3078602-peacegal,4,"Fans of Mary Roach's popular science books will devour CANNIBALISM, a tour of the taboo topic throughout the natural world and human history. From Tyrannosaurus rex to the Donner Party, from tadpoles who eat their siblings to American uberbreeders who dine on placenta, readers will at turns be entertained, saddened, and disgusted by the facts within--but they will always be educated. There is one point on which I'd like to add something to the text on chicken cannibalism within factory farm conditions. The author writes that pecking deaths became a widespread concern when intensive chicken farming first took hold in the 1940s. Thus, the chicken industry developed the practice of debeaking, in which the end of each chick's beak is cut or seared off to hobble them from aggressively pecking one another. The author writes that chicken ""blinder"" masks were invented in the 40s as a supposedly more humane alternative, and words it in such a way that these masks have replaced debeaking in the poultry industry today. Erm, no. While blinders are occasionally used, most notably in the intensive rearing of pheasants for release-and-shoot canned hunts, debeaking remains the rule of the day for billions of hens raised for meat and egg production. (The sheer amount of birds raised coupled with the rapidity with which beaks can be cut or seared ensures this.) Not to say that blinder masks are such a pleasant alternative. They are frequently affixed by shoving a bar through the animal's nostrils. "

Looks like that 1% of the total population could have cannibalistic tendencies but on disasters time, everybody becomes one. "
156,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,5,"Bill Schutt is a writer I really appreciate and enjoy. I read Dark Banquet a few years ago and loved it. He is for me sort of the Neil DeGrasse tyson of biology/animal behavior (human animals included). He is a wonderful storyteller and the structures of his books are clear and accessible and well-organized but also scientifically and sociologically and culturally incisive, and meandering in nice ways. He takes on a specific topic and stays with it in his way, but at the same time, explores it from many angles. He is curious and his interest and curiosity are evident in his writing. He clearly relishes exploring ideas, behaviors and histories and does not look away from the absurdity and violence of human cultures. In this book, in addition to providing insight into various and common cannibalistic behaviors throughout the animal kingdom, he interrogates human cultural and ideological relationships to cannibalism. He asks the question: are our monotheistic western cultures' ideas about and fear and hatred of cannibalism of a genetic origin in any way, or purely cultural. He talks of the devastating irony--how Europeans used the idea of the inherent evil of cannibalism to justify the brutal massacre of unnumbered non-European peoples who may or may not have engaged in cannibalistic rituals. I love the illustrations in the book. I love how Schutt takes myths and legends about certain animals acts or habits of cannibalism and offers a much more complex and nuanced picture. He puts some myths to rest. He offers many fascinating particulars in their places, including stories of physiological changes (epigenetic?) in certain aquatic and semiaquatic (and maybe other? can't recall) animals who engage in filial cannibalism. Also, there's a fantastic section about some messy, dart-throwing gastropods. Clearly, I am a fan of the book and recommend it highly.here's a quote from intro:Is it really a surprise, though, that our greatest cinematic villain is a man-eating psychiatrist while the mild-mannered runner-up is based on a real-life cannibal killer? Perhaps not, if one considers that many cultures share the belief that consuming another human is the worst (or close to the worst) behavior that a person can undertake. As a result, real-life cannibalistic psychopaths like Jeffrey Dahmer (another Wisconsin native) and his Russian counterpart, Andrei Chikatilo, have attained something akin to mythical status in the annals of history’s most notorious murderers. Whether through a filter of fictionalization, where man-eating deviants are transformed into powerful antiheroes, or through tabloids sensationalizing the crimes of real-life cannibals, these tales feed our obsession with all things gruesome—an obsession that is now an acceptable facet of our society.A different attitude was taken toward “primitive” social or ethnic groups whose members might not have shared the Western take on cannibalism taboos. At best, these “savages” were pegged as souls to be saved, but only if they met certain requirements. In the first half of the 20th century, for example, explorers and the missionaries who followed them ventured into the foreboding New Guinea highlands and quickly imposed one hard-and-fast rule for the locals: Cannibalism in any form was strictly forbidden.But far worse instances of cultural intrusion occurred elsewhere and throughout history, as those accused of consuming other humans, for any reason, were brutalized, enslaved, and murdered. The most infamous example of this practice began during the last years of the 15th century when millions of indigenous people living in the Caribbean and Mexico were summarily reclassified as cannibals for reasons that had little to do with people-eating. Instead, it paved the way for them to be robbed, beaten, conquered, and slain, all at the whim of their new Spanish masters.Similar atrocities were carried out on a massive scale by a succession of flag-planting European powers who (if one believes their accounts) wrested South America, Africa, and the Indo-Pacific away from man-eating savages, whose behavior placed them beyond the pale of anything that could remotely be described as human.So were European fears about cannibalism simply an invention used to justify conquest, or were there cultures, including those encountered by the Spaniards, where the consumption of humans was regarded as normal behavior? Although defining someone as a cannibal became an effective way to dehumanize them, there is also evidence that ritual cannibalism, as embodied in various customs related to funerary rites and warfare, occurred throughout history.As I began studying these forms of cannibalism, I sought to determine not only their perceived functions, but just how widespread they were or weren’t. Surprisingly—or perhaps not surprisingly given the subject matter—there is disagreement among anthropologists regarding ritual cannibalism. Some deny that it ever occurred, while others claim that the behavior did occur but was uncommon. Still others claim that cannibalism was practiced by many cultures throughout history and for a variety of reasons. One such body of evidence led me straight back to European history, where I learned that a particularly macabre form of cannibalism had been practiced for hundreds of years by nobility, physicians, and commoners alike, even into the 20th century.As a zoologist, I was, of course, intrigued at the prospect of documenting cases of non-human cannibalism. Looking back now, I can see that I’d started my inquiry with something less than a completely open mind. Part of me reasoned that since cannibalism was presumably a rare occurrence in humans (at least in modern times), it would likely be similarly rare in the animal kingdom.Once I dug further, though, I discovered that cannibalism differs in frequency between major animal groups—nonexistent in some and common in others. It varies from species to species and even within the same species, depending on local environmental conditions. Cannibalism also serves a variety of functions, depending on the cannibal. There are even examples in which an individual being cannibalized receives a benefit.In several instances, cannibalism appears to have arisen only recently in a species, and human activity might be the cause. In one such case, news reports informed horrified audiences that some of the most highly recognizable animals on the planet were suddenly consuming their own young. “Polar bears resort to cannibalism as Arctic ice shrinks,” reported CNN, while the Times of London echoed the sentiment: “Climate Change Forcing Polar Bears to Become Cannibals.” It was Reuters, though, that scored a perfect ten on the gruesome scale with an online slide show in which an adult polar bear was seen carrying around the still cute-as-a button head of a dead cub, the remains of its spinal cord trailing behind like a red streamer.The real story behind polar bear [contextualized in book...] cannibalism turned out to be just as fascinating, though it would also serve as a perfect example of how many accusations of and stories about cannibalism throughout history were untrue, unproven, or exaggerated—distorted by sensationalism, deception, a lack of scientific knowledge, and just plain bad writing. With the passage of time, these accounts too often become part of the historical record, their errors long forgotten. Part of my job would be to expose those errors.I was also extremely curious to see if the origin of cannibalism taboos could be traced back to the natural world, so I developed a pair of alternative hypotheses. Perhaps our aversion to consuming our own kind is hardwired into our brains and as such is a part of our genetic blueprint—a gene or two whose expression selects against such behavior. I reasoned that if such a built-in deterrent exists, then humans and most non-humans (with the exception of a few well-known anomalies such as black widow spiders and praying mantises) would avoid cannibalism at all costs. Thus, the taboo would have a biological foundation.Conversely, I weighed the possibility that the revulsion most people have at the very mention of cannibalism might stem solely from our culture. Of course, this led to even more questions. What are the cultural roots of the cannibalism taboo and how has it become so widespread? I also wondered why, as disgusted as we are at the very thought of cannibalism, we’re so utterly fascinated by it? Might cannibalism have been more common in our ancestors, before societal rules turned it into something abhorrent? I looked for evidence in the fossil record and elsewhere.Finally, I considered what it would take to break down the biological or cultural constraints that prevent us from eating each other on a regular basis. Could there come a time, in our not-so-distant future, when human cannibalism becomes commonplace? And for that matter, was it already becoming a more frequent occurrence? The answers to these questions are far from certain but, then again, there is much about the topic of cannibalism that cannot be neatly divided into black and white. Likely or not, though, the circumstances that might lead to outbreaks of widespread cannibalism in the 21st century are grounded in science, not science fiction.My aim was to stay away from the clichéd ideas about cannibalism that are already ingrained in our collective psyche and, with such a wealth of relevant material to explore, I quickly realized that this wouldn’t be difficult. Even the most famous cannibal stories, it turned out, had factual gaps that are only now being filled. In the case of the Donner Party, for example, I joined researchers whose scientific approach to the most infamous cannibalism-related event in American history had shed new light on this 19th-century tale of stranded pioneers.I’ve tried to approach each example from a scientific viewpoint, delving into what I considered the most intriguing aspects of anthropology, evolution, and biology to provide the broadest yet most engaging natural history of this behavior. What happens to our bodies and minds under starvation conditions? Why are women better equipped to survive starvation than men? And what physiological extremes would compel someone to consume the body of a friend or even a family member?But it’s not just the abundance of eggs and young that makes fish such a popular menu item for members of their own species. Many terrestrial vertebrates produce few or even a single offspring, and most of these newly born or newly hatched individuals already exhibit considerable body size. In many fish species, the extraordinary number of eggs produced imposes a limit on their size, and so a full-grown cod might be a million times (or six orders of magnitude) larger than its own eggs. This fact goes a long way to explain why the majority of them exhibit about as much individual recognition of their offspring as humans do for a handful of raisins. Fish eggs, larvae, and fry (i.e., young fish) are vast in number, minute in size, and high in nutritional value. This makes them an abundant, nonthreatening, and easily collected food source. It’s also why ichthyologists consider the absence of cannibalism in fishes, rather than its presence, to be the exceptional case."

I believed this book would focus more on canabalism in the animal world and then BRIEFLY connect this to human cannibalism. It didnt happen this way. I was so fascinated by the instances of cannabilism in the animal world and, surprisingly, the sections I read on human cannibalism were dull. This could have been due to it focusing mostly on references to cannibalism in early literature and focusing so heavily on the story of the Donner's. I lost interest at this point and just never picked it back up.

I did both the whole day).Cannibalism is a history and an explanation of the act. But don't worry, the author doesn't start with the stomach churning human eating human stuff right away. He starts with the 'lighter' stuff - cannibalism by non-humans.The book starts by defining the various types of cannibalism - of which I remember two: eating your family members and eating people of your species who aren't related to you. Then it gets defined even further, to things like filial cannibalism (parents eating children or vice versa), cannibalism during mating (turns out the Black Widow Spider has been maligned.After going through all these decidedly non-humans, the author slowly makes his way back to us.If I were to generalise, I'd say that the book says that cannibalism tends to be a response to specific conditions (overcrowding, lack of nutrition, etc). Although in humans, there are ritual cannibals. Oh, and grey areas like breastfeeding (if skin cells come off) and I can't remember what else. (For the record, I am in no way justifying cannibalism in the whole 'eat literal human flesh' form)Although I was really surprised about the fact that ritual cannibalism existed in Chinese culture, especially as an act of filial piety. Then I remembered stories about sons cutting their thighs to feed their parents (though I can't remember from where) and I realised that IS cannibalism "
160,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34493714-yasaman,3,"An interesting read. Schutt's overall take on cannibalism - especially in non-human species - is that it essentially occurs either as a mechanism for passing on genetic information to the next generation, or to ensure your and/or your offspring's survival and conservation of energy, which again goes back to making sure genetic information is passed on. So, from an evolutionary standpoint, it makes perfect sense, especially considering that most species do not rely on behaviors/methods such as altruism and Kin selection for their fitness rates. When the topic is discussed in regards to humans, there is also ritualistic and medicinal cannibalism to consider, which Schutt explains is a lot more common than expected. What I liked about Schutt's discussion on the topic is that he shows the hypocrisy of viewpoints regarding ritualistic cannibalism based on which group of people is practicing it (i.e. indigenous people or white European Christians?). But, interestingly, it was also what I didn't like about the book in general: Firstly, Schutt oversimplifies the practice based on strict definitions (I hardly think biting fingernails and eating organs such as liver should fall under the same category,) and, secondly, he doesn't seem overly concerned about explaining that just because something is a cultural influence and seemingly widespread, it doesn't make it any less wrong to do."
161,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6314574-allisonlcarter,3,"While starting in the animal kingdom seems a logical place to start a conversation about cannibalism, this book gets bogged down in the world of weird sex snails and spiders for far too long. What makes cannibalism of such enduring interest is that it's fundamentally a question of whether it is moral to eat a human body under any circumstances. Since morality is, in most cases, relative, this is an endlessly fascinating question for homo sapiens and varies widely from culture to culture. Since animals do not have ethical frameworks that we are aware of, knowing that this invertebrate or that eats each other is less interesting, except in the broadest way.When Schutt does get to human consumption, he mostly covers familiar ground -- the Donner Party, Papua New Guinea, etc. The book shines in a few chapters that skirt the issue of why cannibalism is taboo in Western culture and examines the practice in China. The book is capped off with a long exploration of mad cow disease, which, since the cows didn't choose to engage in cannibalism or derive an evolutionary advantage from it, seems out of place.Still, the book is immaculately researched and Schutt has an amusingly wry sense of humor."

I'm just putting that out there now because the only really interesting Cannibal was Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The dude wore ties to work. That's class.The taboo of cannibalism is exactly what lead me to this book. Working in a library I regularly stock the ""New Books"" section and everyday I saw the book with it's distinct cover. Curiosity got the better of me and I checked the book out and read it in a week. The reader may not think themselves terribly interested in the idea of reading about the history and practice of cannibalism as an act, but they're missing out because there's also loads of biology.Schutt manages to write an easy, approachable book about an act that many people would rather not discuss, but as he points out in his introduction the fact that nobody wants to talk about is reason enough to discuss it. Schutt approaches the book at the start as a biologist, a zoologist to be specific, and just tries to understand biologically why cannibalism takes place in the wild in natural conditions. Once this is done he tackles the human element and it's here that the reader will be able to see that the issue becomes complicated. I won't lie, there are some elements of this book hat can be troubling (the eating of kids during the siege of Stalingrad just about broke me), but this book was approachable and enjoyable to read. It was only in the last three chapters that the writing began to grow a little tiresome, but even in these closing pages the book still felt strong and by it's end I felt as if I had really learned something about the natural world while also being warned about the possible future.Cannibalism isn't a fun topic unless it involves Anthony Hopkins (damn I broke my first rule) but it is an important topic and Schott succeeds in demonstrating that, yes, it does deserve an entire book to itself."

But I thought this one sounded interesting, and it turns out I really loved it! Bill Schutt has a great style that alternates between clear, concise explanations of biological concepts, overviews of research fields and more personal narratives and interviews he had with other scientists. To be clear, this is emphatically not a book about cannibal crimes (in fact, the author devotes only a few paragraphs to such murderers, and states that he both feels that fields has been covered more than enough, and that he doesn't want to be disrespectful towards victims and their families). What it is, is a journey through cannibalism as a biological and social mechanism, starting from examples of various animals and the research done on different species, before moving on to an investigation whether those same mechanisms come into play for humans and how different human cultures have viewed cannibalism throughout history. I actually feel like I've learned a lot about topics I didn't know much about, and had good time while acquiring that knowledge - a perfect combination!"
164,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24590339-k-willows,4,"This is informative & well rounded, but leans heavily on the side of serious science writing (as opposed to more casual/humorous science writing). It does have its bits of humor but overall this is a book I'd recommend to science minded people interested in learning more about the cultural taboo of cannibalism. I felt that the final 3 chapters could have been condensed down. I would have liked to read more about the Aghori of India but they were surprisingly unmentioned. Finally, for true crime nerds, this book does not go into depth regarding the cannibalistic killers, but I felt the author had good reason for avoiding that subject and the sensationalism that comes with it."
165,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46502154-anna,4,"Obviously, it's not for everyone but as someone who's been interested in cannibalism for a very long time (don't ask me why) I found it both interesting and informative. It's certainly the best and the most scientific book I've read on the subject so far. I was a bit worried that my English might fail me because the author is a biologist but luckily I had no problems understanding what he was talking about. What I liked the most was that Bill Schutt covered a very wide range of types of cannibalism and - unlike many other authors - didn't focus on serial killers/psychopaths (they are mentioned at the beginning so it might be a disappointment to those readers who were hoping for more) and sensational stories about tribes consuming human flesh like it's tacos. As an avid fan of animal documentaries I was the most interested in the first part of the book (even though I knew many of the facts Schutt talked about) and I was slightly bored towards the end when he focused on diseases (ones rumoured to be transmitted through infected human meat). But I honestly appreciate how thorough and detailed the research was."
166,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12256655-alisa,4,"I found this to be a very interesting book. I understand the subject matter isn't for everyone but it's not done is a sensational way. The books take a more scientific and anthropological look at cannibalism. There is only a small amount of coverage of human cannibalism. Much more is on the animal kingdom. I found this super interesting and I definitely recommend it to those of you interested in science, anthropology and history. **ARC provided through Netgalley**"

168,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1702050-fox,5,"I've been eagerly awaiting this book since I first became aware of its release, which was likely due to Daphne's review. Cannibalism is an undeniably fascinating subject, and  Bill Schutt tackles it with grace and humor, as long for a disdain for the sensationalism that has too long colored all publications on the topic. The book was fascinating from cover to cover, and is extremely well-organized. It begins with the study of it in the animal kingdom, and ends with the much needed topic of prion diseases, their spread, and how poorly understood they are. Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History is destined to become the go-to book on the topic. Well sourced, entertainingly written, and scattered throughout with just enough humor and a large dose of respect, it does its topic justice.  Bill Schutt writes with a deft hand that does much to dispel many of the sensationalized myths that surround some of the better known cases (i.e. Donner Party, Praying Mantises, Black Widows, etc.) and does a good job explaining topics that have never really gotten enough focus (i.e. prion diseases, kuru) or have suffered from the wrong type of focus.This book was immensely readable, and more in depth and well-sourced than I expected a pop-science book to be. It definitely opened my eyes to the complexity of the topic, and added to disdain I already felt towards one Jared Diamond and his tendency to over simplify nearly everything. I'm very much looking forward to more being published in regards to the Neanderthal hypotheses presented in this book, as well as for more studies being done on the truly terrifying prion diseases. Nothing terrifies me more than the section on prion diseases in this book, and what it may hold in store for our future."
169,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1424908-map,4,"I won a kindle version of this book as a Goodreads Giveaway.I've seen some reviews on here claiming that this book is dry and overly scientific, but I have to disagree. As a psychologist who got my start in animal behaviorism, I appreciated Schutt's precise and behavioral descriptions of animals as opposed to engaging in anthropomorphism. I also found him to have a very dry wit that livened up the chapters without making them unscientific.The first few chapters, focusing primarily on animals, felt less cohesive than the ones focused on humans, which seemed more clearly delineated into categories of cannibalism or specific instances. But all of it was entertaining and engaging.On the downside, as my husband lived in England between 1988-1990, I'm relatively sure he'll die of Mad Cow Disease any day now. When I mentioned this to him, his response was, ""Oh yes, I'm actually not allowed to donate blood because I lived in England during that time."" Wonderful."
170,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61034045-chuy-ruiz,4,"I was given this book as a gift and I definitely enjoyed reading it. It isn't a book that I would have probably picked out myself, so it was great to still learn plenty and find it interesting. It explores the topic of cannibalism in non-human animals at first, then moves on to the social taboos in most cultures around the practice. It takes a skeptical approach to the claims of cannibalism in any culture and looks for actual hard evidence of it, instead of just second hand claims and anecdotal claims. It also explores the potential causes and ramifications of cannibalism in an interesting and engaging way."
171,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1961913-na-amen,4,"Overall I really liked this book. There were some small moments of throwaway lines where I felt the objectivity of the author slipped and some cultural/biological prejudices reared their heads. A good study of cannibalism in nature across species that stayed away from sensationalism, even while discussing the Donner party."
172,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3237385-melissa,5,"4.5* I flew through this! I can't remember the last time I struggled to put down nonfiction. Schutt makes a point of avoiding the sensational, but that doesn't prevent his book from being fascinating and engrossing. I also appreciated how he pointed out conflicting points of view / arguments between scholars, especially when it came to human cannibalistic behaviors."
173,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8071101-jeanne,2,"I found this book a difficult read. It read more like a science proof paper than general interest book.

175,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49782194-conor-ahern,4,"There are very few things I find myself getting squeamish about, but cannibalism is one of them. It's not so much the Donner-Party, necessity-of-survival type cannibalism that bothers me, either--hunger knows no morality and forces normal people to do things that they might ordinarily find horrific. It's more of the victim-of-cannibalization type that makes me shudder. I suppose on some fundamental level, I believe that it's wrong for humans to be used as means to an end, and succumbing by way of cannibalization seems to be the ultimate example of that; your life and your body reduced to the fulfillment of some fetish that by its very nature assigns you no greater value than a head of cattle. These were probably the hardest parts of this book for me. Stories of cannibalism in the animal kingdom and its evolutionary advantages were much more interesting than unsettling. This book got me thinking of other taboos, things that are so ingrained that logic alone can't account for the aversion. The only others that came to mind were incest and pedophilia, but at least by degree those things operate in contemporary societies as norms, and certainly have done so to a greater extent in the past. But it's not like the British or the Yoruba have a tradition of eating, say, an arm but would draw the line there; unlike with the other two types of taboos I mentioned, cannibalism seems much more to be an all-or-nothing type of convention. While societies all over the world permit relationships that we might regard as incestuous or pedophilic, it seems that societies that countenance what we would describe as cannibalism are few and far between. And I guess it's Schutt's goal to show that this is more of a Western taboo, which is interesting. He points to our Greek and Shakespearean cautionary tales as powerfully inculcating the supposed evil of cannibalism, and then looks to China for examples that, at the very least, cannibalism wasn't regarded there in such black-and-white terms, citing Imperial delicacies including human flesh and conventions whereby parents would trade children with other families during times of hunger so as to avoid having to consume their own children. China is a big place with a lot of people and a ton of recorded history, though, so you're bound to come across anything sooner or later, right?I think the interesting thing for me has been that I gave it a fair shot but in the end I simply can't get over the taboo. Much as I try, and Chinese evidence to the contrary placed before me, I cannot get past the idea that it's wrong, with nothing more articulate than that to say about it! Oh well, I'm only human. This book was often funny and takes a light touch. Very worth chewing over, if you can stomach it!"
176,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/616321-juushika,3,"This is a decent overview of the history and biology of cannibalism. The zoological studies are diverse and broad, and make effective arguments about the causes and therefore evolutionary benefits of cannibalism. It lines up nicely with the human studies which investigate these same causes, particularly privation. The issue of evolutionary benefit for humans is of course more complicated, and Schutt takes a variety of approaches, looking at cannibalism both as an act and as a social concept, and this latter--particular the role of (accusations of) cannibalism in justifications for genocide--gives the book depth.But I have too many unanswered questions: What are the ethics of murder versus eating the already-dead versus cannibalism as a social taboo--how does sapience factor into the erstwhile benefits of survival cannibalism? What is it that makes the taboo of cannibalism compelling in the public consciousness, and how does this intersect with cases of criminal cannibalism? I respect the decision to avoid sensationalism and over-reported criminal cases, but the lack here is conspicuous; meanwhile, using Freud to discuss taboo is cliché and, frankly, problematic. What is the cost/benefit for the evolutionary benefits versus health risks of cannibalism; where's the tipping point in that equation and what protective measures exist? Many of these answers exist by implication, and most of them are ""it's complicated,"" but I wish Schutt were bolder & reached further. The only bold conclusion he draws is a warning about the intersection of desensitization and survival cannibalism in near-future disaster situations--a lazy argument that directly conflicts the desensitized genocidal/cannibalistic human past. (All cultures are desensitized in their own special way.) I liked this well enough, the breadth of it is interesting, the science accessible; Schutt's humor conflicts sometimes with the deceptive gravity of his topic, but it makes for a readable text. But I wanted more, more depth, more asked but unanswerable questions, and that's not present here."
177,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5790437-aj-sterkel,4,"Likes: This book gave me nightmares about dying from mad cow disease. Nightmares probably don’t sound like a good thing, but if I’m thinking about a book in my sleep, it must be doing something right. Mad cow disease is especially terrifying because the British government tried to suppress info about it to protect the beef industry. Yeah . . . we’re all screwed.Anyway, I appreciate that the author looks at cannibalism from a scientific point-of-view instead of a sensationalist point-of-view. He avoids most of the serial killer talk and focuses on nature. Which animals are cannibals and why? If it’s common for animals to eat their friends, why is it rare for modern humans to do the same? Where did the taboo against cannibalism come from? (Hint: Christianity and authors with over-active imaginations.)I enjoyed most of the chapters in this book. The writing style is funnier than I expected. My favorite chapters are the ones about Christopher Columbus. I knew about the damage he did to the places he “explored,” but I didn’t know his connection to cannibalism. Queen Isabella decided that only New World cannibals could be enslaved. Selling slaves was big business, so Columbus and his followers slapped the cannibal label on pretty much everybody. I love that the author examines the history of cannibalism and how our (often irrational) fears of it have shaped the modern world. It’s a unique approach to the subject.“[T]he idea of cannibalism had become a handy symbol for unacceptable behavior practiced by “Others”—a broad and malleable category of evildoers that included enemies, followers of non-Christian religions, and any groups determined to retain their “uncivilized” customs.” – CannibalismDislikes: Since there are frogs on the cover, I expected to learn more about animal cannibalism. The first few chapters are about animals, but then the focus shifts to humans and mostly stays on humans. I wanted more animals.The author is clearly a scientist. I am definitely not a scientist. For me, the writing is too dry and sciencey (totally a real word) at times. The author goes into too much detail about a few subjects—such as kuru, a disease that humans get from eating their families. The science behind Kuru takes up so many pages that I got bored with it. The Bottom Line: One of the most educational books I’ve read this year. If you’re interested in learning about cannibalism, I recommend it. (Just prepare yourself for mad cow nightmares.)Do you like reviews, giveaways, and bookish nonsense? Good news! I have a blog for that. "
178,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4876063-elphareads,4,"I mean, just look at the title of this. CANNIBALISM: A PERFECTLY NATURAL HISTORY? How could I not? I don't know who Bill Schutt is, but man does he know how to take a pretty morbid and kind of yucky topic and turn it into something palatable. SEE WHAT I DID?Bill Schutt examines cannibalism in this world, be it in the animal kingdom, in cultural practice, or survival situations. He talks about all kinds of cannibals, from tadpoles to the Donner Party to Papua New Guinea, and puts them into a scientific and cultural context. Usually with some pretty funny anecdotes or quips to go along with it. While the sociological examinations were a bit easier for me to swallow than the scientific explanations, I quite enjoyed CANNIBALISM: A PERFECTLY NATURAL HISTORY. Schutt did a very good job of making all of these sometimes yucky and always fascinating realities very easy to understand, and didn't try to sensationalize anything around the practice of cannibalism. He also did some really interesting chapters about Mad Cow Disease and modern farming practices, which is just another example of 'progress' coming back and biting us on the butt. True, sometimes it's not for the squeamish, but Schutt delivers all this information with charm and aplomb (and even details his experience eating placenta, given to him by some enthusiastic parents). Super interesting and kind of gross too, CANNIBALISM: A PERFECTLY NATURAL HISTORY is a book I'm glad I picked up. "
179,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"This is an interesting little book. Schutt begins with detailing the frequently fascinating ways that cannibalism occurs in the natural world, and then he moves on to the history of cannibalism among the human animals. People have been eating people for a long time. When a city is under siege, or people find themselves adrift at sea without food for weeks... human beings are going to start looking increasingly delicious despite the taboos (see: Kramer in Newman's imagination in that episode of Seinfeld where he accidentally cooks himself with butter). Shutt also explores cultures where that taboo doesn't exist, and where people eat people ritualistically or simply because they taste delicious (the flavor of humans, if you were wondering, gets compared by various people to tuna, pork, and veal).And if we think the Western world is too civilized for Cannibalism, Schutt reminds us that Europeans were eating mummia (ground up Egyptian mummies, or counterfeit ground up mummies) for medicinal reasons right through the end of the Victorian age, and that the practice of placenta eating has actually been growing in recent years."
180,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"Really enjoyable read! Remember all of those awesome studies from animal behavior class, like the ones that demonstrated how many animals avoid having sex with their father, mother, sister, or brother -- chemicals inside their noses and brains help them identify ""self"" and ""non-self"", instructing them not to have sex with anything too similar to ""self"" -- or the studies that demonstrated how sexual selection could spell death for sexy males -- female fish preferred the most orange males, which drove selection toward fish so orange, they were easily spotted and gobbled up by predators -- or the other studies that outlined the many shocking behaviors and likely motivations of various animals? Well, this book is chock full of those types of studies, only they are geared solely at understanding why animals might or might not eat each other instead of why they might or might not mate with each other. Here is a sampling of the intensely interesting things you will find in well researched chapters. Black Widows:Contrary to the well held belief that female Black Widows spiders and female Preying Mantis devour their males when mating, these cannibalistic behaviors are reserved for times of great stress, such as when there is a food shortage or these animals are in captivity. Since they had only been studied in captivity, researchers were only privy to the behaviors associated with that stressor. If the Black Widow had been observed in natural conditions, when food supplies were sufficient, she would have never gotten the name ""Black Widow"". In truth, females spiders are far more often the victims of cannibalism than the perpetrators. In at least one species of spider, the females do a dance to make the males notice them and choose them to mate with. Instead of having sex, as the female intended, she made herself noticed and became a tasty treat for a male spider who, with the energy gained from eating her, moved on to court another female spider who he did choose to mate with. When times are really lean, there is a spider species who eats its own limbs! Spiders and Praying Mantis are not the only animals who do not usually practice cannibalism but turn to that behavior when they are exposed to stressful or unusual conditions. Cats, mice, rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits are all driven to cannibalism when facing similar conditions, but the hamster seems to be more prone to cannibalism than most species. If hamster siblings are kept in the same cage, they will often fight to the death at 4 weeks old, when they reach sexual maturity. The winner will eat the carcass of the loser. Though the behavior is common to many mothers, mother hamsters engage far more often in eating their young when the mother herself is handled close to the time when she gives birth or when her babies are handled when they are little. Apes:Cannibalism is generally rarer in ape species, including humans. However, when they engage in the practice, they are like other animals in that it is usually in times of stress, but not always. There have been serial killers who seem to enjoy eating their victims. There even seem to a pair of mother daughter serial killer chimpanzees, named Passion and Pom, who ate between 5 and 10 infants after attacking the new mothers. It seems it was all in an effort to obtain food. So, perhaps Passion and Pom's actions are not as unexplainable as Jeffery Dahmer's. Carnassial Dentation:The shape of teeth can tell us a lot about the evolution of various species. Schutt discussed the evolution of polar bear teeth to talk in general about how teeth, such as carnassial teeth, help meat eating species rip chunks of meet off their prey. Even though I have read a fair amount about this subject, I wasn't bored at all. In fact, I thought it was one of the better discussions on teeth and evolution. If you enjoy reading about ripping pieces of meat into smaller pieces, in order to aid digestion, I suggest you read, I Contain Multitudes as well. The author of that book, Ed Yong, gave a good bit of detail about gut microbes-- where they are placed in the gut, in front or behind -- so that the animals and the microbes both enjoy a wonderful meal. Yong discussed the types of microbes needed for a meat eating diet vs. a vegetable diet. I could not stop thinking about what Yong wrote when reading this section of Schutt's Cannibalism book. Schutt also used the polar bear section to satisfyingly discuss climate change and the stupidity of the media. Definitely worth reading. Hyenas and infanticide:Who doesn't love to eat babies? It seems that most animals who eat meat, love to eat the babies most. This seems to hold true whether it is a different species or a different species from the animal doing the eating. Chimps patrol their borders and when they encounter a female and her baby, they kill the baby and try to hook up with the female. Nothing says love like murdering her offspring. Chimps are not alone. Males from many different animal species eat babies in order to push females into estrus, so they can mate with them. One female species has evolved a protection against infanticide, and as a result is a dominant member of their clan-- the hyena. To really understand the magic of female hyena biology, it's important to understand sexual development in embryos. Embryos are genderless but have precursors to mammary glands and penises. If an embryo gets an XY chromosome the penis bud will grow, but the memory glands will not. . If the embryo receives XX, the embryo will still grow the penis bud but then get the signal to stop the growth when it is very small, leaving behind a clitoris instead of a large penis. The XX will also send a signal to grow the mammary glands. Males have nipples but cannot feed a baby. This is because they do not have XX, which makes mammary glands that allows milk to flow through the nipples. XY and XX chromosomes use hormones to signal which morphology a body should have. The XY chromosome contains testosterone, which signals the penis bud to grow into a penis . The XX chromosome contains estrogen, which is what signals the growth of mammary glands.In spotted hyenas, researchers believe a mutation developed to provide the female spotted hyena with more testosterone, resulting in a signal to grow the penis bud out more. Thus, female hyenas have a very large clitoris (elongated penis bud). Their vulva is fused shut, allowing them to pee through their clitoris/penis bud, just like a male pees through their penis. When a male wants to have sex with a female, she really has to be receptive, just as a male would have to be receptive to have sex. This is because it's actually like inserting a penis into a penis, making it virtually impossible to force a female to have sex. While evolution did them a favor in not allowing them to be raped by males, it was unkind to them in regards to birthing offspring (I am so glad that I am not a female hyena!). The cub has to come out somewhere and unfortunately it rips the vulva. That was painful to even read about. I do have to say though, this was absolutely the best discussion on hyena biology of any book I have read so far. The rest of the book:The last part of the book veered away from animal behavior and examined the more sociological aspects of cannibalism-- where the word originated, how it appeared in literature throughout the ages, and what our current conception of cannibalism is. Those aspects went on a little too long for my taste, but I can imagine other people enjoying those sections. "
181,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,4,"What an unexpectedly decent read. Unlike many others fascinated by this topic and other types of violence so prevalent on screen, I'm pretty chicken and would like to steer clear from those. Yet an article on National Geographic persuaded me to pick it up since the book seems a lot more scientific and less sensational. And I love reading about animals, and so was hoping for some light entertainment and instead got pretty educated. Writing in a conversational tone, yet packed with a lot of knowledge and terminologies that it's first time since ever that I have to repeatedly look words up, Schutt casually discusses cannibalism in the animal kingdom then gradually move to more difficult and gory scenes in human society. His presentation of China, admittedly, still hasn't convinced me, it feels like his research in China both ancient and modern time isn't rigorous enough. Yet it motivates me to read a book currently on my reading shelf about the Great Leap Forward.The book doesn't stop with cannibalism and definitely isn't a simple ""objective"" piece of writing describing the phenomenon. Schutt inserts his argument on religion, colonialism, on climate change, on modern obsession with violence, on the government and the economy. He talks bluntly about unsolved issue in the study of some infectious disease. All in all, the book leaves me with goose bumps, some fear, certainly aroused neocortex.And fun fact, now I really know the origin of ""Soylent"", my favorite meal replacement these days. What an ironic naming."
182,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3123067-elizabeth-a,4,"Book blurb: Eating one’s own kind is completely natural behavior in thousands of species, including humans. Throughout history we have engaged in cannibalism for reasons of famine, burial rites, and medicinal remedies; it’s been used as a way to terrorize and even a way to show filial piety. Today, the subject of humans consuming one another has been relegated to the realm of horror movies, fiction, and the occasional psychopath, but be forewarned: As climate change progresses and humans see more famine, disease, and overcrowding, biological and cultural constraints may well disappear. I listened to the audiobook which was well narrated by Tom Perkins.One of my fave questions to ask at parties (I kid you not): Say you are starving and your survival is at stake. Do you feel differently about eating a person who is already dead, as opposed to killing someone to eat? Try it at your next gathering and report back.This book hits my sweet spot on so many levels. Most people tend to be really squeamish about the topic, but if you're not a vegetarian, what's all the fuss about? Who decided that we can eat some animals and not others? Besides, if you think that cannibalism is awful, you might want to put it in perspective. Considering the horrid historical accounts of human behavior, eating your fellow Sapiens doesn't really seem all that bad.This is a fun, informative, and eye opening book, and I learned so many things about the animal kingdom I had no idea about. I'll bet school would be much more interesting if some of these topics were incorporated into the curriculum. I could talk about some of the specifics, but then that'd spoil all the fun for you. I assure you that it's full of fascinating and juicy tidbits. The author stays away from sensational crime stories, so if you are looking for recipes, look elsewhere, but if you are willing to have ""no way!"" moments, and are willing to annoy your loved ones by constantly saying ""did you know?"", move this up your TBR.This will end up on my best of 2017 reads, and the only reason I docked a star is due to the fact that there are sections, like the final chapters, where the author gets side tracked and wanders off topic."
183,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3078602-peacegal,4,"Fans of Mary Roach's popular science books will devour CANNIBALISM, a tour of the taboo topic throughout the natural world and human history. From Tyrannosaurus rex to the Donner Party, from tadpoles who eat their siblings to American uberbreeders who dine on placenta, readers will at turns be entertained, saddened, and disgusted by the facts within--but they will always be educated. There is one point on which I'd like to add something to the text on chicken cannibalism within factory farm conditions. The author writes that pecking deaths became a widespread concern when intensive chicken farming first took hold in the 1940s. Thus, the chicken industry developed the practice of debeaking, in which the end of each chick's beak is cut or seared off to hobble them from aggressively pecking one another. The author writes that chicken ""blinder"" masks were invented in the 40s as a supposedly more humane alternative, and words it in such a way that these masks have replaced debeaking in the poultry industry today. Erm, no. While blinders are occasionally used, most notably in the intensive rearing of pheasants for release-and-shoot canned hunts, debeaking remains the rule of the day for billions of hens raised for meat and egg production. (The sheer amount of birds raised coupled with the rapidity with which beaks can be cut or seared ensures this.) Not to say that blinder masks are such a pleasant alternative. They are frequently affixed by shoving a bar through the animal's nostrils. "

This book did not disappoint! So much good and interesting information with lots of discussion on the current disagreements between scientists on such topics as the Donner Party, Mad Cow Disease, and the mysteries of insect mating. This is a fascinating look at a taboo subject, and I loved every minute of it."

Otherwise, starts from the smaller animals or insects mainly, like spiders and covers also humans. The placenta business sounded so disgusting, people wanting to eat part of another human. Looks like that 1% of the total population could have cannibalistic tendencies but on disasters time, everybody becomes one. "
186,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,5,"Bill Schutt is a writer I really appreciate and enjoy. I read Dark Banquet a few years ago and loved it. He is for me sort of the Neil DeGrasse tyson of biology/animal behavior (human animals included). He is a wonderful storyteller and the structures of his books are clear and accessible and well-organized but also scientifically and sociologically and culturally incisive, and meandering in nice ways. He takes on a specific topic and stays with it in his way, but at the same time, explores it from many angles. He is curious and his interest and curiosity are evident in his writing. He clearly relishes exploring ideas, behaviors and histories and does not look away from the absurdity and violence of human cultures. In this book, in addition to providing insight into various and common cannibalistic behaviors throughout the animal kingdom, he interrogates human cultural and ideological relationships to cannibalism. He asks the question: are our monotheistic western cultures' ideas about and fear and hatred of cannibalism of a genetic origin in any way, or purely cultural. He talks of the devastating irony--how Europeans used the idea of the inherent evil of cannibalism to justify the brutal massacre of unnumbered non-European peoples who may or may not have engaged in cannibalistic rituals. I love the illustrations in the book. I love how Schutt takes myths and legends about certain animals acts or habits of cannibalism and offers a much more complex and nuanced picture. He puts some myths to rest. He offers many fascinating particulars in their places, including stories of physiological changes (epigenetic?) in certain aquatic and semiaquatic (and maybe other? can't recall) animals who engage in filial cannibalism. Also, there's a fantastic section about some messy, dart-throwing gastropods. Clearly, I am a fan of the book and recommend it highly.here's a quote from intro:Is it really a surprise, though, that our greatest cinematic villain is a man-eating psychiatrist while the mild-mannered runner-up is based on a real-life cannibal killer? Perhaps not, if one considers that many cultures share the belief that consuming another human is the worst (or close to the worst) behavior that a person can undertake. As a result, real-life cannibalistic psychopaths like Jeffrey Dahmer (another Wisconsin native) and his Russian counterpart, Andrei Chikatilo, have attained something akin to mythical status in the annals of history’s most notorious murderers. Whether through a filter of fictionalization, where man-eating deviants are transformed into powerful antiheroes, or through tabloids sensationalizing the crimes of real-life cannibals, these tales feed our obsession with all things gruesome—an obsession that is now an acceptable facet of our society.A different attitude was taken toward “primitive” social or ethnic groups whose members might not have shared the Western take on cannibalism taboos. At best, these “savages” were pegged as souls to be saved, but only if they met certain requirements. In the first half of the 20th century, for example, explorers and the missionaries who followed them ventured into the foreboding New Guinea highlands and quickly imposed one hard-and-fast rule for the locals: Cannibalism in any form was strictly forbidden.But far worse instances of cultural intrusion occurred elsewhere and throughout history, as those accused of consuming other humans, for any reason, were brutalized, enslaved, and murdered. The most infamous example of this practice began during the last years of the 15th century when millions of indigenous people living in the Caribbean and Mexico were summarily reclassified as cannibals for reasons that had little to do with people-eating. Instead, it paved the way for them to be robbed, beaten, conquered, and slain, all at the whim of their new Spanish masters.Similar atrocities were carried out on a massive scale by a succession of flag-planting European powers who (if one believes their accounts) wrested South America, Africa, and the Indo-Pacific away from man-eating savages, whose behavior placed them beyond the pale of anything that could remotely be described as human.So were European fears about cannibalism simply an invention used to justify conquest, or were there cultures, including those encountered by the Spaniards, where the consumption of humans was regarded as normal behavior? Although defining someone as a cannibal became an effective way to dehumanize them, there is also evidence that ritual cannibalism, as embodied in various customs related to funerary rites and warfare, occurred throughout history.As I began studying these forms of cannibalism, I sought to determine not only their perceived functions, but just how widespread they were or weren’t. Surprisingly—or perhaps not surprisingly given the subject matter—there is disagreement among anthropologists regarding ritual cannibalism. Some deny that it ever occurred, while others claim that the behavior did occur but was uncommon. Still others claim that cannibalism was practiced by many cultures throughout history and for a variety of reasons. One such body of evidence led me straight back to European history, where I learned that a particularly macabre form of cannibalism had been practiced for hundreds of years by nobility, physicians, and commoners alike, even into the 20th century.As a zoologist, I was, of course, intrigued at the prospect of documenting cases of non-human cannibalism. Looking back now, I can see that I’d started my inquiry with something less than a completely open mind. Part of me reasoned that since cannibalism was presumably a rare occurrence in humans (at least in modern times), it would likely be similarly rare in the animal kingdom.Once I dug further, though, I discovered that cannibalism differs in frequency between major animal groups—nonexistent in some and common in others. It varies from species to species and even within the same species, depending on local environmental conditions. Cannibalism also serves a variety of functions, depending on the cannibal. There are even examples in which an individual being cannibalized receives a benefit.In several instances, cannibalism appears to have arisen only recently in a species, and human activity might be the cause. In one such case, news reports informed horrified audiences that some of the most highly recognizable animals on the planet were suddenly consuming their own young. “Polar bears resort to cannibalism as Arctic ice shrinks,” reported CNN, while the Times of London echoed the sentiment: “Climate Change Forcing Polar Bears to Become Cannibals.” It was Reuters, though, that scored a perfect ten on the gruesome scale with an online slide show in which an adult polar bear was seen carrying around the still cute-as-a button head of a dead cub, the remains of its spinal cord trailing behind like a red streamer.The real story behind polar bear [contextualized in book...] cannibalism turned out to be just as fascinating, though it would also serve as a perfect example of how many accusations of and stories about cannibalism throughout history were untrue, unproven, or exaggerated—distorted by sensationalism, deception, a lack of scientific knowledge, and just plain bad writing. With the passage of time, these accounts too often become part of the historical record, their errors long forgotten. Part of my job would be to expose those errors.I was also extremely curious to see if the origin of cannibalism taboos could be traced back to the natural world, so I developed a pair of alternative hypotheses. Perhaps our aversion to consuming our own kind is hardwired into our brains and as such is a part of our genetic blueprint—a gene or two whose expression selects against such behavior. I reasoned that if such a built-in deterrent exists, then humans and most non-humans (with the exception of a few well-known anomalies such as black widow spiders and praying mantises) would avoid cannibalism at all costs. Thus, the taboo would have a biological foundation.Conversely, I weighed the possibility that the revulsion most people have at the very mention of cannibalism might stem solely from our culture. Of course, this led to even more questions. What are the cultural roots of the cannibalism taboo and how has it become so widespread? I also wondered why, as disgusted as we are at the very thought of cannibalism, we’re so utterly fascinated by it? Might cannibalism have been more common in our ancestors, before societal rules turned it into something abhorrent? I looked for evidence in the fossil record and elsewhere.Finally, I considered what it would take to break down the biological or cultural constraints that prevent us from eating each other on a regular basis. Could there come a time, in our not-so-distant future, when human cannibalism becomes commonplace? And for that matter, was it already becoming a more frequent occurrence? The answers to these questions are far from certain but, then again, there is much about the topic of cannibalism that cannot be neatly divided into black and white. Likely or not, though, the circumstances that might lead to outbreaks of widespread cannibalism in the 21st century are grounded in science, not science fiction.My aim was to stay away from the clichéd ideas about cannibalism that are already ingrained in our collective psyche and, with such a wealth of relevant material to explore, I quickly realized that this wouldn’t be difficult. Even the most famous cannibal stories, it turned out, had factual gaps that are only now being filled. In the case of the Donner Party, for example, I joined researchers whose scientific approach to the most infamous cannibalism-related event in American history had shed new light on this 19th-century tale of stranded pioneers.I’ve tried to approach each example from a scientific viewpoint, delving into what I considered the most intriguing aspects of anthropology, evolution, and biology to provide the broadest yet most engaging natural history of this behavior. What happens to our bodies and minds under starvation conditions? Why are women better equipped to survive starvation than men? And what physiological extremes would compel someone to consume the body of a friend or even a family member?But it’s not just the abundance of eggs and young that makes fish such a popular menu item for members of their own species. Many terrestrial vertebrates produce few or even a single offspring, and most of these newly born or newly hatched individuals already exhibit considerable body size. In many fish species, the extraordinary number of eggs produced imposes a limit on their size, and so a full-grown cod might be a million times (or six orders of magnitude) larger than its own eggs. This fact goes a long way to explain why the majority of them exhibit about as much individual recognition of their offspring as humans do for a handful of raisins. Fish eggs, larvae, and fry (i.e., young fish) are vast in number, minute in size, and high in nutritional value. This makes them an abundant, nonthreatening, and easily collected food source. It’s also why ichthyologists consider the absence of cannibalism in fishes, rather than its presence, to be the exceptional case."

I believed this book would focus more on canabalism in the animal world and then BRIEFLY connect this to human cannibalism. It didnt happen this way. I was so fascinated by the instances of cannabilism in the animal world and, surprisingly, the sections I read on human cannibalism were dull. This could have been due to it focusing mostly on references to cannibalism in early literature and focusing so heavily on the story of the Donner's. I lost interest at this point and just never picked it back up. Cool words I learned:Conspecific AdelphophagyDermatophagyAnthropophagyAnthropophagus phobiaOophagyTheophagy Placentophagy Apophallation which is the biting off of a penis (exhibited in terrestrial slugs)."

There are no sensationalized accounts of cannabalism through serial killers or the like. It was well written and easy to understand. I found the incidences of humans more interesting than the insects or animals. My two favorite sections were about the Donnor Party and the placenta. Props to the author for doing what he did for the research! That is some first hand knowledge there! I am not sure how much of this information I will be able to retain, but it was an informative and entertaining read. "
189,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6609117-eustacia-tan,4,"I started this book before a 1am flight because, I don't know, I subconsciously never want to eat or sleep again (just joking. I did both the whole day).Cannibalism is a history and an explanation of the act. But don't worry, the author doesn't start with the stomach churning human eating human stuff right away. He starts with the 'lighter' stuff - cannibalism by non-humans.The book starts by defining the various types of cannibalism - of which I remember two: eating your family members and eating people of your species who aren't related to you. Then it gets defined even further, to things like filial cannibalism (parents eating children or vice versa), cannibalism during mating (turns out the Black Widow Spider has been maligned.After going through all these decidedly non-humans, the author slowly makes his way back to us.If I were to generalise, I'd say that the book says that cannibalism tends to be a response to specific conditions (overcrowding, lack of nutrition, etc). Although in humans, there are ritual cannibals. Oh, and grey areas like breastfeeding (if skin cells come off) and I can't remember what else. (For the record, I am in no way justifying cannibalism in the whole 'eat literal human flesh' form)Although I was really surprised about the fact that ritual cannibalism existed in Chinese culture, especially as an act of filial piety. Then I remembered stories about sons cutting their thighs to feed their parents (though I can't remember from where) and I realised that IS cannibalism "
190,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34493714-yasaman,3,"An interesting read. Schutt's overall take on cannibalism - especially in non-human species - is that it essentially occurs either as a mechanism for passing on genetic information to the next generation, or to ensure your and/or your offspring's survival and conservation of energy, which again goes back to making sure genetic information is passed on. So, from an evolutionary standpoint, it makes perfect sense, especially considering that most species do not rely on behaviors/methods such as altruism and Kin selection for their fitness rates. When the topic is discussed in regards to humans, there is also ritualistic and medicinal cannibalism to consider, which Schutt explains is a lot more common than expected. What I liked about Schutt's discussion on the topic is that he shows the hypocrisy of viewpoints regarding ritualistic cannibalism based on which group of people is practicing it (i.e. indigenous people or white European Christians?). But, interestingly, it was also what I didn't like about the book in general: Firstly, Schutt oversimplifies the practice based on strict definitions (I hardly think biting fingernails and eating organs such as liver should fall under the same category,) and, secondly, he doesn't seem overly concerned about explaining that just because something is a cultural influence and seemingly widespread, it doesn't make it any less wrong to do."
191,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6314574-allisonlcarter,3,"While starting in the animal kingdom seems a logical place to start a conversation about cannibalism, this book gets bogged down in the world of weird sex snails and spiders for far too long. What makes cannibalism of such enduring interest is that it's fundamentally a question of whether it is moral to eat a human body under any circumstances. Since morality is, in most cases, relative, this is an endlessly fascinating question for homo sapiens and varies widely from culture to culture. Since animals do not have ethical frameworks that we are aware of, knowing that this invertebrate or that eats each other is less interesting, except in the broadest way.When Schutt does get to human consumption, he mostly covers familiar ground -- the Donner Party, Papua New Guinea, etc. The book shines in a few chapters that skirt the issue of why cannibalism is taboo in Western culture and examines the practice in China. The book is capped off with a long exploration of mad cow disease, which, since the cows didn't choose to engage in cannibalism or derive an evolutionary advantage from it, seems out of place.Still, the book is immaculately researched and Schutt has an amusingly wry sense of humor."
192,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63058444-joshua,5,"The following review will contain no references and/or bad puns of Hannibal Lecter. I'm just putting that out there now because the only really interesting Cannibal was Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The dude wore ties to work. That's class.The taboo of cannibalism is exactly what lead me to this book. Working in a library I regularly stock the ""New Books"" section and everyday I saw the book with it's distinct cover. Curiosity got the better of me and I checked the book out and read it in a week. The reader may not think themselves terribly interested in the idea of reading about the history and practice of cannibalism as an act, but they're missing out because there's also loads of biology.Schutt manages to write an easy, approachable book about an act that many people would rather not discuss, but as he points out in his introduction the fact that nobody wants to talk about is reason enough to discuss it. Schutt approaches the book at the start as a biologist, a zoologist to be specific, and just tries to understand biologically why cannibalism takes place in the wild in natural conditions. Once this is done he tackles the human element and it's here that the reader will be able to see that the issue becomes complicated. I won't lie, there are some elements of this book hat can be troubling (the eating of kids during the siege of Stalingrad just about broke me), but this book was approachable and enjoyable to read. It was only in the last three chapters that the writing began to grow a little tiresome, but even in these closing pages the book still felt strong and by it's end I felt as if I had really learned something about the natural world while also being warned about the possible future.Cannibalism isn't a fun topic unless it involves Anthony Hopkins (damn I broke my first rule) but it is an important topic and Schott succeeds in demonstrating that, yes, it does deserve an entire book to itself."

But I thought this one sounded interesting, and it turns out I really loved it! Bill Schutt has a great style that alternates between clear, concise explanations of biological concepts, overviews of research fields and more personal narratives and interviews he had with other scientists. To be clear, this is emphatically not a book about cannibal crimes (in fact, the author devotes only a few paragraphs to such murderers, and states that he both feels that fields has been covered more than enough, and that he doesn't want to be disrespectful towards victims and their families). What it is, is a journey through cannibalism as a biological and social mechanism, starting from examples of various animals and the research done on different species, before moving on to an investigation whether those same mechanisms come into play for humans and how different human cultures have viewed cannibalism throughout history. I actually feel like I've learned a lot about topics I didn't know much about, and had good time while acquiring that knowledge - a perfect combination!"
194,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24590339-k-willows,4,"This is informative & well rounded, but leans heavily on the side of serious science writing (as opposed to more casual/humorous science writing). It does have its bits of humor but overall this is a book I'd recommend to science minded people interested in learning more about the cultural taboo of cannibalism. I felt that the final 3 chapters could have been condensed down. I would have liked to read more about the Aghori of India but they were surprisingly unmentioned. Finally, for true crime nerds, this book does not go into depth regarding the cannibalistic killers, but I felt the author had good reason for avoiding that subject and the sensationalism that comes with it."
195,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46502154-anna,4,"Obviously, it's not for everyone but as someone who's been interested in cannibalism for a very long time (don't ask me why) I found it both interesting and informative. It's certainly the best and the most scientific book I've read on the subject so far. I was a bit worried that my English might fail me because the author is a biologist but luckily I had no problems understanding what he was talking about. What I liked the most was that Bill Schutt covered a very wide range of types of cannibalism and - unlike many other authors - didn't focus on serial killers/psychopaths (they are mentioned at the beginning so it might be a disappointment to those readers who were hoping for more) and sensational stories about tribes consuming human flesh like it's tacos. As an avid fan of animal documentaries I was the most interested in the first part of the book (even though I knew many of the facts Schutt talked about) and I was slightly bored towards the end when he focused on diseases (ones rumoured to be transmitted through infected human meat). But I honestly appreciate how thorough and detailed the research was."

The books take a more scientific and anthropological look at cannibalism. There is only a small amount of coverage of human cannibalism. Much more is on the animal kingdom. I found this super interesting and I definitely recommend it to those of you interested in science, anthropology and history. **ARC provided through Netgalley**"

198,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1702050-fox,5,"I've been eagerly awaiting this book since I first became aware of its release, which was likely due to Daphne's review. Cannibalism is an undeniably fascinating subject, and  Bill Schutt tackles it with grace and humor, as long for a disdain for the sensationalism that has too long colored all publications on the topic. The book was fascinating from cover to cover, and is extremely well-organized. It begins with the study of it in the animal kingdom, and ends with the much needed topic of prion diseases, their spread, and how poorly understood they are. Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History is destined to become the go-to book on the topic. Well sourced, entertainingly written, and scattered throughout with just enough humor and a large dose of respect, it does its topic justice.  Bill Schutt writes with a deft hand that does much to dispel many of the sensationalized myths that surround some of the better known cases (i.e. Donner Party, Praying Mantises, Black Widows, etc.) and does a good job explaining topics that have never really gotten enough focus (i.e. prion diseases, kuru) or have suffered from the wrong type of focus.This book was immensely readable, and more in depth and well-sourced than I expected a pop-science book to be. It definitely opened my eyes to the complexity of the topic, and added to disdain I already felt towards one Jared Diamond and his tendency to over simplify nearly everything. I'm very much looking forward to more being published in regards to the Neanderthal hypotheses presented in this book, as well as for more studies being done on the truly terrifying prion diseases. Nothing terrifies me more than the section on prion diseases in this book, and what it may hold in store for our future."
199,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1424908-map,4,"I won a kindle version of this book as a Goodreads Giveaway.I've seen some reviews on here claiming that this book is dry and overly scientific, but I have to disagree. As a psychologist who got my start in animal behaviorism, I appreciated Schutt's precise and behavioral descriptions of animals as opposed to engaging in anthropomorphism. I also found him to have a very dry wit that livened up the chapters without making them unscientific.The first few chapters, focusing primarily on animals, felt less cohesive than the ones focused on humans, which seemed more clearly delineated into categories of cannibalism or specific instances. But all of it was entertaining and engaging.On the downside, as my husband lived in England between 1988-1990, I'm relatively sure he'll die of Mad Cow Disease any day now. When I mentioned this to him, his response was, ""Oh yes, I'm actually not allowed to donate blood because I lived in England during that time."" Wonderful."

It isn't a book that I would have probably picked out myself, so it was great to still learn plenty and find it interesting. It explores the topic of cannibalism in non-human animals at first, then moves on to the social taboos in most cultures around the practice. It takes a skeptical approach to the claims of cannibalism in any culture and looks for actual hard evidence of it, instead of just second hand claims and anecdotal claims. It also explores the potential causes and ramifications of cannibalism in an interesting and engaging way."

Schutt makes a point of avoiding the sensational, but that doesn't prevent his book from being fascinating and engrossing.

203,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8071101-jeanne,2,"I found this book a difficult read. It read more like a science proof paper than general interest book.

205,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49782194-conor-ahern,4,"There are very few things I find myself getting squeamish about, but cannibalism is one of them. It's not so much the Donner-Party, necessity-of-survival type cannibalism that bothers me, either--hunger knows no morality and forces normal people to do things that they might ordinarily find horrific. It's more of the victim-of-cannibalization type that makes me shudder. I suppose on some fundamental level, I believe that it's wrong for humans to be used as means to an end, and succumbing by way of cannibalization seems to be the ultimate example of that; your life and your body reduced to the fulfillment of some fetish that by its very nature assigns you no greater value than a head of cattle. These were probably the hardest parts of this book for me. Stories of cannibalism in the animal kingdom and its evolutionary advantages were much more interesting than unsettling. This book got me thinking of other taboos, things that are so ingrained that logic alone can't account for the aversion. The only others that came to mind were incest and pedophilia, but at least by degree those things operate in contemporary societies as norms, and certainly have done so to a greater extent in the past. But it's not like the British or the Yoruba have a tradition of eating, say, an arm but would draw the line there; unlike with the other two types of taboos I mentioned, cannibalism seems much more to be an all-or-nothing type of convention. While societies all over the world permit relationships that we might regard as incestuous or pedophilic, it seems that societies that countenance what we would describe as cannibalism are few and far between. And I guess it's Schutt's goal to show that this is more of a Western taboo, which is interesting. He points to our Greek and Shakespearean cautionary tales as powerfully inculcating the supposed evil of cannibalism, and then looks to China for examples that, at the very least, cannibalism wasn't regarded there in such black-and-white terms, citing Imperial delicacies including human flesh and conventions whereby parents would trade children with other families during times of hunger so as to avoid having to consume their own children. China is a big place with a lot of people and a ton of recorded history, though, so you're bound to come across anything sooner or later, right?I think the interesting thing for me has been that I gave it a fair shot but in the end I simply can't get over the taboo. Much as I try, and Chinese evidence to the contrary placed before me, I cannot get past the idea that it's wrong, with nothing more articulate than that to say about it! Oh well, I'm only human. This book was often funny and takes a light touch. Very worth chewing over, if you can stomach it!"
206,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/616321-juushika,3,"This is a decent overview of the history and biology of cannibalism. The zoological studies are diverse and broad, and make effective arguments about the causes and therefore evolutionary benefits of cannibalism. It lines up nicely with the human studies which investigate these same causes, particularly privation. The issue of evolutionary benefit for humans is of course more complicated, and Schutt takes a variety of approaches, looking at cannibalism both as an act and as a social concept, and this latter--particular the role of (accusations of) cannibalism in justifications for genocide--gives the book depth.But I have too many unanswered questions: What are the ethics of murder versus eating the already-dead versus cannibalism as a social taboo--how does sapience factor into the erstwhile benefits of survival cannibalism? What is it that makes the taboo of cannibalism compelling in the public consciousness, and how does this intersect with cases of criminal cannibalism? I respect the decision to avoid sensationalism and over-reported criminal cases, but the lack here is conspicuous; meanwhile, using Freud to discuss taboo is cliché and, frankly, problematic. What is the cost/benefit for the evolutionary benefits versus health risks of cannibalism; where's the tipping point in that equation and what protective measures exist? Many of these answers exist by implication, and most of them are ""it's complicated,"" but I wish Schutt were bolder & reached further. The only bold conclusion he draws is a warning about the intersection of desensitization and survival cannibalism in near-future disaster situations--a lazy argument that directly conflicts the desensitized genocidal/cannibalistic human past. (All cultures are desensitized in their own special way.) I liked this well enough, the breadth of it is interesting, the science accessible; Schutt's humor conflicts sometimes with the deceptive gravity of his topic, but it makes for a readable text. But I wanted more, more depth, more asked but unanswerable questions, and that's not present here."
207,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5790437-aj-sterkel,4,"Likes: This book gave me nightmares about dying from mad cow disease. Nightmares probably don’t sound like a good thing, but if I’m thinking about a book in my sleep, it must be doing something right. Mad cow disease is especially terrifying because the British government tried to suppress info about it to protect the beef industry. Yeah . . . we’re all screwed.Anyway, I appreciate that the author looks at cannibalism from a scientific point-of-view instead of a sensationalist point-of-view. He avoids most of the serial killer talk and focuses on nature. Which animals are cannibals and why? If it’s common for animals to eat their friends, why is it rare for modern humans to do the same? Where did the taboo against cannibalism come from? (Hint: Christianity and authors with over-active imaginations.)I enjoyed most of the chapters in this book. The writing style is funnier than I expected. My favorite chapters are the ones about Christopher Columbus. I knew about the damage he did to the places he “explored,” but I didn’t know his connection to cannibalism. Queen Isabella decided that only New World cannibals could be enslaved. Selling slaves was big business, so Columbus and his followers slapped the cannibal label on pretty much everybody. I love that the author examines the history of cannibalism and how our (often irrational) fears of it have shaped the modern world. It’s a unique approach to the subject.“[T]he idea of cannibalism had become a handy symbol for unacceptable behavior practiced by “Others”—a broad and malleable category of evildoers that included enemies, followers of non-Christian religions, and any groups determined to retain their “uncivilized” customs.” – CannibalismDislikes: Since there are frogs on the cover, I expected to learn more about animal cannibalism. The first few chapters are about animals, but then the focus shifts to humans and mostly stays on humans. I wanted more animals.The author is clearly a scientist. I am definitely not a scientist. For me, the writing is too dry and sciencey (totally a real word) at times. The author goes into too much detail about a few subjects—such as kuru, a disease that humans get from eating their families. The science behind Kuru takes up so many pages that I got bored with it. The Bottom Line: One of the most educational books I’ve read this year. If you’re interested in learning about cannibalism, I recommend it. (Just prepare yourself for mad cow nightmares.)Do you like reviews, giveaways, and bookish nonsense? Good news! I have a blog for that. "

I don't know who Bill Schutt is, but man does he know how to take a pretty morbid and kind of yucky topic and turn it into something palatable. SEE WHAT I DID?Bill Schutt examines cannibalism in this world, be it in the animal kingdom, in cultural practice, or survival situations. He talks about all kinds of cannibals, from tadpoles to the Donner Party to Papua New Guinea, and puts them into a scientific and cultural context. Usually with some pretty funny anecdotes or quips to go along with it. While the sociological examinations were a bit easier for me to swallow than the scientific explanations, I quite enjoyed CANNIBALISM: A PERFECTLY NATURAL HISTORY. Schutt did a very good job of making all of these sometimes yucky and always fascinating realities very easy to understand, and didn't try to sensationalize anything around the practice of cannibalism. He also did some really interesting chapters about Mad Cow Disease and modern farming practices, which is just another example of 'progress' coming back and biting us on the butt. True, sometimes it's not for the squeamish, but Schutt delivers all this information with charm and aplomb (and even details his experience eating placenta, given to him by some enthusiastic parents). Super interesting and kind of gross too, CANNIBALISM: A PERFECTLY NATURAL HISTORY is a book I'm glad I picked up. "
209,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"This is an interesting little book. Schutt begins with detailing the frequently fascinating ways that cannibalism occurs in the natural world, and then he moves on to the history of cannibalism among the human animals. People have been eating people for a long time. When a city is under siege, or people find themselves adrift at sea without food for weeks... human beings are going to start looking increasingly delicious despite the taboos (see: Kramer in Newman's imagination in that episode of Seinfeld where he accidentally cooks himself with butter). Shutt also explores cultures where that taboo doesn't exist, and where people eat people ritualistically or simply because they taste delicious (the flavor of humans, if you were wondering, gets compared by various people to tuna, pork, and veal).And if we think the Western world is too civilized for Cannibalism, Schutt reminds us that Europeans were eating mummia (ground up Egyptian mummies, or counterfeit ground up mummies) for medicinal reasons right through the end of the Victorian age, and that the practice of placenta eating has actually been growing in recent years."
210,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"Really enjoyable read! Remember all of those awesome studies from animal behavior class, like the ones that demonstrated how many animals avoid having sex with their father, mother, sister, or brother -- chemicals inside their noses and brains help them identify ""self"" and ""non-self"", instructing them not to have sex with anything too similar to ""self"" -- or the studies that demonstrated how sexual selection could spell death for sexy males -- female fish preferred the most orange males, which drove selection toward fish so orange, they were easily spotted and gobbled up by predators -- or the other studies that outlined the many shocking behaviors and likely motivations of various animals? Well, this book is chock full of those types of studies, only they are geared solely at understanding why animals might or might not eat each other instead of why they might or might not mate with each other. Here is a sampling of the intensely interesting things you will find in well researched chapters. Black Widows:Contrary to the well held belief that female Black Widows spiders and female Preying Mantis devour their males when mating, these cannibalistic behaviors are reserved for times of great stress, such as when there is a food shortage or these animals are in captivity. Since they had only been studied in captivity, researchers were only privy to the behaviors associated with that stressor. If the Black Widow had been observed in natural conditions, when food supplies were sufficient, she would have never gotten the name ""Black Widow"". In truth, females spiders are far more often the victims of cannibalism than the perpetrators. In at least one species of spider, the females do a dance to make the males notice them and choose them to mate with. Instead of having sex, as the female intended, she made herself noticed and became a tasty treat for a male spider who, with the energy gained from eating her, moved on to court another female spider who he did choose to mate with. When times are really lean, there is a spider species who eats its own limbs! Spiders and Praying Mantis are not the only animals who do not usually practice cannibalism but turn to that behavior when they are exposed to stressful or unusual conditions. Cats, mice, rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits are all driven to cannibalism when facing similar conditions, but the hamster seems to be more prone to cannibalism than most species. If hamster siblings are kept in the same cage, they will often fight to the death at 4 weeks old, when they reach sexual maturity. The winner will eat the carcass of the loser. Though the behavior is common to many mothers, mother hamsters engage far more often in eating their young when the mother herself is handled close to the time when she gives birth or when her babies are handled when they are little. Apes:Cannibalism is generally rarer in ape species, including humans. However, when they engage in the practice, they are like other animals in that it is usually in times of stress, but not always. There have been serial killers who seem to enjoy eating their victims. There even seem to a pair of mother daughter serial killer chimpanzees, named Passion and Pom, who ate between 5 and 10 infants after attacking the new mothers. It seems it was all in an effort to obtain food. So, perhaps Passion and Pom's actions are not as unexplainable as Jeffery Dahmer's. Carnassial Dentation:The shape of teeth can tell us a lot about the evolution of various species. Schutt discussed the evolution of polar bear teeth to talk in general about how teeth, such as carnassial teeth, help meat eating species rip chunks of meet off their prey. Even though I have read a fair amount about this subject, I wasn't bored at all. In fact, I thought it was one of the better discussions on teeth and evolution. If you enjoy reading about ripping pieces of meat into smaller pieces, in order to aid digestion, I suggest you read, I Contain Multitudes as well. The author of that book, Ed Yong, gave a good bit of detail about gut microbes-- where they are placed in the gut, in front or behind -- so that the animals and the microbes both enjoy a wonderful meal. Yong discussed the types of microbes needed for a meat eating diet vs. a vegetable diet. I could not stop thinking about what Yong wrote when reading this section of Schutt's Cannibalism book. Schutt also used the polar bear section to satisfyingly discuss climate change and the stupidity of the media. Definitely worth reading. Hyenas and infanticide:Who doesn't love to eat babies? It seems that most animals who eat meat, love to eat the babies most. This seems to hold true whether it is a different species or a different species from the animal doing the eating. Chimps patrol their borders and when they encounter a female and her baby, they kill the baby and try to hook up with the female. Nothing says love like murdering her offspring. Chimps are not alone. Males from many different animal species eat babies in order to push females into estrus, so they can mate with them. One female species has evolved a protection against infanticide, and as a result is a dominant member of their clan-- the hyena. To really understand the magic of female hyena biology, it's important to understand sexual development in embryos. Embryos are genderless but have precursors to mammary glands and penises. If an embryo gets an XY chromosome the penis bud will grow, but the memory glands will not. . If the embryo receives XX, the embryo will still grow the penis bud but then get the signal to stop the growth when it is very small, leaving behind a clitoris instead of a large penis. The XX will also send a signal to grow the mammary glands. Males have nipples but cannot feed a baby. This is because they do not have XX, which makes mammary glands that allows milk to flow through the nipples. XY and XX chromosomes use hormones to signal which morphology a body should have. The XY chromosome contains testosterone, which signals the penis bud to grow into a penis . The XX chromosome contains estrogen, which is what signals the growth of mammary glands.In spotted hyenas, researchers believe a mutation developed to provide the female spotted hyena with more testosterone, resulting in a signal to grow the penis bud out more. Thus, female hyenas have a very large clitoris (elongated penis bud). Their vulva is fused shut, allowing them to pee through their clitoris/penis bud, just like a male pees through their penis. When a male wants to have sex with a female, she really has to be receptive, just as a male would have to be receptive to have sex. This is because it's actually like inserting a penis into a penis, making it virtually impossible to force a female to have sex. While evolution did them a favor in not allowing them to be raped by males, it was unkind to them in regards to birthing offspring (I am so glad that I am not a female hyena!). The cub has to come out somewhere and unfortunately it rips the vulva. That was painful to even read about. I do have to say though, this was absolutely the best discussion on hyena biology of any book I have read so far. The rest of the book:The last part of the book veered away from animal behavior and examined the more sociological aspects of cannibalism-- where the word originated, how it appeared in literature throughout the ages, and what our current conception of cannibalism is. Those aspects went on a little too long for my taste, but I can imagine other people enjoying those sections. "
211,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,4,"What an unexpectedly decent read. Unlike many others fascinated by this topic and other types of violence so prevalent on screen, I'm pretty chicken and would like to steer clear from those. Yet an article on National Geographic persuaded me to pick it up since the book seems a lot more scientific and less sensational. And I love reading about animals, and so was hoping for some light entertainment and instead got pretty educated. Writing in a conversational tone, yet packed with a lot of knowledge and terminologies that it's first time since ever that I have to repeatedly look words up, Schutt casually discusses cannibalism in the animal kingdom then gradually move to more difficult and gory scenes in human society. His presentation of China, admittedly, still hasn't convinced me, it feels like his research in China both ancient and modern time isn't rigorous enough. Yet it motivates me to read a book currently on my reading shelf about the Great Leap Forward.The book doesn't stop with cannibalism and definitely isn't a simple ""objective"" piece of writing describing the phenomenon. Schutt inserts his argument on religion, colonialism, on climate change, on modern obsession with violence, on the government and the economy. He talks bluntly about unsolved issue in the study of some infectious disease. All in all, the book leaves me with goose bumps, some fear, certainly aroused neocortex.And fun fact, now I really know the origin of ""Soylent"", my favorite meal replacement these days. What an ironic naming."
212,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3123067-elizabeth-a,4,"Book blurb: Eating one’s own kind is completely natural behavior in thousands of species, including humans. Throughout history we have engaged in cannibalism for reasons of famine, burial rites, and medicinal remedies; it’s been used as a way to terrorize and even a way to show filial piety. Today, the subject of humans consuming one another has been relegated to the realm of horror movies, fiction, and the occasional psychopath, but be forewarned: As climate change progresses and humans see more famine, disease, and overcrowding, biological and cultural constraints may well disappear. I listened to the audiobook which was well narrated by Tom Perkins.One of my fave questions to ask at parties (I kid you not): Say you are starving and your survival is at stake. Do you feel differently about eating a person who is already dead, as opposed to killing someone to eat? Try it at your next gathering and report back.This book hits my sweet spot on so many levels. Most people tend to be really squeamish about the topic, but if you're not a vegetarian, what's all the fuss about? Who decided that we can eat some animals and not others? Besides, if you think that cannibalism is awful, you might want to put it in perspective. Considering the horrid historical accounts of human behavior, eating your fellow Sapiens doesn't really seem all that bad.This is a fun, informative, and eye opening book, and I learned so many things about the animal kingdom I had no idea about. I'll bet school would be much more interesting if some of these topics were incorporated into the curriculum. I could talk about some of the specifics, but then that'd spoil all the fun for you. I assure you that it's full of fascinating and juicy tidbits. The author stays away from sensational crime stories, so if you are looking for recipes, look elsewhere, but if you are willing to have ""no way!"" moments, and are willing to annoy your loved ones by constantly saying ""did you know?"", move this up your TBR.This will end up on my best of 2017 reads, and the only reason I docked a star is due to the fact that there are sections, like the final chapters, where the author gets side tracked and wanders off topic."
213,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3078602-peacegal,4,"Fans of Mary Roach's popular science books will devour CANNIBALISM, a tour of the taboo topic throughout the natural world and human history. From Tyrannosaurus rex to the Donner Party, from tadpoles who eat their siblings to American uberbreeders who dine on placenta, readers will at turns be entertained, saddened, and disgusted by the facts within--but they will always be educated. There is one point on which I'd like to add something to the text on chicken cannibalism within factory farm conditions. The author writes that pecking deaths became a widespread concern when intensive chicken farming first took hold in the 1940s. Thus, the chicken industry developed the practice of debeaking, in which the end of each chick's beak is cut or seared off to hobble them from aggressively pecking one another. The author writes that chicken ""blinder"" masks were invented in the 40s as a supposedly more humane alternative, and words it in such a way that these masks have replaced debeaking in the poultry industry today. Erm, no. While blinders are occasionally used, most notably in the intensive rearing of pheasants for release-and-shoot canned hunts, debeaking remains the rule of the day for billions of hens raised for meat and egg production. (The sheer amount of birds raised coupled with the rapidity with which beaks can be cut or seared ensures this.) Not to say that blinder masks are such a pleasant alternative. They are frequently affixed by shoving a bar through the animal's nostrils. "

Looks like that 1% of the total population could have cannibalistic tendencies but on disasters time, everybody becomes one. "
216,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,5,"Bill Schutt is a writer I really appreciate and enjoy. I read Dark Banquet a few years ago and loved it. He is for me sort of the Neil DeGrasse tyson of biology/animal behavior (human animals included). He is a wonderful storyteller and the structures of his books are clear and accessible and well-organized but also scientifically and sociologically and culturally incisive, and meandering in nice ways. He takes on a specific topic and stays with it in his way, but at the same time, explores it from many angles. He is curious and his interest and curiosity are evident in his writing. He clearly relishes exploring ideas, behaviors and histories and does not look away from the absurdity and violence of human cultures. In this book, in addition to providing insight into various and common cannibalistic behaviors throughout the animal kingdom, he interrogates human cultural and ideological relationships to cannibalism. He asks the question: are our monotheistic western cultures' ideas about and fear and hatred of cannibalism of a genetic origin in any way, or purely cultural. He talks of the devastating irony--how Europeans used the idea of the inherent evil of cannibalism to justify the brutal massacre of unnumbered non-European peoples who may or may not have engaged in cannibalistic rituals. I love the illustrations in the book. I love how Schutt takes myths and legends about certain animals acts or habits of cannibalism and offers a much more complex and nuanced picture. He puts some myths to rest. He offers many fascinating particulars in their places, including stories of physiological changes (epigenetic?) in certain aquatic and semiaquatic (and maybe other? can't recall) animals who engage in filial cannibalism. Also, there's a fantastic section about some messy, dart-throwing gastropods. Clearly, I am a fan of the book and recommend it highly.here's a quote from intro:Is it really a surprise, though, that our greatest cinematic villain is a man-eating psychiatrist while the mild-mannered runner-up is based on a real-life cannibal killer? Perhaps not, if one considers that many cultures share the belief that consuming another human is the worst (or close to the worst) behavior that a person can undertake. As a result, real-life cannibalistic psychopaths like Jeffrey Dahmer (another Wisconsin native) and his Russian counterpart, Andrei Chikatilo, have attained something akin to mythical status in the annals of history’s most notorious murderers. Whether through a filter of fictionalization, where man-eating deviants are transformed into powerful antiheroes, or through tabloids sensationalizing the crimes of real-life cannibals, these tales feed our obsession with all things gruesome—an obsession that is now an acceptable facet of our society.A different attitude was taken toward “primitive” social or ethnic groups whose members might not have shared the Western take on cannibalism taboos. At best, these “savages” were pegged as souls to be saved, but only if they met certain requirements. In the first half of the 20th century, for example, explorers and the missionaries who followed them ventured into the foreboding New Guinea highlands and quickly imposed one hard-and-fast rule for the locals: Cannibalism in any form was strictly forbidden.But far worse instances of cultural intrusion occurred elsewhere and throughout history, as those accused of consuming other humans, for any reason, were brutalized, enslaved, and murdered. The most infamous example of this practice began during the last years of the 15th century when millions of indigenous people living in the Caribbean and Mexico were summarily reclassified as cannibals for reasons that had little to do with people-eating. Instead, it paved the way for them to be robbed, beaten, conquered, and slain, all at the whim of their new Spanish masters.Similar atrocities were carried out on a massive scale by a succession of flag-planting European powers who (if one believes their accounts) wrested South America, Africa, and the Indo-Pacific away from man-eating savages, whose behavior placed them beyond the pale of anything that could remotely be described as human.So were European fears about cannibalism simply an invention used to justify conquest, or were there cultures, including those encountered by the Spaniards, where the consumption of humans was regarded as normal behavior? Although defining someone as a cannibal became an effective way to dehumanize them, there is also evidence that ritual cannibalism, as embodied in various customs related to funerary rites and warfare, occurred throughout history.As I began studying these forms of cannibalism, I sought to determine not only their perceived functions, but just how widespread they were or weren’t. Surprisingly—or perhaps not surprisingly given the subject matter—there is disagreement among anthropologists regarding ritual cannibalism. Some deny that it ever occurred, while others claim that the behavior did occur but was uncommon. Still others claim that cannibalism was practiced by many cultures throughout history and for a variety of reasons. One such body of evidence led me straight back to European history, where I learned that a particularly macabre form of cannibalism had been practiced for hundreds of years by nobility, physicians, and commoners alike, even into the 20th century.As a zoologist, I was, of course, intrigued at the prospect of documenting cases of non-human cannibalism. Looking back now, I can see that I’d started my inquiry with something less than a completely open mind. Part of me reasoned that since cannibalism was presumably a rare occurrence in humans (at least in modern times), it would likely be similarly rare in the animal kingdom.Once I dug further, though, I discovered that cannibalism differs in frequency between major animal groups—nonexistent in some and common in others. It varies from species to species and even within the same species, depending on local environmental conditions. Cannibalism also serves a variety of functions, depending on the cannibal. There are even examples in which an individual being cannibalized receives a benefit.In several instances, cannibalism appears to have arisen only recently in a species, and human activity might be the cause. In one such case, news reports informed horrified audiences that some of the most highly recognizable animals on the planet were suddenly consuming their own young. “Polar bears resort to cannibalism as Arctic ice shrinks,” reported CNN, while the Times of London echoed the sentiment: “Climate Change Forcing Polar Bears to Become Cannibals.” It was Reuters, though, that scored a perfect ten on the gruesome scale with an online slide show in which an adult polar bear was seen carrying around the still cute-as-a button head of a dead cub, the remains of its spinal cord trailing behind like a red streamer.The real story behind polar bear [contextualized in book...] cannibalism turned out to be just as fascinating, though it would also serve as a perfect example of how many accusations of and stories about cannibalism throughout history were untrue, unproven, or exaggerated—distorted by sensationalism, deception, a lack of scientific knowledge, and just plain bad writing. With the passage of time, these accounts too often become part of the historical record, their errors long forgotten. Part of my job would be to expose those errors.I was also extremely curious to see if the origin of cannibalism taboos could be traced back to the natural world, so I developed a pair of alternative hypotheses. Perhaps our aversion to consuming our own kind is hardwired into our brains and as such is a part of our genetic blueprint—a gene or two whose expression selects against such behavior. I reasoned that if such a built-in deterrent exists, then humans and most non-humans (with the exception of a few well-known anomalies such as black widow spiders and praying mantises) would avoid cannibalism at all costs. Thus, the taboo would have a biological foundation.Conversely, I weighed the possibility that the revulsion most people have at the very mention of cannibalism might stem solely from our culture. Of course, this led to even more questions. What are the cultural roots of the cannibalism taboo and how has it become so widespread? I also wondered why, as disgusted as we are at the very thought of cannibalism, we’re so utterly fascinated by it? Might cannibalism have been more common in our ancestors, before societal rules turned it into something abhorrent? I looked for evidence in the fossil record and elsewhere.Finally, I considered what it would take to break down the biological or cultural constraints that prevent us from eating each other on a regular basis. Could there come a time, in our not-so-distant future, when human cannibalism becomes commonplace? And for that matter, was it already becoming a more frequent occurrence? The answers to these questions are far from certain but, then again, there is much about the topic of cannibalism that cannot be neatly divided into black and white. Likely or not, though, the circumstances that might lead to outbreaks of widespread cannibalism in the 21st century are grounded in science, not science fiction.My aim was to stay away from the clichéd ideas about cannibalism that are already ingrained in our collective psyche and, with such a wealth of relevant material to explore, I quickly realized that this wouldn’t be difficult. Even the most famous cannibal stories, it turned out, had factual gaps that are only now being filled. In the case of the Donner Party, for example, I joined researchers whose scientific approach to the most infamous cannibalism-related event in American history had shed new light on this 19th-century tale of stranded pioneers.I’ve tried to approach each example from a scientific viewpoint, delving into what I considered the most intriguing aspects of anthropology, evolution, and biology to provide the broadest yet most engaging natural history of this behavior. What happens to our bodies and minds under starvation conditions? Why are women better equipped to survive starvation than men? And what physiological extremes would compel someone to consume the body of a friend or even a family member?But it’s not just the abundance of eggs and young that makes fish such a popular menu item for members of their own species. Many terrestrial vertebrates produce few or even a single offspring, and most of these newly born or newly hatched individuals already exhibit considerable body size. In many fish species, the extraordinary number of eggs produced imposes a limit on their size, and so a full-grown cod might be a million times (or six orders of magnitude) larger than its own eggs. This fact goes a long way to explain why the majority of them exhibit about as much individual recognition of their offspring as humans do for a handful of raisins. Fish eggs, larvae, and fry (i.e., young fish) are vast in number, minute in size, and high in nutritional value. This makes them an abundant, nonthreatening, and easily collected food source. It’s also why ichthyologists consider the absence of cannibalism in fishes, rather than its presence, to be the exceptional case."

I believed this book would focus more on canabalism in the animal world and then BRIEFLY connect this to human cannibalism. It didnt happen this way. I was so fascinated by the instances of cannabilism in the animal world and, surprisingly, the sections I read on human cannibalism were dull. This could have been due to it focusing mostly on references to cannibalism in early literature and focusing so heavily on the story of the Donner's. I lost interest at this point and just never picked it back up.

I did both the whole day).Cannibalism is a history and an explanation of the act. But don't worry, the author doesn't start with the stomach churning human eating human stuff right away. He starts with the 'lighter' stuff - cannibalism by non-humans.The book starts by defining the various types of cannibalism - of which I remember two: eating your family members and eating people of your species who aren't related to you. Then it gets defined even further, to things like filial cannibalism (parents eating children or vice versa), cannibalism during mating (turns out the Black Widow Spider has been maligned.After going through all these decidedly non-humans, the author slowly makes his way back to us.If I were to generalise, I'd say that the book says that cannibalism tends to be a response to specific conditions (overcrowding, lack of nutrition, etc). Although in humans, there are ritual cannibals. Oh, and grey areas like breastfeeding (if skin cells come off) and I can't remember what else. (For the record, I am in no way justifying cannibalism in the whole 'eat literal human flesh' form)Although I was really surprised about the fact that ritual cannibalism existed in Chinese culture, especially as an act of filial piety. Then I remembered stories about sons cutting their thighs to feed their parents (though I can't remember from where) and I realised that IS cannibalism "
220,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34493714-yasaman,3,"An interesting read. Schutt's overall take on cannibalism - especially in non-human species - is that it essentially occurs either as a mechanism for passing on genetic information to the next generation, or to ensure your and/or your offspring's survival and conservation of energy, which again goes back to making sure genetic information is passed on. So, from an evolutionary standpoint, it makes perfect sense, especially considering that most species do not rely on behaviors/methods such as altruism and Kin selection for their fitness rates. When the topic is discussed in regards to humans, there is also ritualistic and medicinal cannibalism to consider, which Schutt explains is a lot more common than expected. What I liked about Schutt's discussion on the topic is that he shows the hypocrisy of viewpoints regarding ritualistic cannibalism based on which group of people is practicing it (i.e. indigenous people or white European Christians?). But, interestingly, it was also what I didn't like about the book in general: Firstly, Schutt oversimplifies the practice based on strict definitions (I hardly think biting fingernails and eating organs such as liver should fall under the same category,) and, secondly, he doesn't seem overly concerned about explaining that just because something is a cultural influence and seemingly widespread, it doesn't make it any less wrong to do."
221,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6314574-allisonlcarter,3,"While starting in the animal kingdom seems a logical place to start a conversation about cannibalism, this book gets bogged down in the world of weird sex snails and spiders for far too long. What makes cannibalism of such enduring interest is that it's fundamentally a question of whether it is moral to eat a human body under any circumstances. Since morality is, in most cases, relative, this is an endlessly fascinating question for homo sapiens and varies widely from culture to culture. Since animals do not have ethical frameworks that we are aware of, knowing that this invertebrate or that eats each other is less interesting, except in the broadest way.When Schutt does get to human consumption, he mostly covers familiar ground -- the Donner Party, Papua New Guinea, etc. The book shines in a few chapters that skirt the issue of why cannibalism is taboo in Western culture and examines the practice in China. The book is capped off with a long exploration of mad cow disease, which, since the cows didn't choose to engage in cannibalism or derive an evolutionary advantage from it, seems out of place.Still, the book is immaculately researched and Schutt has an amusingly wry sense of humor."

I'm just putting that out there now because the only really interesting Cannibal was Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The dude wore ties to work. That's class.The taboo of cannibalism is exactly what lead me to this book. Working in a library I regularly stock the ""New Books"" section and everyday I saw the book with it's distinct cover. Curiosity got the better of me and I checked the book out and read it in a week. The reader may not think themselves terribly interested in the idea of reading about the history and practice of cannibalism as an act, but they're missing out because there's also loads of biology.Schutt manages to write an easy, approachable book about an act that many people would rather not discuss, but as he points out in his introduction the fact that nobody wants to talk about is reason enough to discuss it. Schutt approaches the book at the start as a biologist, a zoologist to be specific, and just tries to understand biologically why cannibalism takes place in the wild in natural conditions. Once this is done he tackles the human element and it's here that the reader will be able to see that the issue becomes complicated. I won't lie, there are some elements of this book hat can be troubling (the eating of kids during the siege of Stalingrad just about broke me), but this book was approachable and enjoyable to read. It was only in the last three chapters that the writing began to grow a little tiresome, but even in these closing pages the book still felt strong and by it's end I felt as if I had really learned something about the natural world while also being warned about the possible future.Cannibalism isn't a fun topic unless it involves Anthony Hopkins (damn I broke my first rule) but it is an important topic and Schott succeeds in demonstrating that, yes, it does deserve an entire book to itself."

But I thought this one sounded interesting, and it turns out I really loved it! Bill Schutt has a great style that alternates between clear, concise explanations of biological concepts, overviews of research fields and more personal narratives and interviews he had with other scientists. To be clear, this is emphatically not a book about cannibal crimes (in fact, the author devotes only a few paragraphs to such murderers, and states that he both feels that fields has been covered more than enough, and that he doesn't want to be disrespectful towards victims and their families). What it is, is a journey through cannibalism as a biological and social mechanism, starting from examples of various animals and the research done on different species, before moving on to an investigation whether those same mechanisms come into play for humans and how different human cultures have viewed cannibalism throughout history. I actually feel like I've learned a lot about topics I didn't know much about, and had good time while acquiring that knowledge - a perfect combination!"
224,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24590339-k-willows,4,"This is informative & well rounded, but leans heavily on the side of serious science writing (as opposed to more casual/humorous science writing). It does have its bits of humor but overall this is a book I'd recommend to science minded people interested in learning more about the cultural taboo of cannibalism. I felt that the final 3 chapters could have been condensed down. I would have liked to read more about the Aghori of India but they were surprisingly unmentioned. Finally, for true crime nerds, this book does not go into depth regarding the cannibalistic killers, but I felt the author had good reason for avoiding that subject and the sensationalism that comes with it."
225,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46502154-anna,4,"Obviously, it's not for everyone but as someone who's been interested in cannibalism for a very long time (don't ask me why) I found it both interesting and informative. It's certainly the best and the most scientific book I've read on the subject so far. I was a bit worried that my English might fail me because the author is a biologist but luckily I had no problems understanding what he was talking about. What I liked the most was that Bill Schutt covered a very wide range of types of cannibalism and - unlike many other authors - didn't focus on serial killers/psychopaths (they are mentioned at the beginning so it might be a disappointment to those readers who were hoping for more) and sensational stories about tribes consuming human flesh like it's tacos. As an avid fan of animal documentaries I was the most interested in the first part of the book (even though I knew many of the facts Schutt talked about) and I was slightly bored towards the end when he focused on diseases (ones rumoured to be transmitted through infected human meat). But I honestly appreciate how thorough and detailed the research was."
226,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12256655-alisa,4,"I found this to be a very interesting book. I understand the subject matter isn't for everyone but it's not done is a sensational way. The books take a more scientific and anthropological look at cannibalism. There is only a small amount of coverage of human cannibalism. Much more is on the animal kingdom. I found this super interesting and I definitely recommend it to those of you interested in science, anthropology and history. **ARC provided through Netgalley**"

228,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1702050-fox,5,"I've been eagerly awaiting this book since I first became aware of its release, which was likely due to Daphne's review. Cannibalism is an undeniably fascinating subject, and  Bill Schutt tackles it with grace and humor, as long for a disdain for the sensationalism that has too long colored all publications on the topic. The book was fascinating from cover to cover, and is extremely well-organized. It begins with the study of it in the animal kingdom, and ends with the much needed topic of prion diseases, their spread, and how poorly understood they are. Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History is destined to become the go-to book on the topic. Well sourced, entertainingly written, and scattered throughout with just enough humor and a large dose of respect, it does its topic justice.  Bill Schutt writes with a deft hand that does much to dispel many of the sensationalized myths that surround some of the better known cases (i.e. Donner Party, Praying Mantises, Black Widows, etc.) and does a good job explaining topics that have never really gotten enough focus (i.e. prion diseases, kuru) or have suffered from the wrong type of focus.This book was immensely readable, and more in depth and well-sourced than I expected a pop-science book to be. It definitely opened my eyes to the complexity of the topic, and added to disdain I already felt towards one Jared Diamond and his tendency to over simplify nearly everything. I'm very much looking forward to more being published in regards to the Neanderthal hypotheses presented in this book, as well as for more studies being done on the truly terrifying prion diseases. Nothing terrifies me more than the section on prion diseases in this book, and what it may hold in store for our future."
229,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1424908-map,4,"I won a kindle version of this book as a Goodreads Giveaway.I've seen some reviews on here claiming that this book is dry and overly scientific, but I have to disagree. As a psychologist who got my start in animal behaviorism, I appreciated Schutt's precise and behavioral descriptions of animals as opposed to engaging in anthropomorphism. I also found him to have a very dry wit that livened up the chapters without making them unscientific.The first few chapters, focusing primarily on animals, felt less cohesive than the ones focused on humans, which seemed more clearly delineated into categories of cannibalism or specific instances. But all of it was entertaining and engaging.On the downside, as my husband lived in England between 1988-1990, I'm relatively sure he'll die of Mad Cow Disease any day now. When I mentioned this to him, his response was, ""Oh yes, I'm actually not allowed to donate blood because I lived in England during that time."" Wonderful."
230,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61034045-chuy-ruiz,4,"I was given this book as a gift and I definitely enjoyed reading it. It isn't a book that I would have probably picked out myself, so it was great to still learn plenty and find it interesting. It explores the topic of cannibalism in non-human animals at first, then moves on to the social taboos in most cultures around the practice. It takes a skeptical approach to the claims of cannibalism in any culture and looks for actual hard evidence of it, instead of just second hand claims and anecdotal claims. It also explores the potential causes and ramifications of cannibalism in an interesting and engaging way."
231,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1961913-na-amen,4,"Overall I really liked this book. There were some small moments of throwaway lines where I felt the objectivity of the author slipped and some cultural/biological prejudices reared their heads. A good study of cannibalism in nature across species that stayed away from sensationalism, even while discussing the Donner party."
232,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3237385-melissa,5,"4.5* I flew through this! I can't remember the last time I struggled to put down nonfiction. Schutt makes a point of avoiding the sensational, but that doesn't prevent his book from being fascinating and engrossing. I also appreciated how he pointed out conflicting points of view / arguments between scholars, especially when it came to human cannibalistic behaviors."
233,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8071101-jeanne,2,"I found this book a difficult read. It read more like a science proof paper than general interest book.

235,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49782194-conor-ahern,4,"There are very few things I find myself getting squeamish about, but cannibalism is one of them. It's not so much the Donner-Party, necessity-of-survival type cannibalism that bothers me, either--hunger knows no morality and forces normal people to do things that they might ordinarily find horrific. It's more of the victim-of-cannibalization type that makes me shudder. I suppose on some fundamental level, I believe that it's wrong for humans to be used as means to an end, and succumbing by way of cannibalization seems to be the ultimate example of that; your life and your body reduced to the fulfillment of some fetish that by its very nature assigns you no greater value than a head of cattle. These were probably the hardest parts of this book for me. Stories of cannibalism in the animal kingdom and its evolutionary advantages were much more interesting than unsettling. This book got me thinking of other taboos, things that are so ingrained that logic alone can't account for the aversion. The only others that came to mind were incest and pedophilia, but at least by degree those things operate in contemporary societies as norms, and certainly have done so to a greater extent in the past. But it's not like the British or the Yoruba have a tradition of eating, say, an arm but would draw the line there; unlike with the other two types of taboos I mentioned, cannibalism seems much more to be an all-or-nothing type of convention. While societies all over the world permit relationships that we might regard as incestuous or pedophilic, it seems that societies that countenance what we would describe as cannibalism are few and far between. And I guess it's Schutt's goal to show that this is more of a Western taboo, which is interesting. He points to our Greek and Shakespearean cautionary tales as powerfully inculcating the supposed evil of cannibalism, and then looks to China for examples that, at the very least, cannibalism wasn't regarded there in such black-and-white terms, citing Imperial delicacies including human flesh and conventions whereby parents would trade children with other families during times of hunger so as to avoid having to consume their own children. China is a big place with a lot of people and a ton of recorded history, though, so you're bound to come across anything sooner or later, right?I think the interesting thing for me has been that I gave it a fair shot but in the end I simply can't get over the taboo. Much as I try, and Chinese evidence to the contrary placed before me, I cannot get past the idea that it's wrong, with nothing more articulate than that to say about it! Oh well, I'm only human. This book was often funny and takes a light touch. Very worth chewing over, if you can stomach it!"
236,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/616321-juushika,3,"This is a decent overview of the history and biology of cannibalism. The zoological studies are diverse and broad, and make effective arguments about the causes and therefore evolutionary benefits of cannibalism. It lines up nicely with the human studies which investigate these same causes, particularly privation. The issue of evolutionary benefit for humans is of course more complicated, and Schutt takes a variety of approaches, looking at cannibalism both as an act and as a social concept, and this latter--particular the role of (accusations of) cannibalism in justifications for genocide--gives the book depth.But I have too many unanswered questions: What are the ethics of murder versus eating the already-dead versus cannibalism as a social taboo--how does sapience factor into the erstwhile benefits of survival cannibalism? What is it that makes the taboo of cannibalism compelling in the public consciousness, and how does this intersect with cases of criminal cannibalism? I respect the decision to avoid sensationalism and over-reported criminal cases, but the lack here is conspicuous; meanwhile, using Freud to discuss taboo is cliché and, frankly, problematic. What is the cost/benefit for the evolutionary benefits versus health risks of cannibalism; where's the tipping point in that equation and what protective measures exist? Many of these answers exist by implication, and most of them are ""it's complicated,"" but I wish Schutt were bolder & reached further. The only bold conclusion he draws is a warning about the intersection of desensitization and survival cannibalism in near-future disaster situations--a lazy argument that directly conflicts the desensitized genocidal/cannibalistic human past. (All cultures are desensitized in their own special way.) I liked this well enough, the breadth of it is interesting, the science accessible; Schutt's humor conflicts sometimes with the deceptive gravity of his topic, but it makes for a readable text. But I wanted more, more depth, more asked but unanswerable questions, and that's not present here."
237,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5790437-aj-sterkel,4,"Likes: This book gave me nightmares about dying from mad cow disease. Nightmares probably don’t sound like a good thing, but if I’m thinking about a book in my sleep, it must be doing something right. Mad cow disease is especially terrifying because the British government tried to suppress info about it to protect the beef industry. Yeah . . . we’re all screwed.Anyway, I appreciate that the author looks at cannibalism from a scientific point-of-view instead of a sensationalist point-of-view. He avoids most of the serial killer talk and focuses on nature. Which animals are cannibals and why? If it’s common for animals to eat their friends, why is it rare for modern humans to do the same? Where did the taboo against cannibalism come from? (Hint: Christianity and authors with over-active imaginations.)I enjoyed most of the chapters in this book. The writing style is funnier than I expected. My favorite chapters are the ones about Christopher Columbus. I knew about the damage he did to the places he “explored,” but I didn’t know his connection to cannibalism. Queen Isabella decided that only New World cannibals could be enslaved. Selling slaves was big business, so Columbus and his followers slapped the cannibal label on pretty much everybody. I love that the author examines the history of cannibalism and how our (often irrational) fears of it have shaped the modern world. It’s a unique approach to the subject.“[T]he idea of cannibalism had become a handy symbol for unacceptable behavior practiced by “Others”—a broad and malleable category of evildoers that included enemies, followers of non-Christian religions, and any groups determined to retain their “uncivilized” customs.” – CannibalismDislikes: Since there are frogs on the cover, I expected to learn more about animal cannibalism. The first few chapters are about animals, but then the focus shifts to humans and mostly stays on humans. I wanted more animals.The author is clearly a scientist. I am definitely not a scientist. For me, the writing is too dry and sciencey (totally a real word) at times. The author goes into too much detail about a few subjects—such as kuru, a disease that humans get from eating their families. The science behind Kuru takes up so many pages that I got bored with it. The Bottom Line: One of the most educational books I’ve read this year. If you’re interested in learning about cannibalism, I recommend it. (Just prepare yourself for mad cow nightmares.)Do you like reviews, giveaways, and bookish nonsense? Good news! I have a blog for that. "
238,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4876063-elphareads,4,"I mean, just look at the title of this. CANNIBALISM: A PERFECTLY NATURAL HISTORY? How could I not? I don't know who Bill Schutt is, but man does he know how to take a pretty morbid and kind of yucky topic and turn it into something palatable. SEE WHAT I DID?Bill Schutt examines cannibalism in this world, be it in the animal kingdom, in cultural practice, or survival situations. He talks about all kinds of cannibals, from tadpoles to the Donner Party to Papua New Guinea, and puts them into a scientific and cultural context. Usually with some pretty funny anecdotes or quips to go along with it. While the sociological examinations were a bit easier for me to swallow than the scientific explanations, I quite enjoyed CANNIBALISM: A PERFECTLY NATURAL HISTORY. Schutt did a very good job of making all of these sometimes yucky and always fascinating realities very easy to understand, and didn't try to sensationalize anything around the practice of cannibalism. He also did some really interesting chapters about Mad Cow Disease and modern farming practices, which is just another example of 'progress' coming back and biting us on the butt. True, sometimes it's not for the squeamish, but Schutt delivers all this information with charm and aplomb (and even details his experience eating placenta, given to him by some enthusiastic parents). Super interesting and kind of gross too, CANNIBALISM: A PERFECTLY NATURAL HISTORY is a book I'm glad I picked up. "
239,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"This is an interesting little book. Schutt begins with detailing the frequently fascinating ways that cannibalism occurs in the natural world, and then he moves on to the history of cannibalism among the human animals. People have been eating people for a long time. When a city is under siege, or people find themselves adrift at sea without food for weeks... human beings are going to start looking increasingly delicious despite the taboos (see: Kramer in Newman's imagination in that episode of Seinfeld where he accidentally cooks himself with butter). Shutt also explores cultures where that taboo doesn't exist, and where people eat people ritualistically or simply because they taste delicious (the flavor of humans, if you were wondering, gets compared by various people to tuna, pork, and veal).And if we think the Western world is too civilized for Cannibalism, Schutt reminds us that Europeans were eating mummia (ground up Egyptian mummies, or counterfeit ground up mummies) for medicinal reasons right through the end of the Victorian age, and that the practice of placenta eating has actually been growing in recent years."
240,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"Really enjoyable read! Remember all of those awesome studies from animal behavior class, like the ones that demonstrated how many animals avoid having sex with their father, mother, sister, or brother -- chemicals inside their noses and brains help them identify ""self"" and ""non-self"", instructing them not to have sex with anything too similar to ""self"" -- or the studies that demonstrated how sexual selection could spell death for sexy males -- female fish preferred the most orange males, which drove selection toward fish so orange, they were easily spotted and gobbled up by predators -- or the other studies that outlined the many shocking behaviors and likely motivations of various animals? Well, this book is chock full of those types of studies, only they are geared solely at understanding why animals might or might not eat each other instead of why they might or might not mate with each other. Here is a sampling of the intensely interesting things you will find in well researched chapters. Black Widows:Contrary to the well held belief that female Black Widows spiders and female Preying Mantis devour their males when mating, these cannibalistic behaviors are reserved for times of great stress, such as when there is a food shortage or these animals are in captivity. Since they had only been studied in captivity, researchers were only privy to the behaviors associated with that stressor. If the Black Widow had been observed in natural conditions, when food supplies were sufficient, she would have never gotten the name ""Black Widow"". In truth, females spiders are far more often the victims of cannibalism than the perpetrators. In at least one species of spider, the females do a dance to make the males notice them and choose them to mate with. Instead of having sex, as the female intended, she made herself noticed and became a tasty treat for a male spider who, with the energy gained from eating her, moved on to court another female spider who he did choose to mate with. When times are really lean, there is a spider species who eats its own limbs! Spiders and Praying Mantis are not the only animals who do not usually practice cannibalism but turn to that behavior when they are exposed to stressful or unusual conditions. Cats, mice, rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits are all driven to cannibalism when facing similar conditions, but the hamster seems to be more prone to cannibalism than most species. If hamster siblings are kept in the same cage, they will often fight to the death at 4 weeks old, when they reach sexual maturity. The winner will eat the carcass of the loser. Though the behavior is common to many mothers, mother hamsters engage far more often in eating their young when the mother herself is handled close to the time when she gives birth or when her babies are handled when they are little. Apes:Cannibalism is generally rarer in ape species, including humans. However, when they engage in the practice, they are like other animals in that it is usually in times of stress, but not always. There have been serial killers who seem to enjoy eating their victims. There even seem to a pair of mother daughter serial killer chimpanzees, named Passion and Pom, who ate between 5 and 10 infants after attacking the new mothers. It seems it was all in an effort to obtain food. So, perhaps Passion and Pom's actions are not as unexplainable as Jeffery Dahmer's. Carnassial Dentation:The shape of teeth can tell us a lot about the evolution of various species. Schutt discussed the evolution of polar bear teeth to talk in general about how teeth, such as carnassial teeth, help meat eating species rip chunks of meet off their prey. Even though I have read a fair amount about this subject, I wasn't bored at all. In fact, I thought it was one of the better discussions on teeth and evolution. If you enjoy reading about ripping pieces of meat into smaller pieces, in order to aid digestion, I suggest you read, I Contain Multitudes as well. The author of that book, Ed Yong, gave a good bit of detail about gut microbes-- where they are placed in the gut, in front or behind -- so that the animals and the microbes both enjoy a wonderful meal. Yong discussed the types of microbes needed for a meat eating diet vs. a vegetable diet. I could not stop thinking about what Yong wrote when reading this section of Schutt's Cannibalism book. Schutt also used the polar bear section to satisfyingly discuss climate change and the stupidity of the media. Definitely worth reading. Hyenas and infanticide:Who doesn't love to eat babies? It seems that most animals who eat meat, love to eat the babies most. This seems to hold true whether it is a different species or a different species from the animal doing the eating. Chimps patrol their borders and when they encounter a female and her baby, they kill the baby and try to hook up with the female. Nothing says love like murdering her offspring. Chimps are not alone. Males from many different animal species eat babies in order to push females into estrus, so they can mate with them. One female species has evolved a protection against infanticide, and as a result is a dominant member of their clan-- the hyena. To really understand the magic of female hyena biology, it's important to understand sexual development in embryos. Embryos are genderless but have precursors to mammary glands and penises. If an embryo gets an XY chromosome the penis bud will grow, but the memory glands will not. . If the embryo receives XX, the embryo will still grow the penis bud but then get the signal to stop the growth when it is very small, leaving behind a clitoris instead of a large penis. The XX will also send a signal to grow the mammary glands. Males have nipples but cannot feed a baby. This is because they do not have XX, which makes mammary glands that allows milk to flow through the nipples. XY and XX chromosomes use hormones to signal which morphology a body should have. The XY chromosome contains testosterone, which signals the penis bud to grow into a penis . The XX chromosome contains estrogen, which is what signals the growth of mammary glands.In spotted hyenas, researchers believe a mutation developed to provide the female spotted hyena with more testosterone, resulting in a signal to grow the penis bud out more. Thus, female hyenas have a very large clitoris (elongated penis bud). Their vulva is fused shut, allowing them to pee through their clitoris/penis bud, just like a male pees through their penis. When a male wants to have sex with a female, she really has to be receptive, just as a male would have to be receptive to have sex. This is because it's actually like inserting a penis into a penis, making it virtually impossible to force a female to have sex. While evolution did them a favor in not allowing them to be raped by males, it was unkind to them in regards to birthing offspring (I am so glad that I am not a female hyena!). The cub has to come out somewhere and unfortunately it rips the vulva. That was painful to even read about. I do have to say though, this was absolutely the best discussion on hyena biology of any book I have read so far. The rest of the book:The last part of the book veered away from animal behavior and examined the more sociological aspects of cannibalism-- where the word originated, how it appeared in literature throughout the ages, and what our current conception of cannibalism is. Those aspects went on a little too long for my taste, but I can imagine other people enjoying those sections. "
241,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,4,"What an unexpectedly decent read. Unlike many others fascinated by this topic and other types of violence so prevalent on screen, I'm pretty chicken and would like to steer clear from those. Yet an article on National Geographic persuaded me to pick it up since the book seems a lot more scientific and less sensational. And I love reading about animals, and so was hoping for some light entertainment and instead got pretty educated. Writing in a conversational tone, yet packed with a lot of knowledge and terminologies that it's first time since ever that I have to repeatedly look words up, Schutt casually discusses cannibalism in the animal kingdom then gradually move to more difficult and gory scenes in human society. His presentation of China, admittedly, still hasn't convinced me, it feels like his research in China both ancient and modern time isn't rigorous enough. Yet it motivates me to read a book currently on my reading shelf about the Great Leap Forward.The book doesn't stop with cannibalism and definitely isn't a simple ""objective"" piece of writing describing the phenomenon. Schutt inserts his argument on religion, colonialism, on climate change, on modern obsession with violence, on the government and the economy. He talks bluntly about unsolved issue in the study of some infectious disease. All in all, the book leaves me with goose bumps, some fear, certainly aroused neocortex.And fun fact, now I really know the origin of ""Soylent"", my favorite meal replacement these days. What an ironic naming."
242,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3123067-elizabeth-a,4,"Book blurb: Eating one’s own kind is completely natural behavior in thousands of species, including humans. Throughout history we have engaged in cannibalism for reasons of famine, burial rites, and medicinal remedies; it’s been used as a way to terrorize and even a way to show filial piety. Today, the subject of humans consuming one another has been relegated to the realm of horror movies, fiction, and the occasional psychopath, but be forewarned: As climate change progresses and humans see more famine, disease, and overcrowding, biological and cultural constraints may well disappear. I listened to the audiobook which was well narrated by Tom Perkins.One of my fave questions to ask at parties (I kid you not): Say you are starving and your survival is at stake. Do you feel differently about eating a person who is already dead, as opposed to killing someone to eat? Try it at your next gathering and report back.This book hits my sweet spot on so many levels. Most people tend to be really squeamish about the topic, but if you're not a vegetarian, what's all the fuss about? Who decided that we can eat some animals and not others? Besides, if you think that cannibalism is awful, you might want to put it in perspective. Considering the horrid historical accounts of human behavior, eating your fellow Sapiens doesn't really seem all that bad.This is a fun, informative, and eye opening book, and I learned so many things about the animal kingdom I had no idea about. I'll bet school would be much more interesting if some of these topics were incorporated into the curriculum. I could talk about some of the specifics, but then that'd spoil all the fun for you. I assure you that it's full of fascinating and juicy tidbits. The author stays away from sensational crime stories, so if you are looking for recipes, look elsewhere, but if you are willing to have ""no way!"" moments, and are willing to annoy your loved ones by constantly saying ""did you know?"", move this up your TBR.This will end up on my best of 2017 reads, and the only reason I docked a star is due to the fact that there are sections, like the final chapters, where the author gets side tracked and wanders off topic."
243,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3078602-peacegal,4,"Fans of Mary Roach's popular science books will devour CANNIBALISM, a tour of the taboo topic throughout the natural world and human history. From Tyrannosaurus rex to the Donner Party, from tadpoles who eat their siblings to American uberbreeders who dine on placenta, readers will at turns be entertained, saddened, and disgusted by the facts within--but they will always be educated. There is one point on which I'd like to add something to the text on chicken cannibalism within factory farm conditions. The author writes that pecking deaths became a widespread concern when intensive chicken farming first took hold in the 1940s. Thus, the chicken industry developed the practice of debeaking, in which the end of each chick's beak is cut or seared off to hobble them from aggressively pecking one another. The author writes that chicken ""blinder"" masks were invented in the 40s as a supposedly more humane alternative, and words it in such a way that these masks have replaced debeaking in the poultry industry today. Erm, no. While blinders are occasionally used, most notably in the intensive rearing of pheasants for release-and-shoot canned hunts, debeaking remains the rule of the day for billions of hens raised for meat and egg production. (The sheer amount of birds raised coupled with the rapidity with which beaks can be cut or seared ensures this.) Not to say that blinder masks are such a pleasant alternative. They are frequently affixed by shoving a bar through the animal's nostrils. "

This book did not disappoint! So much good and interesting information with lots of discussion on the current disagreements between scientists on such topics as the Donner Party, Mad Cow Disease, and the mysteries of insect mating. This is a fascinating look at a taboo subject, and I loved every minute of it."

Otherwise, starts from the smaller animals or insects mainly, like spiders and covers also humans. The placenta business sounded so disgusting, people wanting to eat part of another human. Looks like that 1% of the total population could have cannibalistic tendencies but on disasters time, everybody becomes one. "
246,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,5,"Bill Schutt is a writer I really appreciate and enjoy. I read Dark Banquet a few years ago and loved it. He is for me sort of the Neil DeGrasse tyson of biology/animal behavior (human animals included). He is a wonderful storyteller and the structures of his books are clear and accessible and well-organized but also scientifically and sociologically and culturally incisive, and meandering in nice ways. He takes on a specific topic and stays with it in his way, but at the same time, explores it from many angles. He is curious and his interest and curiosity are evident in his writing. He clearly relishes exploring ideas, behaviors and histories and does not look away from the absurdity and violence of human cultures. In this book, in addition to providing insight into various and common cannibalistic behaviors throughout the animal kingdom, he interrogates human cultural and ideological relationships to cannibalism. He asks the question: are our monotheistic western cultures' ideas about and fear and hatred of cannibalism of a genetic origin in any way, or purely cultural. He talks of the devastating irony--how Europeans used the idea of the inherent evil of cannibalism to justify the brutal massacre of unnumbered non-European peoples who may or may not have engaged in cannibalistic rituals. I love the illustrations in the book. I love how Schutt takes myths and legends about certain animals acts or habits of cannibalism and offers a much more complex and nuanced picture. He puts some myths to rest. He offers many fascinating particulars in their places, including stories of physiological changes (epigenetic?) in certain aquatic and semiaquatic (and maybe other? can't recall) animals who engage in filial cannibalism. Also, there's a fantastic section about some messy, dart-throwing gastropods. Clearly, I am a fan of the book and recommend it highly.here's a quote from intro:Is it really a surprise, though, that our greatest cinematic villain is a man-eating psychiatrist while the mild-mannered runner-up is based on a real-life cannibal killer? Perhaps not, if one considers that many cultures share the belief that consuming another human is the worst (or close to the worst) behavior that a person can undertake. As a result, real-life cannibalistic psychopaths like Jeffrey Dahmer (another Wisconsin native) and his Russian counterpart, Andrei Chikatilo, have attained something akin to mythical status in the annals of history’s most notorious murderers. Whether through a filter of fictionalization, where man-eating deviants are transformed into powerful antiheroes, or through tabloids sensationalizing the crimes of real-life cannibals, these tales feed our obsession with all things gruesome—an obsession that is now an acceptable facet of our society.A different attitude was taken toward “primitive” social or ethnic groups whose members might not have shared the Western take on cannibalism taboos. At best, these “savages” were pegged as souls to be saved, but only if they met certain requirements. In the first half of the 20th century, for example, explorers and the missionaries who followed them ventured into the foreboding New Guinea highlands and quickly imposed one hard-and-fast rule for the locals: Cannibalism in any form was strictly forbidden.But far worse instances of cultural intrusion occurred elsewhere and throughout history, as those accused of consuming other humans, for any reason, were brutalized, enslaved, and murdered. The most infamous example of this practice began during the last years of the 15th century when millions of indigenous people living in the Caribbean and Mexico were summarily reclassified as cannibals for reasons that had little to do with people-eating. Instead, it paved the way for them to be robbed, beaten, conquered, and slain, all at the whim of their new Spanish masters.Similar atrocities were carried out on a massive scale by a succession of flag-planting European powers who (if one believes their accounts) wrested South America, Africa, and the Indo-Pacific away from man-eating savages, whose behavior placed them beyond the pale of anything that could remotely be described as human.So were European fears about cannibalism simply an invention used to justify conquest, or were there cultures, including those encountered by the Spaniards, where the consumption of humans was regarded as normal behavior? Although defining someone as a cannibal became an effective way to dehumanize them, there is also evidence that ritual cannibalism, as embodied in various customs related to funerary rites and warfare, occurred throughout history.As I began studying these forms of cannibalism, I sought to determine not only their perceived functions, but just how widespread they were or weren’t. Surprisingly—or perhaps not surprisingly given the subject matter—there is disagreement among anthropologists regarding ritual cannibalism. Some deny that it ever occurred, while others claim that the behavior did occur but was uncommon. Still others claim that cannibalism was practiced by many cultures throughout history and for a variety of reasons. One such body of evidence led me straight back to European history, where I learned that a particularly macabre form of cannibalism had been practiced for hundreds of years by nobility, physicians, and commoners alike, even into the 20th century.As a zoologist, I was, of course, intrigued at the prospect of documenting cases of non-human cannibalism. Looking back now, I can see that I’d started my inquiry with something less than a completely open mind. Part of me reasoned that since cannibalism was presumably a rare occurrence in humans (at least in modern times), it would likely be similarly rare in the animal kingdom.Once I dug further, though, I discovered that cannibalism differs in frequency between major animal groups—nonexistent in some and common in others. It varies from species to species and even within the same species, depending on local environmental conditions. Cannibalism also serves a variety of functions, depending on the cannibal. There are even examples in which an individual being cannibalized receives a benefit.In several instances, cannibalism appears to have arisen only recently in a species, and human activity might be the cause. In one such case, news reports informed horrified audiences that some of the most highly recognizable animals on the planet were suddenly consuming their own young. “Polar bears resort to cannibalism as Arctic ice shrinks,” reported CNN, while the Times of London echoed the sentiment: “Climate Change Forcing Polar Bears to Become Cannibals.” It was Reuters, though, that scored a perfect ten on the gruesome scale with an online slide show in which an adult polar bear was seen carrying around the still cute-as-a button head of a dead cub, the remains of its spinal cord trailing behind like a red streamer.The real story behind polar bear [contextualized in book...] cannibalism turned out to be just as fascinating, though it would also serve as a perfect example of how many accusations of and stories about cannibalism throughout history were untrue, unproven, or exaggerated—distorted by sensationalism, deception, a lack of scientific knowledge, and just plain bad writing. With the passage of time, these accounts too often become part of the historical record, their errors long forgotten. Part of my job would be to expose those errors.I was also extremely curious to see if the origin of cannibalism taboos could be traced back to the natural world, so I developed a pair of alternative hypotheses. Perhaps our aversion to consuming our own kind is hardwired into our brains and as such is a part of our genetic blueprint—a gene or two whose expression selects against such behavior. I reasoned that if such a built-in deterrent exists, then humans and most non-humans (with the exception of a few well-known anomalies such as black widow spiders and praying mantises) would avoid cannibalism at all costs. Thus, the taboo would have a biological foundation.Conversely, I weighed the possibility that the revulsion most people have at the very mention of cannibalism might stem solely from our culture. Of course, this led to even more questions. What are the cultural roots of the cannibalism taboo and how has it become so widespread? I also wondered why, as disgusted as we are at the very thought of cannibalism, we’re so utterly fascinated by it? Might cannibalism have been more common in our ancestors, before societal rules turned it into something abhorrent? I looked for evidence in the fossil record and elsewhere.Finally, I considered what it would take to break down the biological or cultural constraints that prevent us from eating each other on a regular basis. Could there come a time, in our not-so-distant future, when human cannibalism becomes commonplace? And for that matter, was it already becoming a more frequent occurrence? The answers to these questions are far from certain but, then again, there is much about the topic of cannibalism that cannot be neatly divided into black and white. Likely or not, though, the circumstances that might lead to outbreaks of widespread cannibalism in the 21st century are grounded in science, not science fiction.My aim was to stay away from the clichéd ideas about cannibalism that are already ingrained in our collective psyche and, with such a wealth of relevant material to explore, I quickly realized that this wouldn’t be difficult. Even the most famous cannibal stories, it turned out, had factual gaps that are only now being filled. In the case of the Donner Party, for example, I joined researchers whose scientific approach to the most infamous cannibalism-related event in American history had shed new light on this 19th-century tale of stranded pioneers.I’ve tried to approach each example from a scientific viewpoint, delving into what I considered the most intriguing aspects of anthropology, evolution, and biology to provide the broadest yet most engaging natural history of this behavior. What happens to our bodies and minds under starvation conditions? Why are women better equipped to survive starvation than men? And what physiological extremes would compel someone to consume the body of a friend or even a family member?But it’s not just the abundance of eggs and young that makes fish such a popular menu item for members of their own species. Many terrestrial vertebrates produce few or even a single offspring, and most of these newly born or newly hatched individuals already exhibit considerable body size. In many fish species, the extraordinary number of eggs produced imposes a limit on their size, and so a full-grown cod might be a million times (or six orders of magnitude) larger than its own eggs. This fact goes a long way to explain why the majority of them exhibit about as much individual recognition of their offspring as humans do for a handful of raisins. Fish eggs, larvae, and fry (i.e., young fish) are vast in number, minute in size, and high in nutritional value. This makes them an abundant, nonthreatening, and easily collected food source. It’s also why ichthyologists consider the absence of cannibalism in fishes, rather than its presence, to be the exceptional case."

I believed this book would focus more on canabalism in the animal world and then BRIEFLY connect this to human cannibalism. It didnt happen this way. I was so fascinated by the instances of cannabilism in the animal world and, surprisingly, the sections I read on human cannibalism were dull. This could have been due to it focusing mostly on references to cannibalism in early literature and focusing so heavily on the story of the Donner's. I lost interest at this point and just never picked it back up. Cool words I learned:Conspecific AdelphophagyDermatophagyAnthropophagyAnthropophagus phobiaOophagyTheophagy Placentophagy Apophallation which is the biting off of a penis (exhibited in terrestrial slugs)."

There are no sensationalized accounts of cannabalism through serial killers or the like. It was well written and easy to understand. I found the incidences of humans more interesting than the insects or animals. My two favorite sections were about the Donnor Party and the placenta. Props to the author for doing what he did for the research! That is some first hand knowledge there! I am not sure how much of this information I will be able to retain, but it was an informative and entertaining read. "
249,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6609117-eustacia-tan,4,"I started this book before a 1am flight because, I don't know, I subconsciously never want to eat or sleep again (just joking. I did both the whole day).Cannibalism is a history and an explanation of the act. But don't worry, the author doesn't start with the stomach churning human eating human stuff right away. He starts with the 'lighter' stuff - cannibalism by non-humans.The book starts by defining the various types of cannibalism - of which I remember two: eating your family members and eating people of your species who aren't related to you. Then it gets defined even further, to things like filial cannibalism (parents eating children or vice versa), cannibalism during mating (turns out the Black Widow Spider has been maligned.After going through all these decidedly non-humans, the author slowly makes his way back to us.If I were to generalise, I'd say that the book says that cannibalism tends to be a response to specific conditions (overcrowding, lack of nutrition, etc). Although in humans, there are ritual cannibals. Oh, and grey areas like breastfeeding (if skin cells come off) and I can't remember what else. (For the record, I am in no way justifying cannibalism in the whole 'eat literal human flesh' form)Although I was really surprised about the fact that ritual cannibalism existed in Chinese culture, especially as an act of filial piety. Then I remembered stories about sons cutting their thighs to feed their parents (though I can't remember from where) and I realised that IS cannibalism "
250,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34493714-yasaman,3,"An interesting read. Schutt's overall take on cannibalism - especially in non-human species - is that it essentially occurs either as a mechanism for passing on genetic information to the next generation, or to ensure your and/or your offspring's survival and conservation of energy, which again goes back to making sure genetic information is passed on. So, from an evolutionary standpoint, it makes perfect sense, especially considering that most species do not rely on behaviors/methods such as altruism and Kin selection for their fitness rates. When the topic is discussed in regards to humans, there is also ritualistic and medicinal cannibalism to consider, which Schutt explains is a lot more common than expected. What I liked about Schutt's discussion on the topic is that he shows the hypocrisy of viewpoints regarding ritualistic cannibalism based on which group of people is practicing it (i.e. indigenous people or white European Christians?). But, interestingly, it was also what I didn't like about the book in general: Firstly, Schutt oversimplifies the practice based on strict definitions (I hardly think biting fingernails and eating organs such as liver should fall under the same category,) and, secondly, he doesn't seem overly concerned about explaining that just because something is a cultural influence and seemingly widespread, it doesn't make it any less wrong to do."
251,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6314574-allisonlcarter,3,"While starting in the animal kingdom seems a logical place to start a conversation about cannibalism, this book gets bogged down in the world of weird sex snails and spiders for far too long. What makes cannibalism of such enduring interest is that it's fundamentally a question of whether it is moral to eat a human body under any circumstances. Since morality is, in most cases, relative, this is an endlessly fascinating question for homo sapiens and varies widely from culture to culture. Since animals do not have ethical frameworks that we are aware of, knowing that this invertebrate or that eats each other is less interesting, except in the broadest way.When Schutt does get to human consumption, he mostly covers familiar ground -- the Donner Party, Papua New Guinea, etc. The book shines in a few chapters that skirt the issue of why cannibalism is taboo in Western culture and examines the practice in China. The book is capped off with a long exploration of mad cow disease, which, since the cows didn't choose to engage in cannibalism or derive an evolutionary advantage from it, seems out of place.Still, the book is immaculately researched and Schutt has an amusingly wry sense of humor."
252,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63058444-joshua,5,"The following review will contain no references and/or bad puns of Hannibal Lecter. I'm just putting that out there now because the only really interesting Cannibal was Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The dude wore ties to work. That's class.The taboo of cannibalism is exactly what lead me to this book. Working in a library I regularly stock the ""New Books"" section and everyday I saw the book with it's distinct cover. Curiosity got the better of me and I checked the book out and read it in a week. The reader may not think themselves terribly interested in the idea of reading about the history and practice of cannibalism as an act, but they're missing out because there's also loads of biology.Schutt manages to write an easy, approachable book about an act that many people would rather not discuss, but as he points out in his introduction the fact that nobody wants to talk about is reason enough to discuss it. Schutt approaches the book at the start as a biologist, a zoologist to be specific, and just tries to understand biologically why cannibalism takes place in the wild in natural conditions. Once this is done he tackles the human element and it's here that the reader will be able to see that the issue becomes complicated. I won't lie, there are some elements of this book hat can be troubling (the eating of kids during the siege of Stalingrad just about broke me), but this book was approachable and enjoyable to read. It was only in the last three chapters that the writing began to grow a little tiresome, but even in these closing pages the book still felt strong and by it's end I felt as if I had really learned something about the natural world while also being warned about the possible future.Cannibalism isn't a fun topic unless it involves Anthony Hopkins (damn I broke my first rule) but it is an important topic and Schott succeeds in demonstrating that, yes, it does deserve an entire book to itself."

But I thought this one sounded interesting, and it turns out I really loved it! Bill Schutt has a great style that alternates between clear, concise explanations of biological concepts, overviews of research fields and more personal narratives and interviews he had with other scientists. To be clear, this is emphatically not a book about cannibal crimes (in fact, the author devotes only a few paragraphs to such murderers, and states that he both feels that fields has been covered more than enough, and that he doesn't want to be disrespectful towards victims and their families). What it is, is a journey through cannibalism as a biological and social mechanism, starting from examples of various animals and the research done on different species, before moving on to an investigation whether those same mechanisms come into play for humans and how different human cultures have viewed cannibalism throughout history. I actually feel like I've learned a lot about topics I didn't know much about, and had good time while acquiring that knowledge - a perfect combination!"
254,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24590339-k-willows,4,"This is informative & well rounded, but leans heavily on the side of serious science writing (as opposed to more casual/humorous science writing). It does have its bits of humor but overall this is a book I'd recommend to science minded people interested in learning more about the cultural taboo of cannibalism. I felt that the final 3 chapters could have been condensed down. I would have liked to read more about the Aghori of India but they were surprisingly unmentioned. Finally, for true crime nerds, this book does not go into depth regarding the cannibalistic killers, but I felt the author had good reason for avoiding that subject and the sensationalism that comes with it."
255,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46502154-anna,4,"Obviously, it's not for everyone but as someone who's been interested in cannibalism for a very long time (don't ask me why) I found it both interesting and informative. It's certainly the best and the most scientific book I've read on the subject so far. I was a bit worried that my English might fail me because the author is a biologist but luckily I had no problems understanding what he was talking about. What I liked the most was that Bill Schutt covered a very wide range of types of cannibalism and - unlike many other authors - didn't focus on serial killers/psychopaths (they are mentioned at the beginning so it might be a disappointment to those readers who were hoping for more) and sensational stories about tribes consuming human flesh like it's tacos. As an avid fan of animal documentaries I was the most interested in the first part of the book (even though I knew many of the facts Schutt talked about) and I was slightly bored towards the end when he focused on diseases (ones rumoured to be transmitted through infected human meat). But I honestly appreciate how thorough and detailed the research was."

The books take a more scientific and anthropological look at cannibalism. There is only a small amount of coverage of human cannibalism. Much more is on the animal kingdom. I found this super interesting and I definitely recommend it to those of you interested in science, anthropology and history. **ARC provided through Netgalley**"

258,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1702050-fox,5,"I've been eagerly awaiting this book since I first became aware of its release, which was likely due to Daphne's review. Cannibalism is an undeniably fascinating subject, and  Bill Schutt tackles it with grace and humor, as long for a disdain for the sensationalism that has too long colored all publications on the topic. The book was fascinating from cover to cover, and is extremely well-organized. It begins with the study of it in the animal kingdom, and ends with the much needed topic of prion diseases, their spread, and how poorly understood they are. Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History is destined to become the go-to book on the topic. Well sourced, entertainingly written, and scattered throughout with just enough humor and a large dose of respect, it does its topic justice.  Bill Schutt writes with a deft hand that does much to dispel many of the sensationalized myths that surround some of the better known cases (i.e. Donner Party, Praying Mantises, Black Widows, etc.) and does a good job explaining topics that have never really gotten enough focus (i.e. prion diseases, kuru) or have suffered from the wrong type of focus.This book was immensely readable, and more in depth and well-sourced than I expected a pop-science book to be. It definitely opened my eyes to the complexity of the topic, and added to disdain I already felt towards one Jared Diamond and his tendency to over simplify nearly everything. I'm very much looking forward to more being published in regards to the Neanderthal hypotheses presented in this book, as well as for more studies being done on the truly terrifying prion diseases. Nothing terrifies me more than the section on prion diseases in this book, and what it may hold in store for our future."
259,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1424908-map,4,"I won a kindle version of this book as a Goodreads Giveaway.I've seen some reviews on here claiming that this book is dry and overly scientific, but I have to disagree. As a psychologist who got my start in animal behaviorism, I appreciated Schutt's precise and behavioral descriptions of animals as opposed to engaging in anthropomorphism. I also found him to have a very dry wit that livened up the chapters without making them unscientific.The first few chapters, focusing primarily on animals, felt less cohesive than the ones focused on humans, which seemed more clearly delineated into categories of cannibalism or specific instances. But all of it was entertaining and engaging.On the downside, as my husband lived in England between 1988-1990, I'm relatively sure he'll die of Mad Cow Disease any day now. When I mentioned this to him, his response was, ""Oh yes, I'm actually not allowed to donate blood because I lived in England during that time."" Wonderful."

It isn't a book that I would have probably picked out myself, so it was great to still learn plenty and find it interesting. It explores the topic of cannibalism in non-human animals at first, then moves on to the social taboos in most cultures around the practice. It takes a skeptical approach to the claims of cannibalism in any culture and looks for actual hard evidence of it, instead of just second hand claims and anecdotal claims. It also explores the potential causes and ramifications of cannibalism in an interesting and engaging way."

Schutt makes a point of avoiding the sensational, but that doesn't prevent his book from being fascinating and engrossing.

263,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8071101-jeanne,2,"I found this book a difficult read. It read more like a science proof paper than general interest book.

265,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49782194-conor-ahern,4,"There are very few things I find myself getting squeamish about, but cannibalism is one of them. It's not so much the Donner-Party, necessity-of-survival type cannibalism that bothers me, either--hunger knows no morality and forces normal people to do things that they might ordinarily find horrific. It's more of the victim-of-cannibalization type that makes me shudder. I suppose on some fundamental level, I believe that it's wrong for humans to be used as means to an end, and succumbing by way of cannibalization seems to be the ultimate example of that; your life and your body reduced to the fulfillment of some fetish that by its very nature assigns you no greater value than a head of cattle. These were probably the hardest parts of this book for me. Stories of cannibalism in the animal kingdom and its evolutionary advantages were much more interesting than unsettling. This book got me thinking of other taboos, things that are so ingrained that logic alone can't account for the aversion. The only others that came to mind were incest and pedophilia, but at least by degree those things operate in contemporary societies as norms, and certainly have done so to a greater extent in the past. But it's not like the British or the Yoruba have a tradition of eating, say, an arm but would draw the line there; unlike with the other two types of taboos I mentioned, cannibalism seems much more to be an all-or-nothing type of convention. While societies all over the world permit relationships that we might regard as incestuous or pedophilic, it seems that societies that countenance what we would describe as cannibalism are few and far between. And I guess it's Schutt's goal to show that this is more of a Western taboo, which is interesting. He points to our Greek and Shakespearean cautionary tales as powerfully inculcating the supposed evil of cannibalism, and then looks to China for examples that, at the very least, cannibalism wasn't regarded there in such black-and-white terms, citing Imperial delicacies including human flesh and conventions whereby parents would trade children with other families during times of hunger so as to avoid having to consume their own children. China is a big place with a lot of people and a ton of recorded history, though, so you're bound to come across anything sooner or later, right?I think the interesting thing for me has been that I gave it a fair shot but in the end I simply can't get over the taboo. Much as I try, and Chinese evidence to the contrary placed before me, I cannot get past the idea that it's wrong, with nothing more articulate than that to say about it! Oh well, I'm only human. This book was often funny and takes a light touch. Very worth chewing over, if you can stomach it!"
266,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/616321-juushika,3,"This is a decent overview of the history and biology of cannibalism. The zoological studies are diverse and broad, and make effective arguments about the causes and therefore evolutionary benefits of cannibalism. It lines up nicely with the human studies which investigate these same causes, particularly privation. The issue of evolutionary benefit for humans is of course more complicated, and Schutt takes a variety of approaches, looking at cannibalism both as an act and as a social concept, and this latter--particular the role of (accusations of) cannibalism in justifications for genocide--gives the book depth.But I have too many unanswered questions: What are the ethics of murder versus eating the already-dead versus cannibalism as a social taboo--how does sapience factor into the erstwhile benefits of survival cannibalism? What is it that makes the taboo of cannibalism compelling in the public consciousness, and how does this intersect with cases of criminal cannibalism? I respect the decision to avoid sensationalism and over-reported criminal cases, but the lack here is conspicuous; meanwhile, using Freud to discuss taboo is cliché and, frankly, problematic. What is the cost/benefit for the evolutionary benefits versus health risks of cannibalism; where's the tipping point in that equation and what protective measures exist? Many of these answers exist by implication, and most of them are ""it's complicated,"" but I wish Schutt were bolder & reached further. The only bold conclusion he draws is a warning about the intersection of desensitization and survival cannibalism in near-future disaster situations--a lazy argument that directly conflicts the desensitized genocidal/cannibalistic human past. (All cultures are desensitized in their own special way.) I liked this well enough, the breadth of it is interesting, the science accessible; Schutt's humor conflicts sometimes with the deceptive gravity of his topic, but it makes for a readable text. But I wanted more, more depth, more asked but unanswerable questions, and that's not present here."
267,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5790437-aj-sterkel,4,"Likes: This book gave me nightmares about dying from mad cow disease. Nightmares probably don’t sound like a good thing, but if I’m thinking about a book in my sleep, it must be doing something right. Mad cow disease is especially terrifying because the British government tried to suppress info about it to protect the beef industry. Yeah . . . we’re all screwed.Anyway, I appreciate that the author looks at cannibalism from a scientific point-of-view instead of a sensationalist point-of-view. He avoids most of the serial killer talk and focuses on nature. Which animals are cannibals and why? If it’s common for animals to eat their friends, why is it rare for modern humans to do the same? Where did the taboo against cannibalism come from? (Hint: Christianity and authors with over-active imaginations.)I enjoyed most of the chapters in this book. The writing style is funnier than I expected. My favorite chapters are the ones about Christopher Columbus. I knew about the damage he did to the places he “explored,” but I didn’t know his connection to cannibalism. Queen Isabella decided that only New World cannibals could be enslaved. Selling slaves was big business, so Columbus and his followers slapped the cannibal label on pretty much everybody. I love that the author examines the history of cannibalism and how our (often irrational) fears of it have shaped the modern world. It’s a unique approach to the subject.“[T]he idea of cannibalism had become a handy symbol for unacceptable behavior practiced by “Others”—a broad and malleable category of evildoers that included enemies, followers of non-Christian religions, and any groups determined to retain their “uncivilized” customs.” – CannibalismDislikes: Since there are frogs on the cover, I expected to learn more about animal cannibalism. The first few chapters are about animals, but then the focus shifts to humans and mostly stays on humans. I wanted more animals.The author is clearly a scientist. I am definitely not a scientist. For me, the writing is too dry and sciencey (totally a real word) at times. The author goes into too much detail about a few subjects—such as kuru, a disease that humans get from eating their families. The science behind Kuru takes up so many pages that I got bored with it. The Bottom Line: One of the most educational books I’ve read this year. If you’re interested in learning about cannibalism, I recommend it. (Just prepare yourself for mad cow nightmares.)Do you like reviews, giveaways, and bookish nonsense? Good news! I have a blog for that. "

I don't know who Bill Schutt is, but man does he know how to take a pretty morbid and kind of yucky topic and turn it into something palatable. SEE WHAT I DID?Bill Schutt examines cannibalism in this world, be it in the animal kingdom, in cultural practice, or survival situations. He talks about all kinds of cannibals, from tadpoles to the Donner Party to Papua New Guinea, and puts them into a scientific and cultural context. Usually with some pretty funny anecdotes or quips to go along with it. While the sociological examinations were a bit easier for me to swallow than the scientific explanations, I quite enjoyed CANNIBALISM: A PERFECTLY NATURAL HISTORY. Schutt did a very good job of making all of these sometimes yucky and always fascinating realities very easy to understand, and didn't try to sensationalize anything around the practice of cannibalism. He also did some really interesting chapters about Mad Cow Disease and modern farming practices, which is just another example of 'progress' coming back and biting us on the butt. True, sometimes it's not for the squeamish, but Schutt delivers all this information with charm and aplomb (and even details his experience eating placenta, given to him by some enthusiastic parents). Super interesting and kind of gross too, CANNIBALISM: A PERFECTLY NATURAL HISTORY is a book I'm glad I picked up. "
269,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"This is an interesting little book. Schutt begins with detailing the frequently fascinating ways that cannibalism occurs in the natural world, and then he moves on to the history of cannibalism among the human animals. People have been eating people for a long time. When a city is under siege, or people find themselves adrift at sea without food for weeks... human beings are going to start looking increasingly delicious despite the taboos (see: Kramer in Newman's imagination in that episode of Seinfeld where he accidentally cooks himself with butter). Shutt also explores cultures where that taboo doesn't exist, and where people eat people ritualistically or simply because they taste delicious (the flavor of humans, if you were wondering, gets compared by various people to tuna, pork, and veal).And if we think the Western world is too civilized for Cannibalism, Schutt reminds us that Europeans were eating mummia (ground up Egyptian mummies, or counterfeit ground up mummies) for medicinal reasons right through the end of the Victorian age, and that the practice of placenta eating has actually been growing in recent years."
270,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"Really enjoyable read! Remember all of those awesome studies from animal behavior class, like the ones that demonstrated how many animals avoid having sex with their father, mother, sister, or brother -- chemicals inside their noses and brains help them identify ""self"" and ""non-self"", instructing them not to have sex with anything too similar to ""self"" -- or the studies that demonstrated how sexual selection could spell death for sexy males -- female fish preferred the most orange males, which drove selection toward fish so orange, they were easily spotted and gobbled up by predators -- or the other studies that outlined the many shocking behaviors and likely motivations of various animals? Well, this book is chock full of those types of studies, only they are geared solely at understanding why animals might or might not eat each other instead of why they might or might not mate with each other. Here is a sampling of the intensely interesting things you will find in well researched chapters. Black Widows:Contrary to the well held belief that female Black Widows spiders and female Preying Mantis devour their males when mating, these cannibalistic behaviors are reserved for times of great stress, such as when there is a food shortage or these animals are in captivity. Since they had only been studied in captivity, researchers were only privy to the behaviors associated with that stressor. If the Black Widow had been observed in natural conditions, when food supplies were sufficient, she would have never gotten the name ""Black Widow"". In truth, females spiders are far more often the victims of cannibalism than the perpetrators. In at least one species of spider, the females do a dance to make the males notice them and choose them to mate with. Instead of having sex, as the female intended, she made herself noticed and became a tasty treat for a male spider who, with the energy gained from eating her, moved on to court another female spider who he did choose to mate with. When times are really lean, there is a spider species who eats its own limbs! Spiders and Praying Mantis are not the only animals who do not usually practice cannibalism but turn to that behavior when they are exposed to stressful or unusual conditions. Cats, mice, rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits are all driven to cannibalism when facing similar conditions, but the hamster seems to be more prone to cannibalism than most species. If hamster siblings are kept in the same cage, they will often fight to the death at 4 weeks old, when they reach sexual maturity. The winner will eat the carcass of the loser. Though the behavior is common to many mothers, mother hamsters engage far more often in eating their young when the mother herself is handled close to the time when she gives birth or when her babies are handled when they are little. Apes:Cannibalism is generally rarer in ape species, including humans. However, when they engage in the practice, they are like other animals in that it is usually in times of stress, but not always. There have been serial killers who seem to enjoy eating their victims. There even seem to a pair of mother daughter serial killer chimpanzees, named Passion and Pom, who ate between 5 and 10 infants after attacking the new mothers. It seems it was all in an effort to obtain food. So, perhaps Passion and Pom's actions are not as unexplainable as Jeffery Dahmer's. Carnassial Dentation:The shape of teeth can tell us a lot about the evolution of various species. Schutt discussed the evolution of polar bear teeth to talk in general about how teeth, such as carnassial teeth, help meat eating species rip chunks of meet off their prey. Even though I have read a fair amount about this subject, I wasn't bored at all. In fact, I thought it was one of the better discussions on teeth and evolution. If you enjoy reading about ripping pieces of meat into smaller pieces, in order to aid digestion, I suggest you read, I Contain Multitudes as well. The author of that book, Ed Yong, gave a good bit of detail about gut microbes-- where they are placed in the gut, in front or behind -- so that the animals and the microbes both enjoy a wonderful meal. Yong discussed the types of microbes needed for a meat eating diet vs. a vegetable diet. I could not stop thinking about what Yong wrote when reading this section of Schutt's Cannibalism book. Schutt also used the polar bear section to satisfyingly discuss climate change and the stupidity of the media. Definitely worth reading. Hyenas and infanticide:Who doesn't love to eat babies? It seems that most animals who eat meat, love to eat the babies most. This seems to hold true whether it is a different species or a different species from the animal doing the eating. Chimps patrol their borders and when they encounter a female and her baby, they kill the baby and try to hook up with the female. Nothing says love like murdering her offspring. Chimps are not alone. Males from many different animal species eat babies in order to push females into estrus, so they can mate with them. One female species has evolved a protection against infanticide, and as a result is a dominant member of their clan-- the hyena. To really understand the magic of female hyena biology, it's important to understand sexual development in embryos. Embryos are genderless but have precursors to mammary glands and penises. If an embryo gets an XY chromosome the penis bud will grow, but the memory glands will not. . If the embryo receives XX, the embryo will still grow the penis bud but then get the signal to stop the growth when it is very small, leaving behind a clitoris instead of a large penis. The XX will also send a signal to grow the mammary glands. Males have nipples but cannot feed a baby. This is because they do not have XX, which makes mammary glands that allows milk to flow through the nipples. XY and XX chromosomes use hormones to signal which morphology a body should have. The XY chromosome contains testosterone, which signals the penis bud to grow into a penis . The XX chromosome contains estrogen, which is what signals the growth of mammary glands.In spotted hyenas, researchers believe a mutation developed to provide the female spotted hyena with more testosterone, resulting in a signal to grow the penis bud out more. Thus, female hyenas have a very large clitoris (elongated penis bud). Their vulva is fused shut, allowing them to pee through their clitoris/penis bud, just like a male pees through their penis. When a male wants to have sex with a female, she really has to be receptive, just as a male would have to be receptive to have sex. This is because it's actually like inserting a penis into a penis, making it virtually impossible to force a female to have sex. While evolution did them a favor in not allowing them to be raped by males, it was unkind to them in regards to birthing offspring (I am so glad that I am not a female hyena!). The cub has to come out somewhere and unfortunately it rips the vulva. That was painful to even read about. I do have to say though, this was absolutely the best discussion on hyena biology of any book I have read so far. The rest of the book:The last part of the book veered away from animal behavior and examined the more sociological aspects of cannibalism-- where the word originated, how it appeared in literature throughout the ages, and what our current conception of cannibalism is. Those aspects went on a little too long for my taste, but I can imagine other people enjoying those sections. "
271,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,4,"What an unexpectedly decent read. Unlike many others fascinated by this topic and other types of violence so prevalent on screen, I'm pretty chicken and would like to steer clear from those. Yet an article on National Geographic persuaded me to pick it up since the book seems a lot more scientific and less sensational. And I love reading about animals, and so was hoping for some light entertainment and instead got pretty educated. Writing in a conversational tone, yet packed with a lot of knowledge and terminologies that it's first time since ever that I have to repeatedly look words up, Schutt casually discusses cannibalism in the animal kingdom then gradually move to more difficult and gory scenes in human society. His presentation of China, admittedly, still hasn't convinced me, it feels like his research in China both ancient and modern time isn't rigorous enough. Yet it motivates me to read a book currently on my reading shelf about the Great Leap Forward.The book doesn't stop with cannibalism and definitely isn't a simple ""objective"" piece of writing describing the phenomenon. Schutt inserts his argument on religion, colonialism, on climate change, on modern obsession with violence, on the government and the economy. He talks bluntly about unsolved issue in the study of some infectious disease. All in all, the book leaves me with goose bumps, some fear, certainly aroused neocortex.And fun fact, now I really know the origin of ""Soylent"", my favorite meal replacement these days. What an ironic naming."
272,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3123067-elizabeth-a,4,"Book blurb: Eating one’s own kind is completely natural behavior in thousands of species, including humans. Throughout history we have engaged in cannibalism for reasons of famine, burial rites, and medicinal remedies; it’s been used as a way to terrorize and even a way to show filial piety. Today, the subject of humans consuming one another has been relegated to the realm of horror movies, fiction, and the occasional psychopath, but be forewarned: As climate change progresses and humans see more famine, disease, and overcrowding, biological and cultural constraints may well disappear. I listened to the audiobook which was well narrated by Tom Perkins.One of my fave questions to ask at parties (I kid you not): Say you are starving and your survival is at stake. Do you feel differently about eating a person who is already dead, as opposed to killing someone to eat? Try it at your next gathering and report back.This book hits my sweet spot on so many levels. Most people tend to be really squeamish about the topic, but if you're not a vegetarian, what's all the fuss about? Who decided that we can eat some animals and not others? Besides, if you think that cannibalism is awful, you might want to put it in perspective. Considering the horrid historical accounts of human behavior, eating your fellow Sapiens doesn't really seem all that bad.This is a fun, informative, and eye opening book, and I learned so many things about the animal kingdom I had no idea about. I'll bet school would be much more interesting if some of these topics were incorporated into the curriculum. I could talk about some of the specifics, but then that'd spoil all the fun for you. I assure you that it's full of fascinating and juicy tidbits. The author stays away from sensational crime stories, so if you are looking for recipes, look elsewhere, but if you are willing to have ""no way!"" moments, and are willing to annoy your loved ones by constantly saying ""did you know?"", move this up your TBR.This will end up on my best of 2017 reads, and the only reason I docked a star is due to the fact that there are sections, like the final chapters, where the author gets side tracked and wanders off topic."
273,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3078602-peacegal,4,"Fans of Mary Roach's popular science books will devour CANNIBALISM, a tour of the taboo topic throughout the natural world and human history. From Tyrannosaurus rex to the Donner Party, from tadpoles who eat their siblings to American uberbreeders who dine on placenta, readers will at turns be entertained, saddened, and disgusted by the facts within--but they will always be educated. There is one point on which I'd like to add something to the text on chicken cannibalism within factory farm conditions. The author writes that pecking deaths became a widespread concern when intensive chicken farming first took hold in the 1940s. Thus, the chicken industry developed the practice of debeaking, in which the end of each chick's beak is cut or seared off to hobble them from aggressively pecking one another. The author writes that chicken ""blinder"" masks were invented in the 40s as a supposedly more humane alternative, and words it in such a way that these masks have replaced debeaking in the poultry industry today. Erm, no. While blinders are occasionally used, most notably in the intensive rearing of pheasants for release-and-shoot canned hunts, debeaking remains the rule of the day for billions of hens raised for meat and egg production. (The sheer amount of birds raised coupled with the rapidity with which beaks can be cut or seared ensures this.) Not to say that blinder masks are such a pleasant alternative. They are frequently affixed by shoving a bar through the animal's nostrils. "

Looks like that 1% of the total population could have cannibalistic tendencies but on disasters time, everybody becomes one. "
276,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,5,"Bill Schutt is a writer I really appreciate and enjoy. I read Dark Banquet a few years ago and loved it. He is for me sort of the Neil DeGrasse tyson of biology/animal behavior (human animals included). He is a wonderful storyteller and the structures of his books are clear and accessible and well-organized but also scientifically and sociologically and culturally incisive, and meandering in nice ways. He takes on a specific topic and stays with it in his way, but at the same time, explores it from many angles. He is curious and his interest and curiosity are evident in his writing. He clearly relishes exploring ideas, behaviors and histories and does not look away from the absurdity and violence of human cultures. In this book, in addition to providing insight into various and common cannibalistic behaviors throughout the animal kingdom, he interrogates human cultural and ideological relationships to cannibalism. He asks the question: are our monotheistic western cultures' ideas about and fear and hatred of cannibalism of a genetic origin in any way, or purely cultural. He talks of the devastating irony--how Europeans used the idea of the inherent evil of cannibalism to justify the brutal massacre of unnumbered non-European peoples who may or may not have engaged in cannibalistic rituals. I love the illustrations in the book. I love how Schutt takes myths and legends about certain animals acts or habits of cannibalism and offers a much more complex and nuanced picture. He puts some myths to rest. He offers many fascinating particulars in their places, including stories of physiological changes (epigenetic?) in certain aquatic and semiaquatic (and maybe other? can't recall) animals who engage in filial cannibalism. Also, there's a fantastic section about some messy, dart-throwing gastropods. Clearly, I am a fan of the book and recommend it highly.here's a quote from intro:Is it really a surprise, though, that our greatest cinematic villain is a man-eating psychiatrist while the mild-mannered runner-up is based on a real-life cannibal killer? Perhaps not, if one considers that many cultures share the belief that consuming another human is the worst (or close to the worst) behavior that a person can undertake. As a result, real-life cannibalistic psychopaths like Jeffrey Dahmer (another Wisconsin native) and his Russian counterpart, Andrei Chikatilo, have attained something akin to mythical status in the annals of history’s most notorious murderers. Whether through a filter of fictionalization, where man-eating deviants are transformed into powerful antiheroes, or through tabloids sensationalizing the crimes of real-life cannibals, these tales feed our obsession with all things gruesome—an obsession that is now an acceptable facet of our society.A different attitude was taken toward “primitive” social or ethnic groups whose members might not have shared the Western take on cannibalism taboos. At best, these “savages” were pegged as souls to be saved, but only if they met certain requirements. In the first half of the 20th century, for example, explorers and the missionaries who followed them ventured into the foreboding New Guinea highlands and quickly imposed one hard-and-fast rule for the locals: Cannibalism in any form was strictly forbidden.But far worse instances of cultural intrusion occurred elsewhere and throughout history, as those accused of consuming other humans, for any reason, were brutalized, enslaved, and murdered. The most infamous example of this practice began during the last years of the 15th century when millions of indigenous people living in the Caribbean and Mexico were summarily reclassified as cannibals for reasons that had little to do with people-eating. Instead, it paved the way for them to be robbed, beaten, conquered, and slain, all at the whim of their new Spanish masters.Similar atrocities were carried out on a massive scale by a succession of flag-planting European powers who (if one believes their accounts) wrested South America, Africa, and the Indo-Pacific away from man-eating savages, whose behavior placed them beyond the pale of anything that could remotely be described as human.So were European fears about cannibalism simply an invention used to justify conquest, or were there cultures, including those encountered by the Spaniards, where the consumption of humans was regarded as normal behavior? Although defining someone as a cannibal became an effective way to dehumanize them, there is also evidence that ritual cannibalism, as embodied in various customs related to funerary rites and warfare, occurred throughout history.As I began studying these forms of cannibalism, I sought to determine not only their perceived functions, but just how widespread they were or weren’t. Surprisingly—or perhaps not surprisingly given the subject matter—there is disagreement among anthropologists regarding ritual cannibalism. Some deny that it ever occurred, while others claim that the behavior did occur but was uncommon. Still others claim that cannibalism was practiced by many cultures throughout history and for a variety of reasons. One such body of evidence led me straight back to European history, where I learned that a particularly macabre form of cannibalism had been practiced for hundreds of years by nobility, physicians, and commoners alike, even into the 20th century.As a zoologist, I was, of course, intrigued at the prospect of documenting cases of non-human cannibalism. Looking back now, I can see that I’d started my inquiry with something less than a completely open mind. Part of me reasoned that since cannibalism was presumably a rare occurrence in humans (at least in modern times), it would likely be similarly rare in the animal kingdom.Once I dug further, though, I discovered that cannibalism differs in frequency between major animal groups—nonexistent in some and common in others. It varies from species to species and even within the same species, depending on local environmental conditions. Cannibalism also serves a variety of functions, depending on the cannibal. There are even examples in which an individual being cannibalized receives a benefit.In several instances, cannibalism appears to have arisen only recently in a species, and human activity might be the cause. In one such case, news reports informed horrified audiences that some of the most highly recognizable animals on the planet were suddenly consuming their own young. “Polar bears resort to cannibalism as Arctic ice shrinks,” reported CNN, while the Times of London echoed the sentiment: “Climate Change Forcing Polar Bears to Become Cannibals.” It was Reuters, though, that scored a perfect ten on the gruesome scale with an online slide show in which an adult polar bear was seen carrying around the still cute-as-a button head of a dead cub, the remains of its spinal cord trailing behind like a red streamer.The real story behind polar bear [contextualized in book...] cannibalism turned out to be just as fascinating, though it would also serve as a perfect example of how many accusations of and stories about cannibalism throughout history were untrue, unproven, or exaggerated—distorted by sensationalism, deception, a lack of scientific knowledge, and just plain bad writing. With the passage of time, these accounts too often become part of the historical record, their errors long forgotten. Part of my job would be to expose those errors.I was also extremely curious to see if the origin of cannibalism taboos could be traced back to the natural world, so I developed a pair of alternative hypotheses. Perhaps our aversion to consuming our own kind is hardwired into our brains and as such is a part of our genetic blueprint—a gene or two whose expression selects against such behavior. I reasoned that if such a built-in deterrent exists, then humans and most non-humans (with the exception of a few well-known anomalies such as black widow spiders and praying mantises) would avoid cannibalism at all costs. Thus, the taboo would have a biological foundation.Conversely, I weighed the possibility that the revulsion most people have at the very mention of cannibalism might stem solely from our culture. Of course, this led to even more questions. What are the cultural roots of the cannibalism taboo and how has it become so widespread? I also wondered why, as disgusted as we are at the very thought of cannibalism, we’re so utterly fascinated by it? Might cannibalism have been more common in our ancestors, before societal rules turned it into something abhorrent? I looked for evidence in the fossil record and elsewhere.Finally, I considered what it would take to break down the biological or cultural constraints that prevent us from eating each other on a regular basis. Could there come a time, in our not-so-distant future, when human cannibalism becomes commonplace? And for that matter, was it already becoming a more frequent occurrence? The answers to these questions are far from certain but, then again, there is much about the topic of cannibalism that cannot be neatly divided into black and white. Likely or not, though, the circumstances that might lead to outbreaks of widespread cannibalism in the 21st century are grounded in science, not science fiction.My aim was to stay away from the clichéd ideas about cannibalism that are already ingrained in our collective psyche and, with such a wealth of relevant material to explore, I quickly realized that this wouldn’t be difficult. Even the most famous cannibal stories, it turned out, had factual gaps that are only now being filled. In the case of the Donner Party, for example, I joined researchers whose scientific approach to the most infamous cannibalism-related event in American history had shed new light on this 19th-century tale of stranded pioneers.I’ve tried to approach each example from a scientific viewpoint, delving into what I considered the most intriguing aspects of anthropology, evolution, and biology to provide the broadest yet most engaging natural history of this behavior. What happens to our bodies and minds under starvation conditions? Why are women better equipped to survive starvation than men? And what physiological extremes would compel someone to consume the body of a friend or even a family member?But it’s not just the abundance of eggs and young that makes fish such a popular menu item for members of their own species. Many terrestrial vertebrates produce few or even a single offspring, and most of these newly born or newly hatched individuals already exhibit considerable body size. In many fish species, the extraordinary number of eggs produced imposes a limit on their size, and so a full-grown cod might be a million times (or six orders of magnitude) larger than its own eggs. This fact goes a long way to explain why the majority of them exhibit about as much individual recognition of their offspring as humans do for a handful of raisins. Fish eggs, larvae, and fry (i.e., young fish) are vast in number, minute in size, and high in nutritional value. This makes them an abundant, nonthreatening, and easily collected food source. It’s also why ichthyologists consider the absence of cannibalism in fishes, rather than its presence, to be the exceptional case."

I believed this book would focus more on canabalism in the animal world and then BRIEFLY connect this to human cannibalism. It didnt happen this way. I was so fascinated by the instances of cannabilism in the animal world and, surprisingly, the sections I read on human cannibalism were dull. This could have been due to it focusing mostly on references to cannibalism in early literature and focusing so heavily on the story of the Donner's. I lost interest at this point and just never picked it back up.

I did both the whole day).Cannibalism is a history and an explanation of the act. But don't worry, the author doesn't start with the stomach churning human eating human stuff right away. He starts with the 'lighter' stuff - cannibalism by non-humans.The book starts by defining the various types of cannibalism - of which I remember two: eating your family members and eating people of your species who aren't related to you. Then it gets defined even further, to things like filial cannibalism (parents eating children or vice versa), cannibalism during mating (turns out the Black Widow Spider has been maligned.After going through all these decidedly non-humans, the author slowly makes his way back to us.If I were to generalise, I'd say that the book says that cannibalism tends to be a response to specific conditions (overcrowding, lack of nutrition, etc). Although in humans, there are ritual cannibals. Oh, and grey areas like breastfeeding (if skin cells come off) and I can't remember what else. (For the record, I am in no way justifying cannibalism in the whole 'eat literal human flesh' form)Although I was really surprised about the fact that ritual cannibalism existed in Chinese culture, especially as an act of filial piety. Then I remembered stories about sons cutting their thighs to feed their parents (though I can't remember from where) and I realised that IS cannibalism "
280,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34493714-yasaman,3,"An interesting read. Schutt's overall take on cannibalism - especially in non-human species - is that it essentially occurs either as a mechanism for passing on genetic information to the next generation, or to ensure your and/or your offspring's survival and conservation of energy, which again goes back to making sure genetic information is passed on. So, from an evolutionary standpoint, it makes perfect sense, especially considering that most species do not rely on behaviors/methods such as altruism and Kin selection for their fitness rates. When the topic is discussed in regards to humans, there is also ritualistic and medicinal cannibalism to consider, which Schutt explains is a lot more common than expected. What I liked about Schutt's discussion on the topic is that he shows the hypocrisy of viewpoints regarding ritualistic cannibalism based on which group of people is practicing it (i.e. indigenous people or white European Christians?). But, interestingly, it was also what I didn't like about the book in general: Firstly, Schutt oversimplifies the practice based on strict definitions (I hardly think biting fingernails and eating organs such as liver should fall under the same category,) and, secondly, he doesn't seem overly concerned about explaining that just because something is a cultural influence and seemingly widespread, it doesn't make it any less wrong to do."
281,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6314574-allisonlcarter,3,"While starting in the animal kingdom seems a logical place to start a conversation about cannibalism, this book gets bogged down in the world of weird sex snails and spiders for far too long. What makes cannibalism of such enduring interest is that it's fundamentally a question of whether it is moral to eat a human body under any circumstances. Since morality is, in most cases, relative, this is an endlessly fascinating question for homo sapiens and varies widely from culture to culture. Since animals do not have ethical frameworks that we are aware of, knowing that this invertebrate or that eats each other is less interesting, except in the broadest way.When Schutt does get to human consumption, he mostly covers familiar ground -- the Donner Party, Papua New Guinea, etc. The book shines in a few chapters that skirt the issue of why cannibalism is taboo in Western culture and examines the practice in China. The book is capped off with a long exploration of mad cow disease, which, since the cows didn't choose to engage in cannibalism or derive an evolutionary advantage from it, seems out of place.Still, the book is immaculately researched and Schutt has an amusingly wry sense of humor."

I'm just putting that out there now because the only really interesting Cannibal was Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The dude wore ties to work. That's class.The taboo of cannibalism is exactly what lead me to this book. Working in a library I regularly stock the ""New Books"" section and everyday I saw the book with it's distinct cover. Curiosity got the better of me and I checked the book out and read it in a week. The reader may not think themselves terribly interested in the idea of reading about the history and practice of cannibalism as an act, but they're missing out because there's also loads of biology.Schutt manages to write an easy, approachable book about an act that many people would rather not discuss, but as he points out in his introduction the fact that nobody wants to talk about is reason enough to discuss it. Schutt approaches the book at the start as a biologist, a zoologist to be specific, and just tries to understand biologically why cannibalism takes place in the wild in natural conditions. Once this is done he tackles the human element and it's here that the reader will be able to see that the issue becomes complicated. I won't lie, there are some elements of this book hat can be troubling (the eating of kids during the siege of Stalingrad just about broke me), but this book was approachable and enjoyable to read. It was only in the last three chapters that the writing began to grow a little tiresome, but even in these closing pages the book still felt strong and by it's end I felt as if I had really learned something about the natural world while also being warned about the possible future.Cannibalism isn't a fun topic unless it involves Anthony Hopkins (damn I broke my first rule) but it is an important topic and Schott succeeds in demonstrating that, yes, it does deserve an entire book to itself."

But I thought this one sounded interesting, and it turns out I really loved it! Bill Schutt has a great style that alternates between clear, concise explanations of biological concepts, overviews of research fields and more personal narratives and interviews he had with other scientists. To be clear, this is emphatically not a book about cannibal crimes (in fact, the author devotes only a few paragraphs to such murderers, and states that he both feels that fields has been covered more than enough, and that he doesn't want to be disrespectful towards victims and their families). What it is, is a journey through cannibalism as a biological and social mechanism, starting from examples of various animals and the research done on different species, before moving on to an investigation whether those same mechanisms come into play for humans and how different human cultures have viewed cannibalism throughout history. I actually feel like I've learned a lot about topics I didn't know much about, and had good time while acquiring that knowledge - a perfect combination!"
284,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24590339-k-willows,4,"This is informative & well rounded, but leans heavily on the side of serious science writing (as opposed to more casual/humorous science writing). It does have its bits of humor but overall this is a book I'd recommend to science minded people interested in learning more about the cultural taboo of cannibalism. I felt that the final 3 chapters could have been condensed down. I would have liked to read more about the Aghori of India but they were surprisingly unmentioned. Finally, for true crime nerds, this book does not go into depth regarding the cannibalistic killers, but I felt the author had good reason for avoiding that subject and the sensationalism that comes with it."
285,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46502154-anna,4,"Obviously, it's not for everyone but as someone who's been interested in cannibalism for a very long time (don't ask me why) I found it both interesting and informative. It's certainly the best and the most scientific book I've read on the subject so far. I was a bit worried that my English might fail me because the author is a biologist but luckily I had no problems understanding what he was talking about. What I liked the most was that Bill Schutt covered a very wide range of types of cannibalism and - unlike many other authors - didn't focus on serial killers/psychopaths (they are mentioned at the beginning so it might be a disappointment to those readers who were hoping for more) and sensational stories about tribes consuming human flesh like it's tacos. As an avid fan of animal documentaries I was the most interested in the first part of the book (even though I knew many of the facts Schutt talked about) and I was slightly bored towards the end when he focused on diseases (ones rumoured to be transmitted through infected human meat). But I honestly appreciate how thorough and detailed the research was."
286,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12256655-alisa,4,"I found this to be a very interesting book. I understand the subject matter isn't for everyone but it's not done is a sensational way. The books take a more scientific and anthropological look at cannibalism. There is only a small amount of coverage of human cannibalism. Much more is on the animal kingdom. I found this super interesting and I definitely recommend it to those of you interested in science, anthropology and history. **ARC provided through Netgalley**"
287,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22710459-leah,5,This book is very fun and very gross and gets in several digs at Jared Diamond
288,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1702050-fox,5,"I've been eagerly awaiting this book since I first became aware of its release, which was likely due to Daphne's review. Cannibalism is an undeniably fascinating subject, and  Bill Schutt tackles it with grace and humor, as long for a disdain for the sensationalism that has too long colored all publications on the topic. The book was fascinating from cover to cover, and is extremely well-organized. It begins with the study of it in the animal kingdom, and ends with the much needed topic of prion diseases, their spread, and how poorly understood they are. Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History is destined to become the go-to book on the topic. Well sourced, entertainingly written, and scattered throughout with just enough humor and a large dose of respect, it does its topic justice.  Bill Schutt writes with a deft hand that does much to dispel many of the sensationalized myths that surround some of the better known cases (i.e. Donner Party, Praying Mantises, Black Widows, etc.) and does a good job explaining topics that have never really gotten enough focus (i.e. prion diseases, kuru) or have suffered from the wrong type of focus.This book was immensely readable, and more in depth and well-sourced than I expected a pop-science book to be. It definitely opened my eyes to the complexity of the topic, and added to disdain I already felt towards one Jared Diamond and his tendency to over simplify nearly everything. I'm very much looking forward to more being published in regards to the Neanderthal hypotheses presented in this book, as well as for more studies being done on the truly terrifying prion diseases. Nothing terrifies me more than the section on prion diseases in this book, and what it may hold in store for our future."
289,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1424908-map,4,"I won a kindle version of this book as a Goodreads Giveaway.I've seen some reviews on here claiming that this book is dry and overly scientific, but I have to disagree. As a psychologist who got my start in animal behaviorism, I appreciated Schutt's precise and behavioral descriptions of animals as opposed to engaging in anthropomorphism. I also found him to have a very dry wit that livened up the chapters without making them unscientific.The first few chapters, focusing primarily on animals, felt less cohesive than the ones focused on humans, which seemed more clearly delineated into categories of cannibalism or specific instances. But all of it was entertaining and engaging.On the downside, as my husband lived in England between 1988-1990, I'm relatively sure he'll die of Mad Cow Disease any day now. When I mentioned this to him, his response was, ""Oh yes, I'm actually not allowed to donate blood because I lived in England during that time."" Wonderful."
290,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61034045-chuy-ruiz,4,"I was given this book as a gift and I definitely enjoyed reading it. It isn't a book that I would have probably picked out myself, so it was great to still learn plenty and find it interesting. It explores the topic of cannibalism in non-human animals at first, then moves on to the social taboos in most cultures around the practice. It takes a skeptical approach to the claims of cannibalism in any culture and looks for actual hard evidence of it, instead of just second hand claims and anecdotal claims. It also explores the potential causes and ramifications of cannibalism in an interesting and engaging way."
291,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1961913-na-amen,4,"Overall I really liked this book. There were some small moments of throwaway lines where I felt the objectivity of the author slipped and some cultural/biological prejudices reared their heads. A good study of cannibalism in nature across species that stayed away from sensationalism, even while discussing the Donner party."
292,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3237385-melissa,5,"4.5* I flew through this! I can't remember the last time I struggled to put down nonfiction. Schutt makes a point of avoiding the sensational, but that doesn't prevent his book from being fascinating and engrossing. I also appreciated how he pointed out conflicting points of view / arguments between scholars, especially when it came to human cannibalistic behaviors."
293,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8071101-jeanne,2,"I found this book a difficult read. It read more like a science proof paper than general interest book. There were some very interesting concepts presented, but it was not an enjoyable read. And, warning: do not read this book while eating lunch!"

295,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49782194-conor-ahern,4,"There are very few things I find myself getting squeamish about, but cannibalism is one of them. It's not so much the Donner-Party, necessity-of-survival type cannibalism that bothers me, either--hunger knows no morality and forces normal people to do things that they might ordinarily find horrific. It's more of the victim-of-cannibalization type that makes me shudder. I suppose on some fundamental level, I believe that it's wrong for humans to be used as means to an end, and succumbing by way of cannibalization seems to be the ultimate example of that; your life and your body reduced to the fulfillment of some fetish that by its very nature assigns you no greater value than a head of cattle. These were probably the hardest parts of this book for me. Stories of cannibalism in the animal kingdom and its evolutionary advantages were much more interesting than unsettling. This book got me thinking of other taboos, things that are so ingrained that logic alone can't account for the aversion. The only others that came to mind were incest and pedophilia, but at least by degree those things operate in contemporary societies as norms, and certainly have done so to a greater extent in the past. But it's not like the British or the Yoruba have a tradition of eating, say, an arm but would draw the line there; unlike with the other two types of taboos I mentioned, cannibalism seems much more to be an all-or-nothing type of convention. While societies all over the world permit relationships that we might regard as incestuous or pedophilic, it seems that societies that countenance what we would describe as cannibalism are few and far between. And I guess it's Schutt's goal to show that this is more of a Western taboo, which is interesting. He points to our Greek and Shakespearean cautionary tales as powerfully inculcating the supposed evil of cannibalism, and then looks to China for examples that, at the very least, cannibalism wasn't regarded there in such black-and-white terms, citing Imperial delicacies including human flesh and conventions whereby parents would trade children with other families during times of hunger so as to avoid having to consume their own children. China is a big place with a lot of people and a ton of recorded history, though, so you're bound to come across anything sooner or later, right?I think the interesting thing for me has been that I gave it a fair shot but in the end I simply can't get over the taboo. Much as I try, and Chinese evidence to the contrary placed before me, I cannot get past the idea that it's wrong, with nothing more articulate than that to say about it! Oh well, I'm only human. This book was often funny and takes a light touch. Very worth chewing over, if you can stomach it!"
296,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/616321-juushika,3,"This is a decent overview of the history and biology of cannibalism. The zoological studies are diverse and broad, and make effective arguments about the causes and therefore evolutionary benefits of cannibalism. It lines up nicely with the human studies which investigate these same causes, particularly privation. The issue of evolutionary benefit for humans is of course more complicated, and Schutt takes a variety of approaches, looking at cannibalism both as an act and as a social concept, and this latter--particular the role of (accusations of) cannibalism in justifications for genocide--gives the book depth.But I have too many unanswered questions: What are the ethics of murder versus eating the already-dead versus cannibalism as a social taboo--how does sapience factor into the erstwhile benefits of survival cannibalism? What is it that makes the taboo of cannibalism compelling in the public consciousness, and how does this intersect with cases of criminal cannibalism? I respect the decision to avoid sensationalism and over-reported criminal cases, but the lack here is conspicuous; meanwhile, using Freud to discuss taboo is cliché and, frankly, problematic. What is the cost/benefit for the evolutionary benefits versus health risks of cannibalism; where's the tipping point in that equation and what protective measures exist? Many of these answers exist by implication, and most of them are ""it's complicated,"" but I wish Schutt were bolder & reached further. The only bold conclusion he draws is a warning about the intersection of desensitization and survival cannibalism in near-future disaster situations--a lazy argument that directly conflicts the desensitized genocidal/cannibalistic human past. (All cultures are desensitized in their own special way.) I liked this well enough, the breadth of it is interesting, the science accessible; Schutt's humor conflicts sometimes with the deceptive gravity of his topic, but it makes for a readable text. But I wanted more, more depth, more asked but unanswerable questions, and that's not present here."
297,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5790437-aj-sterkel,4,"Likes: This book gave me nightmares about dying from mad cow disease. Nightmares probably don’t sound like a good thing, but if I’m thinking about a book in my sleep, it must be doing something right. Mad cow disease is especially terrifying because the British government tried to suppress info about it to protect the beef industry. Yeah . . . we’re all screwed.Anyway, I appreciate that the author looks at cannibalism from a scientific point-of-view instead of a sensationalist point-of-view. He avoids most of the serial killer talk and focuses on nature. Which animals are cannibals and why? If it’s common for animals to eat their friends, why is it rare for modern humans to do the same? Where did the taboo against cannibalism come from? (Hint: Christianity and authors with over-active imaginations.)I enjoyed most of the chapters in this book. The writing style is funnier than I expected. My favorite chapters are the ones about Christopher Columbus. I knew about the damage he did to the places he “explored,” but I didn’t know his connection to cannibalism. Queen Isabella decided that only New World cannibals could be enslaved. Selling slaves was big business, so Columbus and his followers slapped the cannibal label on pretty much everybody. I love that the author examines the history of cannibalism and how our (often irrational) fears of it have shaped the modern world. It’s a unique approach to the subject.“[T]he idea of cannibalism had become a handy symbol for unacceptable behavior practiced by “Others”—a broad and malleable category of evildoers that included enemies, followers of non-Christian religions, and any groups determined to retain their “uncivilized” customs.” – CannibalismDislikes: Since there are frogs on the cover, I expected to learn more about animal cannibalism. The first few chapters are about animals, but then the focus shifts to humans and mostly stays on humans. I wanted more animals.The author is clearly a scientist. I am definitely not a scientist. For me, the writing is too dry and sciencey (totally a real word) at times. The author goes into too much detail about a few subjects—such as kuru, a disease that humans get from eating their families. The science behind Kuru takes up so many pages that I got bored with it. The Bottom Line: One of the most educational books I’ve read this year. If you’re interested in learning about cannibalism, I recommend it. (Just prepare yourself for mad cow nightmares.)Do you like reviews, giveaways, and bookish nonsense? Good news! I have a blog for that. "
298,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4876063-elphareads,4,"I mean, just look at the title of this. CANNIBALISM: A PERFECTLY NATURAL HISTORY? How could I not? I don't know who Bill Schutt is, but man does he know how to take a pretty morbid and kind of yucky topic and turn it into something palatable. SEE WHAT I DID?Bill Schutt examines cannibalism in this world, be it in the animal kingdom, in cultural practice, or survival situations. He talks about all kinds of cannibals, from tadpoles to the Donner Party to Papua New Guinea, and puts them into a scientific and cultural context. Usually with some pretty funny anecdotes or quips to go along with it. While the sociological examinations were a bit easier for me to swallow than the scientific explanations, I quite enjoyed CANNIBALISM: A PERFECTLY NATURAL HISTORY. Schutt did a very good job of making all of these sometimes yucky and always fascinating realities very easy to understand, and didn't try to sensationalize anything around the practice of cannibalism. He also did some really interesting chapters about Mad Cow Disease and modern farming practices, which is just another example of 'progress' coming back and biting us on the butt. True, sometimes it's not for the squeamish, but Schutt delivers all this information with charm and aplomb (and even details his experience eating placenta, given to him by some enthusiastic parents). Super interesting and kind of gross too, CANNIBALISM: A PERFECTLY NATURAL HISTORY is a book I'm glad I picked up. "
299,1616204621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"This is an interesting little book. Schutt begins with detailing the frequently fascinating ways that cannibalism occurs in the natural world, and then he moves on to the history of cannibalism among the human animals. People have been eating people for a long time. When a city is under siege, or people find themselves adrift at sea without food for weeks... human beings are going to start looking increasingly delicious despite the taboos (see: Kramer in Newman's imagination in that episode of Seinfeld where he accidentally cooks himself with butter). Shutt also explores cultures where that taboo doesn't exist, and where people eat people ritualistically or simply because they taste delicious (the flavor of humans, if you were wondering, gets compared by various people to tuna, pork, and veal).And if we think the Western world is too civilized for Cannibalism, Schutt reminds us that Europeans were eating mummia (ground up Egyptian mummies, or counterfeit ground up mummies) for medicinal reasons right through the end of the Victorian age, and that the practice of placenta eating has actually been growing in recent years."
