0,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29247564-alison-anderson,4,"I read this book because Mr Marsh operated on a friend of mine who had a brain tumour - she sadly died, but 5 years after her surgery. Some throwaway lines such as ""I like to wash my female patients' hair"" rang true - she had wonderful long hair and she found it very moving that her surgeon made her hair beautiful again after the mess that accompanies brain surgery.As a fellow doctor , I both liked his honesty but also realised he must be impossible to work with. Other asides which are very revealing - "" I think most of my colleagues dislike me"" and the story of him throwing out fellow surgeons from ""his"" neurosurgery restroom reveals a lot of insight into how he is viewed at work. Other statements such as "" I do not allow junior doctors or medical students in my clinic"" - are just exasperating - how do they learn then? How did Henry Marsh himself learn?? ie from watching others.However, although he is known to all at St Georges as quite a maverick, he also brilliantly explores the human side of having to make potentially earth-shattering decisions every day - in my job, I can usually phone the patient back, or see them again, if I am not 100% perfect on the day. In neurosurgery, a tiny lapse of concentration or just sheer bad luck, renders the patient potentially paralysed or dead, or worse - he does explain what is worse.....Neurosurgeons are often accused ( by other doctors) of behaving as if they were God, and being immensely condescending to others - but here you get to see the other side of the coin - knowing you CAN operate but having to decide if you SHOULD, having to go and see a patient you have rendered paralysed, or at least, failed to cure, having to cope with the huge expectations, and huge anger and disappointment of relatives, and so on.In highlighting so many cases where things have gone wrong, perhaps Henry Marsh does himself a disservice - after all, to many of his patients, including my friend, he is viewed as wonderfully kind, reassurring, capable - everything one would wish for if you have to undergo such a frightening procedure. As well as these cases where often he shows things not turning out well, he has performed hundreds of operations that have been huge successes.And there is the interesting part of this book - you start out feeling irritated/bored with some of the medical descriptions, and exasperated by his ""I am God"" behaviour - but by the end you see him (and other surgeons like him) as normal human beings, bravely doing what most of us couldn't cope with, and somehow still retaining his humanity and care.A very interesting book"

2,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,5,"An intensely readable book about Henry Marsh's experiences as a neurosurgeon, working for St George's Hospital, under the British National Health Service. It also describes the charity work he does at a hospital in the Ukraine, working in incredibly difficult conditions. He's funny......and pompous yet humble..... and a brilliant yet vulnerable man, who is not above throwing the occasional wobbly when one of the ghastly NHS computers behaves badly. His other great bête noir is a hatred of administration generally (of which there is an endless amount in hospitals), and in particular the myriad health and safety rules which intrude upon his life as a doctor. But he has a kinder view towards people - especially towards his patients.Until reading this book I hadn't really taken on board the full implications of what can happen if brain surgery goes wrong. You can be left unable to speak, or paralysed down one side, or even in a completely vegetative state for the rest of your life. And if the stories in this book are anything to go by - the risks are quite high. Even if the risk is seemingly fairly low - say 5% - I personally would prefer not to be operated upon. If the outcome of the operation going wrong was death, that would be an okay alternative (for me), but given that the outcome can be life, but a grossly diminished life? For me then the cost would be too high. The brain is an incredibly difficult thing to operate on. There are risks. And when things go wrong they can go horribly wrong. Even for experienced surgeons, the challenges are often enormous.On the other hand, experience shows that when faced with the prospect of death, we often cling on to life with desperation. Marsh has seen this time and time again, as people beg to be operated upon, and then later, to be operated on again, to squeeze just a few more months out of life. ""(I) wondered, yet again, as I walked away down the dark hospital corridor, at the way we cling so tightly to life and how there would be so much less suffering if we did not. Life without hope is hopelessly difficult but at the end hope can so easily make fools of us all."" I hope deeply that should I find myself in this position, I would be able to let go....I will end on a happier note, albeit one peppered with expletives. It illustrates the frustration that hospital staff experience in the day-to-day care that they try and give their patients. It is a long extract, but it made me laugh. (view spoiler)[ ""Let's look at the scan,"" I said. I had seen it two days earlier but I see so many scans every day that I have to have the scan immediately in front of me whenever I see a patient if I am not to make a mistake.""This may take a while,"" I added. ""The scans are on the computer network of your local hospital and this is then linked over the net to our system..."" As I spoke I typed on the keyboard looking for the icon for his hospital's X-ray network. I found it and summoned up a password box. I have lost count of the number of different passwords I now need to get my work done every day. I spent five minutes failing to get into the system. I was painfully aware of the anxious man and his family watching my every move, waiting to hear if I would be reading him his death sentence or not.""It was so much easier in the past,"" I sighed, pointing at the redundant light-screen in front of my desk. ""Just thirty seconds to put an X-ray film up onto the X-ray screen. I've tried every bloody password I know."" I could have added that the previous week I had had to send four of the twelve patients home from the clinic without having been able to see their scans, so that the appointments had been entirely wasted and the patients made even more anxious and unhappy.....I rang Gail (Marsh's secretary) but she was unable to solve the problem. She gave me the number of the X-ray department but when I tried it I only got an answering machine in reply.""Excuse me,"" I said. I'll go upstairs to see if I can get one of the X-ray secretaries to help."" So I hurried past the waiting patients in the subterranean waiting room and ran up the two flights of stairs to the X-ray department....""Where is Caroline?"" I shouted as I arrived at the X-ray reception desk, a little out of breath.""Well, she's about somewhere,"" came the reply so I headed off round the department and eventually I found her and explained the problem.""Have you tried your password?""""Yes, I bloody well have.""""Well, try Mr Johnston's. That usually works. Fuck Off 45. He hates computers.""""Why forty-five?""""It's the forty-fifth month since we signed onto that hospital's system and one has to change the password every month,"" Caroline replied.So I ran down the corridor and down the stairs and past the waiting patients back to the consultation room.""Apparently the best passwords is Fuck Off 45,"" I told the patient and his parents, who were still waiting to hear his possible death sentence. They laughed nervously.I duly typed in 'Fuck Off 45' but, having thought about it, and having told me that is was 'checking my credentials' the computer told me that the password was not recognised. I tried typing in Fuck Off 45 in many different ways, upper case, lower case, with spaces, without spaces. I typed in Fuck Off 44 and Fuck Off 46, but without success. I ran back upstairs a second time, followed by the curious, anxious eyes of the patients in the waiting area. The clinic was now running late and the number of patients waiting to see me was steadily growing.I went back to the X-ray Department and found Caroline at her desk. I told her that Fuck Off 45 did not work.""Well,"" she sighed,""I'd better come and look. Maybe you don't know how to spell Fuck Off""We went downstairs together and returned to the consultation room.""Now that I think of it,"" She said. ""It might have become Fuck Off 47."" She typed in 'Fuck Off 47' and the computer, having checked my credentials - although they were really Mr Johnston's - to its satisfaction, finally downloaded the menu for the X-ray department at the patient's hospital.

3,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23743588-erika,4,"4.5 stars. The Goodread’s description of Do No Harm talks about the books’ “astonishing compassion and candor” and says it’s “it is a lesson in the need for hope when faced with life's most difficult decisions.” I’m thinking whoever wrote that only read half the book. English neurosurgeon Henry Marsh does write beautifully about brain surgery. There certainly is great compassion and candor, and he’s fascinating on the topic of the human brain—how it works and what can go wrong with it. There are engaging narratives here, and Marsh has a way of dropping a story and picking it up again that kept me eagerly waiting to find out what would happen to each of the patients he depicts But, Do No Harm is not “a lesson in the need for hope.” Hope doesn’t even factor into it. Instead, this is part medical memoir and part impassioned rant against England’s National Health Service. Again and again, Marsh provides examples, sometimes hilarious, sometimes depressing, of the way technology and a dysfunctional corporate culture impedes his ability to help patients. Toward the end of the book, we meet a man and his parents who come to Marsh’s office for a diagnosis of the man’s brain tumor. They are terrified and ready to hear the worst as they sit and wait for his verdict. But Marsh is unable to access the brain scans. There’s been a mix up in the hospital system's network, so he leaves the scared family in his office, and walks over to the imaging department, which is far away, but they’re not answering the phone. “Where is Caroline?” I asked as I arrived at the x-ray reception desk, a little out of breath.“Well, she’s about somewhere,” came the reply.So I headed off round the department and eventually I found her and explained the problem.“Have you tried your password?” “Yes, I bloody well have!”“Well, try Mr. Johnsons. That usually works. Fuckoff45. He hates computers.”“Why 45?”“It’s the 45th month since we signed on to that hospital system and one has to change the password every month,” Caroline replied. So I ran down the corridor and down the stairs and past the waiting patients back to the consultation room.” Fuckoff45 doesn’t work and neither does any other permeation Marsh tries. He runs back to the imaging department and convinces Caroline to accompany him back to the consultation room. FuckOff47 finally does the job. By then, the patients are almost vibrating with anxiety, his clinic is running 45 minutes late, and it’s not even 10:00 yet.And on it goes.I listed to the audio version of this book read by British actor Jim Barclay who perfectly captures Marsh’s brilliance, passion and wit. I did subtract half a star because portions of Do No Harm read like a bad Yelp review and while no doubt Marsh is correct in his indictment of the NHS, I don’t need to be taken that deeply into the weeds. That said, this is a small detail in an otherwise wonderful book."

Don’t do it.” Lucky for us, Henry Marsh reports back from the frontlines of brain surgery so we don’t have to. He’s nearing retirement age after a career divided between a London hospital and medical missions to Ukraine. The punchy chapters are named after conditions he has treated or observed. Rarely, he has been a patient himself (detached retinas, a broken leg), or observed a family member’s illness – his son’s brain tumor, his second wife’s epilepsy, and his mother’s terminal cancer.Marsh comes across as having a hot temper, exhibiting extreme frustration with NHS bureaucracy. At the same time, he gets very emotional over his patients declining and dying, and experiences profound guilt over operations that go wrong or were ultimately unnecessary. He realizes the God-like power he holds over people’s quality of life: “We [surgeons] sit there, alive and well and happy in our work, and with sardonic amusement and Olympian detachment we examine these abstract cases on which to operate.”It was particularly interesting for me to see the view from the other side of the operating table because two chapters have personal significance for me: “Oligodendroglioma” was my late brother-in-law’s diagnosis, and the account of a near-disastrous clipping surgery in “Aneurysm” showed me why my mother has been so reluctant to have it performed.In my favorite passages, Marsh reflects on the mind-blowing fact that the few pounds of tissue stored in our heads could be the site of our consciousness, our creativity, our personhood – everything we traditionally count as the soul:I am looking directly into the center of the brain, a secret and mysterious area where all the most vital functions that keep us conscious and alive are to be found. Above me, like the great arches of a cathedral roof, are the deep veins of the brain – the Internal Cerebral Veins and beyond them the basal veins of Rosenthal and the in the midline the Great Vein of Galen, dark blue and glittering in the light of the microscope. This is anatomy that inspires awe in neurosurgeons.Are the thoughts that I am thinking as I look at this solid lump of fatty protein covered in blood vessels really made out of the same stuff? And the answer always comes back – they are – and the thought itself is too crazy, too incomprehensible, and I get on with the operation.This book might not be for you if you are squeamish about surgical details, but if you can get past that I submit to you that, like Atul Gawande’s Being Mortal, this is one that everyone should read."

“Life without hope is hopelessly difficult but at the end hope can so easily make fools of us all.”
In this book, Mr. Marsh tries to show the reader what it is like to be a neurosurgeon. Also serving as his memoir, this book shows the stress, the triumphs and failures of working in a hospital, specifically in neurosurgery. Personally, I thought it was very interesting and touching, but I had some problems just with the way it was written. If you are interested in medicine, give this a go.I really enjoyed that he doesn't develop God-complex when he writes. Marsh is fully aware of his failures and some of my favorite parts of the novel were when he has to deal with failing and ultimately destroying someone's life. The guilt and the constant thinking over what could have been done better/differently was heartbreaking to read about but also enthralling. Throughout this book you get a better idea of what goes on behind the scenes in a hospital. As someone who was in the hospital recently and kept experiencing delays, I think I can now understand a bit more what was happening. I have often wondered how doctors live with the stress of holding other people's fates in their hands, once again this is an area in which Mr. Marsh excels. Chapters are devoted to examining the divide between patients and doctors and the walls that doctors put up. I never really realised the dehumanisation that patients go through when entering the hospital. All sorts of emotions sprang up when Marsh explained how doctors early on need to learn to view patients as something other than them; a different race. This way, they can get their job done and not suffer a mental breakdown. The strong points of this book definitely were the examinations of difficult topics.What I didn't enjoy as much was the formula. Unlike many memoirs/autobiographies, Do No Harm isn't chronological. The names of the chapters aren't dates either, so you end up jumping around in the time line which is very disorientating. Sometimes I was trying to wrap my head around what was going on and at what state he was in his life to understand where he was coming from in that moment. Similarly, I liked the chapter titles (names of diseases for the most part) in the beginning. Later though, they stopped being disease names and sometimes, it would be disease name that isn't really covered. Again, this was kind of disorientating. At times the book was also quite formulaic, especially towards the beginning, but as we got into the last 1/3 this went away.Overall, this was a very thought-provoking, interesting read."
6,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,5,"If you’re really squeamish about blood and body parts and squishy bits, this isn’t the book for you. Marsh talks a lot about the practicality of operating on the brain, as well as about interacting with patients, decision making, dealing with outcomes, training new surgeons, etc. He’s very frank about all of it. If, like me, you’re planning to become a doctor, you might want to read it just to get a frank, unvarnished view of what it’s like to work in the NHS, what it’s like to have people’s lives in your hands, and how to (and sometimes how not to) interact with patients and coworkers. He has the humility to admit that he’s not perfect, without false modesty. He’s a brain surgeon, and he’s bloody good at it: if he weren’t, a lot more people would be dead. But he does make mistakes, and he owns up to them — both the avoidable and the unavoidable ones.Some parts of this book feel painfully real, too. I’ve been the family member being told by a doctor that someone isn’t going to make it; seeing it from the doctor’s perspective is no easier. I really appreciated Marsh’s humanity about these things: he wasn’t afraid to admit that he didn’t want to meet bereaved family members, but he did meet them all the same, and confess to his mistakes where he’d made them.On another level, of course, the book is fascinating just because it’s about the brain. Neurology or genetics are tentatively my interests right now, and while I’m not going within a football field’s length of neurosurgery, this still had a lot of fascinating insights.As a volunteer for a charity for the blind, I heard about a patient my age who had brain surgery. She was fine before, aside from the tumour on her pituitary gland which was just starting to cause problems. She came out of it totally blind; in removing the tumour on her pituitary gland, the surgeon also irreparably damaged her optic chiasm (where the optic nerves cross). Mostly, I’ve thought about this from her perspective — now I find myself wondering about that surgeon. Did he think it went perfectly, until after? The damage might not have been apparent until she woke up from anaesthesia. He did well, otherwise; got the whole tumour, as near as damn it. And yet the course of that young woman’s life is completely changed all the same. A lot of the things she wanted to do aren’t possible anymore. I bet it felt just a little bit like failure, even if he saved her life.It makes me doubt being a doctor, a little. But it also makes me think about the importance of good doctors — not just technically good, but doctors who try to do good; who may make mistakes, but admit to them, and try to redress the damage. I want to be one of them, for sure."
7,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20608600-laura,4,"Is there anything more frightening than the thought of being diagnosed with a brain tumour? In the vast world of illness and disease, it is perhaps the singular worst thing any patient can begin to comprehend. Dr Marsh has made a career out of performing complex surgical procedures on such patients, and not always with a positive result.The brain is a fascinating yet often poorly understood organ. As a registered nurse, I have cared for patients afflicted by hundreds - if not thousands - of different ailments, however disease of the brain is perhaps one of the most overwhelming. It controls every part of our being; our thought processes, our emotions, behaviours, desires and so much more. Dr Marsh writes a gripping memoir dedicated to his many years of operating on some of the sickest patients in the country. I enjoyed much of the book, and as a fellow NHS worker, could highly empathise with Dr Marsh's frustrations on the red tape that interferes with the care we give. From difficult staff parking to the ever changing government and management enforced regulations, none of the complications that mounted pressure on an already stressful job came as a surprise to me. Dr Marsh is not afraid of admitting his weaknesses, both personally and professionally. At times he is pompous, arrogant and self important. Although I do not wish to tar all surgeons with the same brush, in my experience the surgical brand of senior doctors do tend to behave in a particular way! Some of the writing is very much tongue-in-cheek (example: referring to an overweight patient as ""a small whale"".) It could be argued Dr Marsh appears unsympathetic towards his patients, although I could understand to an extent that a degree of emotional detachment is required. I was impressed of Dr Marsh not coming from a traditional medical background. Although privately taught, he worked as both a porter and a nurses assistant before his medical training - something I wish could be made mandatory for modern would be doctors. I would have liked to have seen more emphasis on the role of nurses in neurosurgery, both the operation itself and its long aftercare. Otherwise, I fully enjoyed this memoir and only wished it were a little longer. Deserving of its place on the Costa Coffee book club short list."

Far more than the average doctor-memoirist, Marsh does not conceal his feelings, whether dealing with patients, colleagues, assistants, or superiors, and he spares no one when matters turn out badly. Beautifully written , candid, and honest about the advantages and misgivings during his career, Dr Marsh, lays it down on paper as it is. "

Not my usual style which is why I'm always reluctant to joining bookclubs- I'm 30 years old now, I know what sort of books I enjoy. Life's too short to read books you're not interested in.It started off okay but for me quickly descended into just an outlet for an angry, arrogant old man's egotistical musings. I still can't quite figure out what he was trying to achieve by writing this book, other than to rant about 'management', technology, and tell us 50 times that hospitals don't have enough beds. I think a lot of my dislike of this book comes specifically from the arrogance of the author, and his obviously false humility. There was a moment in his book where he had been forced to go to a kind of health & safety course (like all us mere mortals who are 'useless and don't save lives' do) and when the instructor tried to hand him the work folder he refused to take it because he thought he was above this nonsense, so the guy had to put it on the floor next to him. He also on numerous occasions expressed how irritated he was if for example, a nurse who worked in a completely different ward didn't recognise HIM, in HIS OWN HOSPITAL. Like, are you child? Grow the eff up. I can't even count the amount of times I found myself exclaiming 'ugh what an asshole!' while reading this I guess I just wanted more stories of the people he has operated on, more of a study on human behaviour. He tantalizes us with hints of how a person can go through a 'horrible personality change' caused by tumours or surgery but then doesn't give any examples. Instead we just have ramblings of a old man dotted with recounts of some of his surgeries, both with good outcomes and bad. It was okay, but I wouldn't recommend this book. "

It gives a fascinating insight into neurosurgery itself as well as the changes that have occurred in British healthcare over that time. While some of these changes are undoubtedly for the better (when Marsh started out working in hospitals, there was a bar in which doctors drank and smoked for hours while on call); many of them are negative. The reader sees through Marsh's eyes the devastation wrought by ever-changing and unrealistic government targets, unreliable technology and the increasingly labyrinthine bureaucracy that all NHS workers need to wade through each day. But the best thing about Do No Harm is that it breaks down the invisible wall between patients and doctor and shows surgeons as they really are: anxious, fallible and human. Marsh describes his surgical mistakes (many of which have utterly devastating consequences) as well as his triumphs.It's a book like nothing I've ever read and would recommend it to pretty much everyone apart from the incurably squeamish.

Was Marsh just trying to fill the pages of his book? I really don't know. I thought he would only mention the rarest and most interesting cases that he came across during his long career or stories of patients that changed something in him.But all in all, he is such a good author and doctor and I liked following his career progress and to see how he dealt differently with his patients over time.  ""If the operation succeeds the surgeon is a hero, but if it fails he is a villain""  I also really enjoyed reading the perspective of a neurosurgeon; someone in my family had a brain surgery a while ago and we really consider the surgeon a hero/angel/life-saver but what if something went wrong? would we still appreciate his efforts? I doubt it :(  ""Perhaps they never quite realized just how dangerous the operation had been and how lucky they were to have recovered so well. Whereas the surgeon, for a while, has known heaven, having come very close to hell""  All respect to all surgeons who save lives every day!"
13,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/730754-ken,5,"If you're a hypochondriac, steer clear. Otherwise, steel yourself and have a look-see at surgery from the other side (assuming you're not a neurosurgeon reading this). Henry Marsh is a British brain surgeon and a writer with a clear, straightforward style -- not only his diction, but his personality. With each chapter named after a different (and terrible) thing that can go wrong with these miracle devices we call our brains and our bodies, he delivers anecdote after anecdote of actual cases he's experienced over the years, some ending happily, many not. What's refreshing is his human voice. Being seen as savior or demon (often depending on outcome of surgery) is no easy way to make a living, as readers will see.Still, Marsh is not one to hide behind his vaunted profession and overly-romanticize it. In fact, he admits that errors happen. Things go wrong, even during routine operations. In one frightening case, he let a junior surgeon begin a rather straightforward procedure and an error causing permanent disablement occurred. Rather than falsify records as many doctors do (and easily can, considering the patient is out and you're only surrounded by members of your team, the medical brethren), Marsh owned up to it. In his view, hospitals deserved to be sued in some cases -- a man like this should at least win a settlement to help with the obvious ordeal lying ahead. Still, settlements or not, mistakes don't stop guilt from hounding doctors. At least doctors who care.Despite all of the gloom and doom, there's an education to be had in this book. You can learn a lot about the brain's function and effects on other parts of the body. All pain is signaled by the brain. Hemispheres matter. Location and size of tumors matter. Some tumors are ""sticky"" and become problematic because they adhere too much to the brain. Others, more luckily, almost ""pop"" out with little coaxing -- like Teflon, even. One never knows until one goes into the brain, which on more than one occasion sounds as much the ""last frontier"" as outer space, especially when reading Marsh's graphic descriptions of the ""landscape"" in there.Here's an excerpt showing Marsh's typical tone and overall humanity: ""My outpatient clinic is an odd combination of the trivial and the deadly serious. It is here that I see patients weeks or months after I have operated on them, new referrals or long-term follow-ups. They are wearing their own clothes and I meet them as equals. They are not yet in-patients who have to submit to the depersonalizing rituals of being admitted to the hospital, to be tagged like captive birds or criminals and to be put into bed like children in hospital gowns. I refuse to have anybody else in the room -- no students, no junior doctors or nurses -- only the patients and their families.""The type of doctor you could put your faith in? I should say so. An education not only on the brain but on dying? That, too. The doctors know what's going down, and you will, too, once you read all of these cases. Sometimes no operation is the answer. Sometimes hope is your enemy -- bound only to prolong your suffering when palliative measures would be so much more humane. Overall, a compelling document. With moments of humor, dark and not, Do No Harm rails against bureaucracy and government, and offers countless snapshots of people like you and me... always hoping the best from life, sometimes receiving the worst from it. In a word: fate."
14,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19218176-flapper72,4,"I'm never sure about reading books that are related to my profession but Mr Marsh is highly regarded and I thought it would be very interesting to hear about his thoughts and experiences. It really is a lovely book. A good mixture of surgical, medical and personal experiences that's really wonderfully written. I think having a certain amount of medical knowledge made it a much more relaxing and easier read for me but am sure it would appeal to other non medical people too. I would warn people though that they might be shocked or surprised by some of Mr Marsh's honestly but I find that extremely comforting, reassuring and bold of him to be so very honest especially with regards to changes that have happened in the NHS over his career. A number of times I actually found myself laughing as he described 'run ins' with bureaucracy and management. I feel humble that I am part of the same profession of Mr Marsh with all his wisdom, experience, excellence, humanity and honesty. "
15,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28323108-a-rather-bookish,5,"Quite honestly, this book was really unlike anything I've ever read before. This book should be read by anybody that has ever received treatment on the NHS, is awaiting treatment, or is going in for any kind of major surgery at any point.This book is written by an extremely well known neurosurgeon, called Henry Marsh. His writing gives an incredible insight into neurosurgery, and the many changes the health care system has gone through for the last thirty years. Many of these changes have been rather negative, but there are also some positives.What I like about Marsh, is the way he tells it like it really is. He doesn't sugarcoat things, and he explains why it needs to be this way, with some empathy, in order to maintain a healthy doctor patient relationship. He quickly admits that things do in fact go wrong, even in apparently simple routine operations. Marsh describes his surgical mistakes as well as sharing his huge triumphs. This book remarkably reminds us that health care staff are human too, and they too, can make mistakes. What is terribly shocking is the totally unreasonable and unrealistic Government targets, and the way these reflect on the staff, therefore it has a domino effect on the patients. Having the duty of bed management in a hospital is an extremely stressful job. I should know. I cannot imagine how frustrating it is as a surgeon to have serious, life threatening surgery cancelled, due to a lack of beds. It's truly horrendous.This book is wonderfully educational and I found it fascinating, learning about neurosurgery, from an actual neurosurgeon, who really, is an inspiration. "
16,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9841866-kate-bibliophile-book-club,3,"I’ve had Do No Harm on my kindle for 3 years, yes, YEARS! After reading Fragile Lives earlier this year, I figured I’d give this one a go as instead of a cardiac surgery this book centres on neurosurgery. I have a morbid fascination with medical things like that so I was looking forward to it.Henry Marsh has written a very interesting book. He’s no Derek Shepherd in terms of drama and excitement, but he is dealing with the everyday lives of his patients. Do No Harm gives the reader an interesting glimpse into what it’s like to be a neurosurgeon and the things they go through inside and outside of the surgical theatre.I don’t know what I was expecting when I picked it up but what I found was an honest memoir. It had case studies in every chapter, as well as a glimpse into Marsh’s own life outside of surgery, and how it impacted his home life. It’s an easy read in terms of pace and writing, but it’s all too easy to forget you are reading about patients. Any one of us could end up on an operating theatre table needing help from a man like this. The irony of Do No Harm, for me, was that my eldest child ended up in A&E on the day I read this book. He fell after deciding spinning around to make himself dizzy was a good idea and proceeded to hit his head!!! He is completely fine, but this book couldn’t have been read at a worse time! Do No Harm is definitely a book to read if you like true life medical stories! Interesting, graphic but always honest!Recommended!"
17,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,5,"Marsh is a complete breath of fresh air - full of compassion, knowledge, and empathy. This book was a profound look at life and death through the perspective of neurosurgery. "
18,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23106940-mia,4,"""Every surgeon carries within himself a small cemetery, where from time to time he goes to pray- a place of bitterness and regret, where he must look for an explanation for his failures.""-René Leriche, La philosophie de la chirurgie, 1951I loved this book, and I can say with confidence that it's the best nonfiction book I have ever read. (Before you get too excited, bear in mind that I don't have extensive experience in the nonfic realm.) But, honestly, if you're even slightly interested in neuroscience or surgery and want to read an intelligently written, frank account of modern medicine, this is the book for you. If, however, you're the squeamish sort who shrieks at the mention of blood or is simply not down with pretty graphic descriptions of surgery, perhaps you should stay away from this one. I feel I should say, though, that I found the descriptions of neurosurgical procedures incredibly fascinating and beautifully written.Henry Marsh's voice is clear in every page of this book. He's tough, brutally honest, and I found his outlook on life, death, and brain surgery refreshing. Marsh, like most every surgeon, struggles with professional objectivity, with giving hope to patients and sometimes having to take it away, with the high stakes of his practise and the looming fact that he can't save every patient who passes into the ward. It's a hard, gruelling, yet rewarding career, and being able to see a typical day (and some atypical ones) in the life of Dr Marsh was not only interesting but his musings on hope, medicine, when to give up, and death in the modern age were thought-provoking as well. I left them in the little room, their knees squeezed together as the four of them sat on the small sofa and wondered, yet again, as I walked away down the dark hospital corridor, at the way we cling so tightly to life and how there would be so much less suffering if we did not. Life without hope is hopelessly difficult but at the end hope can so easily make fools of us all.Like any career, neurosurgery has its highs and lows, and we see both in Do No Harm. There are good days:I went down the stairs to my office to see if there was any more paperwork to be done but just for once Gail had left my office empty. It had been a good day. I had not lost my temper. I had finished the list. The patients were well. The pathology had been benign. I had been able to cancel the two spines at the beginning of the list rather than at the end. There were no major problems with the patients on the wards. What more could a surgeon want?And, inevitably, there are bad ones:None of us felt able to make our usual sardonic jokes at the morning meeting. The first case was a man who had died as a result of an entirely avoidable delay in his being transferred to our unit; another was a young woman who had become brain dead after a haemorrhage. We looked glumly at her brain scan.'That's a dead brain,' one of my colleagues explained to the juniors. 'Brain looks like ground glass.'The last case was an eight-year-old who had tried to hang himself and had suffered hypoxic brain damage.'Can we have some rather less depressing cases please?' someone asked, but there were none and the meeting came to an end.Some things mentioned here weren't entirely clear to me, mostly the parts where Marsh describes the Trust or what he thinks of the NHS or how NHS hospitals differ from others, or how he could afford private insurance but now cannot. This is because I live in the U.S., where we have a commercial healthcare system, and so some of the gripes the author has with how things are run in the U.K. went over my head. That doesn't mean, though, that I didn't appreciate Marsh's dislike of useless authority, or his hatred of hospital bureaucracy and pointless lectures. I especially loved his occasional refusal to adhere to meaningless rules, and his frustration at when delays and problems are caused due to unnecessary restrictions and regulations imposed by the management. My favourite was when he was having his time wasted by being forced to attend a mandatory lecture by a man who didn't know what he was talking about:How strange it is, I thought as I listened to him talking, that after thirty years of struggling with death, disaster and countless crises and catastrophes, having watched patients bleed to death in my hands, having had furious arguments with colleagues, terrible meetings with relatives, moments of utter despair and of profound exhilaration- in short, a typical neurosurgical career- how strange it is that I should now be listening to a young man with a background in catering telling me that I should develop empathy, keep focused and stay calm. As soon as the signing-out register had been passed around, and I had signed it, thus confirming that the Trust could now state that I had been trained in Empathy and Self-control, and the classification of Abuse and of Fire Extinguishers, in addition to many other things I had already forgotten, I charged out of the room despite Chris' protests that he had not yet finished.Click the spoiler for an amazing close-up of the tiny arteries and veins on the surface of the brain!

19,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64305928-mbgirl,5,"What an amazing life Dr Marsh has lived. From geriatric psych nurse to renown in neurosurgery, his authentic thoughts and revisitation of heartbreaking and interesting cases and patients reminds us all, life is most definitely precious. Marveling at the details of the various classes of tumors, benign and neoplastic, I was very intrigued to read it all. As well, his risk in undertaking a mentor role, taking Ukrainian neurosurgeons under his tutelage...bravo. A real, human, honest account from the POV of a veteran expert. will try hard to take away some of his attitudes the next time I may get a ribbing from our own super talented Chinese peds neurosurgeon: hero to so many locally."
20,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11578910-antenna,5,"""The idea that emotions and reason, that memories, dreams and reflections should consist of jelly is simply too strange to understand... Yet..if I stray into what neurosurgeons call eloquent brain, I will be faced with a damaged and disabled patient.""It is this kind of honesty that makes Henry Marsh's memoirs so compelling, overriding the initial concern that I might be reading the book solely out of a kind of ghoulish voyeurism. Henry Marsh was clearly drawn to this field by the challenge and element of danger, akin to what drives people to climb mountains. He describes with great clarity and insight the sense of shame when what should be a straightforward operation goes wrong, perhaps through a moment of hubris or distraction, but it could also be because one has given a more junior colleague the practice he needs in order to improve, or just bad luck, a sudden haemorrhage for no obvious reason. On the other hand, inexperience - or memories of a recent disaster- may make a surgeon over-cautious as regards something as simple as trying to adjust the clip on an aneurism.Marsh patiently explains various medical conditions, mainly tumours, in terms a layman can grasp. I found it hard to read more than about three chapters at a time, not because the book is depressing - Marsh manages to weave in a surprising amount of humour - but because the experiences of many of his patients seemed to demand a certain amount of respectful reflection before rushing on to the next trauma.Marsh reserves his bile for hospital management and government targets or cuts. He may be a bit of a dinosaur in some respects, but makes his case very convincingly. The 48 hour Working Time Directive causes more frequent shift changes so that staff often do not know the condition of patients they are treating as well as they used to. Bureaucratic rules enforced by junior staff no longer so in awe of consultants and senior surgeons often mean that patients have to wait longer for operations, and suffer more often the stress of last minute postponements. He condemns Private Finance Initiative (PFI) schemes as a ""very expensive way of building second rate public buildings"" which ""some would consider to be an economic crime, although nobody is to be held responsible for it.""If anything, this book has eroded my confidence in the NHS as a whole, but has made me more understanding of the surgeon's dilemma. Often, he really does not know whether on balance it is better to operate or not. As regards patient consent, the percentage risk of death from the operation may equal that of eventually dying from a tumour, but if one survives the former, there is the incalculable benefit of peace of mind. Even such an eminent surgeon as Marsh may have to face charges of indefensible error, say for delay in diagnosing an infection: ""it was painfully clear, as I had always known - that the case could not be defended... The final bill...was for six million"" to settle it. One is left thankful that there are people with the courage and motivation to persevere in this complex medical field."
21,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7133078-elizabeth,5,"It takes a particular kind of person to want to be a surgeon, especially a neurosurgeon. Reading this book has left me in awe of the work of Henry Marsh, and all other surgeons. I know I couldn't have done it. He writes with extreme candour, not shying away from the times when he has operated on a patient and it has not been a success. He tells of many incidences of failure in his book. Neurosurgery is obviously, by its nature, one which is fraught with huge risk of failure - leaving a patient disabled, or dead is quite possible. He admits he doesn't always know when to operate and when merely to allow nature to take its course. He has made mistakes which have led to the NHS Trust, for whom he works, being sued. He has caused catastrophic life-altering injuries to patients on the operating table. He admits this. Surgeons are human, they are prone to error and when it goes wrong it can be disastrous for everyone concerned. This book covers many types of cases he has come across throughout his working life, the successes, the failures, the frustrations of working within the NHS, bound by government guidelines and working practices, the difficulties of training new surgeons and so on. I got the impression that he felt his most rewarding work has been that done in Ukraine, helping people who felt he was their only chance. I watched the documentary The English Surgeon part way through reading this book, and it helped me to visualise that work and also to see some of the people mentioned in this book.We often imbue surgeons, and doctors, with superhuman powers - believing that they can cure everyone and everything, that they are miracle-workers. This book, sometimes brutally, debunks that myth. They can only do what is possible.If I had to have a criticism of this book, it is that it is quite heavy on the failures ""this operation went wrong and the patient died or was left in a severely disabled state"". I understand that neurosurgery is dangerous and that many people who come to the operating table are beyond help or are just being patched up temporarily, but one or two more successes to balance it out might have made it a little less despairing at times. That's not to say that all the cases were without hope - he wrote of his own son's successful treatment at just a few months old and I found that particularly moving.It is, above all, a fascinating insight into the difficult and (I found) often distressing work of neurosurgery."
22,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,5,"The form of the book is not perfect, but Henry Marsh (he is called Mr. Marsh during his consults and NOT Dr.)is honest to an incredible degree. This is his personal story slanted toward full reveal for his career choice: how he got there, and what he does now and during decades working for the NHS in his role of neurosurgeon. His own personal history or detail of relationship is never in the forefront of the tale, just tangent to crux decisions and ultimate roles he has experienced. It's exact in the operation descriptions of process and form. It's pure gold in the way he will parse decisions to operate at all or not, and why, BEFORE the fact. And of regretted consequence.There are nuggets I learned of method I had never heard about at all. Most though are defunct now. For example, that they used to do actual brain surgery- incising in lines to certain brain regions with instrument in order to moderate OCD behaviors. Or that you could, at one time, get into a medical program after college with no science or chemistry background at all. But other aspects beyond the manual technique were the best ones; those were the ones that rotated in different real life scenarios upon conversations with the dying and those who surround them from diagnosis on. The very long dying and the short shock form. Tough profession, and tough psyche is demonstrated by Marsh. His work in the Ukraine, the children stories and the building/admins. conditions are other highlights. Of these I so enjoyed his observations.It does not at all surprise me that governmental administrators making medical decisions does not work. Nor that huge buildings with dozens of balconies are designed and then cannot be used because of liability. Or that tech often makes it harder to see records and scans than before those storage methods existed. Or that alarm systems work for a couple of weeks until someone turns them off because they can't stand to hear the screech any more. The only shocking feature, to me, was that he could never find his own next day patients, the night before their operations because of constant chaos and bed and entire ward changes caused by bed count lack and endemic overcrowding.He seems a modern saint to me. Love his top cubical room addition idea for a few plants, a comfy chair, a drink in hand and looking over a Southern London view where no one can get to him."

I was immediately beset by many, many people telling me how wonderful it was; needless to say it did not remain upon my TBR pile for too long.Filled with honesty and compassion, Do No Harm... is a fantastic book, which takes one to the next level of illness narratives; rather than reading about a patient's experience, we are given the expertise and understanding of one of the country's leading neurosurgeons. He speaks about his own place within the hospital, and always shows so much empathy toward those he treats, sometimes successfully and sometimes not so.I thought that I might be a little squeamish for the book, but because Marsh writes so well, the descriptions of surgery are seamlessly joined to the stories either side, which certainly takes emphasis away from drillbits and blood. Do No Harm... is wonderfully structured and compelling from the outset, and I felt as though I learnt an awful lot whilst reading. Marsh's unshakeable enthusiasm for his craft is nothing short of remarkable, and his account of his working life is incredibly human, captivating the reader from start to finish."

The memoir isn't particularly well structured and the stories don't always have a well defined arc, but that doesn't matter. The author is a brain surgeon for god sake, not a Pulitzer winning author. What is revealed is the challenging world of high risk surgery carry high levels of risk and reward. Surgeons are notorious for having big egos, and Dr. Henry Marsh is no exception. His disdain for hospital and healthcare management was as evident as his compassion for his patients. He candidly talks about his struggles dealing with less than sympathetic patients. Also, kudos to the best temper tantrum I've seen in a book (following a botched job performed by a trainee). There are many great quotes from this book, instead of repeating, I invite you to check them out.https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes...2016 reading challenge checks the box for 35. A biography . "
26,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15945083-nigel,4,Plenty has been said about this already and I guess it is a classic of sorts. I certainly found it very readable. I guess my slight reservation is that it feels somewhat dated compared to other books by medical professionals that I've read that have been published more recently. I like Henry Marsh a lot and have been to see him speak as well as hearing him on the radio too. It seems to me as though he might be the beginning of the end of a generation. Minor irritations included his somewhat double standards between what he told his juniors he wanted and what he did himself. Good read though.

I have worked with a lot of surgeons and I just haven't understood what gives them the self-confidence/optimism/arrogance to do the surgery sometimes. This book really explores this along with some very profound and personal reflections on life, and some entertaining stories.

I liked how the surgeon focused on the patients, their families, their psychology before and after the surgeries and everything in between. But also shed light on his own feelings, which might be an insight into the feelings of all surgeons out there. It was so honest and straight forward. It always entertains me to read accounts of doctors, surgeons in particular. "
31,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11716769-rachel,2,"I love a good neuroscience casebook. Into the Silent Land: Travels in Neuropsychology is one of my favorite books and I adore Oliver Sacks more than is seemly. Even if it's not neuro I enjoy reading a good case study to the point it probably baffles other psych people. This book should be right in my wheelhouse of non-fiction books I enjoy. Unfortunately, I was not as enthused with this book as I expected to be. I did enjoy the variety of cases. There's quite a variety of different surgeries. I got to learn new things about the British healthcare system which is always exciting. However, there wasn't much else I enjoyed about the book. I understand that being a doctor is frustrating and it's entirely possible that Marsh has a bone dry wit that my painful sincerity doesn't allow me to grasp, but I reprieved so much bitterness in this book. The case studies were mechanical, unlike other case study books I've read where they really dig into the whole person. Possibly because of this, the surgeries did start to blur together. I also wanted more follow up or closure. Some of the chapter endings felt abrupt. I wasn't enthused with Marsh's writing style, it didn't grab me and neuroscience is an area of interest for me. I don't need sensationalism but more excitement from the author about the subject would have been nice. As I read it seemed like Marsh begrudgingly wrote this book because that's what you do. His tone is bitter and resentful (does it really matter that you bought the couches in the lounge?) At times I kept waiting for him to tell all the kids to get off his lawn. It's also clear that Marsh doesn't think much of NHS and his side rants about that took me away from the neuro parts. It felt like at times Marsh couldn't decided if he wanted to write about his career as a doctor or case studies and tried to do both. There's an adept way to do that and this book isn't it. I know case study based books tend to be laid out according to the case study, but the organization could have been different. It was hard for me to get a handle on Marsh's professional timeline. This last critique could be because I'm a stupid American but a short glossary of key NHS terms would have been helpful. I don't know a lot about the terms used in British medicine and while I could figure out most, it did take me out of the book to stop, have to go to the internet and look up what it meant for a hospital to be a trust. I went into this book wanting interesting case studies and instead I felt like I got the resentful notes of an older doctor which happened to include case studies. "
32,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35482263-gumble-s-yard,5,"Fascinating and insightful autobiography of a brain surgeon – each chapter covers a particular condition and an operation or number of operations around that condition – although these operations (and the teaching sessions around them) are more of a base from which to explore themes of brain surgery. The book is particularly interesting for insights into: the power that a brain surgeon feels and the contrast with the impotence of daily life particularly in an increasingly bureaucratic and manager run NHS where the surgeon is no longer king; the complex relationship between the surgeon, his patients and particularly their family and how this develops so that for example Marsh prefers it if the family soon forgets him as that tends to be associated with a successful operation with no need for follow up; Marsh’s increasing realisation as he gets older that his previous tendency to operate for his own professional challenge and satisfaction wasn’t in the interests of patients who often ended up with a catastrophic quality of life; the effect of being in charge of life and death decisions (and the risk of terrible damage) on a personal life - when Marsh first interviews to be a neurosurgeon the first question at each interview is what his wife’s view is."
33,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3925186-bill,5,"I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it. I'm surprised there was not a co-writer since the writing style and structure is unusually strong. It is episodic but that didn't bother me. In fact, I quite liked how it slowly built up an elliptical commentary on bureaucracy, the political aspects of the U.K.'s public health system, and even mortality while also just being composed of entertaining anecdotes. The only thing I would have changed is to add more detailed narrative of surgeries themselves. After the first few, they are glossed over but I found them equally exciting and educational."

38,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7810428-tala,4,"“There are one hundred billion nerve cells in our brains. Does each one have a fragment of consciousness within it? How many nerve cells do we require to be conscious or to feel pain? Or does consciousness and thought reside in the electrochemical impulses that join these billions of cells together? Is a snail aware? Does it feel pain when you crush it underfoot? Nobody knows.”3.5 stars.It seems that neurosurgery is such a popular specialty for writing memoirs and autobiographies, and I can understand why; the mystery and mysticism of the nervous system leaves a vast sea of writing fodder, and the possibilities are endless.I thought this particular memoir to be adequately informative without being overwhelming on the jargon and medical procedures, and it was peppered with anecdotes that ranged from heartbreaking, to happy and at times, funny. I also liked the tiny glimpse of the UK's NHS it gave me, how advanced and yet disappointing it can be at times, as well as the even tinier glimpse of Ukraine's health system. However, there was something missing that didn't quite let me fully immerse myself into it (as opposed to When Breath Becomes Air, which I thought was absolutely brilliant). Perhaps it was the casual detachment so often mentioned and which I witness most days in school (that I know most physicians will have to armor themselves with sooner or later), maybe it was the missing tragedy, or some attitudes I disapproved of (that may very well be normal for anyone having a not-so-well day). In other words, I felt that it was dry (at times) and lacking hope- which is what being a neurosurgeon might be like.Anyway, I wanted to put a macabre quote I liked in the beginning of the review, but decided against it. I did really like it though, and since you've reached this far, here you go:“Dying is rarely easy, whatever we might wish to think. Our bodies will not let us off the hook of life without a struggle. You don’t just speak a few meaningful last words to your tearful family and then breathe your last. If you don’t die violently, choking or coughing, or in a coma, you must gradually be worn away, the flesh shrivelling off your bones, your skin and eyes turning deep yellow if your liver is failing, your voice weakening, until, near the end, you haven’t even the strength to open your eyes, and you lie motionless on your death bed, the only movement your gasping breath.”"
39,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6945307-damaskcat,5,"I have put off reading this book for several months because just after I bought it someone close to me died of a brain injury. Having steeled myself to read it, I found it a harrowing but ultimately reassuring read. It seems that any sort of brain surgery has a relatively large failure rate and that medical science still doesn't know as much about the brain and how to treat its problems as everyone would wish.I liked the author's style and even though he does not spare himself when it comes to cataloguing his failures I felt if I was being treated by him I would trust him implicitly. It must be hugely difficult not to be able to offer patients and their families hope when someone has an injury or a tumour on their brain but sometimes it is kinder to do nothing and let nature take its course. Hardly anyone would think that being in a persistent vegetative state is preferable to death. The skill of any medical professional lies as much in knowing when to do nothing as it does in when to intervene.Even when surgery goes well there are always dangers of possible complications afterwards. Strokes are a very really possibility after any sort of brain surgery. This book is far from being all doom and gloom. There is plenty of black humour, some marvellously touching moments and a fascinating insight into the problems of operating on the brain. There are some success stories as well which to the patients concerned appear miraculous.If you like reading about things medical then I recommend this book whole heartedly. It isn't an easy read and you may well need plenty of tissues to hand at times but it is a worthwhile read."
40,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14084605-pink,4,"A very good book, both informative about Neuroscience and a fascinating account of Henry Marsh's life. The only problem is that it scares the shit out of you. Points I've come away -1. Do not botch your suicide attempt 2. Do not allow inexperienced surgeons to operate on you3. Do not expect a hospital bed4. Do not consider brain surgery as the safer option. Ever. 5. Do not presume to get help if it all goes wrongOkay, so I guess nobody chooses to have brain surgery unless absolutely necessary. BUT the overwhelming message I'm left with is that even if brain surgery is explained to you as the safest option, it probably isn't as safe as they say. Things go wrong. A LOT. Not just unavoidable things either, like really complicated surgeries, but stupid unnecessary mistakes that are only learnt with hindsight and years of experience. In fact, if you or your family do need a brain operation, pick the oldest guy you can find to carry it out. They might just be more careful and compassionate than the young, heroic, glory hunters who still think they can play god. Better yet, find Henry Marsh. "
41,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4624802-marc-aplin,3,"A good insight into the life of one of the UK's most qualified and experienced surgeons. Upon completion, it is hard to look badly upon the way doctors operate - death, disaster, against-the-odds survival and joy are emotion they experience multiple times each and every day during medical school / training - I have come to understand why an emotional detachment from patients becomes sensible and almost unavoidable. I wish there was a little more variety to the book and, it sounds a bit morbid, but perhaps a bit more focus on what happens when things do go wrong (much of the book focused on the positive cases with only a mention of unsuccessful cases as means of comparison - i.e. this case I didn't have to have the same kind of conversation I had with the wife of the patient who died as the result of my mistake last week).Overall though it was very enjoyable, open and honest. It contains fluent prose and details much about how brain surgery works and is developing (rapidly) without being complicated or overwhelming.

Contrary to what I expected, this had the quality of a fireside conversation with an old friend—an old friend who, after a drink or two, finds himself talking about the work he normally insists on leaving in his hospital (unless he is on call!). Marsh is to the point, clear about what he wants to say and the points he wishes to make, and writes with admirable economy. Given the subject, this helps considerably, especially for those from a non-medical background (although, admittedly, I did find the language somewhat sparse to begin with).Ranging in subject from the expected stories of his successes and failures in the operating theatre to the frustrations of NHS trust computer network passwords, the varying interwoven subjects are treated with appropriate pathos, humour and, more to the point, absolute humanity."

Little did he know, he would become a top neurosurgeon (like the one he had observed).  Dr. Henry Marsh says you will make mistakes and live with the awful consequences---meaning the patients you crippled, maimed and put in a dirty/early grave. Do No Harm is a descriptive caramel morsel in the way he describes “eloquent brain” with its’ jelly consistency.  Disasters with patients are not forgotten and surgical life is often transfixed by rigmarole periods of silence when auspicious despair slaps in hard---like a hurricane pouncing on a lone mobile home. Buy, absorb and transmit. Distingué!"

I am always a little nervous when I have to talk to neurosurgeons on the phone because the odds are that they're going to be dismissive and curt, at best. So it's hard to find Dr Marsh a sympathetic character in this book when he clearly fits the profile: he waxes nostalgic for the days when he could vent his frustration in the OR by throwing things, he embarrasses younger doctors just for the sport of it, he refuses to accept his empathy training packet from an HR rep, forcing the man to set it on the floor in front of him...and yet somewhere along the way his pure honesty does kind of grow on you. There's no doubt that his is an excruciating profession and he does a really good job of showing how making decisions in the face of uncertainty is the most difficult part of medicine. In the book he is almost aggressively up front about past mistakes, like it's a kind of catharsis for him, and you find yourself grateful that there are people willing to take on that kind of responsibility. I was surprised at a number of grammatical errors in the book (""sometimes it's best to let Nature takes its course""), but maybe his editor was a little bit scared of him. Overall I would say that this is a quick and enjoyable glimpse into the world of neurosurgery."
48,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3123581-valerie-kyriosity,3,"Braaaaaaaiiins! I ate up this book like a zombie. Medical books like this⁠—written on a popular level⁠—are always appealing, and particularly stuff about the brain.And almost always frustrating, too. If you put an EGO into an MD, what do you get? ME GOD. I don't know what degree British physicians get, so perhaps that particular pun doesn't work on the other side of the pond, but the phenomenon knows no such bounds. Interestingly, Marsh has a chapter on hubris. He's aware of his limitations as a physician, and he was cured pretty early in his career from any savior-of-the-world complex, but he still has a standard-of-the-world complex. I see it most in his anger. The world would run much more smoothly if everything would just be done his way. This is totally a takes-one-to-know-one observation. I fall prey to this toddler-temper-tantrum temptation all too often, so I recognize it. Not that I disagree with many of the things he wishes were different. The NHS bureaucracy is ludicrous (and I'm glad I don't have to live under it). But it's not a mess because Mr. Marsh or I say it's ludicrous, but because there is an objective standard outside and above it and him and me that we should all be submitting to. And we aren't. And so we make ourselves as exasperating as we are exasperated when we do not leave room for the wrath of God nor kiss the Son ourselves. There were a couple other places where this fundamental misunderstanding of the order of the universe stood out to me. The first was early in the book, where he notes that his career caused his divorce from his first wife. No. Careers do not and cannot cause divorce. Sin causes divorce. A career might be a circumstance or a setting of that cause, but not the cause itself. Perhaps Marsh sinned in the way he prioritized his career over his marriage. Perhaps his wife sinned in not being supportive or encouraging of his career. Perhaps both. Perhaps neither. But people, not careers, commit divorce. The second was a quote that made me laugh out loud: ""Neuroscience tells us that it is highly improbable that we have souls."" As if neuroscience had the wherewithal to make that determination or the soul were something measurable by neuroscience, to be detected in a brain scan or viewed on a microscope slide! The category confusion is a hoot. Man is not the measure of moral reality, nor are his tools the measurer of spiritual reality. Those things simply make no sense without God; with God as the first axiom, their place in the order of creation becomes clear. All that said, I like Marsh. I admire his skill and his honesty. I enjoyed his stories of success and frustration. Scribd has another of his books, and I've added it to my to-be-read pile. A friend says that in it he is clearly wrestling with the subject of death, probably as he sees the end of his own path not too many years hence. I pray that God would open his eyes to the reality of the much longer road beyond.The reader was good. I was surprised that the c in hydrocephalus is a hard k sound in British pronunciation (assuming his pronunciation was correct, which I've no reason to doubt). Also, be forewarned that this book has more f-bombs (and other language) than any I other I've read."

Is it surgeon fallibility or inevitability that caused the patient to die/stroke/bleed out/have a tumour recur etc? I found this book quite comforting: it took an area of medicine that has always left me awestruck and made brain surgery seem almost routine. For some of the situations, Henry Marsh seems to confirm the notion of surgeon as mechanic - pop out the broken part and put it back together. Easy peasy. I also really enjoyed more explanation of what each type of brain tumour was. I see these terms but never knew what each was. All in all, a great read!"
50,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/445533-sarah,4,"I was first aware of this book when I saw a friend mark it as read at the end of last year. The title stuck with me, having had neurosurgery myself only a few months before, and it came up on a 99p Kindle deal recently so snapped it up.This is a fascinating look into neurosurgery and life as a neurosurgeon, written by such a surgeon at the end of his career. As often seems to be the case with life's strange coincidences Marsh's son suffered from a brain tumour as a little boy, his wife developed epilepsy late in life, and he himself has had a few surgeries (although nothing related to the brain specifically) so his stories are not only from the surgeon's viewpoint, but also from that of the patient and the frightened family member.We all on some level know that doctors are only human and all surgery comes with some level of risk, but it was refreshing to really hear that from the surgeon's experience. One of the biggest surprises for me was the observation that most surgeons can cope relatively well with patients who are beyond saving, the certainty that surgery won't help and the patient will definitely die being easy to come to terms with. It's the cases where you can't be sure whether operating will help or not that are the most difficult. It makes sense when you think about it, uncertainty is always the hardest thing to cope with, but I'd never thought about it that way before.Also fascinating was learning all about different types of brain tumours and other afflictions. Having never known anyone closely with a brain tumour, it was an education to learn how many types there are and how they differ in terms of symptoms, surgery and other treatments.Overall the memoir felt honest and it was definitely quite humble which is not the stereotypical depiction of a surgeon who we are often led to believe have something of a God-complex! As a surgeon who worked in the NHS and some private practice for several decades it was interesting to see how things had changed, both in surgery and in the wider world of secondary care. Unfortunately it did lead to quite a few chapters including a lamentation on lack of beds, but that's a sad truth of the NHS these days and so probably hard to avoid.Definitely a great read for pretty much anyone, unless you are squeamish at detailed descriptions of surgery!"

Henry Marsh, what on Earth are you trying to do to me?? I’ve been through every single emotion I think whilst reading Do No Harm!As a huge obsessive of real life medical tv programmes, when I found out about this book, I had to read it. Enthralled and intrigued by the lives of our surgeons and medical teams, to read anecdotes straight from the horses mouth was too good an opportunity to miss.I found Do No Harm to be a conundrum of ‘happy’, ‘sad’, ‘cringeworthy’, ‘ouch out loads’, ‘flipping ecks’, and ‘eye popping’ stories which has left me with no other choice but to say ‘I am so flipping thankful I am NOT a brain surgeon!’ AND so grateful for reading this book now and not a year ago when I was undergoing major spinal surgery. I say this because one of the stories in Do No Harm concerns an operation quite similar to the one I underwent and in Do No Harm it went as wrong as it could go – petrifying!Overall, Do No Harm shows an attractive and honest insight to the life of a brain surgeon, showing they do in fact have feelings – it’s all a brave face they hold for their patients and to make it to the top, unfortunately a lot of mistakes – both life changing and fatal – have to be made along the way."

Dr Marsh delivers a crash course for the layman in a way that engages the reader well. He is brutally honest about the high & lows of his career and I found his self-reflections very engaging. This book managed to bring a tear to my eye and had me laughing at loud, mind you not at the same time.I was left with a much better understanding of the mysteries of the human brain and those who we rely to care for it. The author gets the mix spot on between the technical and personal sides of his profession.I do think though the book could have been better structured with it jumping around his long career a bit too much for my liking. I also found that some of the facts were repeated over and over again. Overall an engaging and good read that just could have done with some tweaking."

Most of their lives are dedicated to their job, even at times when they are at a vacation, their minds are haunted by the patients they have killed. It is quite common and inevitable to kill a patient in neurosurgery. Their patients are hardly ever totally cured, due to the complexity of the human brain. Even at times when they have tried their best to perform a surgery in the best way, something unexpectedly can happen in the brain as a result of the surgery which can destroy the neurosurgeon's hardwork."
54,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2040938-helen,4,"A fascinating memoir, exploring both the technical complexity of brain surgery and its inherent complications, and the emotional and human side of what it actually feels like to both succeed and occasionally fail at this amazing surgical specialty. The descriptions of how he could either transform someone's life for the better or (less often) catastrophically ruin it were compelling; Mr Marsh is an excellent example of one of the myriad reasons to be proud of and grateful for the existence of the NHS."

This is a frank, often upsetting, recollection of Marsh's career and all its ups and downs. Refreshingly honest in recounting the failures as well as the successes and in conveying his views on the role of the numerous NHS Managers! Highly recommend this even if the subject matter doesn't at first appeal to you as it didn't to me. A fascinating man and what a life he has lived so far. "

His frustration with the changing nature of health care provision is resonant with the changes we have seen in the health system here and I could chuckle and sympathise with this aspect of his story. As someone with a medical background but little knowledge or experience of neurosurgery I found the detailed glimpses into the brain and its various tumours fascinating. 
58,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8093511-patricia,4,"Very candid memoir that reveals this neurosurgeon's skills, compassion and hubris through stories of his medical successes and failures. It is also interesting to read about the differences in care patients receive between the National Health Service and private insurance in Britain. NHS patients generally do not get private rooms and other niceties of medical care but at least everyone gets care and most do as well as they might have with private insurance. Dr. Marsh is a NHS neurosurgeon."

Do No Harm  is an anthology of surgical stories that also let you peek at the mind of the neurosurgeon. The book consists of 25 chapters, each focused on a case that Dr Henry Marsh encountered during his career. While they follow no particular order, each one lets the reader get a better understanding on how a medical professional gets through their day and the difficult decisions they face. One thing that becomes apparent is that once you don the white coat, there is almost no moment when you won't be thinking about your patients or how you can improve. Every chapter bears a title, most of them being different types of tumours or diseases, and all of them have a short definition. While this book will inspire future medical students and young doctors, the language used is by no means convoluted or highly specialized (yes, there are enough medical terms, but they are all explained so that everyone can understand the story). Given the accessibility of the text, anyone reading it can benefit from Dr Marsh's experience and it can lead to more empathy towards surgeons' clinical decisions. The most important lesson that comes up quite often and that can't be stressed enough is that 'no operation is without risks'. Also, not all changes in the medical system are making it better.I recommend this book to all medical students and nurses, but also to anyone who wants to understand why sometimes medical professionals seem grumpy and brusque when interacting with their patients (they are humans too, with worries, families and illnesses of their own)."
62,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22750469-robert-kirwan,4,"I certainly didn’t take a year to read this book but I started it and then put it down. I randomly came back to it and flew through the rest of it in 3 days.Here we have an honest look at what it’s like to be a neurosurgeon. I say honest, because from my time in general surgery, I can see things that I identify with and things that thoroughly make me unsuited and uninterested in being a surgeon myself.I’ve heard a lot of commentary about Mr. Marsh (Mr. As he was a surgeon) and these lead me to believe he is quite arrogant and very much a “surgeon.” However on reading this book, I find him quite relatable and if anything very real.No doubt he’s a great surgeon, but he came across quite humble, deferring to others as more senior or better, and being frank about his mistakes. Of course, that’s what makes this book so interesting! We all love success stories but if we’re completely honest, we all love stories of how people fail even more. Not to be sadistic but it makes us feel better as people, to view others as fallible.Sometimes, yes, Marsh does come across as elitist. Mostly evident when he is describing a drunk that he ends up operating on. However, from my own practice, I have to say that I certainly cannot take the high horse as I have 100% done the same thing, I just haven’t put it in writing.As a whole, this book is very interesting, both for medical professionals and non-medical backgrounds. Marsh explains things with ease that is complex enough for medics, but understandable enough for those who have only watched and episode or 2 of Grey’s anatomy for their own knowledge.And inspirational man who is down to earth and writes a damn good book!! My thought in a nutshell "
63,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4281301-andrew-robins,5,"At times a tough read, but one of the most compelling books I've read this year. Despite having zero interest in this sort of subject usually, I couldn't put it down and polished it off in a day or two.These are basically a collection of stories by renowned neurosurgeon Henry Marsh. Starting off with a description of how he ended up in this line of work in the first place, we then are introduced to a series of patients he helps both here and in his charitable work in Ukraine.What struck me is what an excellent writer he is. One of the themes he covers is how in many ways, the operating, even on an organ as complex as the brain, is the easy bit, it is the ""human"" side of things, the dealing with people who are usually going through some of the most difficult times of their lives which is really difficult.Over time, he tells us how his skills in this regard have developed, and I really thought you could see signs of this in his writing style - economic and efficient but deeply warm and moving at the same time. This is a man who is used to holding extremely difficult conversations with people, where he needs to explain matters which are totally alien to the layman, in a clear, balanced manner.There are points at which he seems to be a somewhat cantankerous man, but I can't even begin to think how spending thirty years handling the sort of work stress he handles would affect me.If you had asked me, before reading the first page, what I thought would be in the book, one of the obvious things would be the state of the NHS, the sprawling bureaucracy, the non-functional IT systems, the growth of a management-heavy cultured, and that is here in spades.It pales into insignificance, though, when you consider some of the truly heartbreaking stories he relates. The people whose lives are turned upside down, whether it be the diagnosis of a brain tumour, or the effects of what can happen should operations not go as hoped.The thing which really struck me was some of the language the authors uses.It doesn't take long to notice the frequent use of the words ""wrecked"" and ""broken"" to describe what happens to patients following procedures which go wrong. At first sight, this can appear high-handed or somewhat dismissive, not too dissimilar to, say, mechanics describing a car as ""a knacker"", or a ""lemon"". You soon come to realise, though, that this is anything but dismissive of the things which can go wrong for patients. The words are actually crushingly accurate, he is working in a world where a simple mistake can result in wrecked lives, broken minds. Maybe thinking of them in such blunt terms sounds heartless, but it struck me as a way for the surgeons to cope with the horrible reality of either factors out of their control, or the results of a simple mistake. The stakes are huge.""Good surgeons"", he is told by a colleague, ""tend to have bad memories"". That seemed very appropriate.Two things will stick in my mind for a while. One is the patient, a teacher in his 50s, who is diagnosed as having a tumour at the base of his skull.A long, difficult operation is envisaged, eventually lasting 18 hours. Marsh removes almost all of the tumour, certainly enough for the man to recover, and later acknowledges he should have stopped at that point. Instead, he admits he is at that point thinking he has arrived in the big league of neurosurgery, and finds himself thinking how the big medical conference speakers show their post operative scans and there is no tumour left at all.So, he decides to remove the small remaining bit of growth left. As he does so, an essential artery is torn, blood gushes everywhere, and he knows immediately that this was ""a catastrophe"". That patient never woke up, and remained in a persistent vegetative state.The story alone at that point alone would be tough enough, but several years later, he is visiting another patient at a nursing home, where he sees a name he recognises on the door to a patient's room, so takes a look inside. He realises, with horror, that the grey, curled up, motionless figure on the bed is the man mentioned above. A life ""wrecked"".It struck me that it must have taken immense courage to write about something like that, to admit that ruined life was in some part a terrible consequence of his hubris. It is this sort of amazing honestly that makes this book such an excellent, but difficult, read.The other story which will stay with me is that of how Mr Marsh became a neurosurgeon in the first place, a circuitous route, which he said contrasts hugely with the process of admittance to medical school today - he had no science background at all, not even at O Level. I found myself wondering whether in the focus on extraordinary A Level performance that gets people into med school these days, we are missing out on more people like Henry Marsh, who as well as being true experts in their field, offer so much more by having the sort of empathy and understanding which bridges the gap between medical professionals and the people on the operating table."
64,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4294263-amy-rogers,3,"ScienceThrillers review: Do No Harm: Stories of Life, Death, and Brain Surgery made the top 5 of the NYTimes bestseller list in Science this summer. People are loving this book.Me, not as much.Granted, I read the whole book and enjoyed doing so–evidence that this is good stuff, well written, intellectually engaging, even page-turning with suspense at times. The reason I didn’t fall in love, I think, is my personal reaction to the voice of the author, who represents a certain type of older male surgeon that I find less than endearing.Henry Marsh is a British neurosurgeon who has been in the business for a long time. (Apparently he’s a bit of a media star in England.) In this memoir-ish book, Marsh tells eye-opening stories about patients he’s had, and cases he’s performed, including some that did not end well. A blurb on the book’s back cover praises Marsh for “rare and unflinching honesty,” and I agree. This book’s strength is Marsh’s confessional approach to telling his stories, revealing his inner frustrations, worries, and insecurities.That a man who cuts open other people’s heads and mucks around with the insides suffers from doubts and insecurity should be no surprise, but in the psychologically strange world of surgery, it is shocking, in a way. For most of us, a mistake at work requires a broom or perhaps a delete key. For a neurosurgeon, even the tiniest lapse of judgment or concentration can mean lifelong paralysis, loss of speech, or death for the patient. No wonder that doubt creeps in. Yet on the outside, the surgeon must appear absolutely confident for the good of the patient, who can only cope with their situation by ascribing godlike properties to their doctor.This odd mental arrangement is laid bare in Marsh’s book. He admits that to operate when you know that you are fallible requires extraordinary courage, coupled with some unhealthy defense mechanisms: a tendency to forget your mistakes, and to blame others.Thus the arrogance of surgeons is legendary, and here we get into why I was put off by this narrator. While I give Marsh credit for his barefaced sincerity, and his desire to put the patient first, an arrogance runs through his stories that is not always sympathetic. Marsh has a particular disrespect for administration. Granted, his misadventures with the British National Health Service justify much of his scorn, but at the same time he represents an older generation of doctors who do not understand that medicine has changed. Surgeons are no longer boss of the world, not even in the OR. They can’t do whatever they want.This spills over into their relationships with coworkers, in particular, I think, women in medicine. The good old days of male trainees being chained to the hospital for days on end, and then lingering to share a drink with the boys, are gone. Marsh relates an episode of frustration with scheduling a case because an anesthesiologist had to leave the hospital to pick up her child. While Marsh puts most of the blame on the bureaucracy and its newfangled rules restricting physicians’ working hours, I sensed a total lack of appreciation for why younger doctors, especially women, might have lives outside the hospital. (Marsh, like most older surgeons, is no longer married to his first wife.)Do No Harm is primarily a loosely connected series of anecdotes, not a sustained narrative. Each chapter is named after a neurosurgical condition (Pineocytoma; Aneurysm) and includes a story about a patient with that. Many chapters have detailed descriptions of surgery, so they’re not for readers who are squeamish.Marsh also touches a little on end of life issues, on the wisdom of doing nothing in some cases, and the tension between hope and futility. This is a theme I find fascinating but is far better explored in another physician’s book, Being Mortal by Atul Gawande which I highly recommend. If you like Do No Harm, you’ll love: Being Mortal by Atul Gawande; The Afflictions by Vikram Paralkar; Working Stiff by Judy Melinek and TJ Mitchell. "

66,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11223424-robert,4,"Do No Harm by Henry Marsh.This book is a series of case histories written by the neurosurgeon Henry Marsh. In these stories we are given extraordinary insight not only into the world of brain surgery but also the modern NHS, the frighteningly backward facilities of the Ukraine (where Marsh performed operations), but above all into the humane mind of Henry Marsh himself.Neurosurgery is amongst the toughest of surgical disciplines because it is the one area where the smallest of slips can provoke the most drastic of outcomes such as severe disability, paralysis and death. Marsh is unflinchingly honest about the mistakes he’s made, the luck he has had and the tough process of learning from experience.Many of the surgeons I have come across have been arrogant, lacking in humanity and matter of fact about things that really matter to the patients they are dealing with. I suspect this comes from playing God on a daily basis with people’s lives. Having to distance yourself from what you are doing in order to be able to do it. Keeping any emotional involvement at bay because it would be too upsetting to face patients and families with catastrophic news.Henry Marsh has transformed my opinion. He talks to patients, in some cases he becomes their friend, he even talks to them while he’s operating on their brains to make sure that he isn’t ruining them. He talks to their families, he sympathizes and empathizes. He has abiding regrets for some of his decisions. On visiting a care home he sees the name of an ex-patient, who had been reduced to a mound on a bed, and relives the horror of that operation. He admits to hubris – in wanting to perform the perfect operation on a most difficult tumour he decides that he will go in one last time in order to cut out the very last bit. In doing so he puts his patient beyond repair. He has intense emotional experiences with patients and loved ones in languages he can’t even speak, he unleashes brilliant vituperative tirades against the stupidity of NHS managers, he has torrential arguments both in his head and out loud, he relates the death of his own mother with the most moving compassion, he diverts from going home to say goodbye to a patient he’d spent years trying to save. He is, in short, a brilliant surgeon, who is also utterly and totally human."
67,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5675365-simon-howard,3,"This is an autobiography of Henry Marsh's professional life as a neurosurgeon. There are a lot of interesting insights into the challenges of his branch of practice, and particularly good discussions of the complexity of balancing surgical risks. It also tickled me that he found his passion for neurosurgery when placed in a neurosurgery job at exactly the same point of training at I was - with completely the opposite outcome!My overriding feeling, however, was that Marsh comes across as a bit of an unpleasant bastard. He hurls instruments around his operating theatre, yells at his colleagues, knowingly and intentionally humiliates his juniors as a teaching technique, refuses ever to have students in clinic, and makes breathtakingly insensitive comments to dying patients (""Well, at least I kept you going this long!"")This all made me reflect the degree to which neurosurgery - or, at least, this neurosurgeon - is completely focused on a single patient at a time, with no concept of balancing the needs of multiple patients. Marsh regularly blows up about bed shortages delaying operations for his patients, without any reflection that someone is doing the tricky work of balancing the risks of cancelling his patients versus the risks of displacing other patients in completely different specialties. His lack of insight seems so profound that, at one point, he compares ""excessive"" infection control measures following an outbreak on his ward to being in a concentration camp. There's absolutely no recognition that spread of an infection today might well lead to cancelled operations tomorrow.Maybe that level of focus is required to reach his level of accomplishment in such a highly specialised field. Perhaps his narrow focus is the reason for his success. Maybe he's overly hard on himself in the book, or perhaps he felt pressure (personally, from the publisher, or at the stroke of an editor's pen) to emphasise a certain surgical bravado. Either way, I've no doubt that Marsh is very accomplished in his field, but I couldn't be more glad that I don't have to work with the bloke described in this book."
68,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/412055-kerfe,5,"""Do No Harm"" has all the intensity of a murder mystery. And in a way, a good doctor is like a good detective. He is trying to find an answer, a resolution to a problem, drawing on both his experience and a thorough investigation into the particular situation.This is life or death. Over and over, sometimes multiple times for the same patient.""Surgeons must always tell the truth but rarely, if ever, deprive patients of all hope. It can be very difficult to find the balance between optimism and realism.""The truth is actually not something most people are willing to acknowledge: it is impossible in practicing medicine on real people to always get things right. You cannot predict the exact course of an individual illness, or be certain of the results of a medical intervention.There is no infallibility. And yet we continue to demand perfection from medicine.One of the most startling aspects of Marsh's stories is that he so honestly and straightforwardly admits his mistakes. The anguish is palpable, but he doesn't try to foist off the blame. As a result the fact that failure is built into medicine becomes more clear. It's a wonder actually that it so often succeeds.We are going to die, all of us.How refreshing to see someone acknowledging the messiness and difficulty of living, of being in this world. To admit that doing your best is often not good enough, that perfection is just not an option, even among those most competent and experienced.""I wondered yet again...at the way we cling so tightly to life and how there would be so much less suffering if we did not. Life without hope is hopelessly difficult but at the end hope can so easily make fools of us all.""The need for a more compassionate and honest examination of the way we approach death is apparent. We need to look at, and accept, that all of us will die. For a nation so consumed with the idea of heaven, we seem oddly unable to fashion a loving and merciful bridge to the other side."
69,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9346543-victor-tatarskii,5,"Confessions of a neurosurgeon.In the age when medicine is becoming more and more guided by strict protocols and guidelines, surgery still depends now only on statistics, but on skill. This is even more true for neurosurgery, where any mistake could lead to irreversible brain damage and severe disability. So it's not surprising that neurosurgeons are much revered and there is an almost limitless belief in their abilities. In ""Do No Harm"", Henry Marsh, a well-known neurosurgeon with decades of practice shows the inside part of his profession, giving an account not only of successes and cures, but of failures, mistakes and tragedies. Each chapter, usually named after a disease of the brain, contains stories of patients: the ones successfully cured, the ones who could not be treated and the ones wrecked by the complications of operations or mistakes of the doctor. Marsh is almost painfully honest, describing his “small cemetery” of patients, the ""ghosts that watch him operate”, telling about his occasional anxiety before the operation, the shame he feels if the intervention didn't work, the decisions whether to operate at all, weighing the risks of operation against the not always large benefits (the difficult part, as he calls it). The operations themselves are beautifully and captivatingly described, and one could see that Marsh has a deep love with the brain and its complicated structure, and feel a small part of the terrifying excitement of an operations which he compares to ""bomb disposal"". There is also some wry, grumpy English humour at the expense of the NHS and hospital administration. But the best part of this excellent book is Marsh's compassionate reflections about his patients and talks with them, the meditations about the value of life and acceptance of death - things that we try to avoid, but with which he lives for many years. One could only hope to meet such a doctor in a critical moment."
70,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27336185-kenny,4,"Perhaps the most satisfying section of Ian McEwen's Saturday was when he followed his brain surgeon protagonist at work for a few days, so I was interested to read a book all about it. Henry Marsh is one of the UK's leading brain surgeons, and this is his account of things. What I didn't expect is that in some cases his writing bettered that of McEwen - the first few chapters which provide step by step accounts of dramatic brain surgery. That it's based on reality adds more drama, but I found myself far more tense than reading a dramatic thriller. Perhaps it was the plain language, and the lack of drama in his writing - he does not need to tell you if he's a couple of milimeters out, the patient could be irreversibly damaged. So his explanations build far more tension as they go. This lessens as the book goes on and he has less detail on operations, which also strengthens the book. Moving from the frankly sci-fi descriptions of operations and kit (ok, I'm still amazed by the lightbulb, so this stuff is really cool) and into more general discussions - with both pride and regret gives what feels like an honest self- appraisal of how he's done (google him: not bad is the general opinion).  He makes clear from the outset that as he aged, his sense of absolute confidence diminished, and this book contained some apologies as much as success. He goes some way to explaining why brain surgeons are widely characterised with massive egos - and clearly has/had this himself. But also the absolute power, coupled with an increasing fear of leaving someone severely damaged, disabled, vegetative - fates he (rightly) feared as worse than death are also made clear - and you can see how it creeps in.He writes between the dispassionate view of an objective doctor, and then the patients who do get into his head as much as he does theirs as after. And he's a very good writer. If you read one book about brain surgery..."

I have none of these..."" This book is truly remarkable and I would recommend it to anyone who ever had or will have an operation at some point in their life (99% of us). I think it's an essential read. Too many of us treat surgeons as some sort of divine puppet-masters, not realising that surgery is as much a game of luck as it is of skill. When we blame the surgeons, we cast them to all the way to hell and when we praise them, we give them a god-like status; there is (usually) no middle ground. We often forget that they are nothing more than simple individuals like the rest of us, prone to mistakes and deep, emotional struggles. Though, like Mr. Marsh points out they try to do their best to hide it and disengage from the patients. Surgeons might appear as cold and frighteningly rational people, but what most of us don't realise is that you wouldn't want them to be anything else. Neurosurgery is not for everyone, it takes the right kind of person and the right kind of mind-state. Not all of us are ready to appreciate how much struggle it actually takes, but all of us should learn to respect it. This books will help you do just that. What I've learned from this book:1. Surgery is very much a game of luck.2. Operating is the easy part; difficulties are all to do with the decision making3. Power corrupts and surgeons need to be held responsible even if it's often not their fault.4. Great surgeons have bad memories - if all surgeons were emotionally involved they wouldn't be as effective at what they do.5. The best is the enemy of the good. "

It's incredibly fascinating and difficult. Each chapter in this book talks about a different illness that falls under neurology alongside his many patients and their stories. There are a lot of glimpses here and there about what it's like for him being a neurosurgeon, what's it like dealing with life threatening illnesses, the urge to be in control and operate, the doctor-patient relationship and how hard that can be sometimes, what it's like being a patient or a parent of a patient, how revealing bad news never gets easy and what all of that entails on his personal life. There's so much about one could say about this book but I don't have all the right words for it. It's just really intriguing. This book offers a nice balance between medical information, day-to-day operations and personal anecdotes. There's so much to learn from this book. No matter how many times I say this or how many times I feel in awe after reading one of these books it just boils down to the fact that doctors do a lot of incredible stuff and there's so much about what goes on that we don't know about or as people who aren't in the medical profession find it hard to fathom or even understand and that just makes it riveting and interesting. At least to me.The only reason this is a three star is that I'm not a fan of the writing style. I would imagine this would have been a different experience if I'd listen to it instead of reading it."

I have a morbid fascination with medical things and after reading about the number of different types on brain tumours both operable and inoperable I was looking forward to learning more from the surgeon's point of view.This is a very honest and open book which has many short chapters, each focusing on individual case studies - different tumours and different patients all with their own complications or considerations. Whist there are some upsetting chapters they each give a different perspective on what needs to be taken into consideration prior to each and every surgery. Do No Harm gives an interesting glimpse into what it’s like to be a neurosurgeon and the things they go through inside and outside of the surgical theatre.I was fascinated by the stories of time spent working in the Ukraine as well as around the UK within the NHS. In all this is an enlightening insight into the world of neurosurgery from Dr Henry Marsh. He is a man who whilst obviously extremely talented and a true life saver also comes across as absolutely human, tormented when things go wrong and truly grateful when things go right.All reviews available at www.momobookdiary.com"

Having heard him interviewed on Terry Gross' show Fresh Air, I decided to read his memoir. At first I was put off by the graphic details and wondered what ever possessed me to read such a book. But then I became fascinated by the author's musings on life and death and on the intricate surgeries he performs on the human brain, the most complex of human organs. Unlike other surgeries, one little mistake can have devastating consequences. How he deals with crucial decisions day in and day out, while navigating the extreme bureaucracy of the British NHS, is fascinating reading. We also learn that Dr. Marsh is a generous humanitarian, having performed numerous surgeries in Ukraine. He is the subject of a BBC documentary, The English Surgeon. Henry Marsh embodies all the fine qualities we would like in a doctor - brilliant, competent and most importantly, empathetic. And he's a darn good writer!"

The best aspect of the book is the writer's lack of pretension--or his episodes of pretension, followed by apologies. The author has led a very rare and unusual life: Saving or killing persons needing major neurosurgery. His humility in the face of the usual towering arrogance of doctors in this specialty is refreshing. He calls himself out for the times when he tried to pull rank, shouted at younger doctors, and considered himself very important. At the end of his career, he acknowledges the huge power that neurosurgeons have over life, death, and successful or unsuccessful recoveries. His admission of feeling helpless in instances of having to tell family members that their loved one has just died, and especially having to admit that sometimes he or his team caused the death by incompetence, misdiagnosis, or sheer hubris, is courageous and appears truthful. I would guess he's an exceptional neurosurgeon based on his humility in the face of great success. A very authentic book."

I got a few chapters in and couldn't stand how incredibly egotistical he is. There are a lot of parts in the book that I can relate to but most of it is just about how much he is above other doctors in the hospital (as well as staff and the general public) because he is a neurosurgeon. I got halfway through the book and had to stop reading because he is just such an ass to the other staff and clinicians at his hospital, I couldn't take it any more! He is the stereotypical surgeon that I cannot STAND working with- throwing things, yelling, believing he is god's gift to the earth. I could see why a lot of people like the book for the stories of each patient he tells, but I couldn't look past his immense ego.Very disappointing read, interesting description of the cases but his ego puts a dark storm cloud over the entire book to me."

The chapters are short, and so there are a lot of them. By the time I'd finished reading, I'd learned way more about what can go wrong with the brain than I ever hoped to know.The topic is absolutely fascinating. I guess I'd always considered the brain a mass of undifferentiated goo, but this book takes us on a grand tour through all the various bits and pieces that can swell up, shrink down, go askew or separate, and how lots of human ingenuity has been brought to bear on each problem. In some cases, of course, the best course of action is to do nothing at all, and this is something that surgeons, like most people, just have to learn as they grow up."

Obviously you have not mind reading about operations nor be the kind of person who starts imagining symptoms just by reading about them. My husband agreed to let me read some of the book aloud to him, and said he would tap my arm when he'd heard as much as he could bare; I didn't get to finish one sentence - although I did deliberately select a more gruesome one.

Facing his patients years after surgery (both successes and failures). It is also fantastically written - unpretentious but gripping.

Dr. Marsh has a very...detached way about writing about things, even if they are emotional moments. Which I suppose makes sense if you need that kind of detachment as a neurosurgeon? Yet there was an air of self importance in his writing that I could not settle into. Understandably, neurosurgery is a profession that demands great respect. Yet throughout this book I couldn’t help but feel entitlement from Dr. Marsh when he expresses his frustrations with hospital staff.I suppose my idea if medical memoirs are based upon first impressions from books I’ve read previous to this one. I often feel thoughtful, inspired, and introspective upon reading about the insight given by a medical professional and their duty to society as healthcare provider and lifeline against death. Yet...this book made me feel sad. Jaded. Tired. And a large part of that was reflected off of the author’s way of recollection.

Gripping, emotional, funny, gentle, deeply sad, philosophical and hopeful. Marsh manages to detach himself from his own professional detachment to describe what it's like to operate on life-or-death brain surgery cases every day for 35 years. He combines care for patients, an ingrained understanding of the role of probability and luck in complex surgery and a continued fascination with the technical skill of his craft into his uncomplicated but moving prose.Broadly, Marsh writes about people and cases, providing enough technical exposition to leave the reader feeling informed and with an appreciation of the difficulty of the operations without needing to demonstrate his own (clearly substantial) intelligence. It's a look behind the scenes of life in a modern hospital, too, punctuated with frustration at NHS reforms and bureaucracy.I could write about this for hours, but suffice to say that this is a triumph by a master in his field. I recommend it unreservedly."

But I liked reading about the procedures and glimpsing a little hospital behind-the-scenes action. 
100,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"There was a trailer that kept playing on TV during my childhood from the TV series ER. As a sort of subtitle on the trailer was written that a doctor is a true image of God on Earth. I was at a pretty impressionable age then and swallowed this completely thinking that a doctor is one of those divine entities who one has to view with reverence. It took a few years for that to be beaten out of me and to realize that human beings everywhere, no matter what they do are prone to make mistakes. Henry Marsh’s book is a series of anecdotes from his life as a renowned neurosurgeon, a life where he is not a superhero but a professional working on a job where one slip is the difference between life and death. He has done countless surgeries and saved a lot of lives from death (imminent and otherwise) but that does not stop him from musing that : A famous English surgeon once remarked that a surgeon has to have the nerves of steel, the heart of a lion and the hands of a woman. I have none of these and instead, at this point of an aneurysm operation, I have to struggle against an overwhelming wish to get the operation over and done with, and to leave the clip in place, even if it is not quite perfectly placed. The tone of the book follows these lines for Dr.Marsh does not write about anecdotes that herald him as a surgeon who never stumbles but he tells us how fragile the whole job is. The title of the book as I understand is derived from the Latin term Primum non nocere (first ,do no harm) which forms a fundamental principle for anyone practicing medicine. But doctors sometimes end up doing harm and it is to these that Marsh calls our attention to. There could be a multitude of reasons : incompetence, ignorance, bad luck or even hubris that have the surgeon ending up with a mistake. The mistake can be of such gravity that you leave the patient to a life more wretched than death. In Marsh’s words : Doctors need to be held accountable, since power corrupts. There must be complaints procedures and litigation, commissions of enquiry, punishment and compensation. At the same time if you do not hide or deny any mistakes when things go wrong, and if your patients and their families know that you are distressed by whatever happened, you might, if you are lucky, receive the precious gift of forgiveness.It is not a grim book filled with gloom and doom but one that speaks with brutal candor of what it means to hold someone’s life in your hands. Surgeons also have that unenviable job of breaking bad news to the relatives. A group of people with their eyes full of expectation await the surgeon in the consulting room and he/she has to walk up to them, sit them down and tell them that their loved one might not be coming back. How do you deal with the helplessness, the grief and the rage ? How do you even maintain a semblance of calm in the face of all these ? Think as I might, I can never find this strength in me. There is an instance that Marsh recounts of one of his patients suffering a fatal post-operative stroke that disabled the entire right side of the body. When he visits her at the bed, she in all her helplessness mumbles through the left side of her mouth in a slurred voice ‘I trusted you’, it is not easy to erase these words from memory. The words sometimes affect Dr. Marsh so much that he tells one of his juniors ’Terrible job, neurosurgery. Don’t do it !’. The relationship between patients and doctors can be that :Patients are both terrified and ignorant. How are they to know whether the surgeon is competent or not ? They will try to overcome their fear by investing the surgeon with superhuman abilities.…and many a time the superhuman fails. In one of the most touching scenes in the book, Dr. Marsh visits a nursing home run by Catholic nuns. The place specializes on taking care of people who have been rendered invalid or in a vegetative state following accidents or surgeries. The only way someone new to the place can identify one individual from the next is to read their names printed on boards outside the rooms. Walking the corridor, Dr. Marsh is horrified to realize that five of those names became inmates here only following his surgery on them ! Highly recommended. Humane, incisive and very pragmatic a view of neurosurgery and what it means to be a doctor.As an aside, I loved these lines by Dr. Marsh : Neuroscience tells us that it is highly improbable that we have souls, as everything we think and feel are no more or no less than the electrochemical chatter of our nerve cells. Our sense of self, our feelings and our thoughts, our love for others, our hopes and ambitions, our hates and fears all die when our brains die. "
101,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39882547-linda-hill,5,"A factual memoir about the life of an eminent brain surgeon, Henry Marsh.Do No Harm opens with a fairly graphic description of brain surgery and initially I had the feeling I was going to be too squeamish to read this memoir. However, Henry Marsh writes with such eloquence that I was drawn in within a couple of pages and found myself completely held in his thrall.What works so well in this book is the balance of factual and medical detail, explanation of procedures, hospital administration and insight into the personality of the author. Henry Marsh does not spare himself or the reader from his triumphs and disasters, his generosity and his embarrassments, so that there is a true sense of the man behind the surgical mask. I must admit I found some of the passages referring to the bureaucracy and inadequate systems our doctors and nurses have to work within made my blood boil.I thoroughly enjoyed meeting all the people Henry Marsh worked on and with, and have to admire the way in which he dealt with them. I’m not at all certain I could have behaved with many of them as equitably as did the author. I got a vivid sense of the people and personalities and felt that I had encountered their experiences with them because the writing is so skilful. Indeed, it is quite poetic at times. Although Henry Marsh sees himself as an ordinary man I have to disagree. He is a fantastic surgeon, a magnificent writer and a thoroughly compassionate and wonderful, if flawed, human being. It is those flaws and human frailties that make reading Do No Harm so mesmerising.I thought Do No Harm was written with honesty, humility, humour and, above all, a real feeling of humanity. It’s a fascinating and sometimes heartbreaking read that I recommend most highly. I could not tear myself away from its pages."
102,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12884422-steven-yenzer,3,"Marsh is a gifted writer and Do No Harm is a fascinating read. Unfortunately, his dislike of authority of any kind is so pervasive as to be distracting. He never misses a chance to lament some new regulation that is getting between him and his patients. Marsh has never met a rule he didn't like, and he doesn't seem to be able to imagine that anyone above him has any idea what they're doing."
103,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6949946-xilaii,5,"I was unsure about reading this. I tend towards paranoia when it comes to health and things you can do nothing about, and it's really not a good time for me to be reading about cancers and dying. I guess there won't ever be a good time. It was not an easy read and I was more detached than I usually am when I read most books. I imagine to the right person in the right frame of mind is a very emotionally draining book. That's not to say that I wasn't moved by it- I was, in pretty much every direction. It is as buoyant as it is heavy, it is as entertaining as it is saddening and it is as interesting as it is ordinary. There is no separation or remarkable difference, but I found the second half much more enjoyable than the first. I started out thinking he was a privileged asshole, but ended it humbled to know I could not have lived one day in his shoes. The arrogance is just a side effect of revealing so much, I think. The honesty is actually quite refreshing. It is not a glamorous list of successes and bragging, but nor is it a melancholy list of failures and regret. It is what it says it will be, stories. Stories about life, and death. Stories of brain surgery. And perhaps, most importantly I think, stories about the part of us that brain surgeons (or anyone, for that matter) know so little about - the millions of electric impulses that make us people. And as much as stories of life are themselves unique, I think this particular book was worth the read for it's perspective alone. It is one that an overwhelming majority of everyone who ever lived would never otherwise know, and I'm grateful Henry Marsh decided to share it."

105,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5847899-patrick,4,"[4.5]I've read a few reviews that have complained that this book is repetitive. But I think that is part of the point. It is a book about work - and about what it feels like to be doing that work day in and day out. And that's something that the multiple descriptions of brain surgery, which almost always seems to boil down to 'clipping' an aneurysm or removing a tumour, helps to get across. Marsh is good at getting across both the appeal of the work - the satisfaction that can come from doing something really challenging (I've heard him interviewed on the radio about remarking to a patient ""this look's like it'll be a fun tumour to remove"" and, adding, when the patient appeared disconcerted - ""Well, you don't want to be operated on by someone who hates their job do you?"" The book certainly gives you an idea of where the idea of the surgeon who comes to develop the god complex comes from. Knowing that the life or death of others depends on you, and having a whole team hanging on your word can probably have that effect on anyone.But there is a downside to the work, and he's good on that too. The fact that the consequences of failure - and of avoidable human error - is death, or quite possibly worse, years of severe disability. There is a very sad story of how a decision to let an inexperienced junior doctor lead on an operation to deal with a trapped nerve leaves a patient with permanent paralysis. And then there are the difficult conversations with family members and relatives who are begging him to perform operations which have little or no chance of prolonging the patient's life in any meaningful way, and he's honest enough to admit that on occasion, he bowed to that pressure, and almost always regretted doing so. In neurosurgery the delivery of bad news is commonplace enough and he muses on it at one point that ""you never really know if you've done a good job. Nobody has ever got in touch to say ""thank you for the way you told me I was going to die today""...There's humour here too - usually directed at the sometimes Kafka-esque bureaucracy that he rightly or wrongly sees as foisted on doctors by managers who understand little of the work that hospitals actually do. Logging on to a computer he uses to see x-rays causes particular frustration to him, and his secretary remarks ""try Mr Johnston's password. That usually works. Fuck Off 45. He hates computers.""""Why forty five?""""It's the forty fifth month since we signed on to the hospital's system and one has to change the password every month."""
106,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7949813-emma,4,"A warts and all memoir that plunges the reader head first into the fascinating and fragile world of a brain surgeon. Alongside vivid descriptions of human anatomy are the raw confessions of a man driven at times by his arrogance and at other times driven by his compassion, an aspect of humanity that Marsh openly battles with throughout his writing.It was harrowing to discover the difficulties faced by what I deemed to be an exact, yet deeply challenging, branch of medicine. Marsh's openness is a credit to his writing, and his admission that mistakes are easy to make, especially when driven by the desperate need to impress your intimidating peers, left me equally awestruck and terrified. His writing dallies between his own life, outside of medicine and, more frequently, into the brief encounters his has with his patients, those that he saves, those who have longer to spend with families and friends, those who he leaves in a vegetative state due to unavoidable catastrophe or his own over confidence and lastly, those that perish in spite of or as a result of his actions. It is a world I did not envy, one that, through Marsh's admission, ruined his first marriage and requires enough detachment and strength of mind that you can get through the stress of walking into an operating theatre and facing the chance you might fail.Marsh also explores the changes that have occurred during the length of his career, one that seems to irk him the most is the dwindling of respect for both his skills and the needs of his patients. There are some interesting questions raised here about the declining state of our National Health Service, questions posed by those that work within its bowels rather than the patients.Marsh's writing puts the reader straight into the heart of his operations, vivid descriptions completely submerge you inside the grey matter of his patients and his ability to recall the drama faced by himself and his team is tangible. It was refreshing to find a memoir on such a complex, academic subject so easy to read, Marsh truly knows how to reel in the reader, I was hooked until the very end.Overall, a fresh, exciting well written memoir that demands to be read, not only by those who have had friends or family who have endured the challenging, mysterious world of brain surgery, as patient or practitioner, but also by anyone curious and fearless enough to learn about a riveting, pressure driven career with rules that blur at the most tragic of times."
107,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4158121-sarah,5,"I needed to mix things up a bit. It was getting too heavy and dystopian with all the environmentalism and animal abuse and humans-are-rapidly-killing-everything-they-touch and whatnot. Not that I’m done with that kind of reality forever, but all those reminders of how moronic and doomed we are as a species can really weigh on a person, am I wrong? Anyway, this book wasn’t a targeted selection– it was simply one of the first things I saw in the Kindle Store that looked interesting. And interesting it was! A quick read, and quite the page turner if you ask me.Doctors have long been perceived as infallible heroes in many cultures, including our own (and that of the U.K. where Dr. Marsh works as a consulting neurosurgeon). Movies and television shows like Grey’s Anatomy and E.R. demonstrate our fascination with the ever-mysterious lives and works of the Gods of the O.R. I don’t think many would argue the possibility that we may have a slightly skewed perception of what actually goes on in hospitals and the lives of the folks who work in them. I know you’re thinking to yourself: “Wait, there ISN’T any spontaneous, choreographed song and dance?!” And I’m here as the bearer of bad news. There is no spontaneous, choreographed song and dance. I’m as shocked and appalled as you are. Turns out, doctors are actually human. Who knew! They have lives outside of their work; they have families and hobbies and quirks. They pay bills and face the frustrations of bureaucracy and systematic failure. They’re personally and familially susceptible to disease and death and they, just like their patients (the rest of us), sometimes make mistakes. *GASP* Luckily (or maybe not so much for those of us who prefer believing in the Doctors Can Do No Wrong theory), folks like Dr. Marsh are finding the graciousness and courage to tell it like it is. To share with us the real story of anatomy, emergencies, our twisted up healthcare system, the triumph of life and the inevitability of death. Marsh is confident and smart with an impressive talent for describing, simply and accessibly, his insanely complex work. But he is equally humble and openly shares his failures, mistakes, and frustrations. He’s genuine, and that makes him a pleasure to read. Even without the all the television style melodrama. So, long story short. Brains are cool, doctors are human, and one day we’re all going to die."
108,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/320372-lenny-husen,5,"I LOVED this and LOVED the narrator's voice. I listened to it in the car. The first disc contained the most suspenseful story I've heard/read in a long while--I was figuratively biting my nails in anxiety for how the surgery was going to turn out. I particularly love British English and every word was a delight. It was beautifully, elegantly, sensitively and warmly well-written.Neurosurgeon Henry Marsh has displaced Professor Robert Greenberg as the Number One Person whose hand I would love to shake, a list that also includes Atul Gawande, Paul Farmer, Abraham Verghese. Warning: this book isn't for someone who doesn't like the thought of blood (such as one of my brothers). Very graphic as far as surgery, terminal illness, death.What was harder to bear for me personally was the descriptions of Hospital Bed Control and the extremely irriting hospital administration's lack of respect and rules that served to impede work getting done--I could identify as I deal with this kind of thing daily as well and could commiserate. I laughed out loud at MAST (MANDATORY AND STATUTORY TRAINING) for Improved Customer Service that Mr. Marsh was forced to attend and had to leave to tell the anxious family of a patient that their loved one was going to die, and then to go back to the Training. Also I laughed and shouted in my car at the ""Best Password"" Marsh had to use to get into the Remote Radiology System in order to give the patient his prognosis about his brain tumour, where the difficulty getting into the system to review the film cost Mr. Marsh and the waiting patients 30 unnecessary minutes delay.Marsh describes cases that were tragic failures and those that were brilliant successes, both with grace, charm, humility. Who should listen to this book: Any doctor, anyone caring for a loved one or patient with a brain tumour, any one with an interest in Surgery or Medicine. Especially anyone interested in Neurosurgery, the Pinnacle of Medicine. Note: This is the third book I've read by a Neurosurgeon, and I no longer envy them, as I once did as a Pre-Med Student. It is not a life that my particular brain could lead with any success."
109,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22117564-douglas-lord,5,"There’s an old Far Side cartoon that shows a group of doctors obscuring a patient on an operating table. “Whoa!” says one. “That was a good one! Try it, Hobbs—just poke his brain right where my finger is.” Marsh (an actual brain surgeon for Britain’s National Health Service), aka Dr. Reality Check, here manfully acknowledges the unreal level of trust that patients put in their doctors and also recognizes medicine’s inherent fallacy: “[i]f the operation succeeds the surgeon is a hero, but if it fails he is a villain.” Anecdotes illustrate “attempts, and occasional failures, to find a balance between the necessary detachment and compassion that a surgical career requires, a balance between hope and realism.” It’s a fairly upsetting, sometimes brutal, book to read. For example, the brain “…has the consistency of jelly” and Marsh’s simultaneous “fear and excitement” when he lets his “instruments sink into the brain or spinal cord” is unnerving. He admits to speaking with “false optimism” to a man with a tumor in his pineal gland (that’s way deep inside the brain, Chumley) and laments the young woman who “…had had a tumour in her spinal cord, between the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae” who “awoke from the operation paralysed down the right side of her body. I had probably tried to take out too much of the tumour,” he admits. Another chapter is all about a lecture he gives, titled “All My Worst Mistakes,” that puts Michael Jordan’s failure speech to shame. VERDICT Imagine the unimaginable—Marsh reveals a real person behind the mystique, one who is trying as mightily as he can to heal but who is all too aware of his errors.Find this review and others at Books for Dudes, the online reader's advisory column for men from Library Journal here.

110,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6200323-david-ball,5,"Like Atul Gawande’s Being Mortal I fought this. I knew from the reviews that Do No Harm was something I should read, but the subject matter always put me off. After a long day of work, chasing kids, and being a responsible adult, it’s not always easy to sit down and read about death, or in this case brain surgery. And unsurprisingly the 'right-mood' window to attempt these types of books is both infrequent and fleeting. At least with Being Mortal I felt I was being forced to contemplate some of life’s most difficult questions, and if it wasn’t exactly enjoyable, at least it felt useful or productive, as it does whenever one finally faces up to doing something previously avoided. Do No Harm does not have the same redeeming features. First of all, it compels one to consider a pretty horrific subject, one that most people would normally try to great lengths to avoid. Then it makes matters worse by dwelling on the fallibility of the surgeon. If I was about to undergo a brain operation, I wouldn't want to know about my surgeon’s bad moods, mistakes, insecurities, tiredness or helplessness. But that's Henry Marsh. Excessively conscious and self-aware; honest to a fault, and superbly human - a gloriously Knausgardian figure. Full of complexities and contradictions, he's great company, and probably a great surgeon; although you come to realize from reading this book that greatness has its limitations when it comes to life and death matters. That's probably the most valuable lesson with both Do No Harm and Being Mortal - these books look you in the eye and tell you the truth. It may not be pretty, but it's realistic. And sometimes that's enough to warrant five stars. "
111,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145290-amy-qualls,3,"As someone who was married to someone who sustained a brain injury while I was married to him, I knew I would not have the easiest of relationships with this book. One of the supporting characters in this book -- asking questions, unsure whether to hope or fear -- could very easily have been me, if this book had been written at a different hospital.I've dealt with surgeons and other medical professionals with Marsh's mindset, and had an expectation of what his personality would be in this book. I was correct, and in that regard, this book was exactly what I expected. On the other hand, I was also a little bit disappointed; I think I was hoping for some level of additional insight by reading this book, and there was none for me. It's possible that my prior experience as the caregiver of a TBI survivor meant I'd already gained the insight Marsh hoped I'd receive as a reader of this book.I did find some comfort in one of the themes, though. From spending time watching families come and go in a neurological intensive care unit, I came away with the deep suspicion that many medical professionals perform overly heroic measures on brain injury patients in the name of prolonging life, without consideration to the quality of life they are prolonging. Dr. Marsh acknowledged this tendency and discussed it openly; his conclusions are quite similar to mine. Letting go is hard, unspeakably hard, but not every survival is a success story.The book's not for the faint of heart. If you're curious about the mindset of surgeons, or need closure after seeing a brain injury affect the life of someone you love, give it a try."
112,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie,5,"“Do no harm” is paraphrased in the Hippocratic Oath that medical students are all exposed to first thing. It’s the common principal in all medicine, but is especially stressed in neurosurgery, where the possibility for harm is so high. Henry Marsh has been a top neurosurgeon in Great Britain for many years and shares his stories of the trade here. Each chapter is named for and explores the treatment of a different neurological problem; meningioma, pituitary adenoma, infarct. Each chapter features a different patient; we see how the patient came to Marsh, how the operation went, and sometimes we see how they fared. Not always; sometimes they are whisked way back to the hospital that referred them, rather them leaving them under the care of the surgeon. So there are times that the author had no idea how they ultimately turned out. The descriptions of the problems and the way they are treated fascinated me, but beware if you are squeamish- the author describes things pretty vividly. But his book is not just about operations; it’s also about his own life, the about the NHS system in England. The system limits not just patient care but the hours doctors can work, which can make arranging long operations difficult. New doctors don’t have time enough to learn all they should. Marsh describes taking this out on nurses, anesthesiologists, clerks, and more- while an empathic, caring, man with patients, he seems to have been an ass to those he worked with at times- and admits it. I couldn’t put this book down. It was like reading a series of exciting stories, watching Marsh’s expertise and character grow. And I love a good medical description. "

Some would say it is too frank with its graphic description of mistakes and of suffering. Each chapter is centered around a specific medical condition of the brain or the spinal cord and has details on the surgery and the recovery all beautifully wrapped around the human story. The book is at times sad when he talks about personal connections with patients and their lives and deaths, at times funny especially when he describes the detailed turd descriptions as part of record keeping and about botched computerization of the records, and at times political when he shows his disdain for the NHS and the management of medicine by bureaucrats. You manage to get into the head of a very conscientious doctor as he makes life or death decisions. There is also the frank admission that a lot of what happens in these surgeries comes down to luck. I walked away with a renewed appreciation and understanding of the complexity (or the knowledge of how much I do not know) of the human brain, the decisions and the aftermath that these extremely skilled surgeons have to live with and the thought process that goes into their interactions. If you have wondered how a doctor can seem so detached for something that can be life or death for you, this book will help you get closer to that answer. "
114,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6053755-audrey,5,"This book amazed me in a couple of ways. First, that a book subtitled ""Stories of Life, Death, and Brain Surgery"" could manage to be not only enjoyable, but somewhat uplifting. Second, that someone who has had a career in a field that seems utterly daunting to me can also write. Marsh's stories tell us not only that he is a gifted and compassionate surgeon but also a talented writer. As I noted when I first tried to begin reading ""Do No Harm"" a few days after recovering from a migraine, this is NOT a book for hypochondriacs or anyone who tends to adopt the symptoms of whatever they are reading about. Marsh writes candidly about what afflicts his patients (and, in some cases, himself and his family members). You'll need to be able to tolerate that to enjoy the book.He organizes each story around a particular diagnosis or anomaly (for example, ""Meningioma"" or ""Tic Doloreux"") which also names the chapter. We learn about his early training, difficult cases, and something of his personal life, as well as about the challenges and evolution of the U.K.'s National Health System during the more than 40 years of Marsh's career. The book's episodic structure contributes greatly to its readability. What might otherwise have been a ho-hum, ""first this happened, then this happened"" narrative becomes a powerful meditation on our common humanity, human fallibility, and some truly mind-blowing (no pun intended) insights into the human mind and brain."
115,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6390523-marco,5,"Illness is something that happens only to patients. This is an important lesson you learn early on as a medical student. You are suddenly exposed to a terrifying new world of illness and death, and you learn how terrible illnesses often start with quite trivial symptoms - blood on the toothbrush can mean leukaemia, a small lump in the neck might mean cancer, a previously unnoticed mole might be a malignant melanoma. Most medical students go trough a brief period when they develop all matter of imaginary illnesses - I myself had leukaemia for at least four days - until they learn, as a matter of self-preservation, that illnesses happen to patients, not to doctors. This necessary detachment from patients becomes all the greater when you start working as a junior doctor and you have to do frightening and unpleasant things to patients. It starts with simple blood-taking and inserting drips, and progresses over time - if you train as a surgeon - to ever more radical procedures, cutting and slicing into people's bodies. It would be impossible to do the work if you felt the patients' fear and suffering yourself. Besides, the increasing responsability that comes as you climb the career ladder brings greater anxiety that you will make a mistake and that patients will suffer. Patients become objects of fear as well as of sympathy. It is much easier to feel compassion for other people if you are not responsible for what happens to them."
116,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9281513-cheryl,4,"A fascinating dive into the world of neurosurgery. This one won't be for everyone as it can be stark and even brutal (who knew that they do some brain surgeries while the patient is awake and sitting up?). That said, the author, who is one of the U.K.'s foremost neurosurgeons, takes the reader behind the scenes. We feel like we are in the operating room with him. We are witness to absolutely amazing successes, and we join him as he explains to a patient that there is no hope. The book was given to me by my sister who lives in the U.K., and there are plenty of digs at the British NHS. However, Marsh balances the digs with witness to how a national health care system can provide not just adequate, but many times,quite remarkable care to those who might not otherwise be able to avail themselves of it. For American readers, it will provide pros and cons of a national health care system of which we need to be aware, as the issue of universal health care is definitely on the horizon for us. If you are not the queasy type, I highly recommend this book. I do have to say that at one point, I had to drop it as it became too dark. That may have been just where I was then, in my life, (especially given that I am an estate attorney and live in death's back yard), or it may be that sometimes one needs to take a break with a glass of wine and some good fiction. Obviously I picked it up again and am glad that I did."

The medical stuff was great but I could do without moaning and whinging about managers and his (apparent) disrespect for work health and safety and any kind of bureaucracy. I get that it can be annoying but he also wouldn't be able to do his job without it. The apparent contempt with which he held the managers (non-medical) in the hospital was a bit mind-blowing. Again, not sure if it was in part a bad interpretation from the narrator - I heard Mr. Marsh interviewed on ABC's Conversations podcast and he sounded WAY nicer and far more personable. Perhaps some of it was written ironically? There was some of that ""doctors are superior and neurosurgeons are the most superior"" thing going on but he seemed both self-aware and self-deprecating about it (at least at times - from the text only - I couldn't tell that from the narrator's tone) that I decided to give that a pass.I didn't love the narration but as it was non-fiction I was mostly able to not let it get in the way. There were stupid pauses between tracks so the production wasn't the best (I borrowed the CDs from the library and imported them into iTunes - I suspect the download would be smoother but I'm not buying it to check).It was fascinating and also a little terrifying because: brain tumours are scary! Note to self: do not panic next time you get a headache. Argh."
118,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46238669-varun-padmanaban,5,"Marsh in this brilliant memoir of his life and surgical career expounds his errors and he does so in a manner where he explores how these errors has changed him, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. He speaks of his “small cemetery, where from time to time he goes to pray.” Importantly, he speaks with an aura of reckless honesty compared to the usually defensive surgeon’s emotions. Interestingly, he speaks of his daily anxiety – before surgery on the decision whether to operate or not, sometimes during the surgery he is – “oppressed by dread, almost a feeling of doom” and right before the surgery he is often seized by panic before entering flow – “fierce and happy concentration.” He speaks of the pain he feels for his patients whom are vegetative, curled up, alive yet unable to do anything. What he feels in speaking to their family and loved ones. He speaks of luck – even while he ids blamed for what goes wrong and praised for what goes right, and in the end he uses this luck to create his moral code: never lie to a patient, control how you feel by not letting your feelings add to a patients’ fear or unhappiness. In a fitting end, his last chapter, “Anesthesia dolorosa” speaks of a patient who can no longer feel pain in one of her facial nerves and he describes how this can sometimes be ironically painful. One is sometimes determined to feel as much as he can."
119,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6893402-counsel182,5,"This is an amazing book. I stumbled upon Dr. Marsh while reading a New York Times Magazine article about him by Karl Ove Knausgaad that was equally fascinating (December 2015). In fact, about the only criticism I would have about ""Do No Harm"" is the first person narrative is at times too personal and shocking in all its splendid candor that I fear Dr. Marsh (my latest ""hero"") is opening himself up far too much. He is quite human and in neurosurgeons that is refreshing and self deprecating when he admits that his own surgeries have gone horribly wrong with dire consequences. Reading such candor here in the United States where such revelations can only lead to a minefield of litigation is amazing. Dr. Marsh also does not sugarcoat the pitfalls of the English ""socialized"" medical two-tier system which also makes this book a bit of a primer on what MUST be done here in the states to reform the silly health care system we currently have and the insane attempts to derail affordable care for all.But, getting back to Dr. Marsh and this exceptional book--I also had the very good fortune years ago to stumble across Dr. Richard Seltzer's ""Mortal Lessons: Notes on the Art of Surgery"" which was equally refreshing and amazing. I would hope Dr. Marsh and Dr. Seltzer would have at one time crossed paths. These amazing men give hope to the art and science of medicine. "

A fascinating and candid insight into the world of neurosurgery, technical enough to interest medics yet accessible enough for anyone to pick up. Recommend! :)"
122,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10638379-mitchell-keo,3,"Was not very moved upon finishing this book. Dr. Marsh has a very...detached way about writing about things, even if they are emotional moments. Which I suppose makes sense if you need that kind of detachment as a neurosurgeon? Yet there was an air of self importance in his writing that I could not settle into. Understandably, neurosurgery is a profession that demands great respect. Yet throughout this book I couldn’t help but feel entitlement from Dr. Marsh when he expresses his frustrations with hospital staff.I suppose my idea if medical memoirs are based upon first impressions from books I’ve read previous to this one. I often feel thoughtful, inspired, and introspective upon reading about the insight given by a medical professional and their duty to society as healthcare provider and lifeline against death. Yet...this book made me feel sad. Jaded. Tired. And a large part of that was reflected off of the author’s way of recollection. Which makes sense, since neurosurgery is a very emotionally demanding field. But it was not something within this book that I could feel myself moved by."
123,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15788793-ed,5,"What an absolutely stunning book. I've been recommending this to anyone who will listen since about 10 pages in. Gripping, emotional, funny, gentle, deeply sad, philosophical and hopeful. Marsh manages to detach himself from his own professional detachment to describe what it's like to operate on life-or-death brain surgery cases every day for 35 years. He combines care for patients, an ingrained understanding of the role of probability and luck in complex surgery and a continued fascination with the technical skill of his craft into his uncomplicated but moving prose.Broadly, Marsh writes about people and cases, providing enough technical exposition to leave the reader feeling informed and with an appreciation of the difficulty of the operations without needing to demonstrate his own (clearly substantial) intelligence. It's a look behind the scenes of life in a modern hospital, too, punctuated with frustration at NHS reforms and bureaucracy.I could write about this for hours, but suffice to say that this is a triumph by a master in his field. I recommend it unreservedly."
124,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739605-helen-costello,5,Absolutely fascinating and perfect for fans of medical literature. Henry Marsh is a character that I can imagine being quite difficult to work with. He does come across with compassion for his patients but is brutally honest when he says that most people do not like to work with him. This book has graphic descriptions of operations - You do get used to the gore though as the individual cases and their history shines through. Marsh may not be the ideal work colleague but he definitely cares for his patients.He is very truthful about when operations goes wrong - I'm not sure this is the read for anyone facing brain surgery.

I found myself getting bored with the detailed descriptions brain surgery and medical procedures. But I did think it was really well written and a very worthwhile read. I especially appreciated how the neurosurgery was described in a way that made it easy to understand and follow, even for people with no experience in the field (outside of McDreamy from Grey's Anatomy).I would highly recommend this to anyone with even a passing curiosity about brain surgery, but perhaps not the people like me who are just looking for an interesting memoir about someone's life."

But I liked reading about the procedures and glimpsing a little hospital behind-the-scenes action. 
130,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"There was a trailer that kept playing on TV during my childhood from the TV series ER. As a sort of subtitle on the trailer was written that a doctor is a true image of God on Earth. I was at a pretty impressionable age then and swallowed this completely thinking that a doctor is one of those divine entities who one has to view with reverence. It took a few years for that to be beaten out of me and to realize that human beings everywhere, no matter what they do are prone to make mistakes. Henry Marsh’s book is a series of anecdotes from his life as a renowned neurosurgeon, a life where he is not a superhero but a professional working on a job where one slip is the difference between life and death. He has done countless surgeries and saved a lot of lives from death (imminent and otherwise) but that does not stop him from musing that : A famous English surgeon once remarked that a surgeon has to have the nerves of steel, the heart of a lion and the hands of a woman. I have none of these and instead, at this point of an aneurysm operation, I have to struggle against an overwhelming wish to get the operation over and done with, and to leave the clip in place, even if it is not quite perfectly placed. The tone of the book follows these lines for Dr.Marsh does not write about anecdotes that herald him as a surgeon who never stumbles but he tells us how fragile the whole job is. The title of the book as I understand is derived from the Latin term Primum non nocere (first ,do no harm) which forms a fundamental principle for anyone practicing medicine. But doctors sometimes end up doing harm and it is to these that Marsh calls our attention to. There could be a multitude of reasons : incompetence, ignorance, bad luck or even hubris that have the surgeon ending up with a mistake. The mistake can be of such gravity that you leave the patient to a life more wretched than death. In Marsh’s words : Doctors need to be held accountable, since power corrupts. There must be complaints procedures and litigation, commissions of enquiry, punishment and compensation. At the same time if you do not hide or deny any mistakes when things go wrong, and if your patients and their families know that you are distressed by whatever happened, you might, if you are lucky, receive the precious gift of forgiveness.It is not a grim book filled with gloom and doom but one that speaks with brutal candor of what it means to hold someone’s life in your hands. Surgeons also have that unenviable job of breaking bad news to the relatives. A group of people with their eyes full of expectation await the surgeon in the consulting room and he/she has to walk up to them, sit them down and tell them that their loved one might not be coming back. How do you deal with the helplessness, the grief and the rage ? How do you even maintain a semblance of calm in the face of all these ? Think as I might, I can never find this strength in me. There is an instance that Marsh recounts of one of his patients suffering a fatal post-operative stroke that disabled the entire right side of the body. When he visits her at the bed, she in all her helplessness mumbles through the left side of her mouth in a slurred voice ‘I trusted you’, it is not easy to erase these words from memory. The words sometimes affect Dr. Marsh so much that he tells one of his juniors ’Terrible job, neurosurgery. Don’t do it !’. The relationship between patients and doctors can be that :Patients are both terrified and ignorant. How are they to know whether the surgeon is competent or not ? They will try to overcome their fear by investing the surgeon with superhuman abilities.…and many a time the superhuman fails. In one of the most touching scenes in the book, Dr. Marsh visits a nursing home run by Catholic nuns. The place specializes on taking care of people who have been rendered invalid or in a vegetative state following accidents or surgeries. The only way someone new to the place can identify one individual from the next is to read their names printed on boards outside the rooms. Walking the corridor, Dr. Marsh is horrified to realize that five of those names became inmates here only following his surgery on them ! Highly recommended. Humane, incisive and very pragmatic a view of neurosurgery and what it means to be a doctor.As an aside, I loved these lines by Dr. Marsh : Neuroscience tells us that it is highly improbable that we have souls, as everything we think and feel are no more or no less than the electrochemical chatter of our nerve cells. Our sense of self, our feelings and our thoughts, our love for others, our hopes and ambitions, our hates and fears all die when our brains die. "
131,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39882547-linda-hill,5,"A factual memoir about the life of an eminent brain surgeon, Henry Marsh.Do No Harm opens with a fairly graphic description of brain surgery and initially I had the feeling I was going to be too squeamish to read this memoir. However, Henry Marsh writes with such eloquence that I was drawn in within a couple of pages and found myself completely held in his thrall.What works so well in this book is the balance of factual and medical detail, explanation of procedures, hospital administration and insight into the personality of the author. Henry Marsh does not spare himself or the reader from his triumphs and disasters, his generosity and his embarrassments, so that there is a true sense of the man behind the surgical mask. I must admit I found some of the passages referring to the bureaucracy and inadequate systems our doctors and nurses have to work within made my blood boil.I thoroughly enjoyed meeting all the people Henry Marsh worked on and with, and have to admire the way in which he dealt with them. I’m not at all certain I could have behaved with many of them as equitably as did the author. I got a vivid sense of the people and personalities and felt that I had encountered their experiences with them because the writing is so skilful. Indeed, it is quite poetic at times. Although Henry Marsh sees himself as an ordinary man I have to disagree. He is a fantastic surgeon, a magnificent writer and a thoroughly compassionate and wonderful, if flawed, human being. It is those flaws and human frailties that make reading Do No Harm so mesmerising.I thought Do No Harm was written with honesty, humility, humour and, above all, a real feeling of humanity. It’s a fascinating and sometimes heartbreaking read that I recommend most highly. I could not tear myself away from its pages."
132,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12884422-steven-yenzer,3,"Marsh is a gifted writer and Do No Harm is a fascinating read. Unfortunately, his dislike of authority of any kind is so pervasive as to be distracting. He never misses a chance to lament some new regulation that is getting between him and his patients. Marsh has never met a rule he didn't like, and he doesn't seem to be able to imagine that anyone above him has any idea what they're doing."
133,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6949946-xilaii,5,"I was unsure about reading this. I tend towards paranoia when it comes to health and things you can do nothing about, and it's really not a good time for me to be reading about cancers and dying. I guess there won't ever be a good time. It was not an easy read and I was more detached than I usually am when I read most books. I imagine to the right person in the right frame of mind is a very emotionally draining book. That's not to say that I wasn't moved by it- I was, in pretty much every direction. It is as buoyant as it is heavy, it is as entertaining as it is saddening and it is as interesting as it is ordinary. There is no separation or remarkable difference, but I found the second half much more enjoyable than the first. I started out thinking he was a privileged asshole, but ended it humbled to know I could not have lived one day in his shoes. The arrogance is just a side effect of revealing so much, I think. The honesty is actually quite refreshing. It is not a glamorous list of successes and bragging, but nor is it a melancholy list of failures and regret. It is what it says it will be, stories. Stories about life, and death. Stories of brain surgery. And perhaps, most importantly I think, stories about the part of us that brain surgeons (or anyone, for that matter) know so little about - the millions of electric impulses that make us people. And as much as stories of life are themselves unique, I think this particular book was worth the read for it's perspective alone. It is one that an overwhelming majority of everyone who ever lived would never otherwise know, and I'm grateful Henry Marsh decided to share it."

135,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5847899-patrick,4,"[4.5]I've read a few reviews that have complained that this book is repetitive. But I think that is part of the point. It is a book about work - and about what it feels like to be doing that work day in and day out. And that's something that the multiple descriptions of brain surgery, which almost always seems to boil down to 'clipping' an aneurysm or removing a tumour, helps to get across. Marsh is good at getting across both the appeal of the work - the satisfaction that can come from doing something really challenging (I've heard him interviewed on the radio about remarking to a patient ""this look's like it'll be a fun tumour to remove"" and, adding, when the patient appeared disconcerted - ""Well, you don't want to be operated on by someone who hates their job do you?"" The book certainly gives you an idea of where the idea of the surgeon who comes to develop the god complex comes from. Knowing that the life or death of others depends on you, and having a whole team hanging on your word can probably have that effect on anyone.But there is a downside to the work, and he's good on that too. The fact that the consequences of failure - and of avoidable human error - is death, or quite possibly worse, years of severe disability. There is a very sad story of how a decision to let an inexperienced junior doctor lead on an operation to deal with a trapped nerve leaves a patient with permanent paralysis. And then there are the difficult conversations with family members and relatives who are begging him to perform operations which have little or no chance of prolonging the patient's life in any meaningful way, and he's honest enough to admit that on occasion, he bowed to that pressure, and almost always regretted doing so. In neurosurgery the delivery of bad news is commonplace enough and he muses on it at one point that ""you never really know if you've done a good job. Nobody has ever got in touch to say ""thank you for the way you told me I was going to die today""...There's humour here too - usually directed at the sometimes Kafka-esque bureaucracy that he rightly or wrongly sees as foisted on doctors by managers who understand little of the work that hospitals actually do. Logging on to a computer he uses to see x-rays causes particular frustration to him, and his secretary remarks ""try Mr Johnston's password. That usually works. Fuck Off 45. He hates computers.""""Why forty five?""""It's the forty fifth month since we signed on to the hospital's system and one has to change the password every month."""
136,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7949813-emma,4,"A warts and all memoir that plunges the reader head first into the fascinating and fragile world of a brain surgeon. Alongside vivid descriptions of human anatomy are the raw confessions of a man driven at times by his arrogance and at other times driven by his compassion, an aspect of humanity that Marsh openly battles with throughout his writing.It was harrowing to discover the difficulties faced by what I deemed to be an exact, yet deeply challenging, branch of medicine. Marsh's openness is a credit to his writing, and his admission that mistakes are easy to make, especially when driven by the desperate need to impress your intimidating peers, left me equally awestruck and terrified. His writing dallies between his own life, outside of medicine and, more frequently, into the brief encounters his has with his patients, those that he saves, those who have longer to spend with families and friends, those who he leaves in a vegetative state due to unavoidable catastrophe or his own over confidence and lastly, those that perish in spite of or as a result of his actions. It is a world I did not envy, one that, through Marsh's admission, ruined his first marriage and requires enough detachment and strength of mind that you can get through the stress of walking into an operating theatre and facing the chance you might fail.Marsh also explores the changes that have occurred during the length of his career, one that seems to irk him the most is the dwindling of respect for both his skills and the needs of his patients. There are some interesting questions raised here about the declining state of our National Health Service, questions posed by those that work within its bowels rather than the patients.Marsh's writing puts the reader straight into the heart of his operations, vivid descriptions completely submerge you inside the grey matter of his patients and his ability to recall the drama faced by himself and his team is tangible. It was refreshing to find a memoir on such a complex, academic subject so easy to read, Marsh truly knows how to reel in the reader, I was hooked until the very end.Overall, a fresh, exciting well written memoir that demands to be read, not only by those who have had friends or family who have endured the challenging, mysterious world of brain surgery, as patient or practitioner, but also by anyone curious and fearless enough to learn about a riveting, pressure driven career with rules that blur at the most tragic of times."
137,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4158121-sarah,5,"I needed to mix things up a bit. It was getting too heavy and dystopian with all the environmentalism and animal abuse and humans-are-rapidly-killing-everything-they-touch and whatnot. Not that I’m done with that kind of reality forever, but all those reminders of how moronic and doomed we are as a species can really weigh on a person, am I wrong? Anyway, this book wasn’t a targeted selection– it was simply one of the first things I saw in the Kindle Store that looked interesting. And interesting it was! A quick read, and quite the page turner if you ask me.Doctors have long been perceived as infallible heroes in many cultures, including our own (and that of the U.K. where Dr. Marsh works as a consulting neurosurgeon). Movies and television shows like Grey’s Anatomy and E.R. demonstrate our fascination with the ever-mysterious lives and works of the Gods of the O.R. I don’t think many would argue the possibility that we may have a slightly skewed perception of what actually goes on in hospitals and the lives of the folks who work in them. I know you’re thinking to yourself: “Wait, there ISN’T any spontaneous, choreographed song and dance?!” And I’m here as the bearer of bad news. There is no spontaneous, choreographed song and dance. I’m as shocked and appalled as you are. Turns out, doctors are actually human. Who knew! They have lives outside of their work; they have families and hobbies and quirks. They pay bills and face the frustrations of bureaucracy and systematic failure. They’re personally and familially susceptible to disease and death and they, just like their patients (the rest of us), sometimes make mistakes. *GASP* Luckily (or maybe not so much for those of us who prefer believing in the Doctors Can Do No Wrong theory), folks like Dr. Marsh are finding the graciousness and courage to tell it like it is. To share with us the real story of anatomy, emergencies, our twisted up healthcare system, the triumph of life and the inevitability of death. Marsh is confident and smart with an impressive talent for describing, simply and accessibly, his insanely complex work. But he is equally humble and openly shares his failures, mistakes, and frustrations. He’s genuine, and that makes him a pleasure to read. Even without the all the television style melodrama. So, long story short. Brains are cool, doctors are human, and one day we’re all going to die."
138,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/320372-lenny-husen,5,"I LOVED this and LOVED the narrator's voice. I listened to it in the car. The first disc contained the most suspenseful story I've heard/read in a long while--I was figuratively biting my nails in anxiety for how the surgery was going to turn out. I particularly love British English and every word was a delight. It was beautifully, elegantly, sensitively and warmly well-written.Neurosurgeon Henry Marsh has displaced Professor Robert Greenberg as the Number One Person whose hand I would love to shake, a list that also includes Atul Gawande, Paul Farmer, Abraham Verghese. Warning: this book isn't for someone who doesn't like the thought of blood (such as one of my brothers). Very graphic as far as surgery, terminal illness, death.What was harder to bear for me personally was the descriptions of Hospital Bed Control and the extremely irriting hospital administration's lack of respect and rules that served to impede work getting done--I could identify as I deal with this kind of thing daily as well and could commiserate. I laughed out loud at MAST (MANDATORY AND STATUTORY TRAINING) for Improved Customer Service that Mr. Marsh was forced to attend and had to leave to tell the anxious family of a patient that their loved one was going to die, and then to go back to the Training. Also I laughed and shouted in my car at the ""Best Password"" Marsh had to use to get into the Remote Radiology System in order to give the patient his prognosis about his brain tumour, where the difficulty getting into the system to review the film cost Mr. Marsh and the waiting patients 30 unnecessary minutes delay.Marsh describes cases that were tragic failures and those that were brilliant successes, both with grace, charm, humility. Who should listen to this book: Any doctor, anyone caring for a loved one or patient with a brain tumour, any one with an interest in Surgery or Medicine. Especially anyone interested in Neurosurgery, the Pinnacle of Medicine. Note: This is the third book I've read by a Neurosurgeon, and I no longer envy them, as I once did as a Pre-Med Student. It is not a life that my particular brain could lead with any success."
139,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22117564-douglas-lord,5,"There’s an old Far Side cartoon that shows a group of doctors obscuring a patient on an operating table. “Whoa!” says one. “That was a good one! Try it, Hobbs—just poke his brain right where my finger is.” Marsh (an actual brain surgeon for Britain’s National Health Service), aka Dr. Reality Check, here manfully acknowledges the unreal level of trust that patients put in their doctors and also recognizes medicine’s inherent fallacy: “[i]f the operation succeeds the surgeon is a hero, but if it fails he is a villain.” Anecdotes illustrate “attempts, and occasional failures, to find a balance between the necessary detachment and compassion that a surgical career requires, a balance between hope and realism.” It’s a fairly upsetting, sometimes brutal, book to read. For example, the brain “…has the consistency of jelly” and Marsh’s simultaneous “fear and excitement” when he lets his “instruments sink into the brain or spinal cord” is unnerving. He admits to speaking with “false optimism” to a man with a tumor in his pineal gland (that’s way deep inside the brain, Chumley) and laments the young woman who “…had had a tumour in her spinal cord, between the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae” who “awoke from the operation paralysed down the right side of her body. I had probably tried to take out too much of the tumour,” he admits. Another chapter is all about a lecture he gives, titled “All My Worst Mistakes,” that puts Michael Jordan’s failure speech to shame. VERDICT Imagine the unimaginable—Marsh reveals a real person behind the mystique, one who is trying as mightily as he can to heal but who is all too aware of his errors.Find this review and others at Books for Dudes, the online reader's advisory column for men from Library Journal here.

140,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6200323-david-ball,5,"Like Atul Gawande’s Being Mortal I fought this. I knew from the reviews that Do No Harm was something I should read, but the subject matter always put me off. After a long day of work, chasing kids, and being a responsible adult, it’s not always easy to sit down and read about death, or in this case brain surgery. And unsurprisingly the 'right-mood' window to attempt these types of books is both infrequent and fleeting. At least with Being Mortal I felt I was being forced to contemplate some of life’s most difficult questions, and if it wasn’t exactly enjoyable, at least it felt useful or productive, as it does whenever one finally faces up to doing something previously avoided. Do No Harm does not have the same redeeming features. First of all, it compels one to consider a pretty horrific subject, one that most people would normally try to great lengths to avoid. Then it makes matters worse by dwelling on the fallibility of the surgeon. If I was about to undergo a brain operation, I wouldn't want to know about my surgeon’s bad moods, mistakes, insecurities, tiredness or helplessness. But that's Henry Marsh. Excessively conscious and self-aware; honest to a fault, and superbly human - a gloriously Knausgardian figure. Full of complexities and contradictions, he's great company, and probably a great surgeon; although you come to realize from reading this book that greatness has its limitations when it comes to life and death matters. That's probably the most valuable lesson with both Do No Harm and Being Mortal - these books look you in the eye and tell you the truth. It may not be pretty, but it's realistic. And sometimes that's enough to warrant five stars. "
141,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145290-amy-qualls,3,"As someone who was married to someone who sustained a brain injury while I was married to him, I knew I would not have the easiest of relationships with this book. One of the supporting characters in this book -- asking questions, unsure whether to hope or fear -- could very easily have been me, if this book had been written at a different hospital.I've dealt with surgeons and other medical professionals with Marsh's mindset, and had an expectation of what his personality would be in this book. I was correct, and in that regard, this book was exactly what I expected. On the other hand, I was also a little bit disappointed; I think I was hoping for some level of additional insight by reading this book, and there was none for me. It's possible that my prior experience as the caregiver of a TBI survivor meant I'd already gained the insight Marsh hoped I'd receive as a reader of this book.I did find some comfort in one of the themes, though. From spending time watching families come and go in a neurological intensive care unit, I came away with the deep suspicion that many medical professionals perform overly heroic measures on brain injury patients in the name of prolonging life, without consideration to the quality of life they are prolonging. Dr. Marsh acknowledged this tendency and discussed it openly; his conclusions are quite similar to mine. Letting go is hard, unspeakably hard, but not every survival is a success story.The book's not for the faint of heart. If you're curious about the mindset of surgeons, or need closure after seeing a brain injury affect the life of someone you love, give it a try."
142,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie,5,"“Do no harm” is paraphrased in the Hippocratic Oath that medical students are all exposed to first thing. It’s the common principal in all medicine, but is especially stressed in neurosurgery, where the possibility for harm is so high. Henry Marsh has been a top neurosurgeon in Great Britain for many years and shares his stories of the trade here. Each chapter is named for and explores the treatment of a different neurological problem; meningioma, pituitary adenoma, infarct. Each chapter features a different patient; we see how the patient came to Marsh, how the operation went, and sometimes we see how they fared. Not always; sometimes they are whisked way back to the hospital that referred them, rather them leaving them under the care of the surgeon. So there are times that the author had no idea how they ultimately turned out. The descriptions of the problems and the way they are treated fascinated me, but beware if you are squeamish- the author describes things pretty vividly. But his book is not just about operations; it’s also about his own life, the about the NHS system in England. The system limits not just patient care but the hours doctors can work, which can make arranging long operations difficult. New doctors don’t have time enough to learn all they should. Marsh describes taking this out on nurses, anesthesiologists, clerks, and more- while an empathic, caring, man with patients, he seems to have been an ass to those he worked with at times- and admits it. I couldn’t put this book down. It was like reading a series of exciting stories, watching Marsh’s expertise and character grow. And I love a good medical description. "

Some would say it is too frank with its graphic description of mistakes and of suffering. Each chapter is centered around a specific medical condition of the brain or the spinal cord and has details on the surgery and the recovery all beautifully wrapped around the human story. The book is at times sad when he talks about personal connections with patients and their lives and deaths, at times funny especially when he describes the detailed turd descriptions as part of record keeping and about botched computerization of the records, and at times political when he shows his disdain for the NHS and the management of medicine by bureaucrats. You manage to get into the head of a very conscientious doctor as he makes life or death decisions. There is also the frank admission that a lot of what happens in these surgeries comes down to luck. I walked away with a renewed appreciation and understanding of the complexity (or the knowledge of how much I do not know) of the human brain, the decisions and the aftermath that these extremely skilled surgeons have to live with and the thought process that goes into their interactions. If you have wondered how a doctor can seem so detached for something that can be life or death for you, this book will help you get closer to that answer. "
144,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6053755-audrey,5,"This book amazed me in a couple of ways. First, that a book subtitled ""Stories of Life, Death, and Brain Surgery"" could manage to be not only enjoyable, but somewhat uplifting. Second, that someone who has had a career in a field that seems utterly daunting to me can also write. Marsh's stories tell us not only that he is a gifted and compassionate surgeon but also a talented writer. As I noted when I first tried to begin reading ""Do No Harm"" a few days after recovering from a migraine, this is NOT a book for hypochondriacs or anyone who tends to adopt the symptoms of whatever they are reading about. Marsh writes candidly about what afflicts his patients (and, in some cases, himself and his family members). You'll need to be able to tolerate that to enjoy the book.He organizes each story around a particular diagnosis or anomaly (for example, ""Meningioma"" or ""Tic Doloreux"") which also names the chapter. We learn about his early training, difficult cases, and something of his personal life, as well as about the challenges and evolution of the U.K.'s National Health System during the more than 40 years of Marsh's career. The book's episodic structure contributes greatly to its readability. What might otherwise have been a ho-hum, ""first this happened, then this happened"" narrative becomes a powerful meditation on our common humanity, human fallibility, and some truly mind-blowing (no pun intended) insights into the human mind and brain."
145,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6390523-marco,5,"Illness is something that happens only to patients. This is an important lesson you learn early on as a medical student. You are suddenly exposed to a terrifying new world of illness and death, and you learn how terrible illnesses often start with quite trivial symptoms - blood on the toothbrush can mean leukaemia, a small lump in the neck might mean cancer, a previously unnoticed mole might be a malignant melanoma. Most medical students go trough a brief period when they develop all matter of imaginary illnesses - I myself had leukaemia for at least four days - until they learn, as a matter of self-preservation, that illnesses happen to patients, not to doctors. This necessary detachment from patients becomes all the greater when you start working as a junior doctor and you have to do frightening and unpleasant things to patients. It starts with simple blood-taking and inserting drips, and progresses over time - if you train as a surgeon - to ever more radical procedures, cutting and slicing into people's bodies. It would be impossible to do the work if you felt the patients' fear and suffering yourself. Besides, the increasing responsability that comes as you climb the career ladder brings greater anxiety that you will make a mistake and that patients will suffer. Patients become objects of fear as well as of sympathy. It is much easier to feel compassion for other people if you are not responsible for what happens to them."
146,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9281513-cheryl,4,"A fascinating dive into the world of neurosurgery. This one won't be for everyone as it can be stark and even brutal (who knew that they do some brain surgeries while the patient is awake and sitting up?). That said, the author, who is one of the U.K.'s foremost neurosurgeons, takes the reader behind the scenes. We feel like we are in the operating room with him. We are witness to absolutely amazing successes, and we join him as he explains to a patient that there is no hope. The book was given to me by my sister who lives in the U.K., and there are plenty of digs at the British NHS. However, Marsh balances the digs with witness to how a national health care system can provide not just adequate, but many times,quite remarkable care to those who might not otherwise be able to avail themselves of it. For American readers, it will provide pros and cons of a national health care system of which we need to be aware, as the issue of universal health care is definitely on the horizon for us. If you are not the queasy type, I highly recommend this book. I do have to say that at one point, I had to drop it as it became too dark. That may have been just where I was then, in my life, (especially given that I am an estate attorney and live in death's back yard), or it may be that sometimes one needs to take a break with a glass of wine and some good fiction. Obviously I picked it up again and am glad that I did."

The medical stuff was great but I could do without moaning and whinging about managers and his (apparent) disrespect for work health and safety and any kind of bureaucracy. I get that it can be annoying but he also wouldn't be able to do his job without it. The apparent contempt with which he held the managers (non-medical) in the hospital was a bit mind-blowing. Again, not sure if it was in part a bad interpretation from the narrator - I heard Mr. Marsh interviewed on ABC's Conversations podcast and he sounded WAY nicer and far more personable. Perhaps some of it was written ironically? There was some of that ""doctors are superior and neurosurgeons are the most superior"" thing going on but he seemed both self-aware and self-deprecating about it (at least at times - from the text only - I couldn't tell that from the narrator's tone) that I decided to give that a pass.I didn't love the narration but as it was non-fiction I was mostly able to not let it get in the way. There were stupid pauses between tracks so the production wasn't the best (I borrowed the CDs from the library and imported them into iTunes - I suspect the download would be smoother but I'm not buying it to check).It was fascinating and also a little terrifying because: brain tumours are scary! Note to self: do not panic next time you get a headache. Argh."
148,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46238669-varun-padmanaban,5,"Marsh in this brilliant memoir of his life and surgical career expounds his errors and he does so in a manner where he explores how these errors has changed him, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. He speaks of his “small cemetery, where from time to time he goes to pray.” Importantly, he speaks with an aura of reckless honesty compared to the usually defensive surgeon’s emotions. Interestingly, he speaks of his daily anxiety – before surgery on the decision whether to operate or not, sometimes during the surgery he is – “oppressed by dread, almost a feeling of doom” and right before the surgery he is often seized by panic before entering flow – “fierce and happy concentration.” He speaks of the pain he feels for his patients whom are vegetative, curled up, alive yet unable to do anything. What he feels in speaking to their family and loved ones. He speaks of luck – even while he ids blamed for what goes wrong and praised for what goes right, and in the end he uses this luck to create his moral code: never lie to a patient, control how you feel by not letting your feelings add to a patients’ fear or unhappiness. In a fitting end, his last chapter, “Anesthesia dolorosa” speaks of a patient who can no longer feel pain in one of her facial nerves and he describes how this can sometimes be ironically painful. One is sometimes determined to feel as much as he can."
149,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6893402-counsel182,5,"This is an amazing book. I stumbled upon Dr. Marsh while reading a New York Times Magazine article about him by Karl Ove Knausgaad that was equally fascinating (December 2015). In fact, about the only criticism I would have about ""Do No Harm"" is the first person narrative is at times too personal and shocking in all its splendid candor that I fear Dr. Marsh (my latest ""hero"") is opening himself up far too much. He is quite human and in neurosurgeons that is refreshing and self deprecating when he admits that his own surgeries have gone horribly wrong with dire consequences. Reading such candor here in the United States where such revelations can only lead to a minefield of litigation is amazing. Dr. Marsh also does not sugarcoat the pitfalls of the English ""socialized"" medical two-tier system which also makes this book a bit of a primer on what MUST be done here in the states to reform the silly health care system we currently have and the insane attempts to derail affordable care for all.But, getting back to Dr. Marsh and this exceptional book--I also had the very good fortune years ago to stumble across Dr. Richard Seltzer's ""Mortal Lessons: Notes on the Art of Surgery"" which was equally refreshing and amazing. I would hope Dr. Marsh and Dr. Seltzer would have at one time crossed paths. These amazing men give hope to the art and science of medicine. "

Maybe working at an academic medical center has burnt me out on these types of voices. Not the best neuro book out there. Head Cases was better, just to name one. "

152,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10638379-mitchell-keo,3,"Was not very moved upon finishing this book. Dr. Marsh has a very...detached way about writing about things, even if they are emotional moments. Which I suppose makes sense if you need that kind of detachment as a neurosurgeon? Yet there was an air of self importance in his writing that I could not settle into. Understandably, neurosurgery is a profession that demands great respect. Yet throughout this book I couldn’t help but feel entitlement from Dr. Marsh when he expresses his frustrations with hospital staff.I suppose my idea if medical memoirs are based upon first impressions from books I’ve read previous to this one. I often feel thoughtful, inspired, and introspective upon reading about the insight given by a medical professional and their duty to society as healthcare provider and lifeline against death. Yet...this book made me feel sad. Jaded. Tired. And a large part of that was reflected off of the author’s way of recollection. Which makes sense, since neurosurgery is a very emotionally demanding field. But it was not something within this book that I could feel myself moved by."
153,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15788793-ed,5,"What an absolutely stunning book. I've been recommending this to anyone who will listen since about 10 pages in. Gripping, emotional, funny, gentle, deeply sad, philosophical and hopeful. Marsh manages to detach himself from his own professional detachment to describe what it's like to operate on life-or-death brain surgery cases every day for 35 years. He combines care for patients, an ingrained understanding of the role of probability and luck in complex surgery and a continued fascination with the technical skill of his craft into his uncomplicated but moving prose.Broadly, Marsh writes about people and cases, providing enough technical exposition to leave the reader feeling informed and with an appreciation of the difficulty of the operations without needing to demonstrate his own (clearly substantial) intelligence. It's a look behind the scenes of life in a modern hospital, too, punctuated with frustration at NHS reforms and bureaucracy.I could write about this for hours, but suffice to say that this is a triumph by a master in his field. I recommend it unreservedly."
154,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739605-helen-costello,5,Absolutely fascinating and perfect for fans of medical literature. Henry Marsh is a character that I can imagine being quite difficult to work with. He does come across with compassion for his patients but is brutally honest when he says that most people do not like to work with him. This book has graphic descriptions of operations - You do get used to the gore though as the individual cases and their history shines through. Marsh may not be the ideal work colleague but he definitely cares for his patients.He is very truthful about when operations goes wrong - I'm not sure this is the read for anyone facing brain surgery.

I found myself getting bored with the detailed descriptions brain surgery and medical procedures. But I did think it was really well written and a very worthwhile read. I especially appreciated how the neurosurgery was described in a way that made it easy to understand and follow, even for people with no experience in the field (outside of McDreamy from Grey's Anatomy).I would highly recommend this to anyone with even a passing curiosity about brain surgery, but perhaps not the people like me who are just looking for an interesting memoir about someone's life."

159,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23953835-debbie,3,I have great admiration for anyone who has the aptitude and has acquired the skill to be a neurosurgeon in the first place—something I could never do—but something about the author’s tone didn’t hit me quite right to feel fully engaged when he was relating his patients’ stories. But I liked reading about the procedures and glimpsing a little hospital behind-the-scenes action. 
160,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"There was a trailer that kept playing on TV during my childhood from the TV series ER. As a sort of subtitle on the trailer was written that a doctor is a true image of God on Earth. I was at a pretty impressionable age then and swallowed this completely thinking that a doctor is one of those divine entities who one has to view with reverence. It took a few years for that to be beaten out of me and to realize that human beings everywhere, no matter what they do are prone to make mistakes. Henry Marsh’s book is a series of anecdotes from his life as a renowned neurosurgeon, a life where he is not a superhero but a professional working on a job where one slip is the difference between life and death. He has done countless surgeries and saved a lot of lives from death (imminent and otherwise) but that does not stop him from musing that : A famous English surgeon once remarked that a surgeon has to have the nerves of steel, the heart of a lion and the hands of a woman. I have none of these and instead, at this point of an aneurysm operation, I have to struggle against an overwhelming wish to get the operation over and done with, and to leave the clip in place, even if it is not quite perfectly placed. The tone of the book follows these lines for Dr.Marsh does not write about anecdotes that herald him as a surgeon who never stumbles but he tells us how fragile the whole job is. The title of the book as I understand is derived from the Latin term Primum non nocere (first ,do no harm) which forms a fundamental principle for anyone practicing medicine. But doctors sometimes end up doing harm and it is to these that Marsh calls our attention to. There could be a multitude of reasons : incompetence, ignorance, bad luck or even hubris that have the surgeon ending up with a mistake. The mistake can be of such gravity that you leave the patient to a life more wretched than death. In Marsh’s words : Doctors need to be held accountable, since power corrupts. There must be complaints procedures and litigation, commissions of enquiry, punishment and compensation. At the same time if you do not hide or deny any mistakes when things go wrong, and if your patients and their families know that you are distressed by whatever happened, you might, if you are lucky, receive the precious gift of forgiveness.It is not a grim book filled with gloom and doom but one that speaks with brutal candor of what it means to hold someone’s life in your hands. Surgeons also have that unenviable job of breaking bad news to the relatives. A group of people with their eyes full of expectation await the surgeon in the consulting room and he/she has to walk up to them, sit them down and tell them that their loved one might not be coming back. How do you deal with the helplessness, the grief and the rage ? How do you even maintain a semblance of calm in the face of all these ? Think as I might, I can never find this strength in me. There is an instance that Marsh recounts of one of his patients suffering a fatal post-operative stroke that disabled the entire right side of the body. When he visits her at the bed, she in all her helplessness mumbles through the left side of her mouth in a slurred voice ‘I trusted you’, it is not easy to erase these words from memory. The words sometimes affect Dr. Marsh so much that he tells one of his juniors ’Terrible job, neurosurgery. Don’t do it !’. The relationship between patients and doctors can be that :Patients are both terrified and ignorant. How are they to know whether the surgeon is competent or not ? They will try to overcome their fear by investing the surgeon with superhuman abilities.…and many a time the superhuman fails. In one of the most touching scenes in the book, Dr. Marsh visits a nursing home run by Catholic nuns. The place specializes on taking care of people who have been rendered invalid or in a vegetative state following accidents or surgeries. The only way someone new to the place can identify one individual from the next is to read their names printed on boards outside the rooms. Walking the corridor, Dr. Marsh is horrified to realize that five of those names became inmates here only following his surgery on them ! Highly recommended. Humane, incisive and very pragmatic a view of neurosurgery and what it means to be a doctor.As an aside, I loved these lines by Dr. Marsh : Neuroscience tells us that it is highly improbable that we have souls, as everything we think and feel are no more or no less than the electrochemical chatter of our nerve cells. Our sense of self, our feelings and our thoughts, our love for others, our hopes and ambitions, our hates and fears all die when our brains die. "
161,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39882547-linda-hill,5,"A factual memoir about the life of an eminent brain surgeon, Henry Marsh.Do No Harm opens with a fairly graphic description of brain surgery and initially I had the feeling I was going to be too squeamish to read this memoir. However, Henry Marsh writes with such eloquence that I was drawn in within a couple of pages and found myself completely held in his thrall.What works so well in this book is the balance of factual and medical detail, explanation of procedures, hospital administration and insight into the personality of the author. Henry Marsh does not spare himself or the reader from his triumphs and disasters, his generosity and his embarrassments, so that there is a true sense of the man behind the surgical mask. I must admit I found some of the passages referring to the bureaucracy and inadequate systems our doctors and nurses have to work within made my blood boil.I thoroughly enjoyed meeting all the people Henry Marsh worked on and with, and have to admire the way in which he dealt with them. I’m not at all certain I could have behaved with many of them as equitably as did the author. I got a vivid sense of the people and personalities and felt that I had encountered their experiences with them because the writing is so skilful. Indeed, it is quite poetic at times. Although Henry Marsh sees himself as an ordinary man I have to disagree. He is a fantastic surgeon, a magnificent writer and a thoroughly compassionate and wonderful, if flawed, human being. It is those flaws and human frailties that make reading Do No Harm so mesmerising.I thought Do No Harm was written with honesty, humility, humour and, above all, a real feeling of humanity. It’s a fascinating and sometimes heartbreaking read that I recommend most highly. I could not tear myself away from its pages."
162,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12884422-steven-yenzer,3,"Marsh is a gifted writer and Do No Harm is a fascinating read. Unfortunately, his dislike of authority of any kind is so pervasive as to be distracting. He never misses a chance to lament some new regulation that is getting between him and his patients. Marsh has never met a rule he didn't like, and he doesn't seem to be able to imagine that anyone above him has any idea what they're doing."
163,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6949946-xilaii,5,"I was unsure about reading this. I tend towards paranoia when it comes to health and things you can do nothing about, and it's really not a good time for me to be reading about cancers and dying. I guess there won't ever be a good time. It was not an easy read and I was more detached than I usually am when I read most books. I imagine to the right person in the right frame of mind is a very emotionally draining book. That's not to say that I wasn't moved by it- I was, in pretty much every direction. It is as buoyant as it is heavy, it is as entertaining as it is saddening and it is as interesting as it is ordinary. There is no separation or remarkable difference, but I found the second half much more enjoyable than the first. I started out thinking he was a privileged asshole, but ended it humbled to know I could not have lived one day in his shoes. The arrogance is just a side effect of revealing so much, I think. The honesty is actually quite refreshing. It is not a glamorous list of successes and bragging, but nor is it a melancholy list of failures and regret. It is what it says it will be, stories. Stories about life, and death. Stories of brain surgery. And perhaps, most importantly I think, stories about the part of us that brain surgeons (or anyone, for that matter) know so little about - the millions of electric impulses that make us people. And as much as stories of life are themselves unique, I think this particular book was worth the read for it's perspective alone. It is one that an overwhelming majority of everyone who ever lived would never otherwise know, and I'm grateful Henry Marsh decided to share it."

165,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5847899-patrick,4,"[4.5]I've read a few reviews that have complained that this book is repetitive. But I think that is part of the point. It is a book about work - and about what it feels like to be doing that work day in and day out. And that's something that the multiple descriptions of brain surgery, which almost always seems to boil down to 'clipping' an aneurysm or removing a tumour, helps to get across. Marsh is good at getting across both the appeal of the work - the satisfaction that can come from doing something really challenging (I've heard him interviewed on the radio about remarking to a patient ""this look's like it'll be a fun tumour to remove"" and, adding, when the patient appeared disconcerted - ""Well, you don't want to be operated on by someone who hates their job do you?"" The book certainly gives you an idea of where the idea of the surgeon who comes to develop the god complex comes from. Knowing that the life or death of others depends on you, and having a whole team hanging on your word can probably have that effect on anyone.But there is a downside to the work, and he's good on that too. The fact that the consequences of failure - and of avoidable human error - is death, or quite possibly worse, years of severe disability. There is a very sad story of how a decision to let an inexperienced junior doctor lead on an operation to deal with a trapped nerve leaves a patient with permanent paralysis. And then there are the difficult conversations with family members and relatives who are begging him to perform operations which have little or no chance of prolonging the patient's life in any meaningful way, and he's honest enough to admit that on occasion, he bowed to that pressure, and almost always regretted doing so. In neurosurgery the delivery of bad news is commonplace enough and he muses on it at one point that ""you never really know if you've done a good job. Nobody has ever got in touch to say ""thank you for the way you told me I was going to die today""...There's humour here too - usually directed at the sometimes Kafka-esque bureaucracy that he rightly or wrongly sees as foisted on doctors by managers who understand little of the work that hospitals actually do. Logging on to a computer he uses to see x-rays causes particular frustration to him, and his secretary remarks ""try Mr Johnston's password. That usually works. Fuck Off 45. He hates computers.""""Why forty five?""""It's the forty fifth month since we signed on to the hospital's system and one has to change the password every month."""
166,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7949813-emma,4,"A warts and all memoir that plunges the reader head first into the fascinating and fragile world of a brain surgeon. Alongside vivid descriptions of human anatomy are the raw confessions of a man driven at times by his arrogance and at other times driven by his compassion, an aspect of humanity that Marsh openly battles with throughout his writing.It was harrowing to discover the difficulties faced by what I deemed to be an exact, yet deeply challenging, branch of medicine. Marsh's openness is a credit to his writing, and his admission that mistakes are easy to make, especially when driven by the desperate need to impress your intimidating peers, left me equally awestruck and terrified. His writing dallies between his own life, outside of medicine and, more frequently, into the brief encounters his has with his patients, those that he saves, those who have longer to spend with families and friends, those who he leaves in a vegetative state due to unavoidable catastrophe or his own over confidence and lastly, those that perish in spite of or as a result of his actions. It is a world I did not envy, one that, through Marsh's admission, ruined his first marriage and requires enough detachment and strength of mind that you can get through the stress of walking into an operating theatre and facing the chance you might fail.Marsh also explores the changes that have occurred during the length of his career, one that seems to irk him the most is the dwindling of respect for both his skills and the needs of his patients. There are some interesting questions raised here about the declining state of our National Health Service, questions posed by those that work within its bowels rather than the patients.Marsh's writing puts the reader straight into the heart of his operations, vivid descriptions completely submerge you inside the grey matter of his patients and his ability to recall the drama faced by himself and his team is tangible. It was refreshing to find a memoir on such a complex, academic subject so easy to read, Marsh truly knows how to reel in the reader, I was hooked until the very end.Overall, a fresh, exciting well written memoir that demands to be read, not only by those who have had friends or family who have endured the challenging, mysterious world of brain surgery, as patient or practitioner, but also by anyone curious and fearless enough to learn about a riveting, pressure driven career with rules that blur at the most tragic of times."
167,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4158121-sarah,5,"I needed to mix things up a bit. It was getting too heavy and dystopian with all the environmentalism and animal abuse and humans-are-rapidly-killing-everything-they-touch and whatnot. Not that I’m done with that kind of reality forever, but all those reminders of how moronic and doomed we are as a species can really weigh on a person, am I wrong? Anyway, this book wasn’t a targeted selection– it was simply one of the first things I saw in the Kindle Store that looked interesting. And interesting it was! A quick read, and quite the page turner if you ask me.Doctors have long been perceived as infallible heroes in many cultures, including our own (and that of the U.K. where Dr. Marsh works as a consulting neurosurgeon). Movies and television shows like Grey’s Anatomy and E.R. demonstrate our fascination with the ever-mysterious lives and works of the Gods of the O.R. I don’t think many would argue the possibility that we may have a slightly skewed perception of what actually goes on in hospitals and the lives of the folks who work in them. I know you’re thinking to yourself: “Wait, there ISN’T any spontaneous, choreographed song and dance?!” And I’m here as the bearer of bad news. There is no spontaneous, choreographed song and dance. I’m as shocked and appalled as you are. Turns out, doctors are actually human. Who knew! They have lives outside of their work; they have families and hobbies and quirks. They pay bills and face the frustrations of bureaucracy and systematic failure. They’re personally and familially susceptible to disease and death and they, just like their patients (the rest of us), sometimes make mistakes. *GASP* Luckily (or maybe not so much for those of us who prefer believing in the Doctors Can Do No Wrong theory), folks like Dr. Marsh are finding the graciousness and courage to tell it like it is. To share with us the real story of anatomy, emergencies, our twisted up healthcare system, the triumph of life and the inevitability of death. Marsh is confident and smart with an impressive talent for describing, simply and accessibly, his insanely complex work. But he is equally humble and openly shares his failures, mistakes, and frustrations. He’s genuine, and that makes him a pleasure to read. Even without the all the television style melodrama. So, long story short. Brains are cool, doctors are human, and one day we’re all going to die."
168,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/320372-lenny-husen,5,"I LOVED this and LOVED the narrator's voice. I listened to it in the car. The first disc contained the most suspenseful story I've heard/read in a long while--I was figuratively biting my nails in anxiety for how the surgery was going to turn out. I particularly love British English and every word was a delight. It was beautifully, elegantly, sensitively and warmly well-written.Neurosurgeon Henry Marsh has displaced Professor Robert Greenberg as the Number One Person whose hand I would love to shake, a list that also includes Atul Gawande, Paul Farmer, Abraham Verghese. Warning: this book isn't for someone who doesn't like the thought of blood (such as one of my brothers). Very graphic as far as surgery, terminal illness, death.What was harder to bear for me personally was the descriptions of Hospital Bed Control and the extremely irriting hospital administration's lack of respect and rules that served to impede work getting done--I could identify as I deal with this kind of thing daily as well and could commiserate. I laughed out loud at MAST (MANDATORY AND STATUTORY TRAINING) for Improved Customer Service that Mr. Marsh was forced to attend and had to leave to tell the anxious family of a patient that their loved one was going to die, and then to go back to the Training. Also I laughed and shouted in my car at the ""Best Password"" Marsh had to use to get into the Remote Radiology System in order to give the patient his prognosis about his brain tumour, where the difficulty getting into the system to review the film cost Mr. Marsh and the waiting patients 30 unnecessary minutes delay.Marsh describes cases that were tragic failures and those that were brilliant successes, both with grace, charm, humility. Who should listen to this book: Any doctor, anyone caring for a loved one or patient with a brain tumour, any one with an interest in Surgery or Medicine. Especially anyone interested in Neurosurgery, the Pinnacle of Medicine. Note: This is the third book I've read by a Neurosurgeon, and I no longer envy them, as I once did as a Pre-Med Student.

Try it, Hobbs—just poke his brain right where my finger is.” Marsh (an actual brain surgeon for Britain’s National Health Service), aka Dr. Reality Check, here manfully acknowledges the unreal level of trust that patients put in their doctors and also recognizes medicine’s inherent fallacy: “[i]f the operation succeeds the surgeon is a hero, but if it fails he is a villain.” Anecdotes illustrate “attempts, and occasional failures, to find a balance between the necessary detachment and compassion that a surgical career requires, a balance between hope and realism.” It’s a fairly upsetting, sometimes brutal, book to read. For example, the brain “…has the consistency of jelly” and Marsh’s simultaneous “fear and excitement” when he lets his “instruments sink into the brain or spinal cord” is unnerving. He admits to speaking with “false optimism” to a man with a tumor in his pineal gland (that’s way deep inside the brain, Chumley) and laments the young woman who “…had had a tumour in her spinal cord, between the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae” who “awoke from the operation paralysed down the right side of her body. I had probably tried to take out too much of the tumour,” he admits. Another chapter is all about a lecture he gives, titled “All My Worst Mistakes,” that puts Michael Jordan’s failure speech to shame. VERDICT Imagine the unimaginable—Marsh reveals a real person behind the mystique, one who is trying as mightily as he can to heal but who is all too aware of his errors.Find this review and others at Books for Dudes, the online reader's advisory column for men from Library Journal here.

I knew from the reviews that Do No Harm was something I should read, but the subject matter always put me off. After a long day of work, chasing kids, and being a responsible adult, it’s not always easy to sit down and read about death, or in this case brain surgery. And unsurprisingly the 'right-mood' window to attempt these types of books is both infrequent and fleeting. At least with Being Mortal I felt I was being forced to contemplate some of life’s most difficult questions, and if it wasn’t exactly enjoyable, at least it felt useful or productive, as it does whenever one finally faces up to doing something previously avoided. Do No Harm does not have the same redeeming features. First of all, it compels one to consider a pretty horrific subject, one that most people would normally try to great lengths to avoid. Then it makes matters worse by dwelling on the fallibility of the surgeon. If I was about to undergo a brain operation, I wouldn't want to know about my surgeon’s bad moods, mistakes, insecurities, tiredness or helplessness. But that's Henry Marsh. Excessively conscious and self-aware; honest to a fault, and superbly human - a gloriously Knausgardian figure. Full of complexities and contradictions, he's great company, and probably a great surgeon; although you come to realize from reading this book that greatness has its limitations when it comes to life and death matters. That's probably the most valuable lesson with both Do No Harm and Being Mortal - these books look you in the eye and tell you the truth. It may not be pretty, but it's realistic. And sometimes that's enough to warrant five stars. "

One of the supporting characters in this book -- asking questions, unsure whether to hope or fear -- could very easily have been me, if this book had been written at a different hospital.I've dealt with surgeons and other medical professionals with Marsh's mindset, and had an expectation of what his personality would be in this book. I was correct, and in that regard, this book was exactly what I expected. On the other hand, I was also a little bit disappointed; I think I was hoping for some level of additional insight by reading this book, and there was none for me. It's possible that my prior experience as the caregiver of a TBI survivor meant I'd already gained the insight Marsh hoped I'd receive as a reader of this book.I did find some comfort in one of the themes, though. From spending time watching families come and go in a neurological intensive care unit, I came away with the deep suspicion that many medical professionals perform overly heroic measures on brain injury patients in the name of prolonging life, without consideration to the quality of life they are prolonging. Dr. Marsh acknowledged this tendency and discussed it openly; his conclusions are quite similar to mine. Letting go is hard, unspeakably hard, but not every survival is a success story.The book's not for the faint of heart. If you're curious about the mindset of surgeons, or need closure after seeing a brain injury affect the life of someone you love, give it a try."
172,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie,5,"“Do no harm” is paraphrased in the Hippocratic Oath that medical students are all exposed to first thing. It’s the common principal in all medicine, but is especially stressed in neurosurgery, where the possibility for harm is so high. Henry Marsh has been a top neurosurgeon in Great Britain for many years and shares his stories of the trade here. Each chapter is named for and explores the treatment of a different neurological problem; meningioma, pituitary adenoma, infarct. Each chapter features a different patient; we see how the patient came to Marsh, how the operation went, and sometimes we see how they fared. Not always; sometimes they are whisked way back to the hospital that referred them, rather them leaving them under the care of the surgeon. So there are times that the author had no idea how they ultimately turned out. The descriptions of the problems and the way they are treated fascinated me, but beware if you are squeamish- the author describes things pretty vividly. But his book is not just about operations; it’s also about his own life, the about the NHS system in England. The system limits not just patient care but the hours doctors can work, which can make arranging long operations difficult. New doctors don’t have time enough to learn all they should. Marsh describes taking this out on nurses, anesthesiologists, clerks, and more- while an empathic, caring, man with patients, he seems to have been an ass to those he worked with at times- and admits it. I couldn’t put this book down. It was like reading a series of exciting stories, watching Marsh’s expertise and character grow. And I love a good medical description. "

Some would say it is too frank with its graphic description of mistakes and of suffering. Each chapter is centered around a specific medical condition of the brain or the spinal cord and has details on the surgery and the recovery all beautifully wrapped around the human story. The book is at times sad when he talks about personal connections with patients and their lives and deaths, at times funny especially when he describes the detailed turd descriptions as part of record keeping and about botched computerization of the records, and at times political when he shows his disdain for the NHS and the management of medicine by bureaucrats. You manage to get into the head of a very conscientious doctor as he makes life or death decisions. There is also the frank admission that a lot of what happens in these surgeries comes down to luck. I walked away with a renewed appreciation and understanding of the complexity (or the knowledge of how much I do not know) of the human brain, the decisions and the aftermath that these extremely skilled surgeons have to live with and the thought process that goes into their interactions. If you have wondered how a doctor can seem so detached for something that can be life or death for you, this book will help you get closer to that answer. "
174,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6053755-audrey,5,"This book amazed me in a couple of ways. First, that a book subtitled ""Stories of Life, Death, and Brain Surgery"" could manage to be not only enjoyable, but somewhat uplifting. Second, that someone who has had a career in a field that seems utterly daunting to me can also write. Marsh's stories tell us not only that he is a gifted and compassionate surgeon but also a talented writer. As I noted when I first tried to begin reading ""Do No Harm"" a few days after recovering from a migraine, this is NOT a book for hypochondriacs or anyone who tends to adopt the symptoms of whatever they are reading about. Marsh writes candidly about what afflicts his patients (and, in some cases, himself and his family members). You'll need to be able to tolerate that to enjoy the book.He organizes each story around a particular diagnosis or anomaly (for example, ""Meningioma"" or ""Tic Doloreux"") which also names the chapter. We learn about his early training, difficult cases, and something of his personal life, as well as about the challenges and evolution of the U.K.'s National Health System during the more than 40 years of Marsh's career. The book's episodic structure contributes greatly to its readability. What might otherwise have been a ho-hum, ""first this happened, then this happened"" narrative becomes a powerful meditation on our common humanity, human fallibility, and some truly mind-blowing (no pun intended) insights into the human mind and brain."
175,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6390523-marco,5,"Illness is something that happens only to patients. This is an important lesson you learn early on as a medical student. You are suddenly exposed to a terrifying new world of illness and death, and you learn how terrible illnesses often start with quite trivial symptoms - blood on the toothbrush can mean leukaemia, a small lump in the neck might mean cancer, a previously unnoticed mole might be a malignant melanoma. Most medical students go trough a brief period when they develop all matter of imaginary illnesses - I myself had leukaemia for at least four days - until they learn, as a matter of self-preservation, that illnesses happen to patients, not to doctors. This necessary detachment from patients becomes all the greater when you start working as a junior doctor and you have to do frightening and unpleasant things to patients. It starts with simple blood-taking and inserting drips, and progresses over time - if you train as a surgeon - to ever more radical procedures, cutting and slicing into people's bodies. It would be impossible to do the work if you felt the patients' fear and suffering yourself. Besides, the increasing responsability that comes as you climb the career ladder brings greater anxiety that you will make a mistake and that patients will suffer. Patients become objects of fear as well as of sympathy. It is much easier to feel compassion for other people if you are not responsible for what happens to them."
176,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9281513-cheryl,4,"A fascinating dive into the world of neurosurgery. This one won't be for everyone as it can be stark and even brutal (who knew that they do some brain surgeries while the patient is awake and sitting up?). That said, the author, who is one of the U.K.'s foremost neurosurgeons, takes the reader behind the scenes. We feel like we are in the operating room with him. We are witness to absolutely amazing successes, and we join him as he explains to a patient that there is no hope. The book was given to me by my sister who lives in the U.K., and there are plenty of digs at the British NHS. However, Marsh balances the digs with witness to how a national health care system can provide not just adequate, but many times,quite remarkable care to those who might not otherwise be able to avail themselves of it. For American readers, it will provide pros and cons of a national health care system of which we need to be aware, as the issue of universal health care is definitely on the horizon for us. If you are not the queasy type, I highly recommend this book. I do have to say that at one point, I had to drop it as it became too dark. That may have been just where I was then, in my life, (especially given that I am an estate attorney and live in death's back yard), or it may be that sometimes one needs to take a break with a glass of wine and some good fiction. Obviously I picked it up again and am glad that I did."

The medical stuff was great but I could do without moaning and whinging about managers and his (apparent) disrespect for work health and safety and any kind of bureaucracy. I get that it can be annoying but he also wouldn't be able to do his job without it. The apparent contempt with which he held the managers (non-medical) in the hospital was a bit mind-blowing. Again, not sure if it was in part a bad interpretation from the narrator - I heard Mr. Marsh interviewed on ABC's Conversations podcast and he sounded WAY nicer and far more personable. Perhaps some of it was written ironically? There was some of that ""doctors are superior and neurosurgeons are the most superior"" thing going on but he seemed both self-aware and self-deprecating about it (at least at times - from the text only - I couldn't tell that from the narrator's tone) that I decided to give that a pass.I didn't love the narration but as it was non-fiction I was mostly able to not let it get in the way. There were stupid pauses between tracks so the production wasn't the best (I borrowed the CDs from the library and imported them into iTunes - I suspect the download would be smoother but I'm not buying it to check).It was fascinating and also a little terrifying because: brain tumours are scary! Note to self: do not panic next time you get a headache. Argh."
178,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46238669-varun-padmanaban,5,"Marsh in this brilliant memoir of his life and surgical career expounds his errors and he does so in a manner where he explores how these errors has changed him, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. He speaks of his “small cemetery, where from time to time he goes to pray.” Importantly, he speaks with an aura of reckless honesty compared to the usually defensive surgeon’s emotions. Interestingly, he speaks of his daily anxiety – before surgery on the decision whether to operate or not, sometimes during the surgery he is – “oppressed by dread, almost a feeling of doom” and right before the surgery he is often seized by panic before entering flow – “fierce and happy concentration.” He speaks of the pain he feels for his patients whom are vegetative, curled up, alive yet unable to do anything. What he feels in speaking to their family and loved ones. He speaks of luck – even while he ids blamed for what goes wrong and praised for what goes right, and in the end he uses this luck to create his moral code: never lie to a patient, control how you feel by not letting your feelings add to a patients’ fear or unhappiness. In a fitting end, his last chapter, “Anesthesia dolorosa” speaks of a patient who can no longer feel pain in one of her facial nerves and he describes how this can sometimes be ironically painful. One is sometimes determined to feel as much as he can."
179,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6893402-counsel182,5,"This is an amazing book. I stumbled upon Dr. Marsh while reading a New York Times Magazine article about him by Karl Ove Knausgaad that was equally fascinating (December 2015). In fact, about the only criticism I would have about ""Do No Harm"" is the first person narrative is at times too personal and shocking in all its splendid candor that I fear Dr. Marsh (my latest ""hero"") is opening himself up far too much. He is quite human and in neurosurgeons that is refreshing and self deprecating when he admits that his own surgeries have gone horribly wrong with dire consequences. Reading such candor here in the United States where such revelations can only lead to a minefield of litigation is amazing. Dr. Marsh also does not sugarcoat the pitfalls of the English ""socialized"" medical two-tier system which also makes this book a bit of a primer on what MUST be done here in the states to reform the silly health care system we currently have and the insane attempts to derail affordable care for all.But, getting back to Dr. Marsh and this exceptional book--I also had the very good fortune years ago to stumble across Dr. Richard Seltzer's ""Mortal Lessons: Notes on the Art of Surgery"" which was equally refreshing and amazing. I would hope Dr. Marsh and Dr. Seltzer would have at one time crossed paths. These amazing men give hope to the art and science of medicine. "

182,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10638379-mitchell-keo,3,"Was not very moved upon finishing this book. Dr. Marsh has a very...detached way about writing about things, even if they are emotional moments. Which I suppose makes sense if you need that kind of detachment as a neurosurgeon? Yet there was an air of self importance in his writing that I could not settle into. Understandably, neurosurgery is a profession that demands great respect. Yet throughout this book I couldn’t help but feel entitlement from Dr. Marsh when he expresses his frustrations with hospital staff.I suppose my idea if medical memoirs are based upon first impressions from books I’ve read previous to this one. I often feel thoughtful, inspired, and introspective upon reading about the insight given by a medical professional and their duty to society as healthcare provider and lifeline against death. Yet...this book made me feel sad. Jaded. Tired. And a large part of that was reflected off of the author’s way of recollection. Which makes sense, since neurosurgery is a very emotionally demanding field. But it was not something within this book that I could feel myself moved by."
183,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15788793-ed,5,"What an absolutely stunning book. I've been recommending this to anyone who will listen since about 10 pages in. Gripping, emotional, funny, gentle, deeply sad, philosophical and hopeful. Marsh manages to detach himself from his own professional detachment to describe what it's like to operate on life-or-death brain surgery cases every day for 35 years. He combines care for patients, an ingrained understanding of the role of probability and luck in complex surgery and a continued fascination with the technical skill of his craft into his uncomplicated but moving prose.Broadly, Marsh writes about people and cases, providing enough technical exposition to leave the reader feeling informed and with an appreciation of the difficulty of the operations without needing to demonstrate his own (clearly substantial) intelligence. It's a look behind the scenes of life in a modern hospital, too, punctuated with frustration at NHS reforms and bureaucracy.I could write about this for hours, but suffice to say that this is a triumph by a master in his field. I recommend it unreservedly."
184,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739605-helen-costello,5,Absolutely fascinating and perfect for fans of medical literature. Henry Marsh is a character that I can imagine being quite difficult to work with. He does come across with compassion for his patients but is brutally honest when he says that most people do not like to work with him. This book has graphic descriptions of operations - You do get used to the gore though as the individual cases and their history shines through. Marsh may not be the ideal work colleague but he definitely cares for his patients.He is very truthful about when operations goes wrong - I'm not sure this is the read for anyone facing brain surgery.

I found myself getting bored with the detailed descriptions brain surgery and medical procedures. But I did think it was really well written and a very worthwhile read. I especially appreciated how the neurosurgery was described in a way that made it easy to understand and follow, even for people with no experience in the field (outside of McDreamy from Grey's Anatomy).I would highly recommend this to anyone with even a passing curiosity about brain surgery, but perhaps not the people like me who are just looking for an interesting memoir about someone's life."

But I liked reading about the procedures and glimpsing a little hospital behind-the-scenes action. 
190,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"There was a trailer that kept playing on TV during my childhood from the TV series ER. As a sort of subtitle on the trailer was written that a doctor is a true image of God on Earth. I was at a pretty impressionable age then and swallowed this completely thinking that a doctor is one of those divine entities who one has to view with reverence. It took a few years for that to be beaten out of me and to realize that human beings everywhere, no matter what they do are prone to make mistakes. Henry Marsh’s book is a series of anecdotes from his life as a renowned neurosurgeon, a life where he is not a superhero but a professional working on a job where one slip is the difference between life and death. He has done countless surgeries and saved a lot of lives from death (imminent and otherwise) but that does not stop him from musing that : A famous English surgeon once remarked that a surgeon has to have the nerves of steel, the heart of a lion and the hands of a woman. I have none of these and instead, at this point of an aneurysm operation, I have to struggle against an overwhelming wish to get the operation over and done with, and to leave the clip in place, even if it is not quite perfectly placed. The tone of the book follows these lines for Dr.Marsh does not write about anecdotes that herald him as a surgeon who never stumbles but he tells us how fragile the whole job is. The title of the book as I understand is derived from the Latin term Primum non nocere (first ,do no harm) which forms a fundamental principle for anyone practicing medicine. But doctors sometimes end up doing harm and it is to these that Marsh calls our attention to. There could be a multitude of reasons : incompetence, ignorance, bad luck or even hubris that have the surgeon ending up with a mistake. The mistake can be of such gravity that you leave the patient to a life more wretched than death. In Marsh’s words : Doctors need to be held accountable, since power corrupts. There must be complaints procedures and litigation, commissions of enquiry, punishment and compensation. At the same time if you do not hide or deny any mistakes when things go wrong, and if your patients and their families know that you are distressed by whatever happened, you might, if you are lucky, receive the precious gift of forgiveness.It is not a grim book filled with gloom and doom but one that speaks with brutal candor of what it means to hold someone’s life in your hands. Surgeons also have that unenviable job of breaking bad news to the relatives. A group of people with their eyes full of expectation await the surgeon in the consulting room and he/she has to walk up to them, sit them down and tell them that their loved one might not be coming back. How do you deal with the helplessness, the grief and the rage ? How do you even maintain a semblance of calm in the face of all these ? Think as I might, I can never find this strength in me. There is an instance that Marsh recounts of one of his patients suffering a fatal post-operative stroke that disabled the entire right side of the body. When he visits her at the bed, she in all her helplessness mumbles through the left side of her mouth in a slurred voice ‘I trusted you’, it is not easy to erase these words from memory. The words sometimes affect Dr. Marsh so much that he tells one of his juniors ’Terrible job, neurosurgery. Don’t do it !’. The relationship between patients and doctors can be that :Patients are both terrified and ignorant. How are they to know whether the surgeon is competent or not ? They will try to overcome their fear by investing the surgeon with superhuman abilities.…and many a time the superhuman fails. In one of the most touching scenes in the book, Dr. Marsh visits a nursing home run by Catholic nuns. The place specializes on taking care of people who have been rendered invalid or in a vegetative state following accidents or surgeries. The only way someone new to the place can identify one individual from the next is to read their names printed on boards outside the rooms. Walking the corridor, Dr. Marsh is horrified to realize that five of those names became inmates here only following his surgery on them ! Highly recommended. Humane, incisive and very pragmatic a view of neurosurgery and what it means to be a doctor.As an aside, I loved these lines by Dr. Marsh : Neuroscience tells us that it is highly improbable that we have souls, as everything we think and feel are no more or no less than the electrochemical chatter of our nerve cells. Our sense of self, our feelings and our thoughts, our love for others, our hopes and ambitions, our hates and fears all die when our brains die. "
191,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39882547-linda-hill,5,"A factual memoir about the life of an eminent brain surgeon, Henry Marsh.Do No Harm opens with a fairly graphic description of brain surgery and initially I had the feeling I was going to be too squeamish to read this memoir. However, Henry Marsh writes with such eloquence that I was drawn in within a couple of pages and found myself completely held in his thrall.What works so well in this book is the balance of factual and medical detail, explanation of procedures, hospital administration and insight into the personality of the author. Henry Marsh does not spare himself or the reader from his triumphs and disasters, his generosity and his embarrassments, so that there is a true sense of the man behind the surgical mask. I must admit I found some of the passages referring to the bureaucracy and inadequate systems our doctors and nurses have to work within made my blood boil.I thoroughly enjoyed meeting all the people Henry Marsh worked on and with, and have to admire the way in which he dealt with them. I’m not at all certain I could have behaved with many of them as equitably as did the author. I got a vivid sense of the people and personalities and felt that I had encountered their experiences with them because the writing is so skilful. Indeed, it is quite poetic at times. Although Henry Marsh sees himself as an ordinary man I have to disagree. He is a fantastic surgeon, a magnificent writer and a thoroughly compassionate and wonderful, if flawed, human being. It is those flaws and human frailties that make reading Do No Harm so mesmerising.I thought Do No Harm was written with honesty, humility, humour and, above all, a real feeling of humanity. It’s a fascinating and sometimes heartbreaking read that I recommend most highly. I could not tear myself away from its pages."
192,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12884422-steven-yenzer,3,"Marsh is a gifted writer and Do No Harm is a fascinating read. Unfortunately, his dislike of authority of any kind is so pervasive as to be distracting. He never misses a chance to lament some new regulation that is getting between him and his patients. Marsh has never met a rule he didn't like, and he doesn't seem to be able to imagine that anyone above him has any idea what they're doing."
193,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6949946-xilaii,5,"I was unsure about reading this. I tend towards paranoia when it comes to health and things you can do nothing about, and it's really not a good time for me to be reading about cancers and dying. I guess there won't ever be a good time. It was not an easy read and I was more detached than I usually am when I read most books. I imagine to the right person in the right frame of mind is a very emotionally draining book. That's not to say that I wasn't moved by it- I was, in pretty much every direction. It is as buoyant as it is heavy, it is as entertaining as it is saddening and it is as interesting as it is ordinary. There is no separation or remarkable difference, but I found the second half much more enjoyable than the first. I started out thinking he was a privileged asshole, but ended it humbled to know I could not have lived one day in his shoes. The arrogance is just a side effect of revealing so much, I think. The honesty is actually quite refreshing. It is not a glamorous list of successes and bragging, but nor is it a melancholy list of failures and regret. It is what it says it will be, stories. Stories about life, and death. Stories of brain surgery. And perhaps, most importantly I think, stories about the part of us that brain surgeons (or anyone, for that matter) know so little about - the millions of electric impulses that make us people. And as much as stories of life are themselves unique, I think this particular book was worth the read for it's perspective alone. It is one that an overwhelming majority of everyone who ever lived would never otherwise know, and I'm grateful Henry Marsh decided to share it."

195,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5847899-patrick,4,"[4.5]I've read a few reviews that have complained that this book is repetitive. But I think that is part of the point. It is a book about work - and about what it feels like to be doing that work day in and day out. And that's something that the multiple descriptions of brain surgery, which almost always seems to boil down to 'clipping' an aneurysm or removing a tumour, helps to get across. Marsh is good at getting across both the appeal of the work - the satisfaction that can come from doing something really challenging (I've heard him interviewed on the radio about remarking to a patient ""this look's like it'll be a fun tumour to remove"" and, adding, when the patient appeared disconcerted - ""Well, you don't want to be operated on by someone who hates their job do you?"" The book certainly gives you an idea of where the idea of the surgeon who comes to develop the god complex comes from. Knowing that the life or death of others depends on you, and having a whole team hanging on your word can probably have that effect on anyone.But there is a downside to the work, and he's good on that too. The fact that the consequences of failure - and of avoidable human error - is death, or quite possibly worse, years of severe disability. There is a very sad story of how a decision to let an inexperienced junior doctor lead on an operation to deal with a trapped nerve leaves a patient with permanent paralysis. And then there are the difficult conversations with family members and relatives who are begging him to perform operations which have little or no chance of prolonging the patient's life in any meaningful way, and he's honest enough to admit that on occasion, he bowed to that pressure, and almost always regretted doing so. In neurosurgery the delivery of bad news is commonplace enough and he muses on it at one point that ""you never really know if you've done a good job. Nobody has ever got in touch to say ""thank you for the way you told me I was going to die today""...There's humour here too - usually directed at the sometimes Kafka-esque bureaucracy that he rightly or wrongly sees as foisted on doctors by managers who understand little of the work that hospitals actually do. Logging on to a computer he uses to see x-rays causes particular frustration to him, and his secretary remarks ""try Mr Johnston's password. That usually works. Fuck Off 45. He hates computers.""""Why forty five?""""It's the forty fifth month since we signed on to the hospital's system and one has to change the password every month."""
196,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7949813-emma,4,"A warts and all memoir that plunges the reader head first into the fascinating and fragile world of a brain surgeon. Alongside vivid descriptions of human anatomy are the raw confessions of a man driven at times by his arrogance and at other times driven by his compassion, an aspect of humanity that Marsh openly battles with throughout his writing.It was harrowing to discover the difficulties faced by what I deemed to be an exact, yet deeply challenging, branch of medicine. Marsh's openness is a credit to his writing, and his admission that mistakes are easy to make, especially when driven by the desperate need to impress your intimidating peers, left me equally awestruck and terrified. His writing dallies between his own life, outside of medicine and, more frequently, into the brief encounters his has with his patients, those that he saves, those who have longer to spend with families and friends, those who he leaves in a vegetative state due to unavoidable catastrophe or his own over confidence and lastly, those that perish in spite of or as a result of his actions. It is a world I did not envy, one that, through Marsh's admission, ruined his first marriage and requires enough detachment and strength of mind that you can get through the stress of walking into an operating theatre and facing the chance you might fail.Marsh also explores the changes that have occurred during the length of his career, one that seems to irk him the most is the dwindling of respect for both his skills and the needs of his patients. There are some interesting questions raised here about the declining state of our National Health Service, questions posed by those that work within its bowels rather than the patients.Marsh's writing puts the reader straight into the heart of his operations, vivid descriptions completely submerge you inside the grey matter of his patients and his ability to recall the drama faced by himself and his team is tangible. It was refreshing to find a memoir on such a complex, academic subject so easy to read, Marsh truly knows how to reel in the reader, I was hooked until the very end.Overall, a fresh, exciting well written memoir that demands to be read, not only by those who have had friends or family who have endured the challenging, mysterious world of brain surgery, as patient or practitioner, but also by anyone curious and fearless enough to learn about a riveting, pressure driven career with rules that blur at the most tragic of times."

It was getting too heavy and dystopian with all the environmentalism and animal abuse and humans-are-rapidly-killing-everything-they-touch and whatnot. Not that I’m done with that kind of reality forever, but all those reminders of how moronic and doomed we are as a species can really weigh on a person, am I wrong? Anyway, this book wasn’t a targeted selection– it was simply one of the first things I saw in the Kindle Store that looked interesting. And interesting it was! A quick read, and quite the page turner if you ask me.Doctors have long been perceived as infallible heroes in many cultures, including our own (and that of the U.K. where Dr. Marsh works as a consulting neurosurgeon). Movies and television shows like Grey’s Anatomy and E.R. demonstrate our fascination with the ever-mysterious lives and works of the Gods of the O.R. I don’t think many would argue the possibility that we may have a slightly skewed perception of what actually goes on in hospitals and the lives of the folks who work in them. I know you’re thinking to yourself: “Wait, there ISN’T any spontaneous, choreographed song and dance?!” And I’m here as the bearer of bad news. There is no spontaneous, choreographed song and dance. I’m as shocked and appalled as you are. Turns out, doctors are actually human. Who knew! They have lives outside of their work; they have families and hobbies and quirks. They pay bills and face the frustrations of bureaucracy and systematic failure. They’re personally and familially susceptible to disease and death and they, just like their patients (the rest of us), sometimes make mistakes. *GASP* Luckily (or maybe not so much for those of us who prefer believing in the Doctors Can Do No Wrong theory), folks like Dr. Marsh are finding the graciousness and courage to tell it like it is. To share with us the real story of anatomy, emergencies, our twisted up healthcare system, the triumph of life and the inevitability of death. Marsh is confident and smart with an impressive talent for describing, simply and accessibly, his insanely complex work. But he is equally humble and openly shares his failures, mistakes, and frustrations. He’s genuine, and that makes him a pleasure to read. Even without the all the television style melodrama. So, long story short. Brains are cool, doctors are human, and one day we’re all going to die."
198,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/320372-lenny-husen,5,"I LOVED this and LOVED the narrator's voice. I listened to it in the car. The first disc contained the most suspenseful story I've heard/read in a long while--I was figuratively biting my nails in anxiety for how the surgery was going to turn out. I particularly love British English and every word was a delight. It was beautifully, elegantly, sensitively and warmly well-written.Neurosurgeon Henry Marsh has displaced Professor Robert Greenberg as the Number One Person whose hand I would love to shake, a list that also includes Atul Gawande, Paul Farmer, Abraham Verghese. Warning: this book isn't for someone who doesn't like the thought of blood (such as one of my brothers). Very graphic as far as surgery, terminal illness, death.What was harder to bear for me personally was the descriptions of Hospital Bed Control and the extremely irriting hospital administration's lack of respect and rules that served to impede work getting done--I could identify as I deal with this kind of thing daily as well and could commiserate. I laughed out loud at MAST (MANDATORY AND STATUTORY TRAINING) for Improved Customer Service that Mr. Marsh was forced to attend and had to leave to tell the anxious family of a patient that their loved one was going to die, and then to go back to the Training. Also I laughed and shouted in my car at the ""Best Password"" Marsh had to use to get into the Remote Radiology System in order to give the patient his prognosis about his brain tumour, where the difficulty getting into the system to review the film cost Mr. Marsh and the waiting patients 30 unnecessary minutes delay.Marsh describes cases that were tragic failures and those that were brilliant successes, both with grace, charm, humility. Who should listen to this book: Any doctor, anyone caring for a loved one or patient with a brain tumour, any one with an interest in Surgery or Medicine. Especially anyone interested in Neurosurgery, the Pinnacle of Medicine. Note: This is the third book I've read by a Neurosurgeon, and I no longer envy them, as I once did as a Pre-Med Student. It is not a life that my particular brain could lead with any success."
199,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22117564-douglas-lord,5,"There’s an old Far Side cartoon that shows a group of doctors obscuring a patient on an operating table. “Whoa!” says one. “That was a good one! Try it, Hobbs—just poke his brain right where my finger is.” Marsh (an actual brain surgeon for Britain’s National Health Service), aka Dr. Reality Check, here manfully acknowledges the unreal level of trust that patients put in their doctors and also recognizes medicine’s inherent fallacy: “[i]f the operation succeeds the surgeon is a hero, but if it fails he is a villain.” Anecdotes illustrate “attempts, and occasional failures, to find a balance between the necessary detachment and compassion that a surgical career requires, a balance between hope and realism.” It’s a fairly upsetting, sometimes brutal, book to read. For example, the brain “…has the consistency of jelly” and Marsh’s simultaneous “fear and excitement” when he lets his “instruments sink into the brain or spinal cord” is unnerving. He admits to speaking with “false optimism” to a man with a tumor in his pineal gland (that’s way deep inside the brain, Chumley) and laments the young woman who “…had had a tumour in her spinal cord, between the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae” who “awoke from the operation paralysed down the right side of her body. I had probably tried to take out too much of the tumour,” he admits. Another chapter is all about a lecture he gives, titled “All My Worst Mistakes,” that puts Michael Jordan’s failure speech to shame. VERDICT Imagine the unimaginable—Marsh reveals a real person behind the mystique, one who is trying as mightily as he can to heal but who is all too aware of his errors.Find this review and others at Books for Dudes, the online reader's advisory column for men from Library Journal here.

200,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6200323-david-ball,5,"Like Atul Gawande’s Being Mortal I fought this. I knew from the reviews that Do No Harm was something I should read, but the subject matter always put me off. After a long day of work, chasing kids, and being a responsible adult, it’s not always easy to sit down and read about death, or in this case brain surgery. And unsurprisingly the 'right-mood' window to attempt these types of books is both infrequent and fleeting. At least with Being Mortal I felt I was being forced to contemplate some of life’s most difficult questions, and if it wasn’t exactly enjoyable, at least it felt useful or productive, as it does whenever one finally faces up to doing something previously avoided. Do No Harm does not have the same redeeming features. First of all, it compels one to consider a pretty horrific subject, one that most people would normally try to great lengths to avoid. Then it makes matters worse by dwelling on the fallibility of the surgeon. If I was about to undergo a brain operation, I wouldn't want to know about my surgeon’s bad moods, mistakes, insecurities, tiredness or helplessness. But that's Henry Marsh. Excessively conscious and self-aware; honest to a fault, and superbly human - a gloriously Knausgardian figure. Full of complexities and contradictions, he's great company, and probably a great surgeon; although you come to realize from reading this book that greatness has its limitations when it comes to life and death matters. That's probably the most valuable lesson with both Do No Harm and Being Mortal - these books look you in the eye and tell you the truth. It may not be pretty, but it's realistic. And sometimes that's enough to warrant five stars. "
201,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145290-amy-qualls,3,"As someone who was married to someone who sustained a brain injury while I was married to him, I knew I would not have the easiest of relationships with this book. One of the supporting characters in this book -- asking questions, unsure whether to hope or fear -- could very easily have been me, if this book had been written at a different hospital.I've dealt with surgeons and other medical professionals with Marsh's mindset, and had an expectation of what his personality would be in this book. I was correct, and in that regard, this book was exactly what I expected. On the other hand, I was also a little bit disappointed; I think I was hoping for some level of additional insight by reading this book, and there was none for me. It's possible that my prior experience as the caregiver of a TBI survivor meant I'd already gained the insight Marsh hoped I'd receive as a reader of this book.I did find some comfort in one of the themes, though. From spending time watching families come and go in a neurological intensive care unit, I came away with the deep suspicion that many medical professionals perform overly heroic measures on brain injury patients in the name of prolonging life, without consideration to the quality of life they are prolonging. Dr. Marsh acknowledged this tendency and discussed it openly; his conclusions are quite similar to mine. Letting go is hard, unspeakably hard, but not every survival is a success story.The book's not for the faint of heart. If you're curious about the mindset of surgeons, or need closure after seeing a brain injury affect the life of someone you love, give it a try."
202,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie,5,"“Do no harm” is paraphrased in the Hippocratic Oath that medical students are all exposed to first thing. It’s the common principal in all medicine, but is especially stressed in neurosurgery, where the possibility for harm is so high. Henry Marsh has been a top neurosurgeon in Great Britain for many years and shares his stories of the trade here. Each chapter is named for and explores the treatment of a different neurological problem; meningioma, pituitary adenoma, infarct. Each chapter features a different patient; we see how the patient came to Marsh, how the operation went, and sometimes we see how they fared. Not always; sometimes they are whisked way back to the hospital that referred them, rather them leaving them under the care of the surgeon. So there are times that the author had no idea how they ultimately turned out. The descriptions of the problems and the way they are treated fascinated me, but beware if you are squeamish- the author describes things pretty vividly. But his book is not just about operations; it’s also about his own life, the about the NHS system in England. The system limits not just patient care but the hours doctors can work, which can make arranging long operations difficult. New doctors don’t have time enough to learn all they should. Marsh describes taking this out on nurses, anesthesiologists, clerks, and more- while an empathic, caring, man with patients, he seems to have been an ass to those he worked with at times- and admits it. I couldn’t put this book down. It was like reading a series of exciting stories, watching Marsh’s expertise and character grow. And I love a good medical description. "
203,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13141987-sunit,5,"""Every surgeon carries within himself a small cemetery, where from time to time he goes to pray- a place of bitterness and regret, where he must look for an explanation for his failures.""This book is an extremely frank memoir by Dr. Marsh, a world-renowned neurosurgeon in the UK. Some would say it is too frank with its graphic description of mistakes and of suffering. Each chapter is centered around a specific medical condition of the brain or the spinal cord and has details on the surgery and the recovery all beautifully wrapped around the human story. The book is at times sad when he talks about personal connections with patients and their lives and deaths, at times funny especially when he describes the detailed turd descriptions as part of record keeping and about botched computerization of the records, and at times political when he shows his disdain for the NHS and the management of medicine by bureaucrats. You manage to get into the head of a very conscientious doctor as he makes life or death decisions. There is also the frank admission that a lot of what happens in these surgeries comes down to luck. I walked away with a renewed appreciation and understanding of the complexity (or the knowledge of how much I do not know) of the human brain, the decisions and the aftermath that these extremely skilled surgeons have to live with and the thought process that goes into their interactions. If you have wondered how a doctor can seem so detached for something that can be life or death for you, this book will help you get closer to that answer. "
204,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6053755-audrey,5,"This book amazed me in a couple of ways. First, that a book subtitled ""Stories of Life, Death, and Brain Surgery"" could manage to be not only enjoyable, but somewhat uplifting. Second, that someone who has had a career in a field that seems utterly daunting to me can also write. Marsh's stories tell us not only that he is a gifted and compassionate surgeon but also a talented writer. As I noted when I first tried to begin reading ""Do No Harm"" a few days after recovering from a migraine, this is NOT a book for hypochondriacs or anyone who tends to adopt the symptoms of whatever they are reading about. Marsh writes candidly about what afflicts his patients (and, in some cases, himself and his family members). You'll need to be able to tolerate that to enjoy the book.He organizes each story around a particular diagnosis or anomaly (for example, ""Meningioma"" or ""Tic Doloreux"") which also names the chapter. We learn about his early training, difficult cases, and something of his personal life, as well as about the challenges and evolution of the U.K.'s National Health System during the more than 40 years of Marsh's career. The book's episodic structure contributes greatly to its readability. What might otherwise have been a ho-hum, ""first this happened, then this happened"" narrative becomes a powerful meditation on our common humanity, human fallibility, and some truly mind-blowing (no pun intended) insights into the human mind and brain."
205,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6390523-marco,5,"Illness is something that happens only to patients. This is an important lesson you learn early on as a medical student. You are suddenly exposed to a terrifying new world of illness and death, and you learn how terrible illnesses often start with quite trivial symptoms - blood on the toothbrush can mean leukaemia, a small lump in the neck might mean cancer, a previously unnoticed mole might be a malignant melanoma. Most medical students go trough a brief period when they develop all matter of imaginary illnesses - I myself had leukaemia for at least four days - until they learn, as a matter of self-preservation, that illnesses happen to patients, not to doctors. This necessary detachment from patients becomes all the greater when you start working as a junior doctor and you have to do frightening and unpleasant things to patients. It starts with simple blood-taking and inserting drips, and progresses over time - if you train as a surgeon - to ever more radical procedures, cutting and slicing into people's bodies. It would be impossible to do the work if you felt the patients' fear and suffering yourself. Besides, the increasing responsability that comes as you climb the career ladder brings greater anxiety that you will make a mistake and that patients will suffer. Patients become objects of fear as well as of sympathy. It is much easier to feel compassion for other people if you are not responsible for what happens to them."
206,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9281513-cheryl,4,"A fascinating dive into the world of neurosurgery. This one won't be for everyone as it can be stark and even brutal (who knew that they do some brain surgeries while the patient is awake and sitting up?). That said, the author, who is one of the U.K.'s foremost neurosurgeons, takes the reader behind the scenes. We feel like we are in the operating room with him. We are witness to absolutely amazing successes, and we join him as he explains to a patient that there is no hope. The book was given to me by my sister who lives in the U.K., and there are plenty of digs at the British NHS. However, Marsh balances the digs with witness to how a national health care system can provide not just adequate, but many times,quite remarkable care to those who might not otherwise be able to avail themselves of it. For American readers, it will provide pros and cons of a national health care system of which we need to be aware, as the issue of universal health care is definitely on the horizon for us. If you are not the queasy type, I highly recommend this book. I do have to say that at one point, I had to drop it as it became too dark. That may have been just where I was then, in my life, (especially given that I am an estate attorney and live in death's back yard), or it may be that sometimes one needs to take a break with a glass of wine and some good fiction. Obviously I picked it up again and am glad that I did."
207,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2999635-kaetrin,3,"3.5 stars.Not sure if it was the narrator that made the author sound like a bit of a jerk sometimes or if that's just actually the case. The medical stuff was great but I could do without moaning and whinging about managers and his (apparent) disrespect for work health and safety and any kind of bureaucracy. I get that it can be annoying but he also wouldn't be able to do his job without it. The apparent contempt with which he held the managers (non-medical) in the hospital was a bit mind-blowing. Again, not sure if it was in part a bad interpretation from the narrator - I heard Mr. Marsh interviewed on ABC's Conversations podcast and he sounded WAY nicer and far more personable. Perhaps some of it was written ironically? There was some of that ""doctors are superior and neurosurgeons are the most superior"" thing going on but he seemed both self-aware and self-deprecating about it (at least at times - from the text only - I couldn't tell that from the narrator's tone) that I decided to give that a pass.I didn't love the narration but as it was non-fiction I was mostly able to not let it get in the way. There were stupid pauses between tracks so the production wasn't the best (I borrowed the CDs from the library and imported them into iTunes - I suspect the download would be smoother but I'm not buying it to check).It was fascinating and also a little terrifying because: brain tumours are scary! Note to self: do not panic next time you get a headache. Argh."
208,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46238669-varun-padmanaban,5,"Marsh in this brilliant memoir of his life and surgical career expounds his errors and he does so in a manner where he explores how these errors has changed him, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. He speaks of his “small cemetery, where from time to time he goes to pray.” Importantly, he speaks with an aura of reckless honesty compared to the usually defensive surgeon’s emotions. Interestingly, he speaks of his daily anxiety – before surgery on the decision whether to operate or not, sometimes during the surgery he is – “oppressed by dread, almost a feeling of doom” and right before the surgery he is often seized by panic before entering flow – “fierce and happy concentration.” He speaks of the pain he feels for his patients whom are vegetative, curled up, alive yet unable to do anything. What he feels in speaking to their family and loved ones. He speaks of luck – even while he ids blamed for what goes wrong and praised for what goes right, and in the end he uses this luck to create his moral code: never lie to a patient, control how you feel by not letting your feelings add to a patients’ fear or unhappiness. In a fitting end, his last chapter, “Anesthesia dolorosa” speaks of a patient who can no longer feel pain in one of her facial nerves and he describes how this can sometimes be ironically painful. One is sometimes determined to feel as much as he can."
209,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6893402-counsel182,5,"This is an amazing book. I stumbled upon Dr. Marsh while reading a New York Times Magazine article about him by Karl Ove Knausgaad that was equally fascinating (December 2015). In fact, about the only criticism I would have about ""Do No Harm"" is the first person narrative is at times too personal and shocking in all its splendid candor that I fear Dr. Marsh (my latest ""hero"") is opening himself up far too much. He is quite human and in neurosurgeons that is refreshing and self deprecating when he admits that his own surgeries have gone horribly wrong with dire consequences. Reading such candor here in the United States where such revelations can only lead to a minefield of litigation is amazing. Dr. Marsh also does not sugarcoat the pitfalls of the English ""socialized"" medical two-tier system which also makes this book a bit of a primer on what MUST be done here in the states to reform the silly health care system we currently have and the insane attempts to derail affordable care for all.But, getting back to Dr. Marsh and this exceptional book--I also had the very good fortune years ago to stumble across Dr. Richard Seltzer's ""Mortal Lessons: Notes on the Art of Surgery"" which was equally refreshing and amazing. I would hope Dr. Marsh and Dr. Seltzer would have at one time crossed paths. These amazing men give hope to the art and science of medicine. "

212,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10638379-mitchell-keo,3,"Was not very moved upon finishing this book. Dr. Marsh has a very...detached way about writing about things, even if they are emotional moments. Which I suppose makes sense if you need that kind of detachment as a neurosurgeon? Yet there was an air of self importance in his writing that I could not settle into. Understandably, neurosurgery is a profession that demands great respect. Yet throughout this book I couldn’t help but feel entitlement from Dr. Marsh when he expresses his frustrations with hospital staff.I suppose my idea if medical memoirs are based upon first impressions from books I’ve read previous to this one. I often feel thoughtful, inspired, and introspective upon reading about the insight given by a medical professional and their duty to society as healthcare provider and lifeline against death. Yet...this book made me feel sad. Jaded. Tired. And a large part of that was reflected off of the author’s way of recollection. Which makes sense, since neurosurgery is a very emotionally demanding field. But it was not something within this book that I could feel myself moved by."
213,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15788793-ed,5,"What an absolutely stunning book. I've been recommending this to anyone who will listen since about 10 pages in. Gripping, emotional, funny, gentle, deeply sad, philosophical and hopeful. Marsh manages to detach himself from his own professional detachment to describe what it's like to operate on life-or-death brain surgery cases every day for 35 years. He combines care for patients, an ingrained understanding of the role of probability and luck in complex surgery and a continued fascination with the technical skill of his craft into his uncomplicated but moving prose.Broadly, Marsh writes about people and cases, providing enough technical exposition to leave the reader feeling informed and with an appreciation of the difficulty of the operations without needing to demonstrate his own (clearly substantial) intelligence. It's a look behind the scenes of life in a modern hospital, too, punctuated with frustration at NHS reforms and bureaucracy.I could write about this for hours, but suffice to say that this is a triumph by a master in his field. I recommend it unreservedly."
214,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739605-helen-costello,5,Absolutely fascinating and perfect for fans of medical literature. Henry Marsh is a character that I can imagine being quite difficult to work with. He does come across with compassion for his patients but is brutally honest when he says that most people do not like to work with him. This book has graphic descriptions of operations - You do get used to the gore though as the individual cases and their history shines through. Marsh may not be the ideal work colleague but he definitely cares for his patients.He is very truthful about when operations goes wrong - I'm not sure this is the read for anyone facing brain surgery.

I especially appreciated how the neurosurgery was described in a way that made it easy to understand and follow, even for people with no experience in the field (outside of McDreamy from Grey's Anatomy).I would highly recommend this to anyone with even a passing curiosity about brain surgery, but perhaps not the people like me who are just looking for an interesting memoir about someone's life."

220,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"There was a trailer that kept playing on TV during my childhood from the TV series ER. As a sort of subtitle on the trailer was written that a doctor is a true image of God on Earth. I was at a pretty impressionable age then and swallowed this completely thinking that a doctor is one of those divine entities who one has to view with reverence. It took a few years for that to be beaten out of me and to realize that human beings everywhere, no matter what they do are prone to make mistakes. Henry Marsh’s book is a series of anecdotes from his life as a renowned neurosurgeon, a life where he is not a superhero but a professional working on a job where one slip is the difference between life and death. He has done countless surgeries and saved a lot of lives from death (imminent and otherwise) but that does not stop him from musing that : A famous English surgeon once remarked that a surgeon has to have the nerves of steel, the heart of a lion and the hands of a woman. I have none of these and instead, at this point of an aneurysm operation, I have to struggle against an overwhelming wish to get the operation over and done with, and to leave the clip in place, even if it is not quite perfectly placed. The tone of the book follows these lines for Dr.Marsh does not write about anecdotes that herald him as a surgeon who never stumbles but he tells us how fragile the whole job is. The title of the book as I understand is derived from the Latin term Primum non nocere (first ,do no harm) which forms a fundamental principle for anyone practicing medicine. But doctors sometimes end up doing harm and it is to these that Marsh calls our attention to. There could be a multitude of reasons : incompetence, ignorance, bad luck or even hubris that have the surgeon ending up with a mistake. The mistake can be of such gravity that you leave the patient to a life more wretched than death. In Marsh’s words : Doctors need to be held accountable, since power corrupts. There must be complaints procedures and litigation, commissions of enquiry, punishment and compensation. At the same time if you do not hide or deny any mistakes when things go wrong, and if your patients and their families know that you are distressed by whatever happened, you might, if you are lucky, receive the precious gift of forgiveness.It is not a grim book filled with gloom and doom but one that speaks with brutal candor of what it means to hold someone’s life in your hands. Surgeons also have that unenviable job of breaking bad news to the relatives. A group of people with their eyes full of expectation await the surgeon in the consulting room and he/she has to walk up to them, sit them down and tell them that their loved one might not be coming back. How do you deal with the helplessness, the grief and the rage ? How do you even maintain a semblance of calm in the face of all these ? Think as I might, I can never find this strength in me. There is an instance that Marsh recounts of one of his patients suffering a fatal post-operative stroke that disabled the entire right side of the body. When he visits her at the bed, she in all her helplessness mumbles through the left side of her mouth in a slurred voice ‘I trusted you’, it is not easy to erase these words from memory. The words sometimes affect Dr. Marsh so much that he tells one of his juniors ’Terrible job, neurosurgery. Don’t do it !’. The relationship between patients and doctors can be that :Patients are both terrified and ignorant. How are they to know whether the surgeon is competent or not ? They will try to overcome their fear by investing the surgeon with superhuman abilities.…and many a time the superhuman fails. In one of the most touching scenes in the book, Dr. Marsh visits a nursing home run by Catholic nuns. The place specializes on taking care of people who have been rendered invalid or in a vegetative state following accidents or surgeries. The only way someone new to the place can identify one individual from the next is to read their names printed on boards outside the rooms. Walking the corridor, Dr. Marsh is horrified to realize that five of those names became inmates here only following his surgery on them ! Highly recommended. Humane, incisive and very pragmatic a view of neurosurgery and what it means to be a doctor.As an aside, I loved these lines by Dr. Marsh : Neuroscience tells us that it is highly improbable that we have souls, as everything we think and feel are no more or no less than the electrochemical chatter of our nerve cells. Our sense of self, our feelings and our thoughts, our love for others, our hopes and ambitions, our hates and fears all die when our brains die. "
221,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39882547-linda-hill,5,"A factual memoir about the life of an eminent brain surgeon, Henry Marsh.Do No Harm opens with a fairly graphic description of brain surgery and initially I had the feeling I was going to be too squeamish to read this memoir. However, Henry Marsh writes with such eloquence that I was drawn in within a couple of pages and found myself completely held in his thrall.What works so well in this book is the balance of factual and medical detail, explanation of procedures, hospital administration and insight into the personality of the author. Henry Marsh does not spare himself or the reader from his triumphs and disasters, his generosity and his embarrassments, so that there is a true sense of the man behind the surgical mask. I must admit I found some of the passages referring to the bureaucracy and inadequate systems our doctors and nurses have to work within made my blood boil.I thoroughly enjoyed meeting all the people Henry Marsh worked on and with, and have to admire the way in which he dealt with them. I’m not at all certain I could have behaved with many of them as equitably as did the author. I got a vivid sense of the people and personalities and felt that I had encountered their experiences with them because the writing is so skilful. Indeed, it is quite poetic at times. Although Henry Marsh sees himself as an ordinary man I have to disagree. He is a fantastic surgeon, a magnificent writer and a thoroughly compassionate and wonderful, if flawed, human being. It is those flaws and human frailties that make reading Do No Harm so mesmerising.I thought Do No Harm was written with honesty, humility, humour and, above all, a real feeling of humanity. It’s a fascinating and sometimes heartbreaking read that I recommend most highly. I could not tear myself away from its pages."
222,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12884422-steven-yenzer,3,"Marsh is a gifted writer and Do No Harm is a fascinating read. Unfortunately, his dislike of authority of any kind is so pervasive as to be distracting. He never misses a chance to lament some new regulation that is getting between him and his patients. Marsh has never met a rule he didn't like, and he doesn't seem to be able to imagine that anyone above him has any idea what they're doing."
223,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6949946-xilaii,5,"I was unsure about reading this. I tend towards paranoia when it comes to health and things you can do nothing about, and it's really not a good time for me to be reading about cancers and dying. I guess there won't ever be a good time. It was not an easy read and I was more detached than I usually am when I read most books. I imagine to the right person in the right frame of mind is a very emotionally draining book. That's not to say that I wasn't moved by it- I was, in pretty much every direction. It is as buoyant as it is heavy, it is as entertaining as it is saddening and it is as interesting as it is ordinary. There is no separation or remarkable difference, but I found the second half much more enjoyable than the first. I started out thinking he was a privileged asshole, but ended it humbled to know I could not have lived one day in his shoes. The arrogance is just a side effect of revealing so much, I think. The honesty is actually quite refreshing. It is not a glamorous list of successes and bragging, but nor is it a melancholy list of failures and regret. It is what it says it will be, stories. Stories about life, and death. Stories of brain surgery. And perhaps, most importantly I think, stories about the part of us that brain surgeons (or anyone, for that matter) know so little about - the millions of electric impulses that make us people. And as much as stories of life are themselves unique, I think this particular book was worth the read for it's perspective alone. It is one that an overwhelming majority of everyone who ever lived would never otherwise know, and I'm grateful Henry Marsh decided to share it."

225,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5847899-patrick,4,"[4.5]I've read a few reviews that have complained that this book is repetitive. But I think that is part of the point. It is a book about work - and about what it feels like to be doing that work day in and day out. And that's something that the multiple descriptions of brain surgery, which almost always seems to boil down to 'clipping' an aneurysm or removing a tumour, helps to get across. Marsh is good at getting across both the appeal of the work - the satisfaction that can come from doing something really challenging (I've heard him interviewed on the radio about remarking to a patient ""this look's like it'll be a fun tumour to remove"" and, adding, when the patient appeared disconcerted - ""Well, you don't want to be operated on by someone who hates their job do you?"" The book certainly gives you an idea of where the idea of the surgeon who comes to develop the god complex comes from. Knowing that the life or death of others depends on you, and having a whole team hanging on your word can probably have that effect on anyone.But there is a downside to the work, and he's good on that too. The fact that the consequences of failure - and of avoidable human error - is death, or quite possibly worse, years of severe disability. There is a very sad story of how a decision to let an inexperienced junior doctor lead on an operation to deal with a trapped nerve leaves a patient with permanent paralysis. And then there are the difficult conversations with family members and relatives who are begging him to perform operations which have little or no chance of prolonging the patient's life in any meaningful way, and he's honest enough to admit that on occasion, he bowed to that pressure, and almost always regretted doing so. In neurosurgery the delivery of bad news is commonplace enough and he muses on it at one point that ""you never really know if you've done a good job. Nobody has ever got in touch to say ""thank you for the way you told me I was going to die today""...There's humour here too - usually directed at the sometimes Kafka-esque bureaucracy that he rightly or wrongly sees as foisted on doctors by managers who understand little of the work that hospitals actually do. Logging on to a computer he uses to see x-rays causes particular frustration to him, and his secretary remarks ""try Mr Johnston's password. That usually works. Fuck Off 45. He hates computers.""""Why forty five?""""It's the forty fifth month since we signed on to the hospital's system and one has to change the password every month."""
226,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7949813-emma,4,"A warts and all memoir that plunges the reader head first into the fascinating and fragile world of a brain surgeon. Alongside vivid descriptions of human anatomy are the raw confessions of a man driven at times by his arrogance and at other times driven by his compassion, an aspect of humanity that Marsh openly battles with throughout his writing.It was harrowing to discover the difficulties faced by what I deemed to be an exact, yet deeply challenging, branch of medicine. Marsh's openness is a credit to his writing, and his admission that mistakes are easy to make, especially when driven by the desperate need to impress your intimidating peers, left me equally awestruck and terrified. His writing dallies between his own life, outside of medicine and, more frequently, into the brief encounters his has with his patients, those that he saves, those who have longer to spend with families and friends, those who he leaves in a vegetative state due to unavoidable catastrophe or his own over confidence and lastly, those that perish in spite of or as a result of his actions. It is a world I did not envy, one that, through Marsh's admission, ruined his first marriage and requires enough detachment and strength of mind that you can get through the stress of walking into an operating theatre and facing the chance you might fail.Marsh also explores the changes that have occurred during the length of his career, one that seems to irk him the most is the dwindling of respect for both his skills and the needs of his patients. There are some interesting questions raised here about the declining state of our National Health Service, questions posed by those that work within its bowels rather than the patients.Marsh's writing puts the reader straight into the heart of his operations, vivid descriptions completely submerge you inside the grey matter of his patients and his ability to recall the drama faced by himself and his team is tangible. It was refreshing to find a memoir on such a complex, academic subject so easy to read, Marsh truly knows how to reel in the reader, I was hooked until the very end.Overall, a fresh, exciting well written memoir that demands to be read, not only by those who have had friends or family who have endured the challenging, mysterious world of brain surgery, as patient or practitioner, but also by anyone curious and fearless enough to learn about a riveting, pressure driven career with rules that blur at the most tragic of times."
227,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4158121-sarah,5,"I needed to mix things up a bit. It was getting too heavy and dystopian with all the environmentalism and animal abuse and humans-are-rapidly-killing-everything-they-touch and whatnot. Not that I’m done with that kind of reality forever, but all those reminders of how moronic and doomed we are as a species can really weigh on a person, am I wrong? Anyway, this book wasn’t a targeted selection– it was simply one of the first things I saw in the Kindle Store that looked interesting. And interesting it was! A quick read, and quite the page turner if you ask me.Doctors have long been perceived as infallible heroes in many cultures, including our own (and that of the U.K. where Dr. Marsh works as a consulting neurosurgeon). Movies and television shows like Grey’s Anatomy and E.R. demonstrate our fascination with the ever-mysterious lives and works of the Gods of the O.R. I don’t think many would argue the possibility that we may have a slightly skewed perception of what actually goes on in hospitals and the lives of the folks who work in them. I know you’re thinking to yourself: “Wait, there ISN’T any spontaneous, choreographed song and dance?!” And I’m here as the bearer of bad news. There is no spontaneous, choreographed song and dance. I’m as shocked and appalled as you are. Turns out, doctors are actually human. Who knew! They have lives outside of their work; they have families and hobbies and quirks. They pay bills and face the frustrations of bureaucracy and systematic failure. They’re personally and familially susceptible to disease and death and they, just like their patients (the rest of us), sometimes make mistakes. *GASP* Luckily (or maybe not so much for those of us who prefer believing in the Doctors Can Do No Wrong theory), folks like Dr. Marsh are finding the graciousness and courage to tell it like it is. To share with us the real story of anatomy, emergencies, our twisted up healthcare system, the triumph of life and the inevitability of death. Marsh is confident and smart with an impressive talent for describing, simply and accessibly, his insanely complex work. But he is equally humble and openly shares his failures, mistakes, and frustrations. He’s genuine, and that makes him a pleasure to read. Even without the all the television style melodrama. So, long story short. Brains are cool, doctors are human, and one day we’re all going to die."
228,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/320372-lenny-husen,5,"I LOVED this and LOVED the narrator's voice. I listened to it in the car. The first disc contained the most suspenseful story I've heard/read in a long while--I was figuratively biting my nails in anxiety for how the surgery was going to turn out. I particularly love British English and every word was a delight. It was beautifully, elegantly, sensitively and warmly well-written.Neurosurgeon Henry Marsh has displaced Professor Robert Greenberg as the Number One Person whose hand I would love to shake, a list that also includes Atul Gawande, Paul Farmer, Abraham Verghese. Warning: this book isn't for someone who doesn't like the thought of blood (such as one of my brothers). Very graphic as far as surgery, terminal illness, death.What was harder to bear for me personally was the descriptions of Hospital Bed Control and the extremely irriting hospital administration's lack of respect and rules that served to impede work getting done--I could identify as I deal with this kind of thing daily as well and could commiserate. I laughed out loud at MAST (MANDATORY AND STATUTORY TRAINING) for Improved Customer Service that Mr. Marsh was forced to attend and had to leave to tell the anxious family of a patient that their loved one was going to die, and then to go back to the Training. Also I laughed and shouted in my car at the ""Best Password"" Marsh had to use to get into the Remote Radiology System in order to give the patient his prognosis about his brain tumour, where the difficulty getting into the system to review the film cost Mr. Marsh and the waiting patients 30 unnecessary minutes delay.Marsh describes cases that were tragic failures and those that were brilliant successes, both with grace, charm, humility. Who should listen to this book: Any doctor, anyone caring for a loved one or patient with a brain tumour, any one with an interest in Surgery or Medicine. Especially anyone interested in Neurosurgery, the Pinnacle of Medicine. Note: This is the third book I've read by a Neurosurgeon, and I no longer envy them, as I once did as a Pre-Med Student. It is not a life that my particular brain could lead with any success."
229,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22117564-douglas-lord,5,"There’s an old Far Side cartoon that shows a group of doctors obscuring a patient on an operating table. “Whoa!” says one. “That was a good one! Try it, Hobbs—just poke his brain right where my finger is.” Marsh (an actual brain surgeon for Britain’s National Health Service), aka Dr. Reality Check, here manfully acknowledges the unreal level of trust that patients put in their doctors and also recognizes medicine’s inherent fallacy: “[i]f the operation succeeds the surgeon is a hero, but if it fails he is a villain.” Anecdotes illustrate “attempts, and occasional failures, to find a balance between the necessary detachment and compassion that a surgical career requires, a balance between hope and realism.” It’s a fairly upsetting, sometimes brutal, book to read. For example, the brain “…has the consistency of jelly” and Marsh’s simultaneous “fear and excitement” when he lets his “instruments sink into the brain or spinal cord” is unnerving. He admits to speaking with “false optimism” to a man with a tumor in his pineal gland (that’s way deep inside the brain, Chumley) and laments the young woman who “…had had a tumour in her spinal cord, between the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae” who “awoke from the operation paralysed down the right side of her body. I had probably tried to take out too much of the tumour,” he admits. Another chapter is all about a lecture he gives, titled “All My Worst Mistakes,” that puts Michael Jordan’s failure speech to shame. VERDICT Imagine the unimaginable—Marsh reveals a real person behind the mystique, one who is trying as mightily as he can to heal but who is all too aware of his errors.Find this review and others at Books for Dudes, the online reader's advisory column for men from Library Journal here.

230,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6200323-david-ball,5,"Like Atul Gawande’s Being Mortal I fought this. I knew from the reviews that Do No Harm was something I should read, but the subject matter always put me off. After a long day of work, chasing kids, and being a responsible adult, it’s not always easy to sit down and read about death, or in this case brain surgery. And unsurprisingly the 'right-mood' window to attempt these types of books is both infrequent and fleeting. At least with Being Mortal I felt I was being forced to contemplate some of life’s most difficult questions, and if it wasn’t exactly enjoyable, at least it felt useful or productive, as it does whenever one finally faces up to doing something previously avoided. Do No Harm does not have the same redeeming features. First of all, it compels one to consider a pretty horrific subject, one that most people would normally try to great lengths to avoid. Then it makes matters worse by dwelling on the fallibility of the surgeon. If I was about to undergo a brain operation, I wouldn't want to know about my surgeon’s bad moods, mistakes, insecurities, tiredness or helplessness. But that's Henry Marsh. Excessively conscious and self-aware; honest to a fault, and superbly human - a gloriously Knausgardian figure. Full of complexities and contradictions, he's great company, and probably a great surgeon; although you come to realize from reading this book that greatness has its limitations when it comes to life and death matters. That's probably the most valuable lesson with both Do No Harm and Being Mortal - these books look you in the eye and tell you the truth. It may not be pretty, but it's realistic. And sometimes that's enough to warrant five stars. "
231,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145290-amy-qualls,3,"As someone who was married to someone who sustained a brain injury while I was married to him, I knew I would not have the easiest of relationships with this book. One of the supporting characters in this book -- asking questions, unsure whether to hope or fear -- could very easily have been me, if this book had been written at a different hospital.I've dealt with surgeons and other medical professionals with Marsh's mindset, and had an expectation of what his personality would be in this book. I was correct, and in that regard, this book was exactly what I expected. On the other hand, I was also a little bit disappointed; I think I was hoping for some level of additional insight by reading this book, and there was none for me. It's possible that my prior experience as the caregiver of a TBI survivor meant I'd already gained the insight Marsh hoped I'd receive as a reader of this book.I did find some comfort in one of the themes, though. From spending time watching families come and go in a neurological intensive care unit, I came away with the deep suspicion that many medical professionals perform overly heroic measures on brain injury patients in the name of prolonging life, without consideration to the quality of life they are prolonging. Dr. Marsh acknowledged this tendency and discussed it openly; his conclusions are quite similar to mine. Letting go is hard, unspeakably hard, but not every survival is a success story.The book's not for the faint of heart. If you're curious about the mindset of surgeons, or need closure after seeing a brain injury affect the life of someone you love, give it a try."
232,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie,5,"“Do no harm” is paraphrased in the Hippocratic Oath that medical students are all exposed to first thing. It’s the common principal in all medicine, but is especially stressed in neurosurgery, where the possibility for harm is so high. Henry Marsh has been a top neurosurgeon in Great Britain for many years and shares his stories of the trade here. Each chapter is named for and explores the treatment of a different neurological problem; meningioma, pituitary adenoma, infarct. Each chapter features a different patient; we see how the patient came to Marsh, how the operation went, and sometimes we see how they fared. Not always; sometimes they are whisked way back to the hospital that referred them, rather them leaving them under the care of the surgeon. So there are times that the author had no idea how they ultimately turned out. The descriptions of the problems and the way they are treated fascinated me, but beware if you are squeamish- the author describes things pretty vividly. But his book is not just about operations; it’s also about his own life, the about the NHS system in England. The system limits not just patient care but the hours doctors can work, which can make arranging long operations difficult. New doctors don’t have time enough to learn all they should. Marsh describes taking this out on nurses, anesthesiologists, clerks, and more- while an empathic, caring, man with patients, he seems to have been an ass to those he worked with at times- and admits it. I couldn’t put this book down. It was like reading a series of exciting stories, watching Marsh’s expertise and character grow. And I love a good medical description. "

Some would say it is too frank with its graphic description of mistakes and of suffering. Each chapter is centered around a specific medical condition of the brain or the spinal cord and has details on the surgery and the recovery all beautifully wrapped around the human story. The book is at times sad when he talks about personal connections with patients and their lives and deaths, at times funny especially when he describes the detailed turd descriptions as part of record keeping and about botched computerization of the records, and at times political when he shows his disdain for the NHS and the management of medicine by bureaucrats. You manage to get into the head of a very conscientious doctor as he makes life or death decisions. There is also the frank admission that a lot of what happens in these surgeries comes down to luck. I walked away with a renewed appreciation and understanding of the complexity (or the knowledge of how much I do not know) of the human brain, the decisions and the aftermath that these extremely skilled surgeons have to live with and the thought process that goes into their interactions. If you have wondered how a doctor can seem so detached for something that can be life or death for you, this book will help you get closer to that answer. "
234,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6053755-audrey,5,"This book amazed me in a couple of ways. First, that a book subtitled ""Stories of Life, Death, and Brain Surgery"" could manage to be not only enjoyable, but somewhat uplifting. Second, that someone who has had a career in a field that seems utterly daunting to me can also write. Marsh's stories tell us not only that he is a gifted and compassionate surgeon but also a talented writer. As I noted when I first tried to begin reading ""Do No Harm"" a few days after recovering from a migraine, this is NOT a book for hypochondriacs or anyone who tends to adopt the symptoms of whatever they are reading about. Marsh writes candidly about what afflicts his patients (and, in some cases, himself and his family members). You'll need to be able to tolerate that to enjoy the book.He organizes each story around a particular diagnosis or anomaly (for example, ""Meningioma"" or ""Tic Doloreux"") which also names the chapter. We learn about his early training, difficult cases, and something of his personal life, as well as about the challenges and evolution of the U.K.'s National Health System during the more than 40 years of Marsh's career. The book's episodic structure contributes greatly to its readability. What might otherwise have been a ho-hum, ""first this happened, then this happened"" narrative becomes a powerful meditation on our common humanity, human fallibility, and some truly mind-blowing (no pun intended) insights into the human mind and brain."
235,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6390523-marco,5,"Illness is something that happens only to patients. This is an important lesson you learn early on as a medical student. You are suddenly exposed to a terrifying new world of illness and death, and you learn how terrible illnesses often start with quite trivial symptoms - blood on the toothbrush can mean leukaemia, a small lump in the neck might mean cancer, a previously unnoticed mole might be a malignant melanoma. Most medical students go trough a brief period when they develop all matter of imaginary illnesses - I myself had leukaemia for at least four days - until they learn, as a matter of self-preservation, that illnesses happen to patients, not to doctors. This necessary detachment from patients becomes all the greater when you start working as a junior doctor and you have to do frightening and unpleasant things to patients. It starts with simple blood-taking and inserting drips, and progresses over time - if you train as a surgeon - to ever more radical procedures, cutting and slicing into people's bodies. It would be impossible to do the work if you felt the patients' fear and suffering yourself. Besides, the increasing responsability that comes as you climb the career ladder brings greater anxiety that you will make a mistake and that patients will suffer. Patients become objects of fear as well as of sympathy. It is much easier to feel compassion for other people if you are not responsible for what happens to them."
236,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9281513-cheryl,4,"A fascinating dive into the world of neurosurgery. This one won't be for everyone as it can be stark and even brutal (who knew that they do some brain surgeries while the patient is awake and sitting up?). That said, the author, who is one of the U.K.'s foremost neurosurgeons, takes the reader behind the scenes. We feel like we are in the operating room with him. We are witness to absolutely amazing successes, and we join him as he explains to a patient that there is no hope. The book was given to me by my sister who lives in the U.K., and there are plenty of digs at the British NHS. However, Marsh balances the digs with witness to how a national health care system can provide not just adequate, but many times,quite remarkable care to those who might not otherwise be able to avail themselves of it. For American readers, it will provide pros and cons of a national health care system of which we need to be aware, as the issue of universal health care is definitely on the horizon for us. If you are not the queasy type, I highly recommend this book. I do have to say that at one point, I had to drop it as it became too dark. That may have been just where I was then, in my life, (especially given that I am an estate attorney and live in death's back yard), or it may be that sometimes one needs to take a break with a glass of wine and some good fiction. Obviously I picked it up again and am glad that I did."

The medical stuff was great but I could do without moaning and whinging about managers and his (apparent) disrespect for work health and safety and any kind of bureaucracy. I get that it can be annoying but he also wouldn't be able to do his job without it. The apparent contempt with which he held the managers (non-medical) in the hospital was a bit mind-blowing. Again, not sure if it was in part a bad interpretation from the narrator - I heard Mr. Marsh interviewed on ABC's Conversations podcast and he sounded WAY nicer and far more personable. Perhaps some of it was written ironically? There was some of that ""doctors are superior and neurosurgeons are the most superior"" thing going on but he seemed both self-aware and self-deprecating about it (at least at times - from the text only - I couldn't tell that from the narrator's tone) that I decided to give that a pass.I didn't love the narration but as it was non-fiction I was mostly able to not let it get in the way. There were stupid pauses between tracks so the production wasn't the best (I borrowed the CDs from the library and imported them into iTunes - I suspect the download would be smoother but I'm not buying it to check).It was fascinating and also a little terrifying because: brain tumours are scary! Note to self: do not panic next time you get a headache. Argh."
238,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46238669-varun-padmanaban,5,"Marsh in this brilliant memoir of his life and surgical career expounds his errors and he does so in a manner where he explores how these errors has changed him, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. He speaks of his “small cemetery, where from time to time he goes to pray.” Importantly, he speaks with an aura of reckless honesty compared to the usually defensive surgeon’s emotions. Interestingly, he speaks of his daily anxiety – before surgery on the decision whether to operate or not, sometimes during the surgery he is – “oppressed by dread, almost a feeling of doom” and right before the surgery he is often seized by panic before entering flow – “fierce and happy concentration.” He speaks of the pain he feels for his patients whom are vegetative, curled up, alive yet unable to do anything. What he feels in speaking to their family and loved ones. He speaks of luck – even while he ids blamed for what goes wrong and praised for what goes right, and in the end he uses this luck to create his moral code: never lie to a patient, control how you feel by not letting your feelings add to a patients’ fear or unhappiness. In a fitting end, his last chapter, “Anesthesia dolorosa” speaks of a patient who can no longer feel pain in one of her facial nerves and he describes how this can sometimes be ironically painful. One is sometimes determined to feel as much as he can."

I stumbled upon Dr. Marsh while reading a New York Times Magazine article about him by Karl Ove Knausgaad that was equally fascinating (December 2015). In fact, about the only criticism I would have about ""Do No Harm"" is the first person narrative is at times too personal and shocking in all its splendid candor that I fear Dr. Marsh (my latest ""hero"") is opening himself up far too much. He is quite human and in neurosurgeons that is refreshing and self deprecating when he admits that his own surgeries have gone horribly wrong with dire consequences. Reading such candor here in the United States where such revelations can only lead to a minefield of litigation is amazing. Dr. Marsh also does not sugarcoat the pitfalls of the English ""socialized"" medical two-tier system which also makes this book a bit of a primer on what MUST be done here in the states to reform the silly health care system we currently have and the insane attempts to derail affordable care for all.But, getting back to Dr. Marsh and this exceptional book--I also had the very good fortune years ago to stumble across Dr. Richard Seltzer's ""Mortal Lessons: Notes on the Art of Surgery"" which was equally refreshing and amazing. I would hope Dr. Marsh and Dr. Seltzer would have at one time crossed paths. These amazing men give hope to the art and science of medicine. "

Maybe working at an academic medical center has burnt me out on these types of voices. Not the best neuro book out there. Head Cases was better, just to name one. "

A fascinating and candid insight into the world of neurosurgery, technical enough to interest medics yet accessible enough for anyone to pick up. Recommend! :)"
242,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10638379-mitchell-keo,3,"Was not very moved upon finishing this book. Dr. Marsh has a very...detached way about writing about things, even if they are emotional moments. Which I suppose makes sense if you need that kind of detachment as a neurosurgeon? Yet there was an air of self importance in his writing that I could not settle into. Understandably, neurosurgery is a profession that demands great respect. Yet throughout this book I couldn’t help but feel entitlement from Dr. Marsh when he expresses his frustrations with hospital staff.I suppose my idea if medical memoirs are based upon first impressions from books I’ve read previous to this one. I often feel thoughtful, inspired, and introspective upon reading about the insight given by a medical professional and their duty to society as healthcare provider and lifeline against death. Yet...this book made me feel sad. Jaded. Tired. And a large part of that was reflected off of the author’s way of recollection. Which makes sense, since neurosurgery is a very emotionally demanding field. But it was not something within this book that I could feel myself moved by."
243,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15788793-ed,5,"What an absolutely stunning book. I've been recommending this to anyone who will listen since about 10 pages in. Gripping, emotional, funny, gentle, deeply sad, philosophical and hopeful. Marsh manages to detach himself from his own professional detachment to describe what it's like to operate on life-or-death brain surgery cases every day for 35 years. He combines care for patients, an ingrained understanding of the role of probability and luck in complex surgery and a continued fascination with the technical skill of his craft into his uncomplicated but moving prose.Broadly, Marsh writes about people and cases, providing enough technical exposition to leave the reader feeling informed and with an appreciation of the difficulty of the operations without needing to demonstrate his own (clearly substantial) intelligence. It's a look behind the scenes of life in a modern hospital, too, punctuated with frustration at NHS reforms and bureaucracy.I could write about this for hours, but suffice to say that this is a triumph by a master in his field. I recommend it unreservedly."
244,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739605-helen-costello,5,Absolutely fascinating and perfect for fans of medical literature. Henry Marsh is a character that I can imagine being quite difficult to work with. He does come across with compassion for his patients but is brutally honest when he says that most people do not like to work with him. This book has graphic descriptions of operations - You do get used to the gore though as the individual cases and their history shines through. Marsh may not be the ideal work colleague but he definitely cares for his patients.He is very truthful about when operations goes wrong - I'm not sure this is the read for anyone facing brain surgery.

I especially appreciated how the neurosurgery was described in a way that made it easy to understand and follow, even for people with no experience in the field (outside of McDreamy from Grey's Anatomy).I would highly recommend this to anyone with even a passing curiosity about brain surgery, but perhaps not the people like me who are just looking for an interesting memoir about someone's life."

But I liked reading about the procedures and glimpsing a little hospital behind-the-scenes action. 
250,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"There was a trailer that kept playing on TV during my childhood from the TV series ER. As a sort of subtitle on the trailer was written that a doctor is a true image of God on Earth. I was at a pretty impressionable age then and swallowed this completely thinking that a doctor is one of those divine entities who one has to view with reverence. It took a few years for that to be beaten out of me and to realize that human beings everywhere, no matter what they do are prone to make mistakes. Henry Marsh’s book is a series of anecdotes from his life as a renowned neurosurgeon, a life where he is not a superhero but a professional working on a job where one slip is the difference between life and death. He has done countless surgeries and saved a lot of lives from death (imminent and otherwise) but that does not stop him from musing that : A famous English surgeon once remarked that a surgeon has to have the nerves of steel, the heart of a lion and the hands of a woman. I have none of these and instead, at this point of an aneurysm operation, I have to struggle against an overwhelming wish to get the operation over and done with, and to leave the clip in place, even if it is not quite perfectly placed. The tone of the book follows these lines for Dr.Marsh does not write about anecdotes that herald him as a surgeon who never stumbles but he tells us how fragile the whole job is. The title of the book as I understand is derived from the Latin term Primum non nocere (first ,do no harm) which forms a fundamental principle for anyone practicing medicine. But doctors sometimes end up doing harm and it is to these that Marsh calls our attention to. There could be a multitude of reasons : incompetence, ignorance, bad luck or even hubris that have the surgeon ending up with a mistake. The mistake can be of such gravity that you leave the patient to a life more wretched than death. In Marsh’s words : Doctors need to be held accountable, since power corrupts. There must be complaints procedures and litigation, commissions of enquiry, punishment and compensation. At the same time if you do not hide or deny any mistakes when things go wrong, and if your patients and their families know that you are distressed by whatever happened, you might, if you are lucky, receive the precious gift of forgiveness.It is not a grim book filled with gloom and doom but one that speaks with brutal candor of what it means to hold someone’s life in your hands. Surgeons also have that unenviable job of breaking bad news to the relatives. A group of people with their eyes full of expectation await the surgeon in the consulting room and he/she has to walk up to them, sit them down and tell them that their loved one might not be coming back. How do you deal with the helplessness, the grief and the rage ? How do you even maintain a semblance of calm in the face of all these ? Think as I might, I can never find this strength in me. There is an instance that Marsh recounts of one of his patients suffering a fatal post-operative stroke that disabled the entire right side of the body. When he visits her at the bed, she in all her helplessness mumbles through the left side of her mouth in a slurred voice ‘I trusted you’, it is not easy to erase these words from memory. The words sometimes affect Dr. Marsh so much that he tells one of his juniors ’Terrible job, neurosurgery. Don’t do it !’. The relationship between patients and doctors can be that :Patients are both terrified and ignorant. How are they to know whether the surgeon is competent or not ? They will try to overcome their fear by investing the surgeon with superhuman abilities.…and many a time the superhuman fails. In one of the most touching scenes in the book, Dr. Marsh visits a nursing home run by Catholic nuns. The place specializes on taking care of people who have been rendered invalid or in a vegetative state following accidents or surgeries. The only way someone new to the place can identify one individual from the next is to read their names printed on boards outside the rooms. Walking the corridor, Dr. Marsh is horrified to realize that five of those names became inmates here only following his surgery on them ! Highly recommended. Humane, incisive and very pragmatic a view of neurosurgery and what it means to be a doctor.As an aside, I loved these lines by Dr. Marsh : Neuroscience tells us that it is highly improbable that we have souls, as everything we think and feel are no more or no less than the electrochemical chatter of our nerve cells. Our sense of self, our feelings and our thoughts, our love for others, our hopes and ambitions, our hates and fears all die when our brains die. "
251,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39882547-linda-hill,5,"A factual memoir about the life of an eminent brain surgeon, Henry Marsh.Do No Harm opens with a fairly graphic description of brain surgery and initially I had the feeling I was going to be too squeamish to read this memoir. However, Henry Marsh writes with such eloquence that I was drawn in within a couple of pages and found myself completely held in his thrall.What works so well in this book is the balance of factual and medical detail, explanation of procedures, hospital administration and insight into the personality of the author. Henry Marsh does not spare himself or the reader from his triumphs and disasters, his generosity and his embarrassments, so that there is a true sense of the man behind the surgical mask. I must admit I found some of the passages referring to the bureaucracy and inadequate systems our doctors and nurses have to work within made my blood boil.I thoroughly enjoyed meeting all the people Henry Marsh worked on and with, and have to admire the way in which he dealt with them. I’m not at all certain I could have behaved with many of them as equitably as did the author. I got a vivid sense of the people and personalities and felt that I had encountered their experiences with them because the writing is so skilful. Indeed, it is quite poetic at times. Although Henry Marsh sees himself as an ordinary man I have to disagree. He is a fantastic surgeon, a magnificent writer and a thoroughly compassionate and wonderful, if flawed, human being. It is those flaws and human frailties that make reading Do No Harm so mesmerising.I thought Do No Harm was written with honesty, humility, humour and, above all, a real feeling of humanity. It’s a fascinating and sometimes heartbreaking read that I recommend most highly. I could not tear myself away from its pages."
252,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12884422-steven-yenzer,3,"Marsh is a gifted writer and Do No Harm is a fascinating read. Unfortunately, his dislike of authority of any kind is so pervasive as to be distracting. He never misses a chance to lament some new regulation that is getting between him and his patients. Marsh has never met a rule he didn't like, and he doesn't seem to be able to imagine that anyone above him has any idea what they're doing."
253,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6949946-xilaii,5,"I was unsure about reading this. I tend towards paranoia when it comes to health and things you can do nothing about, and it's really not a good time for me to be reading about cancers and dying. I guess there won't ever be a good time. It was not an easy read and I was more detached than I usually am when I read most books. I imagine to the right person in the right frame of mind is a very emotionally draining book. That's not to say that I wasn't moved by it- I was, in pretty much every direction. It is as buoyant as it is heavy, it is as entertaining as it is saddening and it is as interesting as it is ordinary. There is no separation or remarkable difference, but I found the second half much more enjoyable than the first. I started out thinking he was a privileged asshole, but ended it humbled to know I could not have lived one day in his shoes. The arrogance is just a side effect of revealing so much, I think. The honesty is actually quite refreshing. It is not a glamorous list of successes and bragging, but nor is it a melancholy list of failures and regret. It is what it says it will be, stories. Stories about life, and death. Stories of brain surgery. And perhaps, most importantly I think, stories about the part of us that brain surgeons (or anyone, for that matter) know so little about - the millions of electric impulses that make us people. And as much as stories of life are themselves unique, I think this particular book was worth the read for it's perspective alone. It is one that an overwhelming majority of everyone who ever lived would never otherwise know, and I'm grateful Henry Marsh decided to share it."

255,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5847899-patrick,4,"[4.5]I've read a few reviews that have complained that this book is repetitive. But I think that is part of the point. It is a book about work - and about what it feels like to be doing that work day in and day out. And that's something that the multiple descriptions of brain surgery, which almost always seems to boil down to 'clipping' an aneurysm or removing a tumour, helps to get across. Marsh is good at getting across both the appeal of the work - the satisfaction that can come from doing something really challenging (I've heard him interviewed on the radio about remarking to a patient ""this look's like it'll be a fun tumour to remove"" and, adding, when the patient appeared disconcerted - ""Well, you don't want to be operated on by someone who hates their job do you?"" The book certainly gives you an idea of where the idea of the surgeon who comes to develop the god complex comes from. Knowing that the life or death of others depends on you, and having a whole team hanging on your word can probably have that effect on anyone.But there is a downside to the work, and he's good on that too. The fact that the consequences of failure - and of avoidable human error - is death, or quite possibly worse, years of severe disability. There is a very sad story of how a decision to let an inexperienced junior doctor lead on an operation to deal with a trapped nerve leaves a patient with permanent paralysis. And then there are the difficult conversations with family members and relatives who are begging him to perform operations which have little or no chance of prolonging the patient's life in any meaningful way, and he's honest enough to admit that on occasion, he bowed to that pressure, and almost always regretted doing so. In neurosurgery the delivery of bad news is commonplace enough and he muses on it at one point that ""you never really know if you've done a good job. Nobody has ever got in touch to say ""thank you for the way you told me I was going to die today""...There's humour here too - usually directed at the sometimes Kafka-esque bureaucracy that he rightly or wrongly sees as foisted on doctors by managers who understand little of the work that hospitals actually do. Logging on to a computer he uses to see x-rays causes particular frustration to him, and his secretary remarks ""try Mr Johnston's password. That usually works. Fuck Off 45. He hates computers.""""Why forty five?""""It's the forty fifth month since we signed on to the hospital's system and one has to change the password every month."""
256,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7949813-emma,4,"A warts and all memoir that plunges the reader head first into the fascinating and fragile world of a brain surgeon. Alongside vivid descriptions of human anatomy are the raw confessions of a man driven at times by his arrogance and at other times driven by his compassion, an aspect of humanity that Marsh openly battles with throughout his writing.It was harrowing to discover the difficulties faced by what I deemed to be an exact, yet deeply challenging, branch of medicine. Marsh's openness is a credit to his writing, and his admission that mistakes are easy to make, especially when driven by the desperate need to impress your intimidating peers, left me equally awestruck and terrified. His writing dallies between his own life, outside of medicine and, more frequently, into the brief encounters his has with his patients, those that he saves, those who have longer to spend with families and friends, those who he leaves in a vegetative state due to unavoidable catastrophe or his own over confidence and lastly, those that perish in spite of or as a result of his actions. It is a world I did not envy, one that, through Marsh's admission, ruined his first marriage and requires enough detachment and strength of mind that you can get through the stress of walking into an operating theatre and facing the chance you might fail.Marsh also explores the changes that have occurred during the length of his career, one that seems to irk him the most is the dwindling of respect for both his skills and the needs of his patients. There are some interesting questions raised here about the declining state of our National Health Service, questions posed by those that work within its bowels rather than the patients.Marsh's writing puts the reader straight into the heart of his operations, vivid descriptions completely submerge you inside the grey matter of his patients and his ability to recall the drama faced by himself and his team is tangible. It was refreshing to find a memoir on such a complex, academic subject so easy to read, Marsh truly knows how to reel in the reader, I was hooked until the very end.Overall, a fresh, exciting well written memoir that demands to be read, not only by those who have had friends or family who have endured the challenging, mysterious world of brain surgery, as patient or practitioner, but also by anyone curious and fearless enough to learn about a riveting, pressure driven career with rules that blur at the most tragic of times."
257,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4158121-sarah,5,"I needed to mix things up a bit. It was getting too heavy and dystopian with all the environmentalism and animal abuse and humans-are-rapidly-killing-everything-they-touch and whatnot. Not that I’m done with that kind of reality forever, but all those reminders of how moronic and doomed we are as a species can really weigh on a person, am I wrong? Anyway, this book wasn’t a targeted selection– it was simply one of the first things I saw in the Kindle Store that looked interesting. And interesting it was! A quick read, and quite the page turner if you ask me.Doctors have long been perceived as infallible heroes in many cultures, including our own (and that of the U.K. where Dr. Marsh works as a consulting neurosurgeon). Movies and television shows like Grey’s Anatomy and E.R. demonstrate our fascination with the ever-mysterious lives and works of the Gods of the O.R. I don’t think many would argue the possibility that we may have a slightly skewed perception of what actually goes on in hospitals and the lives of the folks who work in them. I know you’re thinking to yourself: “Wait, there ISN’T any spontaneous, choreographed song and dance?!” And I’m here as the bearer of bad news. There is no spontaneous, choreographed song and dance. I’m as shocked and appalled as you are. Turns out, doctors are actually human. Who knew! They have lives outside of their work; they have families and hobbies and quirks. They pay bills and face the frustrations of bureaucracy and systematic failure. They’re personally and familially susceptible to disease and death and they, just like their patients (the rest of us), sometimes make mistakes. *GASP* Luckily (or maybe not so much for those of us who prefer believing in the Doctors Can Do No Wrong theory), folks like Dr. Marsh are finding the graciousness and courage to tell it like it is. To share with us the real story of anatomy, emergencies, our twisted up healthcare system, the triumph of life and the inevitability of death. Marsh is confident and smart with an impressive talent for describing, simply and accessibly, his insanely complex work. But he is equally humble and openly shares his failures, mistakes, and frustrations. He’s genuine, and that makes him a pleasure to read. Even without the all the television style melodrama. So, long story short. Brains are cool, doctors are human, and one day we’re all going to die."
258,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/320372-lenny-husen,5,"I LOVED this and LOVED the narrator's voice. I listened to it in the car. The first disc contained the most suspenseful story I've heard/read in a long while--I was figuratively biting my nails in anxiety for how the surgery was going to turn out. I particularly love British English and every word was a delight. It was beautifully, elegantly, sensitively and warmly well-written.Neurosurgeon Henry Marsh has displaced Professor Robert Greenberg as the Number One Person whose hand I would love to shake, a list that also includes Atul Gawande, Paul Farmer, Abraham Verghese. Warning: this book isn't for someone who doesn't like the thought of blood (such as one of my brothers). Very graphic as far as surgery, terminal illness, death.What was harder to bear for me personally was the descriptions of Hospital Bed Control and the extremely irriting hospital administration's lack of respect and rules that served to impede work getting done--I could identify as I deal with this kind of thing daily as well and could commiserate. I laughed out loud at MAST (MANDATORY AND STATUTORY TRAINING) for Improved Customer Service that Mr. Marsh was forced to attend and had to leave to tell the anxious family of a patient that their loved one was going to die, and then to go back to the Training. Also I laughed and shouted in my car at the ""Best Password"" Marsh had to use to get into the Remote Radiology System in order to give the patient his prognosis about his brain tumour, where the difficulty getting into the system to review the film cost Mr. Marsh and the waiting patients 30 unnecessary minutes delay.Marsh describes cases that were tragic failures and those that were brilliant successes, both with grace, charm, humility. Who should listen to this book: Any doctor, anyone caring for a loved one or patient with a brain tumour, any one with an interest in Surgery or Medicine. Especially anyone interested in Neurosurgery, the Pinnacle of Medicine. Note: This is the third book I've read by a Neurosurgeon, and I no longer envy them, as I once did as a Pre-Med Student. It is not a life that my particular brain could lead with any success."
259,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22117564-douglas-lord,5,"There’s an old Far Side cartoon that shows a group of doctors obscuring a patient on an operating table. “Whoa!” says one. “That was a good one! Try it, Hobbs—just poke his brain right where my finger is.” Marsh (an actual brain surgeon for Britain’s National Health Service), aka Dr. Reality Check, here manfully acknowledges the unreal level of trust that patients put in their doctors and also recognizes medicine’s inherent fallacy: “[i]f the operation succeeds the surgeon is a hero, but if it fails he is a villain.” Anecdotes illustrate “attempts, and occasional failures, to find a balance between the necessary detachment and compassion that a surgical career requires, a balance between hope and realism.” It’s a fairly upsetting, sometimes brutal, book to read. For example, the brain “…has the consistency of jelly” and Marsh’s simultaneous “fear and excitement” when he lets his “instruments sink into the brain or spinal cord” is unnerving. He admits to speaking with “false optimism” to a man with a tumor in his pineal gland (that’s way deep inside the brain, Chumley) and laments the young woman who “…had had a tumour in her spinal cord, between the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae” who “awoke from the operation paralysed down the right side of her body. I had probably tried to take out too much of the tumour,” he admits. Another chapter is all about a lecture he gives, titled “All My Worst Mistakes,” that puts Michael Jordan’s failure speech to shame. VERDICT Imagine the unimaginable—Marsh reveals a real person behind the mystique, one who is trying as mightily as he can to heal but who is all too aware of his errors.Find this review and others at Books for Dudes, the online reader's advisory column for men from Library Journal here.

260,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6200323-david-ball,5,"Like Atul Gawande’s Being Mortal I fought this. I knew from the reviews that Do No Harm was something I should read, but the subject matter always put me off. After a long day of work, chasing kids, and being a responsible adult, it’s not always easy to sit down and read about death, or in this case brain surgery. And unsurprisingly the 'right-mood' window to attempt these types of books is both infrequent and fleeting. At least with Being Mortal I felt I was being forced to contemplate some of life’s most difficult questions, and if it wasn’t exactly enjoyable, at least it felt useful or productive, as it does whenever one finally faces up to doing something previously avoided. Do No Harm does not have the same redeeming features. First of all, it compels one to consider a pretty horrific subject, one that most people would normally try to great lengths to avoid. Then it makes matters worse by dwelling on the fallibility of the surgeon. If I was about to undergo a brain operation, I wouldn't want to know about my surgeon’s bad moods, mistakes, insecurities, tiredness or helplessness. But that's Henry Marsh. Excessively conscious and self-aware; honest to a fault, and superbly human - a gloriously Knausgardian figure. Full of complexities and contradictions, he's great company, and probably a great surgeon; although you come to realize from reading this book that greatness has its limitations when it comes to life and death matters. That's probably the most valuable lesson with both Do No Harm and Being Mortal - these books look you in the eye and tell you the truth. It may not be pretty, but it's realistic. And sometimes that's enough to warrant five stars. "
261,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145290-amy-qualls,3,"As someone who was married to someone who sustained a brain injury while I was married to him, I knew I would not have the easiest of relationships with this book. One of the supporting characters in this book -- asking questions, unsure whether to hope or fear -- could very easily have been me, if this book had been written at a different hospital.I've dealt with surgeons and other medical professionals with Marsh's mindset, and had an expectation of what his personality would be in this book. I was correct, and in that regard, this book was exactly what I expected. On the other hand, I was also a little bit disappointed; I think I was hoping for some level of additional insight by reading this book, and there was none for me. It's possible that my prior experience as the caregiver of a TBI survivor meant I'd already gained the insight Marsh hoped I'd receive as a reader of this book.I did find some comfort in one of the themes, though. From spending time watching families come and go in a neurological intensive care unit, I came away with the deep suspicion that many medical professionals perform overly heroic measures on brain injury patients in the name of prolonging life, without consideration to the quality of life they are prolonging. Dr. Marsh acknowledged this tendency and discussed it openly; his conclusions are quite similar to mine. Letting go is hard, unspeakably hard, but not every survival is a success story.The book's not for the faint of heart. If you're curious about the mindset of surgeons, or need closure after seeing a brain injury affect the life of someone you love, give it a try."
262,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie,5,"“Do no harm” is paraphrased in the Hippocratic Oath that medical students are all exposed to first thing. It’s the common principal in all medicine, but is especially stressed in neurosurgery, where the possibility for harm is so high. Henry Marsh has been a top neurosurgeon in Great Britain for many years and shares his stories of the trade here. Each chapter is named for and explores the treatment of a different neurological problem; meningioma, pituitary adenoma, infarct. Each chapter features a different patient; we see how the patient came to Marsh, how the operation went, and sometimes we see how they fared. Not always; sometimes they are whisked way back to the hospital that referred them, rather them leaving them under the care of the surgeon. So there are times that the author had no idea how they ultimately turned out. The descriptions of the problems and the way they are treated fascinated me, but beware if you are squeamish- the author describes things pretty vividly. But his book is not just about operations; it’s also about his own life, the about the NHS system in England. The system limits not just patient care but the hours doctors can work, which can make arranging long operations difficult. New doctors don’t have time enough to learn all they should. Marsh describes taking this out on nurses, anesthesiologists, clerks, and more- while an empathic, caring, man with patients, he seems to have been an ass to those he worked with at times- and admits it. I couldn’t put this book down. It was like reading a series of exciting stories, watching Marsh’s expertise and character grow. And I love a good medical description. "

The book is at times sad when he talks about personal connections with patients and their lives and deaths, at times funny especially when he describes the detailed turd descriptions as part of record keeping and about botched computerization of the records, and at times political when he shows his disdain for the NHS and the management of medicine by bureaucrats. You manage to get into the head of a very conscientious doctor as he makes life or death decisions. There is also the frank admission that a lot of what happens in these surgeries comes down to luck. I walked away with a renewed appreciation and understanding of the complexity (or the knowledge of how much I do not know) of the human brain, the decisions and the aftermath that these extremely skilled surgeons have to live with and the thought process that goes into their interactions. If you have wondered how a doctor can seem so detached for something that can be life or death for you, this book will help you get closer to that answer. "
264,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6053755-audrey,5,"This book amazed me in a couple of ways. First, that a book subtitled ""Stories of Life, Death, and Brain Surgery"" could manage to be not only enjoyable, but somewhat uplifting. Second, that someone who has had a career in a field that seems utterly daunting to me can also write. Marsh's stories tell us not only that he is a gifted and compassionate surgeon but also a talented writer. As I noted when I first tried to begin reading ""Do No Harm"" a few days after recovering from a migraine, this is NOT a book for hypochondriacs or anyone who tends to adopt the symptoms of whatever they are reading about. Marsh writes candidly about what afflicts his patients (and, in some cases, himself and his family members). You'll need to be able to tolerate that to enjoy the book.He organizes each story around a particular diagnosis or anomaly (for example, ""Meningioma"" or ""Tic Doloreux"") which also names the chapter. We learn about his early training, difficult cases, and something of his personal life, as well as about the challenges and evolution of the U.K.'s National Health System during the more than 40 years of Marsh's career. The book's episodic structure contributes greatly to its readability. What might otherwise have been a ho-hum, ""first this happened, then this happened"" narrative becomes a powerful meditation on our common humanity, human fallibility, and some truly mind-blowing (no pun intended) insights into the human mind and brain."
265,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6390523-marco,5,"Illness is something that happens only to patients. This is an important lesson you learn early on as a medical student. You are suddenly exposed to a terrifying new world of illness and death, and you learn how terrible illnesses often start with quite trivial symptoms - blood on the toothbrush can mean leukaemia, a small lump in the neck might mean cancer, a previously unnoticed mole might be a malignant melanoma. Most medical students go trough a brief period when they develop all matter of imaginary illnesses - I myself had leukaemia for at least four days - until they learn, as a matter of self-preservation, that illnesses happen to patients, not to doctors. This necessary detachment from patients becomes all the greater when you start working as a junior doctor and you have to do frightening and unpleasant things to patients. It starts with simple blood-taking and inserting drips, and progresses over time - if you train as a surgeon - to ever more radical procedures, cutting and slicing into people's bodies. It would be impossible to do the work if you felt the patients' fear and suffering yourself. Besides, the increasing responsability that comes as you climb the career ladder brings greater anxiety that you will make a mistake and that patients will suffer. Patients become objects of fear as well as of sympathy. It is much easier to feel compassion for other people if you are not responsible for what happens to them."
266,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9281513-cheryl,4,"A fascinating dive into the world of neurosurgery. This one won't be for everyone as it can be stark and even brutal (who knew that they do some brain surgeries while the patient is awake and sitting up?). That said, the author, who is one of the U.K.'s foremost neurosurgeons, takes the reader behind the scenes. We feel like we are in the operating room with him. We are witness to absolutely amazing successes, and we join him as he explains to a patient that there is no hope. The book was given to me by my sister who lives in the U.K., and there are plenty of digs at the British NHS. However, Marsh balances the digs with witness to how a national health care system can provide not just adequate, but many times,quite remarkable care to those who might not otherwise be able to avail themselves of it. For American readers, it will provide pros and cons of a national health care system of which we need to be aware, as the issue of universal health care is definitely on the horizon for us. If you are not the queasy type, I highly recommend this book. I do have to say that at one point, I had to drop it as it became too dark. That may have been just where I was then, in my life, (especially given that I am an estate attorney and live in death's back yard), or it may be that sometimes one needs to take a break with a glass of wine and some good fiction. Obviously I picked it up again and am glad that I did."
267,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2999635-kaetrin,3,"3.5 stars.Not sure if it was the narrator that made the author sound like a bit of a jerk sometimes or if that's just actually the case. The medical stuff was great but I could do without moaning and whinging about managers and his (apparent) disrespect for work health and safety and any kind of bureaucracy. I get that it can be annoying but he also wouldn't be able to do his job without it. The apparent contempt with which he held the managers (non-medical) in the hospital was a bit mind-blowing. Again, not sure if it was in part a bad interpretation from the narrator - I heard Mr. Marsh interviewed on ABC's Conversations podcast and he sounded WAY nicer and far more personable. Perhaps some of it was written ironically? There was some of that ""doctors are superior and neurosurgeons are the most superior"" thing going on but he seemed both self-aware and self-deprecating about it (at least at times - from the text only - I couldn't tell that from the narrator's tone) that I decided to give that a pass.I didn't love the narration but as it was non-fiction I was mostly able to not let it get in the way. There were stupid pauses between tracks so the production wasn't the best (I borrowed the CDs from the library and imported them into iTunes - I suspect the download would be smoother but I'm not buying it to check).It was fascinating and also a little terrifying because: brain tumours are scary! Note to self: do not panic next time you get a headache. Argh."
268,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46238669-varun-padmanaban,5,"Marsh in this brilliant memoir of his life and surgical career expounds his errors and he does so in a manner where he explores how these errors has changed him, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. He speaks of his “small cemetery, where from time to time he goes to pray.” Importantly, he speaks with an aura of reckless honesty compared to the usually defensive surgeon’s emotions. Interestingly, he speaks of his daily anxiety – before surgery on the decision whether to operate or not, sometimes during the surgery he is – “oppressed by dread, almost a feeling of doom” and right before the surgery he is often seized by panic before entering flow – “fierce and happy concentration.” He speaks of the pain he feels for his patients whom are vegetative, curled up, alive yet unable to do anything. What he feels in speaking to their family and loved ones. He speaks of luck – even while he ids blamed for what goes wrong and praised for what goes right, and in the end he uses this luck to create his moral code: never lie to a patient, control how you feel by not letting your feelings add to a patients’ fear or unhappiness. In a fitting end, his last chapter, “Anesthesia dolorosa” speaks of a patient who can no longer feel pain in one of her facial nerves and he describes how this can sometimes be ironically painful. One is sometimes determined to feel as much as he can."
269,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6893402-counsel182,5,"This is an amazing book. I stumbled upon Dr. Marsh while reading a New York Times Magazine article about him by Karl Ove Knausgaad that was equally fascinating (December 2015). In fact, about the only criticism I would have about ""Do No Harm"" is the first person narrative is at times too personal and shocking in all its splendid candor that I fear Dr. Marsh (my latest ""hero"") is opening himself up far too much. He is quite human and in neurosurgeons that is refreshing and self deprecating when he admits that his own surgeries have gone horribly wrong with dire consequences. Reading such candor here in the United States where such revelations can only lead to a minefield of litigation is amazing. Dr. Marsh also does not sugarcoat the pitfalls of the English ""socialized"" medical two-tier system which also makes this book a bit of a primer on what MUST be done here in the states to reform the silly health care system we currently have and the insane attempts to derail affordable care for all.But, getting back to Dr. Marsh and this exceptional book--I also had the very good fortune years ago to stumble across Dr. Richard Seltzer's ""Mortal Lessons: Notes on the Art of Surgery"" which was equally refreshing and amazing. I would hope Dr. Marsh and Dr. Seltzer would have at one time crossed paths. These amazing men give hope to the art and science of medicine. "

Maybe working at an academic medical center has burnt me out on these types of voices. Not the best neuro book out there. Head Cases was better, just to name one. "

272,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10638379-mitchell-keo,3,"Was not very moved upon finishing this book. Dr. Marsh has a very...detached way about writing about things, even if they are emotional moments. Which I suppose makes sense if you need that kind of detachment as a neurosurgeon? Yet there was an air of self importance in his writing that I could not settle into. Understandably, neurosurgery is a profession that demands great respect. Yet throughout this book I couldn’t help but feel entitlement from Dr. Marsh when he expresses his frustrations with hospital staff.I suppose my idea if medical memoirs are based upon first impressions from books I’ve read previous to this one. I often feel thoughtful, inspired, and introspective upon reading about the insight given by a medical professional and their duty to society as healthcare provider and lifeline against death. Yet...this book made me feel sad. Jaded. Tired. And a large part of that was reflected off of the author’s way of recollection. Which makes sense, since neurosurgery is a very emotionally demanding field. But it was not something within this book that I could feel myself moved by."
273,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15788793-ed,5,"What an absolutely stunning book. I've been recommending this to anyone who will listen since about 10 pages in. Gripping, emotional, funny, gentle, deeply sad, philosophical and hopeful. Marsh manages to detach himself from his own professional detachment to describe what it's like to operate on life-or-death brain surgery cases every day for 35 years. He combines care for patients, an ingrained understanding of the role of probability and luck in complex surgery and a continued fascination with the technical skill of his craft into his uncomplicated but moving prose.Broadly, Marsh writes about people and cases, providing enough technical exposition to leave the reader feeling informed and with an appreciation of the difficulty of the operations without needing to demonstrate his own (clearly substantial) intelligence. It's a look behind the scenes of life in a modern hospital, too, punctuated with frustration at NHS reforms and bureaucracy.I could write about this for hours, but suffice to say that this is a triumph by a master in his field. I recommend it unreservedly."
274,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739605-helen-costello,5,Absolutely fascinating and perfect for fans of medical literature. Henry Marsh is a character that I can imagine being quite difficult to work with. He does come across with compassion for his patients but is brutally honest when he says that most people do not like to work with him. This book has graphic descriptions of operations - You do get used to the gore though as the individual cases and their history shines through. Marsh may not be the ideal work colleague but he definitely cares for his patients.He is very truthful about when operations goes wrong - I'm not sure this is the read for anyone facing brain surgery.

I found myself getting bored with the detailed descriptions brain surgery and medical procedures. But I did think it was really well written and a very worthwhile read. I especially appreciated how the neurosurgery was described in a way that made it easy to understand and follow, even for people with no experience in the field (outside of McDreamy from Grey's Anatomy).I would highly recommend this to anyone with even a passing curiosity about brain surgery, but perhaps not the people like me who are just looking for an interesting memoir about someone's life."

279,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23953835-debbie,3,I have great admiration for anyone who has the aptitude and has acquired the skill to be a neurosurgeon in the first place—something I could never do—but something about the author’s tone didn’t hit me quite right to feel fully engaged when he was relating his patients’ stories. But I liked reading about the procedures and glimpsing a little hospital behind-the-scenes action. 
280,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"There was a trailer that kept playing on TV during my childhood from the TV series ER. As a sort of subtitle on the trailer was written that a doctor is a true image of God on Earth. I was at a pretty impressionable age then and swallowed this completely thinking that a doctor is one of those divine entities who one has to view with reverence. It took a few years for that to be beaten out of me and to realize that human beings everywhere, no matter what they do are prone to make mistakes. Henry Marsh’s book is a series of anecdotes from his life as a renowned neurosurgeon, a life where he is not a superhero but a professional working on a job where one slip is the difference between life and death. He has done countless surgeries and saved a lot of lives from death (imminent and otherwise) but that does not stop him from musing that : A famous English surgeon once remarked that a surgeon has to have the nerves of steel, the heart of a lion and the hands of a woman. I have none of these and instead, at this point of an aneurysm operation, I have to struggle against an overwhelming wish to get the operation over and done with, and to leave the clip in place, even if it is not quite perfectly placed. The tone of the book follows these lines for Dr.Marsh does not write about anecdotes that herald him as a surgeon who never stumbles but he tells us how fragile the whole job is. The title of the book as I understand is derived from the Latin term Primum non nocere (first ,do no harm) which forms a fundamental principle for anyone practicing medicine. But doctors sometimes end up doing harm and it is to these that Marsh calls our attention to. There could be a multitude of reasons : incompetence, ignorance, bad luck or even hubris that have the surgeon ending up with a mistake. The mistake can be of such gravity that you leave the patient to a life more wretched than death. In Marsh’s words : Doctors need to be held accountable, since power corrupts. There must be complaints procedures and litigation, commissions of enquiry, punishment and compensation. At the same time if you do not hide or deny any mistakes when things go wrong, and if your patients and their families know that you are distressed by whatever happened, you might, if you are lucky, receive the precious gift of forgiveness.It is not a grim book filled with gloom and doom but one that speaks with brutal candor of what it means to hold someone’s life in your hands. Surgeons also have that unenviable job of breaking bad news to the relatives. A group of people with their eyes full of expectation await the surgeon in the consulting room and he/she has to walk up to them, sit them down and tell them that their loved one might not be coming back. How do you deal with the helplessness, the grief and the rage ? How do you even maintain a semblance of calm in the face of all these ? Think as I might, I can never find this strength in me. There is an instance that Marsh recounts of one of his patients suffering a fatal post-operative stroke that disabled the entire right side of the body. When he visits her at the bed, she in all her helplessness mumbles through the left side of her mouth in a slurred voice ‘I trusted you’, it is not easy to erase these words from memory. The words sometimes affect Dr. Marsh so much that he tells one of his juniors ’Terrible job, neurosurgery. Don’t do it !’. The relationship between patients and doctors can be that :Patients are both terrified and ignorant. How are they to know whether the surgeon is competent or not ? They will try to overcome their fear by investing the surgeon with superhuman abilities.…and many a time the superhuman fails. In one of the most touching scenes in the book, Dr. Marsh visits a nursing home run by Catholic nuns. The place specializes on taking care of people who have been rendered invalid or in a vegetative state following accidents or surgeries. The only way someone new to the place can identify one individual from the next is to read their names printed on boards outside the rooms. Walking the corridor, Dr. Marsh is horrified to realize that five of those names became inmates here only following his surgery on them ! Highly recommended. Humane, incisive and very pragmatic a view of neurosurgery and what it means to be a doctor.As an aside, I loved these lines by Dr. Marsh : Neuroscience tells us that it is highly improbable that we have souls, as everything we think and feel are no more or no less than the electrochemical chatter of our nerve cells. Our sense of self, our feelings and our thoughts, our love for others, our hopes and ambitions, our hates and fears all die when our brains die. "
281,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39882547-linda-hill,5,"A factual memoir about the life of an eminent brain surgeon, Henry Marsh.Do No Harm opens with a fairly graphic description of brain surgery and initially I had the feeling I was going to be too squeamish to read this memoir. However, Henry Marsh writes with such eloquence that I was drawn in within a couple of pages and found myself completely held in his thrall.What works so well in this book is the balance of factual and medical detail, explanation of procedures, hospital administration and insight into the personality of the author. Henry Marsh does not spare himself or the reader from his triumphs and disasters, his generosity and his embarrassments, so that there is a true sense of the man behind the surgical mask. I must admit I found some of the passages referring to the bureaucracy and inadequate systems our doctors and nurses have to work within made my blood boil.I thoroughly enjoyed meeting all the people Henry Marsh worked on and with, and have to admire the way in which he dealt with them. I’m not at all certain I could have behaved with many of them as equitably as did the author. I got a vivid sense of the people and personalities and felt that I had encountered their experiences with them because the writing is so skilful. Indeed, it is quite poetic at times. Although Henry Marsh sees himself as an ordinary man I have to disagree. He is a fantastic surgeon, a magnificent writer and a thoroughly compassionate and wonderful, if flawed, human being. It is those flaws and human frailties that make reading Do No Harm so mesmerising.I thought Do No Harm was written with honesty, humility, humour and, above all, a real feeling of humanity. It’s a fascinating and sometimes heartbreaking read that I recommend most highly. I could not tear myself away from its pages."
282,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12884422-steven-yenzer,3,"Marsh is a gifted writer and Do No Harm is a fascinating read. Unfortunately, his dislike of authority of any kind is so pervasive as to be distracting. He never misses a chance to lament some new regulation that is getting between him and his patients. Marsh has never met a rule he didn't like, and he doesn't seem to be able to imagine that anyone above him has any idea what they're doing."
283,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6949946-xilaii,5,"I was unsure about reading this. I tend towards paranoia when it comes to health and things you can do nothing about, and it's really not a good time for me to be reading about cancers and dying. I guess there won't ever be a good time. It was not an easy read and I was more detached than I usually am when I read most books. I imagine to the right person in the right frame of mind is a very emotionally draining book. That's not to say that I wasn't moved by it- I was, in pretty much every direction. It is as buoyant as it is heavy, it is as entertaining as it is saddening and it is as interesting as it is ordinary. There is no separation or remarkable difference, but I found the second half much more enjoyable than the first. I started out thinking he was a privileged asshole, but ended it humbled to know I could not have lived one day in his shoes. The arrogance is just a side effect of revealing so much, I think. The honesty is actually quite refreshing. It is not a glamorous list of successes and bragging, but nor is it a melancholy list of failures and regret. It is what it says it will be, stories. Stories about life, and death. Stories of brain surgery. And perhaps, most importantly I think, stories about the part of us that brain surgeons (or anyone, for that matter) know so little about - the millions of electric impulses that make us people. And as much as stories of life are themselves unique, I think this particular book was worth the read for it's perspective alone. It is one that an overwhelming majority of everyone who ever lived would never otherwise know, and I'm grateful Henry Marsh decided to share it."

285,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5847899-patrick,4,"[4.5]I've read a few reviews that have complained that this book is repetitive. But I think that is part of the point. It is a book about work - and about what it feels like to be doing that work day in and day out. And that's something that the multiple descriptions of brain surgery, which almost always seems to boil down to 'clipping' an aneurysm or removing a tumour, helps to get across. Marsh is good at getting across both the appeal of the work - the satisfaction that can come from doing something really challenging (I've heard him interviewed on the radio about remarking to a patient ""this look's like it'll be a fun tumour to remove"" and, adding, when the patient appeared disconcerted - ""Well, you don't want to be operated on by someone who hates their job do you?"" The book certainly gives you an idea of where the idea of the surgeon who comes to develop the god complex comes from. Knowing that the life or death of others depends on you, and having a whole team hanging on your word can probably have that effect on anyone.But there is a downside to the work, and he's good on that too. The fact that the consequences of failure - and of avoidable human error - is death, or quite possibly worse, years of severe disability. There is a very sad story of how a decision to let an inexperienced junior doctor lead on an operation to deal with a trapped nerve leaves a patient with permanent paralysis. And then there are the difficult conversations with family members and relatives who are begging him to perform operations which have little or no chance of prolonging the patient's life in any meaningful way, and he's honest enough to admit that on occasion, he bowed to that pressure, and almost always regretted doing so. In neurosurgery the delivery of bad news is commonplace enough and he muses on it at one point that ""you never really know if you've done a good job. Nobody has ever got in touch to say ""thank you for the way you told me I was going to die today""...There's humour here too - usually directed at the sometimes Kafka-esque bureaucracy that he rightly or wrongly sees as foisted on doctors by managers who understand little of the work that hospitals actually do. Logging on to a computer he uses to see x-rays causes particular frustration to him, and his secretary remarks ""try Mr Johnston's password. That usually works. Fuck Off 45. He hates computers.""""Why forty five?""""It's the forty fifth month since we signed on to the hospital's system and one has to change the password every month."""
286,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7949813-emma,4,"A warts and all memoir that plunges the reader head first into the fascinating and fragile world of a brain surgeon. Alongside vivid descriptions of human anatomy are the raw confessions of a man driven at times by his arrogance and at other times driven by his compassion, an aspect of humanity that Marsh openly battles with throughout his writing.It was harrowing to discover the difficulties faced by what I deemed to be an exact, yet deeply challenging, branch of medicine. Marsh's openness is a credit to his writing, and his admission that mistakes are easy to make, especially when driven by the desperate need to impress your intimidating peers, left me equally awestruck and terrified. His writing dallies between his own life, outside of medicine and, more frequently, into the brief encounters his has with his patients, those that he saves, those who have longer to spend with families and friends, those who he leaves in a vegetative state due to unavoidable catastrophe or his own over confidence and lastly, those that perish in spite of or as a result of his actions. It is a world I did not envy, one that, through Marsh's admission, ruined his first marriage and requires enough detachment and strength of mind that you can get through the stress of walking into an operating theatre and facing the chance you might fail.Marsh also explores the changes that have occurred during the length of his career, one that seems to irk him the most is the dwindling of respect for both his skills and the needs of his patients. There are some interesting questions raised here about the declining state of our National Health Service, questions posed by those that work within its bowels rather than the patients.Marsh's writing puts the reader straight into the heart of his operations, vivid descriptions completely submerge you inside the grey matter of his patients and his ability to recall the drama faced by himself and his team is tangible. It was refreshing to find a memoir on such a complex, academic subject so easy to read, Marsh truly knows how to reel in the reader, I was hooked until the very end.Overall, a fresh, exciting well written memoir that demands to be read, not only by those who have had friends or family who have endured the challenging, mysterious world of brain surgery, as patient or practitioner, but also by anyone curious and fearless enough to learn about a riveting, pressure driven career with rules that blur at the most tragic of times."
287,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4158121-sarah,5,"I needed to mix things up a bit. It was getting too heavy and dystopian with all the environmentalism and animal abuse and humans-are-rapidly-killing-everything-they-touch and whatnot. Not that I’m done with that kind of reality forever, but all those reminders of how moronic and doomed we are as a species can really weigh on a person, am I wrong? Anyway, this book wasn’t a targeted selection– it was simply one of the first things I saw in the Kindle Store that looked interesting. And interesting it was! A quick read, and quite the page turner if you ask me.Doctors have long been perceived as infallible heroes in many cultures, including our own (and that of the U.K. where Dr. Marsh works as a consulting neurosurgeon). Movies and television shows like Grey’s Anatomy and E.R. demonstrate our fascination with the ever-mysterious lives and works of the Gods of the O.R. I don’t think many would argue the possibility that we may have a slightly skewed perception of what actually goes on in hospitals and the lives of the folks who work in them. I know you’re thinking to yourself: “Wait, there ISN’T any spontaneous, choreographed song and dance?!” And I’m here as the bearer of bad news. There is no spontaneous, choreographed song and dance. I’m as shocked and appalled as you are. Turns out, doctors are actually human. Who knew! They have lives outside of their work; they have families and hobbies and quirks. They pay bills and face the frustrations of bureaucracy and systematic failure. They’re personally and familially susceptible to disease and death and they, just like their patients (the rest of us), sometimes make mistakes. *GASP* Luckily (or maybe not so much for those of us who prefer believing in the Doctors Can Do No Wrong theory), folks like Dr. Marsh are finding the graciousness and courage to tell it like it is. To share with us the real story of anatomy, emergencies, our twisted up healthcare system, the triumph of life and the inevitability of death. Marsh is confident and smart with an impressive talent for describing, simply and accessibly, his insanely complex work. But he is equally humble and openly shares his failures, mistakes, and frustrations. He’s genuine, and that makes him a pleasure to read. Even without the all the television style melodrama. So, long story short. Brains are cool, doctors are human, and one day we’re all going to die."
288,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/320372-lenny-husen,5,"I LOVED this and LOVED the narrator's voice. I listened to it in the car. The first disc contained the most suspenseful story I've heard/read in a long while--I was figuratively biting my nails in anxiety for how the surgery was going to turn out. I particularly love British English and every word was a delight. It was beautifully, elegantly, sensitively and warmly well-written.Neurosurgeon Henry Marsh has displaced Professor Robert Greenberg as the Number One Person whose hand I would love to shake, a list that also includes Atul Gawande, Paul Farmer, Abraham Verghese. Warning: this book isn't for someone who doesn't like the thought of blood (such as one of my brothers). Very graphic as far as surgery, terminal illness, death.What was harder to bear for me personally was the descriptions of Hospital Bed Control and the extremely irriting hospital administration's lack of respect and rules that served to impede work getting done--I could identify as I deal with this kind of thing daily as well and could commiserate. I laughed out loud at MAST (MANDATORY AND STATUTORY TRAINING) for Improved Customer Service that Mr. Marsh was forced to attend and had to leave to tell the anxious family of a patient that their loved one was going to die, and then to go back to the Training. Also I laughed and shouted in my car at the ""Best Password"" Marsh had to use to get into the Remote Radiology System in order to give the patient his prognosis about his brain tumour, where the difficulty getting into the system to review the film cost Mr. Marsh and the waiting patients 30 unnecessary minutes delay.Marsh describes cases that were tragic failures and those that were brilliant successes, both with grace, charm, humility. Who should listen to this book: Any doctor, anyone caring for a loved one or patient with a brain tumour, any one with an interest in Surgery or Medicine. Especially anyone interested in Neurosurgery, the Pinnacle of Medicine. Note: This is the third book I've read by a Neurosurgeon, and I no longer envy them, as I once did as a Pre-Med Student. It is not a life that my particular brain could lead with any success."

Try it, Hobbs—just poke his brain right where my finger is.” Marsh (an actual brain surgeon for Britain’s National Health Service), aka Dr. Reality Check, here manfully acknowledges the unreal level of trust that patients put in their doctors and also recognizes medicine’s inherent fallacy: “[i]f the operation succeeds the surgeon is a hero, but if it fails he is a villain.” Anecdotes illustrate “attempts, and occasional failures, to find a balance between the necessary detachment and compassion that a surgical career requires, a balance between hope and realism.” It’s a fairly upsetting, sometimes brutal, book to read. For example, the brain “…has the consistency of jelly” and Marsh’s simultaneous “fear and excitement” when he lets his “instruments sink into the brain or spinal cord” is unnerving. He admits to speaking with “false optimism” to a man with a tumor in his pineal gland (that’s way deep inside the brain, Chumley) and laments the young woman who “…had had a tumour in her spinal cord, between the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae” who “awoke from the operation paralysed down the right side of her body. I had probably tried to take out too much of the tumour,” he admits. Another chapter is all about a lecture he gives, titled “All My Worst Mistakes,” that puts Michael Jordan’s failure speech to shame. VERDICT Imagine the unimaginable—Marsh reveals a real person behind the mystique, one who is trying as mightily as he can to heal but who is all too aware of his errors.Find this review and others at Books for Dudes, the online reader's advisory column for men from Library Journal here.

I knew from the reviews that Do No Harm was something I should read, but the subject matter always put me off. After a long day of work, chasing kids, and being a responsible adult, it’s not always easy to sit down and read about death, or in this case brain surgery. And unsurprisingly the 'right-mood' window to attempt these types of books is both infrequent and fleeting. At least with Being Mortal I felt I was being forced to contemplate some of life’s most difficult questions, and if it wasn’t exactly enjoyable, at least it felt useful or productive, as it does whenever one finally faces up to doing something previously avoided. Do No Harm does not have the same redeeming features. First of all, it compels one to consider a pretty horrific subject, one that most people would normally try to great lengths to avoid. Then it makes matters worse by dwelling on the fallibility of the surgeon. If I was about to undergo a brain operation, I wouldn't want to know about my surgeon’s bad moods, mistakes, insecurities, tiredness or helplessness. But that's Henry Marsh. Excessively conscious and self-aware; honest to a fault, and superbly human - a gloriously Knausgardian figure. Full of complexities and contradictions, he's great company, and probably a great surgeon; although you come to realize from reading this book that greatness has its limitations when it comes to life and death matters. That's probably the most valuable lesson with both Do No Harm and Being Mortal - these books look you in the eye and tell you the truth. It may not be pretty, but it's realistic. And sometimes that's enough to warrant five stars. "
291,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145290-amy-qualls,3,"As someone who was married to someone who sustained a brain injury while I was married to him, I knew I would not have the easiest of relationships with this book. One of the supporting characters in this book -- asking questions, unsure whether to hope or fear -- could very easily have been me, if this book had been written at a different hospital.I've dealt with surgeons and other medical professionals with Marsh's mindset, and had an expectation of what his personality would be in this book. I was correct, and in that regard, this book was exactly what I expected. On the other hand, I was also a little bit disappointed; I think I was hoping for some level of additional insight by reading this book, and there was none for me. It's possible that my prior experience as the caregiver of a TBI survivor meant I'd already gained the insight Marsh hoped I'd receive as a reader of this book.I did find some comfort in one of the themes, though. From spending time watching families come and go in a neurological intensive care unit, I came away with the deep suspicion that many medical professionals perform overly heroic measures on brain injury patients in the name of prolonging life, without consideration to the quality of life they are prolonging. Dr. Marsh acknowledged this tendency and discussed it openly; his conclusions are quite similar to mine. Letting go is hard, unspeakably hard, but not every survival is a success story.The book's not for the faint of heart. If you're curious about the mindset of surgeons, or need closure after seeing a brain injury affect the life of someone you love, give it a try."
292,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie,5,"“Do no harm” is paraphrased in the Hippocratic Oath that medical students are all exposed to first thing. It’s the common principal in all medicine, but is especially stressed in neurosurgery, where the possibility for harm is so high. Henry Marsh has been a top neurosurgeon in Great Britain for many years and shares his stories of the trade here. Each chapter is named for and explores the treatment of a different neurological problem; meningioma, pituitary adenoma, infarct. Each chapter features a different patient; we see how the patient came to Marsh, how the operation went, and sometimes we see how they fared. Not always; sometimes they are whisked way back to the hospital that referred them, rather them leaving them under the care of the surgeon. So there are times that the author had no idea how they ultimately turned out. The descriptions of the problems and the way they are treated fascinated me, but beware if you are squeamish- the author describes things pretty vividly. But his book is not just about operations; it’s also about his own life, the about the NHS system in England. The system limits not just patient care but the hours doctors can work, which can make arranging long operations difficult. New doctors don’t have time enough to learn all they should. Marsh describes taking this out on nurses, anesthesiologists, clerks, and more- while an empathic, caring, man with patients, he seems to have been an ass to those he worked with at times- and admits it. I couldn’t put this book down. It was like reading a series of exciting stories, watching Marsh’s expertise and character grow. And I love a good medical description. "
293,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13141987-sunit,5,"""Every surgeon carries within himself a small cemetery, where from time to time he goes to pray- a place of bitterness and regret, where he must look for an explanation for his failures.""This book is an extremely frank memoir by Dr. Marsh, a world-renowned neurosurgeon in the UK. Some would say it is too frank with its graphic description of mistakes and of suffering. Each chapter is centered around a specific medical condition of the brain or the spinal cord and has details on the surgery and the recovery all beautifully wrapped around the human story. The book is at times sad when he talks about personal connections with patients and their lives and deaths, at times funny especially when he describes the detailed turd descriptions as part of record keeping and about botched computerization of the records, and at times political when he shows his disdain for the NHS and the management of medicine by bureaucrats. You manage to get into the head of a very conscientious doctor as he makes life or death decisions. There is also the frank admission that a lot of what happens in these surgeries comes down to luck. I walked away with a renewed appreciation and understanding of the complexity (or the knowledge of how much I do not know) of the human brain, the decisions and the aftermath that these extremely skilled surgeons have to live with and the thought process that goes into their interactions. If you have wondered how a doctor can seem so detached for something that can be life or death for you, this book will help you get closer to that answer. "
294,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6053755-audrey,5,"This book amazed me in a couple of ways. First, that a book subtitled ""Stories of Life, Death, and Brain Surgery"" could manage to be not only enjoyable, but somewhat uplifting. Second, that someone who has had a career in a field that seems utterly daunting to me can also write. Marsh's stories tell us not only that he is a gifted and compassionate surgeon but also a talented writer. As I noted when I first tried to begin reading ""Do No Harm"" a few days after recovering from a migraine, this is NOT a book for hypochondriacs or anyone who tends to adopt the symptoms of whatever they are reading about. Marsh writes candidly about what afflicts his patients (and, in some cases, himself and his family members). You'll need to be able to tolerate that to enjoy the book.He organizes each story around a particular diagnosis or anomaly (for example, ""Meningioma"" or ""Tic Doloreux"") which also names the chapter. We learn about his early training, difficult cases, and something of his personal life, as well as about the challenges and evolution of the U.K.'s National Health System during the more than 40 years of Marsh's career. The book's episodic structure contributes greatly to its readability. What might otherwise have been a ho-hum, ""first this happened, then this happened"" narrative becomes a powerful meditation on our common humanity, human fallibility, and some truly mind-blowing (no pun intended) insights into the human mind and brain."
295,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6390523-marco,5,"Illness is something that happens only to patients. This is an important lesson you learn early on as a medical student. You are suddenly exposed to a terrifying new world of illness and death, and you learn how terrible illnesses often start with quite trivial symptoms - blood on the toothbrush can mean leukaemia, a small lump in the neck might mean cancer, a previously unnoticed mole might be a malignant melanoma. Most medical students go trough a brief period when they develop all matter of imaginary illnesses - I myself had leukaemia for at least four days - until they learn, as a matter of self-preservation, that illnesses happen to patients, not to doctors. This necessary detachment from patients becomes all the greater when you start working as a junior doctor and you have to do frightening and unpleasant things to patients. It starts with simple blood-taking and inserting drips, and progresses over time - if you train as a surgeon - to ever more radical procedures, cutting and slicing into people's bodies. It would be impossible to do the work if you felt the patients' fear and suffering yourself. Besides, the increasing responsability that comes as you climb the career ladder brings greater anxiety that you will make a mistake and that patients will suffer. Patients become objects of fear as well as of sympathy. It is much easier to feel compassion for other people if you are not responsible for what happens to them."
296,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9281513-cheryl,4,"A fascinating dive into the world of neurosurgery. This one won't be for everyone as it can be stark and even brutal (who knew that they do some brain surgeries while the patient is awake and sitting up?). That said, the author, who is one of the U.K.'s foremost neurosurgeons, takes the reader behind the scenes. We feel like we are in the operating room with him. We are witness to absolutely amazing successes, and we join him as he explains to a patient that there is no hope. The book was given to me by my sister who lives in the U.K., and there are plenty of digs at the British NHS. However, Marsh balances the digs with witness to how a national health care system can provide not just adequate, but many times,quite remarkable care to those who might not otherwise be able to avail themselves of it. For American readers, it will provide pros and cons of a national health care system of which we need to be aware, as the issue of universal health care is definitely on the horizon for us. If you are not the queasy type, I highly recommend this book. I do have to say that at one point, I had to drop it as it became too dark. That may have been just where I was then, in my life, (especially given that I am an estate attorney and live in death's back yard), or it may be that sometimes one needs to take a break with a glass of wine and some good fiction. Obviously I picked it up again and am glad that I did."
297,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2999635-kaetrin,3,"3.5 stars.Not sure if it was the narrator that made the author sound like a bit of a jerk sometimes or if that's just actually the case. The medical stuff was great but I could do without moaning and whinging about managers and his (apparent) disrespect for work health and safety and any kind of bureaucracy. I get that it can be annoying but he also wouldn't be able to do his job without it. The apparent contempt with which he held the managers (non-medical) in the hospital was a bit mind-blowing. Again, not sure if it was in part a bad interpretation from the narrator - I heard Mr. Marsh interviewed on ABC's Conversations podcast and he sounded WAY nicer and far more personable. Perhaps some of it was written ironically? There was some of that ""doctors are superior and neurosurgeons are the most superior"" thing going on but he seemed both self-aware and self-deprecating about it (at least at times - from the text only - I couldn't tell that from the narrator's tone) that I decided to give that a pass.I didn't love the narration but as it was non-fiction I was mostly able to not let it get in the way. There were stupid pauses between tracks so the production wasn't the best (I borrowed the CDs from the library and imported them into iTunes - I suspect the download would be smoother but I'm not buying it to check).It was fascinating and also a little terrifying because: brain tumours are scary! Note to self: do not panic next time you get a headache. Argh."
298,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46238669-varun-padmanaban,5,"Marsh in this brilliant memoir of his life and surgical career expounds his errors and he does so in a manner where he explores how these errors has changed him, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. He speaks of his “small cemetery, where from time to time he goes to pray.” Importantly, he speaks with an aura of reckless honesty compared to the usually defensive surgeon’s emotions. Interestingly, he speaks of his daily anxiety – before surgery on the decision whether to operate or not, sometimes during the surgery he is – “oppressed by dread, almost a feeling of doom” and right before the surgery he is often seized by panic before entering flow – “fierce and happy concentration.” He speaks of the pain he feels for his patients whom are vegetative, curled up, alive yet unable to do anything. What he feels in speaking to their family and loved ones. He speaks of luck – even while he ids blamed for what goes wrong and praised for what goes right, and in the end he uses this luck to create his moral code: never lie to a patient, control how you feel by not letting your feelings add to a patients’ fear or unhappiness. In a fitting end, his last chapter, “Anesthesia dolorosa” speaks of a patient who can no longer feel pain in one of her facial nerves and he describes how this can sometimes be ironically painful. One is sometimes determined to feel as much as he can."
299,0297869876,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6893402-counsel182,5,"This is an amazing book. I stumbled upon Dr. Marsh while reading a New York Times Magazine article about him by Karl Ove Knausgaad that was equally fascinating (December 2015). In fact, about the only criticism I would have about ""Do No Harm"" is the first person narrative is at times too personal and shocking in all its splendid candor that I fear Dr. Marsh (my latest ""hero"") is opening himself up far too much. He is quite human and in neurosurgeons that is refreshing and self deprecating when he admits that his own surgeries have gone horribly wrong with dire consequences. Reading such candor here in the United States where such revelations can only lead to a minefield of litigation is amazing. Dr. Marsh also does not sugarcoat the pitfalls of the English ""socialized"" medical two-tier system which also makes this book a bit of a primer on what MUST be done here in the states to reform the silly health care system we currently have and the insane attempts to derail affordable care for all.But, getting back to Dr. Marsh and this exceptional book--I also had the very good fortune years ago to stumble across Dr. Richard Seltzer's ""Mortal Lessons: Notes on the Art of Surgery"" which was equally refreshing and amazing. I would hope Dr. Marsh and Dr. Seltzer would have at one time crossed paths. These amazing men give hope to the art and science of medicine. "
