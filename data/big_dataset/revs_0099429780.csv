0,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma,5,"It is very disappointing that this book does not have more ratings on this site - it is really, really underrated.I became a fan of Desmond Morris after reading The Human Zoo: A Zoologist's Study of the Urban Animal; an admiration which increased after I read his other books. Anthropology has the criticism raised against it that it is a shallow science. I don't know about that. But I would say it is damn interesting.In this book, Dr. Morris gives us tips on interpreting human behaviour - and I can tell you from experience that's it's a rewarding hobby. I still remember him describing the hand actions of public speakers, and what the body language signifies: I have applied it to political speeches on TV with great effect. Another chapter of interest was on the interpretation of a couple's stage in the pair-bonding process based on the physical intimacy they displayed in public.This book has plenty of photographs and is a worthy addition to any library. I don't know whether it's still in print - if it is, I would advise all and sundry to grab a copy post-haste."
1,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7118702-loy-machedo,5,"Desmond John Morris – The zoologist, ethologist, anthropologist, painter, television presenter and author, is in my opinion without a doubt one of the world’s best observer, teachers and mentors for anyone who wants to break down, classify and understand the human species. His book ‘People Watching’ which is a revised, enlarged and expanded version of the 1977 version ‘Man-watching’ is a biblical collection of actions, gestures and physical expressions adopted by people on our planet. What makes this massive 490 paged mammoth collection of data so amazing is the detail to which the author has gone to deliver his goods – the diagrams, the photographs, the examples, the explanation, the content, the etymology of the expression and its derivatives, the cultural differences to every single gesture, posture or non-verbal communication and yes the reasons behind the reason. Everything from Resting Behavior, Body Adornments, Pupil Signals, Territorial Behavior, Non-Verbal Leakage, Contradictory signals, Salutation Displays, Sporting Behavior, Signals of Threat, Barriers and Salutation – Desmond Morris has shown through this book how much we think we know to the infinite possibilities of how we truly do not. An absolute and timeless classic that will stand the test of time and in my eyes, always and forever a perfect book.Overall Rating – 10 out of 10. "
2,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5808847-katarina,2, Peoplewatching is a good introduction to the study of human behaviour. Desmond Morris writes as a zoologist studying a species he happens to be particularly fond of. He avoids complex arguments and instead outlines the theories which trace the geneses of modern behaviours. I gave this book two stars because I didn't gain any practical or usable knowledge from it. Morris does openly state in his introduction that this book is best suited to those who wish merely to observe- and not to manipulate- human behaviour.
3,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51454575-nick-davies,4,"I only realised/recalled when adding this to my TBR list that I had in fact previously read a different edition of the same book twenty years ago. This didn't detract from my enjoyment of this, however, it was an interesting and insightful study of human beaviour and a good anthropology/sociology 'primer' in this area.Desmond Morris discusses numerous examples of human behaviour, focussing particularly on gestures and body language, and makes interesting contrast/comparison between different ages and cultures to pick out aspects of 'universal' human behaviour as well as those more culturally determined. There were plenty of quirky new bits of learning, and the very approachable style lent it's self well to the non-expert reader.It did towards the end become a little repetitive, however, to the extent that by the final third I was thinking 'I could have guessed that was the case from what you already told us' at times. I was also left with the sense that it had dated slightly from when it was written in the late 1970s - which added a curious sense of doubt to some of Morris's claims of universal and lasting behaviours now proven to be less important (and the absence of things which he did not predict). "
4,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069403-abby,5,"This is a really cool book. Desmond Morris ROCKS. He's a zoologist who has written lots of books studying the human being as an animal. So like, why do people act the way they do? Is it because we are an advanced amazing species (perhaps), or because we are acting on animal like instincts?If you like to sit and watch people walk by in crowded places (who doesn't?!) this is that sort of interesting book. You learn about body language, postural echoing, and... something else I was going to write there until my husband interrupted me and I lost my train of thought.Anyways, all of his books are awesome. He's so freaking awesome. You would not believe how fascinating it is to read this guys' books and then notice yourself doing things he talks about. You'll be walking around saying ""Oh my gosh! I'm folding my arms because the person I'm sitting next to is folding his, JUST LIKE HE SAID PEOPLE DO IN THE BOOK, and I have never noticed before that I do that!!"" It's freaky and awesome."
5,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52771744-gautam-soman,3," The book is about human actions, how actions become gestures, and how gestures transmit non-verbal messages. In short, the book is about the ""Body Language."" In a clear, lucid way, the author describes a whole range of our day-to day actions, gestures, movements, signs & signals-- most of which we perform sub-consciously. He explains how people from different communities behave in public and in private, and also analyzes the fundamental patterns that govern typical actions-reactions. Packed with almost a hundred diagrams, sketches and photographs, the book makes us aware of the fact that as a species we may have advanced technologically, but we have not yet entirely shed our 'animal' traits of being bodily active. After reading this book, a big change has come over me. Now whenever I meet a person, my attention gets focused on firmness and duration of the shake-hand, the way he is folding his hands, distance between his legs, body tension, inclination of his head, the number of times he scratches his head or touches his nose, whether he gives a hearty laughter or a political smile, and such bizarre details. So if anyone among you happens to meet me (I very much doubt this), do not feel uneasy. I am just putting the theory into practice, ha!"
6,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89691797-circul-wyrd,5,"If you've watched the TV series ""Lie to Me"", I think this book was pretty much their playbook. It is just as the title suggests. Sometimes I feel that making too much of a study of our signaling behaviours as a species quickly gets into the realm of TMI (did I really want to know that?), but at the same time it is fascinating. We are, actually, a primate species, and just like one can observe our next-door species' behaviour and know something about what they are signalling, so can we do with ourselves. Actually it applies to farther away species as well. For example, a bear that is not going to charge will act large and bluff aggressively, but when one really means business, there is none of that: The head goes down, the ears lie low, the mouth is closed. One of the more interesting things about this book is that we share some of these kinds of traits with other further away species: some things are more universal than we realize. I think a lot of us know some of these things at some subliminal level even if we don't make a study of them, but no matter how good your instincts are, there is probably something you can learn in this book. It is sometimes said that those who learn too much about these kinds of things are at the risk of using them opportunistically to seek advantage. It may be true, but no more true than most other kinds of knowledge that can be used or misused. Probably nowhere is this type of misuse more prevalent than in advertising and from that standpoint, having knowledge of it may also help one protect oneself against those who would manipulate the various ways we signal to one another."
7,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110044027-nikita-singh,5,"A very interesting book. Extremely insightful. And the best part is that it lends insight and highlights the root of the most trivial things around us and which are part of us. A simple act of nodding has so much history behind it. Clothes are layered with contexts and meanings and past. A thumbs up, or a face palm that we use so unthinkingly are all inheritances from our ancient ancestors. Must read book! And the pictures along with text are the wonderful bonus."
8,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47716012-denise-connolly-connolly,5,"Really interesting book, read staggered and intermittently and can read chapters out of sync when fully engaged to gain valuable knowledge of universal human body language. So many things in this book I never would have realized until the writer describes i.e. the mannerisms, group dynamics, nationalities, age, relationships, non verbal interactions, how people lie and their tells and everything else imaginable in body language. Have gone back to this book repeatedly over the last few years and still picking up information that I missed last time around. One to keep for sure."
9,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19931113-colin-pearce,5,"Before the motivational speaker with his and her pretence of knowing body language, before Joe Braysich, before Allan Pease, (before me!) there was the scientist and ever so clever Desmond Morris, anthropologist, biologist, zoo-ologist, writer and artist.You have to take your hat off to someone who dedicated his time and studies to helping us get on with each other, understand each other and to stop looking and acting like apes."
10,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51454575-nick-davies,3,"This felt very much like a TV series tie-in (which I assume it was) and wasn't necessarily particularly 'in depth', but Morris did make this a very approachable introduction to sociology - talking about cultural differences, gender differences, and a variety of other areas in the context of subtle signals and gestures etc. that we all do subconsciously as social animals. Interesting stuff, but only a primer to the subject."
11,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18140123-isla,0,"Recommended to me by my friend Rich, I hope this book will give me better insight into reading cues on people's movements and enhancing my knowledge on non verbal communication. I'm going to put it on my deaf studies shelf with the books I've read while aspiring to my dream and my career. Body language is one of the most important aspects of communication with the Deaf. So thanks Rich for the recommendation! "
12,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2049167-angie,5,"One of my favourite books on the behaviour of the human animal. The best section for me was the chapter on religion, which explained to my 13 year old mind (the first time I read the book) why man invented religion. I borrowed the original version from the library, and purchased this version a few years later."
13,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16879983-kathy-doll,4,Exhaustive study of human body language. Who knew there were so many gestures in common between distant cultures. A super interesting and informative read. I will have to re-read sometime again.
14,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56710716-susan-chow-dukhan,2,"One would think that a field guide to human behaviour would not become outdated, but unfortunately this is not the case with Manwatching. Published in 1977, some of the descriptions and explanations provided by Desmond Morris leaves you wishing for an updated version of the book, since there is so much interesting information provided.While the section on action remains strong, the examination of gestures appear to have suffered the most. Due to the number of conflicting gestures attributed to different countries, regions and cultures, the author is presenting his speculations on the origins of some gestures, which could be contradicted by another author. Some of the gestures described are no longer commonly used, although they would have been used decades ago.While we have all been exposed to the idea that man was the original hunter, while the female was the food gatherer, it is a bit insulting that the author still describes that present day man in the role of the hunter as he is still providing for his family by going to work and chasing after solutions and contracts. The physical exertions of hunting can be found in sporting activities. The present day woman is still the food gather, as she hunts for food in the grocery stores. When women and children engage in sports, it is considered to be a popular pastime. If women currently have a more active role in the business world and sports, does that mean that the perception of the evolution of man as a hunter may be flawed? For those readers who are open to different possibilities, I would suggest they read the Descent of Women by Elaine Morgan. This book suggests the equal role of women in human evolution. "
15,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76924506-aashish,4,"TL;DR Great book about human body language. Bit sciency, not my taste. Still enjoyed reading the mammoth sized book. Took a while as I prefer fiction. Would recommend. 4-6/10.As a kid I enjoyed reading textbooks and devouring information that almost seemed useless, yet lo and behold: here I was reading what could really pass as a university level textbook again.But this time, the book was about me.Let me clarify, Peoplewatching is more a book about the detailed history, and study of human behavior, movement, and most importantly play. You can read the book for yourself to dive into chapters that detail the evolutionary traits that humans exhibit in our everyday activities and hobbies. What caught my attention is that this book is exactly what the title is about.Peoplewatching is a book for those of us who find themselves surprised that we can somehow “read the air” of a room, those who know when someone is lying, or just those of us who are interested in finding out why there are so many displays of human body language.I didn’t rate the book out of my enjoyment of it, rather the information I pulled. There are some parts where the age of the text does show, and in some cases as a guy myself I felt at odds with some of the selections in the book. That being said, the book itself is a novel of information that details most of what we can understand about human body language."
16,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565673-nicholas-whyte,3,"https://nwhyte.livejournal.com/2899217.htmlIt's the 2002 update of the 1977 book Manwatching: A Field Guide to Human Behaviour; Morris grumbles a bit about having to change the title in these new times, but then he gets on with the serious business of looking at different things that we do with our bodies to for specific non-verbal communications - 488 pages worth, with loads of diagrams. To be honest, I found it entertaining rather than enlightening; there is no over-arching theory other than that it pays to pay attention to what people are doing as well as saying. It is interesting to see how some gestures can mean quite different things in different countries - in some places the beckoning gesture that I use, moving my hand towards me, actually means ""go away""; my daughter's habit of telling us not to bother her by pushing her open hand towards us is amusing here but extremely rude in Greece."

18,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55334178-c,5,"An incredibly detailed yet very readable analysis of all aspects of human behavior.

Aprite la mano destra, concentrate il vostro pensiero nel suo centro, poi dolcemente, lentamente, ripiegate le dita ponendo tutta la vostra attenzione in quel movimento finché avrete chiuso il pugno. ..Fermatevi un istante e concentrate la vostra energia nel pugno, poi lentamente, dischiudete le dita e riaprite la mano… Fate questo esercizio mettendoci tutta la vostra consapevolezza, e vedrete che a poco a poco raggiungerete un grande controllo dei vostri gesti. Basta che facciate questo esercizio una sola volta, non diverrete più forti facendolo venti volte di seguito, ma fatelo ogni giorno, e come si deve.—“Control of our gestures starts with awareness. Here is anexercise that is very simple but very valuable. Open your righthand, concentrate your thoughts on the centre of your palm, thengently and slowly fold your fingers in, focusing all yourattention on this movement until you have closed your fist. Stopfor a moment and concentrate your energy in your fist, thenslowly unfold your fingers and open your hand…Put all your awareness into this exercise; you will see that youwill gradually achieve great mastery over your gestures.

27,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23951980-oskar-garibaldi,4,"I wish I had access to this book when I was much younger. I probably could've made enemies into friends and salvaged a few wrecked relationship having known how similar humans are. Body language can be painfully obvious depending on the context, but catching and understanding the subtle messages we are unconsciously projecting is not something easily learned. This book is vital for people living in this present day (2018). We are at the peak of our communication capabilities but use them to pit our ideologies against each other. If we look past the demonized ideology of the opposite tribe, we can see that there are also shared layers of urges, insecurities and hangups burned into permanence by events either in their lifetime or throughout the development of our species or of terrestrial life itself. I enjoyed his recurring theme of neoteny as a source of our ""adult"" behaviors and I've never been closer in my life to believing the Aquatic Ape Theory. Based on the evidence he presents (which I did not bother to check against the current scientific zeitgeist), I wouldn't reach as far as some of his conclusions do. The book was a bit dry at some points and the good selection of photos helped to push me forward."
28,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13408775-shubhadeep-roychowdhury,4,"This book takes a different flight altogether about the way we unknowingly express our inner self while interacting. The way Mr. Morris explained and ""Trained"" the readers to ""read"" body languages of human being is very good. If you are a student or a simple enthusiast of Behavioral Science then you would love to read the book. You may not agree with some of his ideas and sometimes they may look as far fetched but overall this book will give you a nice introduction about the field of study. One word of caution: after reading this book you may find that you are able to decipher a lot of unconscious gestures of human while they are talking with you and you may become judgmental based on the assumptions you make. Please make it sure that Human are not only the gestures they make, because most of the time it is not even known to them. If you really want to understand them try to ""read"" their minds too. That is important also. "

It was a bit boring in places but it's nice to obtain some new information, although you truthfully you can probably successfully read a lot of peoples' body language as it is."
65,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5867557-teamhair,5,What a fascinating book! Morris is such an engaging writer about people and their behaviour and this made this book a pleasure to read from cover to cover. Morris looks at a range of human behaviours and explains their emergence and common usage. This book is a must read for anyone who has an interest in understanding why we do what we do.
66,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5919166-lester,4,"Although not for the faint hearted, this book is an eye-opener, even today. Morris is an incredibly observant anthropologist, and I found the occasional dally into the chapters extremely interesting.

167,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5867557-teamhair,5,What a fascinating book! Morris is such an engaging writer about people and their behaviour and this made this book a pleasure to read from cover to cover. Morris looks at a range of human behaviours and explains their emergence and common usage. This book is a must read for anyone who has an interest in understanding why we do what we do.
168,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5919166-lester,4,"Although not for the faint hearted, this book is an eye-opener, even today. Morris is an incredibly observant anthropologist, and I found the occasional dally into the chapters extremely interesting. It would be fabulous as a less detailed coffee-table book interspersed with more pictures as examples."

I finally got around to seeing what all the fuss was about. This book is great, even if you don't have time to read it, it's fun to look at all the pics."
170,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12629162-alice-doherty,5,So interesting! Found it hard to put down and I've even started to apply some of its methods to my people watching. Would definitely recommend this book as you will learn a great deal about human behaviour. 
171,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64437570-corina-leth,4,"A lot of explaining of not only our body language, but of everything human of behavior ...from why men shave, why we don't want to sit in the middle of a restaurant eating blue food. Some seem to be hypothetical guessing, but much is interesting. "
172,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1084968-jay,3,"Morris had an interesting viewpoint, an anthropologist who first studied animal behaviour, then discovered all kinds of similarities in humans. Fascinating read."
173,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1354397-brett,4,"Amazing book about human behavior. Amazing Reference for actors or animators, or anyone who cares about human behaviors, bodylanguage, etc. blah blah."
174,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/631088-fes,0,Only a few pages into it. Very interesting. This is definitely a great reference reading as an animator. Makes you do double takes at body language and human behavior.
175,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4176122-stuart-aken,3,"Fascinating, if slightly flawed ( he takes the usual andocentric route for evolutionary change, largely ignoring the role of the female in our rise from animal to human)."
176,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5955091-mashinito,3,Very useful and curoius
177,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9656231-maya-dellor,4,This is a fun coffee-table took to read in small doses. Interesting outlook that makes sense when you read it.
178,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5953152-chris,4,"This book really makes you think differently about your own actions and those of others, a bit tiresome in places but all in all a pretty good read."

180,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16941199-cigdem-tok,5,ıt is very perfect book
181,0099429780,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5105209-nikos-karagiannakis,5,There are so many aspects of human behaviour and body language that I couldn't imagine where they originate from. This book made it all clear to me. A superb read.
