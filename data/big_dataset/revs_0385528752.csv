0,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4326184-kerrilee,5,"I'll be interested to see if this book is still relevant in 10 years, as the influence of books like this often come and go. In the meantime, though, my brain just won't stop incorporating elements from it into how I'm thinking about current events in my life.I was already inclined to believe the validity of the structure that the Heaths outline because I've practiced some of it already without using the same words--most especially Shaping the Path, as I give a lot of thought to the environment of my preschool classroom (an example: want your students to stop running from one end of the room to the other? Rearrange the furniture so they can't run in a straight line). The environment absolutely makes a difference in behavior.Parsing the elements involved in a successful campaign for change makes me feel more equipped to do that in other contexts. So while this book is a great tool to use to work towards your goals, I think it remains important to choose your goals carefully as you enact some of the Heaths' advice; they actually unintentionally provide a really great example in talking about BP. BP made it a goal in the early 90's to have ""no dry holes"" when they drilled, in effect attempting to reduce their non-productive drilling efforts to zero. But obviously, somewhere along the way to meeting that very ambitious goal, they also threw safety by the wayside and we saw the effects mere months after Switch was published. BP did an incredible job working towards its goal, but simultaneously, it misplaced its priorities to a disastrous degree. This, too, is something to keep in mind when creating change."
1,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"I really quite enjoyed this book. It was one of those books that had me talking to people about it before I finish reading it. In fact, if any of my M Teach friends are reading this – you probably want to get your hands on a copy of it, as it has some really interesting things to say about how to motivate students.I’ve read another of their books – Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die – which was also particularly good and based on an idea in Gladwell’s book The Tipping Point. I thought when I read that book that it also had many things to tell people who want to teach. Essentially, they get all of the more recent research in psychology and behavioural economics and give interesting case studies that illuminate the importance of these studies. They also fit them into fairly easy to understand structures and metaphors and I think this forms the most interesting part of their work. They base much of this book around a metaphor from a book called The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom. That metaphor is of the elephant and the rider. The idea being much the same as Plato’s metaphor of the charioteer from The Republic (yes, some of this stuff has been vexing thinkers for quite some time). To be honest, I prefer the elephant metaphor to that of the two horses and a rider that Plato develops. The elephant is our emotional selves and the rider our rational self. Ever wondered why you can know that it makes sense to give up smoking and yet still not give up? To Plato that just means that you don’t really know – you simply would never do anything bad if you truly knew you were doing a bad thing. This has always been the bit of Plato that has sounded like nonsense to me. As a lapsed smoker for years, while I smoked, I knew and was ashamed of the fact that I smoked. I hated the idea that I was doing something that was so clearly stupid and self-destructive and would have done everything in my power to hide the fact that I smoked. But that didn’t mean I could give up. Giving up smoking was utterly impossible. My rider was utterly convincedI needed to stop, it was just that my elephant had a hell of a lot more will-power than my rider. Think of a rider on an elephant – he needs to exert a lot of will power to keep the elephant doing what he wants it to do, and that drains the rider to the point where he needs to sleep. But the elephant just keeps plodding on, knowing that eventually you will need to sleep, you will need to think about something else and when you do he will go in the direction he was planning to go all along.They discuss an interesting study where people were asked to sit in a room alone with a plate of freshly cooked biscuits. They were then asked to do some boring maths and the people who were not allowed to eat the biscuits did fewer maths problems and for less time then those who could eat the biscuits. The point being that we have a limited amount of 'will-power' and it is easily used up. This seems to me to be an incredibly important thing to know about ourselves.For years I tried to give up smoking, but then I would have a drink or be at a party or something awful would happen during the day or I would just be sitting around with no particular excuse at all and suddenly I would think, ‘oh God, I would kill for a cigarette’ and then I would be smoking again and that would be that. I have only been able to stay off cigarettes by learning to despise them. Now I hate the smell of them, I hate the taste of them, I hate just about everything about them. Revulsion is an elephant, rather than rider, concern and so I’ve used that to negate the other elephant issues that had been dragging me back to cigarettes previously.This book says that if you are going to make any kind of change you need to consider three fundamental conditions – the elephant, the rider and the path – all of these can be manipulated and all of them should be manipulated to make change as easy as possible.Directing the rider is very important, as the rider tends to be overly analytical and negative. There was a lovely quote I saw in a New Scientist article once by a mathematician, ‘any problem can be made to look unsolvable’. They offer the best advice I can think of – if you are seeking to make change you should see what is working and then see what you need to do to replicate that. Often people think they need to be the guru with new and surprising insights no one else has ever had. But often the seeds of what needs to change are already spread around, and you just need to tend them.The elephant needs careful consideration. However, without getting the elephant on board (so to speak) change is going to be impossible. There is some lovely discussion here about diets and why they often don’t work that explains the elephant problem beautifully. I think the main lesson from a lot of this section for me was to remember that we are social animals and that we want to be seen as that and not stand out. Normalising change was very important. Although, really this change the culture theme is the main lesson from their ‘shape the path’ section of the book. There is a lot of nice stuff about how you achieve this. There was an interesting part on drug use in the US military during the Vietnam war, for example, and the fact that when people came home to the US they tended to stop their excessive drug use. That is, the culture of life in US cities simply did not tolerate or sustain heavy drug use in ways that life in Vietnam did. Therefore, if you are seeking to make changes you should look very closely at how you can address the cultural issues that are potentially undermining that change. I had heard many of the examples used in this book before – the ten-thousand lives campaign, for example, although it was better explained here – but they did put interesting spins on even the things I had heard about before.There is a lot of excellent advice in this book about how to bring about change in both your own life and in your workplace and so on. There are excellent examples of how people have applied the strategies discussed and how these simple changes have made differences in what they have been seeking to achieve. I think the best of this book is that many of the interventions suggested are minimal and yet still highly effective. We tend to want to fix everything at once – but as the authors repeatedly point out, the rider is more than happy to find a thousand reasons to do nothing and to fixate on the 'true but useless' facts that tend to undermine change. The point is to find ways to see what can work (which is normally what is already working somewhere) and to replicate that.I really liked the metaphor of the rider, elephant and path developed in this book and think, for that alone, this book is worth reading. It is also worth reading for many of the insights it provides in motivating change. This was really well worth the read."

Author's have structured it in the following format: Three main parts each one being a critical element of change. Each part then is consisted of submodules i.e. different ways of reaching the corresponding element and each submodule is backed up with numerous real world stories on how the element being discussed is put into practice and how it's lead into a snowball of change. Aw, and this book has also some exercise to put your takeaways into test. :DA remarkable fact about the book which is vivid in the real stories provided throughout the book is the consistency and integrity of the ""framework of change"" they're teaching. In each story, they provide you can see all the three elements perfectly at work. So what are these lovely elements?The content Authors have identified three major elements required in any environment to initiate and support a lasting and effective change which are:I. Directing the Rider: Which deals with the thinking part of human brainII. Motivating the Elephant: Which tackles issues regarding our emotional brainIII. Shaping the path: Which is about the environment, influencing our behavior.There's an analogy used through out the book regarding our rational and emotional part. The part of our brain which makes us human is referred to a rider sitting on an elephant which stands for our huge emotional part. Our limbic brain, our subconscious mind or the emotional part of our brain is so strong and compelling that in terms of strength looks like an elephant to our logical part of the brain (rider). Now let's start with an illuminating quote which in spite of seeming obvious is often neglected:All change efforts have something in common: for any thing to change, someone has to start acting differentlyIn this vain, my all time favorite teacher, Jim Rohn says:If you change, everything will change for you.How to change?Rider and the Elephant elementsIn essence, if you want to change things, you've got to appeal to both rider (logical brain) and elephant (emotional brain). The rider provides planning and direction while the elephant provides energy and motivation. If you reach riders of your team but not the Elephants, members will have understanding without motivation. And i you reach their Elephants but not riders, they'll have passion without direction. In each case all attempt for change all doomed to failure. An strong barrier to change is that the mind and the heart often disagree. What looks like laziness is often exhustion.The Situation ElementResearch strongly shows that our environment and situations, drastically influence our behavior. For instance studies shows the bigger our food containers, the more we eat and vice versa. Hence:What looks like a people problem is often a situation (path) problem. Now let's see how we can come up with best strategies to direct the rider, motivate the elephant and shape the path.I. Directing the Rider:1. Find the Bright Spots: To be precise and short, in every terrible situation if you look closely enough, you'll find people that are getting results. Finding bright spots is identifying the cases, people that are getting results in spite of the bad circumstances and teach others the strategies these bright spots are utilizing.This approach in psychology is referred to as Solutions-focused therapy. Focusing on what's worked so far instead of the ""whys"" behind problems.For instance: a specific product of company sells very low, but meanwhile you see some sales persons having high success rate in selling that very product. You must find out how their techniques and teach them to others.In Essence: Instead of asking what's broken and how we can fix it, ask: What's working and how we can do more of it.2. Script the critical Move: Change is often hard, and ambiguity makes it also terrifying. Any successful change requires a translation of ambiguous goals into concrete behaviors. In short, to make a switch, you need to script the critical moves. For instance: Asking someone to eath more healthy is too general, you must define them a precise diet plan to break their resistance.In Essence: Clarity dissolves resistance.3. Point To The Destination: In short, we want what we might call a destination postcard, a vivid picture from the near-term future that show what could be possible. Having a clear perspective gives feedback to people on ho get lost in analysis.w close they are to their desire objective. When you describe a compelling destination, you're helping to correct one of the rider's great weaknesses, the tendency to get lost in analysis.4. Black & White goals: Destination postcards is effective if they motivate the employees. What if they're not. In such cases you must define an absolute goal. For instance: When planning you're new year's resolution, ""Being healthier"" is ambiguous, instead if you change it to ""Gym Every Single Day"" or even ""No More Cheese Cake"", then you leave no room for rationalization. In Essence: When you are at the beginning of a change, don't obsess about the middle, because the middle is going to look different when you get there; instead, Look for a strong beginning and a strong ending and get moving.To Be Continued ..."
3,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266234-7jane,4,"This is a book that's best read after you have read 1-3ish good self-help books (say, Baumeister's ""Willpower"", Duhigg's ""The Power Of Habit"" and Keller's ""The One Thing"" for example), and yet feel you need something like 'cherry on top'.This book teaches one how make a change through the image of a rider, directing an elephant, on a path from A to B. The rider is the rational (sometimes procrastinating and over-researching) mind, the elephant the emotional (sometimes out-of-control) mind, and the path is shaping the situation (badly done may freak the two previous parts and make things complicated). The points are gathered on one simple page at the end but you really benefit from making notes since it doesn't got much in depth. When I made notes I did gather more than what that page says, but happily also noticed that you don't have to write much - unlike in some other cases. There is plenty of examples that pad things nicely, though if you don't want the padding it might feel annoying a bit.But it's a fairly quick read, the examples are good and the writers' attitude is likeable (truly, if the writer(s) show bothering attitude, reading the book can become harder).So, a good 'last' self-help book with a light-hearted real-life example cushioning. *nods* :)"
4,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1109713-reid,5,"I understand the perspective of the haters: this book is broad and over-simplifies a really complex topic. I understand, haters, but I don't agree. I love the Heaths' writing precisely because they keep things simple. Their premise that inspiring change requires you to speak to both the brain's logical, rational side as well as its emotional side isn't headline news, but they present it using a simple metaphor (Rider, Elephant, and Path) that makes it easy to grasp and (more important) easy to remember. I particularly liked the breadth of case studies cited, from principals facing impossible odds to attempted procurement reforms to preventing the spread of AIDS in Tanzania. The 'clinic' sections at the end of each section are also great tools to provoke engagement with the reader.I found it funny how many themes from other books I've read make guest-appearances here. For instance, the emphasis on the powerful psychology of ""quick wins"" (Ramit Sethi), decision paralysis (Barry Schwartz), the power of a checklist (Atul Gawande), or the importance of ""What's the Next Action?"" (David Allen)."
5,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,5,"Another must read from the Heath Brothers-This is another invaluable book packed with extremely useful information. True to the theme of their earlier book, they help make all the concepts stick by hammering them in over and over: Direct the Rider, Motivate the Elephant, and Shape the Path.For any change to occur, you must have a good reason, a good motivation, and a good environment. The rider is the rational side of you, the elephant, your emotional side, and the path, your environment.To direct the rider means to have compelling reasons to do something. In doing so, you can do three things: 1) Find the bright spot; 2) script the critical moves; and 3) point to the destination. Finding the bright spot requires to you to shift through your past experience and find instances in which something was working for you - be it feeling not depressed, going a full day not drinking, or having fun learning - and analyze them so that you can do more of them. Scripting the critical moves means you have to give detailed instructions, because when you tell someone in abstract terms such as, ""be healthy,"" ""eat less,"" they can mean so many things that people don't know what to do. Telling them, ""buy 1% milk,"" is specific enough that they can follow the instruction easily.Finally, pointing to the destination means you have to show people where you're going and why it's worth going there. To motivate the elephant, you can: 1) find the feeling; 2) shrink the change; and 3) grow the people. Finding the feeling just means making people feel something - fear, compassion, indignity, absurdity, anything. And this ties nicely with the concept from their previous book: Emotion and making people care. Showing an individual's plight - a mother who lost her daughter because of some medical error that could've been prevented - makes people care.Shrinking the change means simply that you break down the change into manageable size. So instead of saying, ""clean your whole room!"" - a daunting task for messy people - it helps to shrink the task by saying, ""Just clean the room for five minutes, that's all."" As soon as the elephant gets going, it keeps going and going - the five minutes becomes thirty minutes, and when you come to, voila, the room is clean!Growing the people has two components: 1) cultivating an identity; and 2) instilling the growth mindset. People have two different ways of thinking: individual thinking and group thinking. The former considers things based on one's self-interest while the latter does so based on one's identity, or the group they associate with. As an individual, any monetary gain is a plus, but if you were, say, a doctor, you might not consider money the end-all and might even reject it if it contradicts with your concept of being a doctor.As Carol Dweck's seminal book, Mindset: the New Psychology of Success explains, there are two different kinds of mindsets: fixed and growth. The former believes human abilities are fixed ""talents"" while the latter believes they can be cultivated through effort. To be able to change, it's almost a requirement to have the latter mindset especially because change is often very difficult.Finally, shaping the path has three components: 1) tweak the environment; 2) build habits; and 3) rally the herd.Tweaking the environment means arranging things around you so that it becomes easier to do one thing over another. For example, if you have a perennial problem of obsessively checking your email, it might help you to shut down your Outlook or whatever email program you have, mute the PING! noise whenever an email arrives in your inbox, or physically hide the pop-out notice on the screen with post-its. When my obsession with checking certain websites took over my life, I used Leechblock on Firefox to forbid myself to go there. And it works.Building habits frees the elephant because you do it almost automatically. Some of the techniques introduced here include ""action triggers"" and checklists. Action triggers are a way of ""pre-loading"" decisions by deciding the sequence of actions you'll take so that you don't have to think while going through them. For example, you can say, ""I'll call the office right after dinner tonight."" The ""trigger"" in this case is ""right after dinner."" In other words, when you finish eating, you don't have to think or decide to call the office anymore; the decision has already been made beforehand.People always forget something. Worse yet, they are overconfident about their abilities in general. So having a checklist minimizes possible errors - which we commit by default for being human - and thwart overconfidence.Finally, rallying the herd. This concept is based on the belief that behavior is contagious and you can help it spread by using social pressure, social proof, and free spaces. A good technique that applies social pressure effectively is stand-up meetings. By making everyone stand up, it cuts a lot of excess talk as people start to fidget and send the signal that someone's talking too long.Social proof. A hotel that had a sign, ""A majority of our guests reuse towels"" made more likely for guests to reuse their towels.Having spaces for people to talk and hang out is a must for uniting them and rallying them. A hospital that had a lounge for people to talk about possible changes actually adopted them while a hospital that didn't have such a place didn't.A must read."
6,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1654645-deb-readerbuzz-nance,4,"Let me sum this book up: To change behavior, you must do three things. One, you must change the person’s behavior. Two and three, you must change the person’s hearts and minds. The authors use the analogy of an Elephant and his Rider. The Rider is your logical brain. The Elephant is your heart. To get the elephant to move, you must engage both the Rider and the Elephant. So, to put it another way, to change behavior, you must Direct the Rider (provide clear direction), Motivate the Elephant (engage people’s emotions), and Shape the Path (create the best environment).Here are some more ideas from the book. Keep the Rider (one’s mind) busy analyzing why things work well. Ask what small changes can be made to make things work better. The hardest part of change is in the details. What looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity. Set what Built to Last authors call a BHAG, a Big Hairy Audacious Goal, a goal that hits you in the gut and motivates you, a destination postcard, pictures of a future that hard work can make possible. When it is time to change behavior, our first instinct is to teach them something. Instead, we need to appeal to the heart. If you need quick action, negative emotions might help, but most of the time, it’s not a stone-in-the-shoe situation and we need to encourage play, open minds, creativity, and hope. Go ahead and give two stamps toward the goal on the Loyalty Card, what the authors call Shrink the Change, build by providing an early small win. Small targets lead to small victories. Grow your people. Lock your people into identifying with being a great person. Tweak the environment. Create specific action triggers. Build habits. Use the humble checklist."
7,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3095704-stephen,4,"This is an excellent book on how to enact change and the mechanics behind that. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to change something in their personal life or within their working environment. I was able to get a good understanding of the interplay and motivation of the two competing brain types which Chip coined the Rider ( Rational ) and the Elephant ( Emotional ). He then breaks it down to these sections.Direct the Rider- Follow the bright spots- Script the Critical Moves - Point to a desired destinationMotivate the Elephant- Shrinking the Change - Growing your People Shape the Path - Tweak the Environment- Build Habits- Rally the Herd A concept that I found intriguing is the Fundamental Attribution Error. Its a tendency that people/society have to squarely blame peoples behavior than to look at the situation they are in. Which is the easy way out. What I really enjoyed about this book, is how clearly and straight forward his examples are. Repeat with me! Direct the Rider, Motivate the Elephant, and Shape the Path. "
8,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/804677-rachael,5,"EMOTIONAL SELF=ELEPHANT- It wants things now, easy, It is usually the ""emotional self"" that usually causes us to fail, because it usually doesn't want to make the short term sacrifices for long term payoffs. It can also have enormous strengths like love compassion and sympathy. RATIONAL SELF=RIDER It analyzes and decides what to do. The rider is to direct the elephant where to go. If the rider can't get the elephant to go where it wants. (You overeat, or sleep in) the elephant went against the rider. The problem with the rider, is it can over think things, spin her wheels and not make a decision of where to go. The trick to making changes, is to appeal to both, the emotional side and the rational side. A reluctant elephant or wheel spinning rider will get you nowhere.DIRECT THE RIDER...Concentrate on what works, or the ""bright spots""- Concentrate on what you did differently that made it successful. The idea isn't to just think about the good things in your life or others, but to really analyze why they work so that you can reproduce it.Script the critical moves- Make it easy to make the right decision. Too many choices, or confusion will send us back to our usual habits. Bring a noble goal within reach of everyday life and make the decision clear without exceptions. that leaves no ambiguity. When you want someone to behave in a new way, explain that new way clearly, don't assume the new moves are obvious.Point to a desired destination- Make it clear where you want to go. ex: I want to lose 10 pounds by Jan 3 2011 at midnight. That goal is clear. MOTIVATE THE ELEPHANTFind the feeling- To change, we need an emotional reason to change, think of the scary ""red cement"" videos that they show you in drivers ed to keep kids from drinking and driving. The emotion can be fear, love, sympathy, anything, but we all have to buy into the change with our emotions. Shrink the change-When you realize how close you are already, you are motivated to keep going. Make the first few steps in the right direction big ones so there is motivation to keep going. Dave Ramsey-a financial guru, advises to pay off the smallest debt first, not the one with the highest interest, because when the debt is paid off, you feel like you have accomplished something great, and it motivates you to keep going. Celebrate the first steps of the change. Grow the people-the more people you have on board making the change, it will make the other people feel the positive peer pressure to change. Make people want to identify with your group. You don't want to be the one person that doesn't pick up after your dog. It is a lot easier to tell a group of people to do something differently when 50% or more of the people have already agreed or made that change.HAVE A GROWTH MINDSETYou will have initial feelings of excitement,hope, and optimism, but once started you will start to feel depressed and like a failure, but if you persist and persevere you will make steady progress and come out in the end with a great feeling of accomplishment. If you know this right up front, it actually creates a positive feeling, not a depressing on. I think this is found in Alma 32 when he talks about not throwing out the seed of faith. He lets them know that there will be a time of doubt and hardship and frustration, but if you don't give up, it will grow into a tree that brings forth a wonderful fruit. Expect to feel that way before you even start, so you are ready for it.WE will struggle, we will fail, and we will get knocked down, but throughout we will get better, and we succeed in the end. It reframes failure as a natural part of the change process. SHAPE THE PATH-Tweak the environment-remove every barrier to make the path easy to see. example, throw away the junk food in the house and have a vegetable tray out to snack on. Think of Amazon's 1 click ordering. Leave the scriptures out on the table, or ensign in the bathroom. The less everyday steps you have to take to accomplish a goal, the more chances you will do it. Sometimes what is perceived as a people problem is actually a situational problem. We will all eat way too much popcorn if we are given it in a big bag. Try giving the popcorn in smaller bags and people will eat less popcorn. Environmental tweaks beats self control every time.Build Habits-when we are on autopilot we don't have to work so hard at everything. If we automatically say our prayers, then we can spend our mental and emotional efforts being nice, or withstanding the brownies that your son just made. Habits will change more easily when our environment changes. Build an action trigger. Note in advance when where and how you will execute the change. Put something somewhere different to remind you of the change. Build habits that advance the change you want in your life. Choose habits that are relatively easy to embrace. Making checklists make big screw ups less likely. Rally the Herd- You will imitate the actions of the people around you, especially in unfamiliar situations. Elephants will go with the herd. If you want to change, or help someone else change, hang around people that have already implemented that change in their life or at least excited and motivated to make that same change. You will want to be on the team."
9,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,3,"I wish that I could give this book 2.5 stars—absolutely average. Because I think that I have seen it all and tried it all before. And I think the book could have been cut by several chapters without being hurt at all.I like the basic metaphor of this book: the emotions as an elephant, the intellect as mahout. The rider (as the Heaths call the mahout) has limited amounts of strength and will-power to use to direct the elephant; the elephant has to be cooperative, or the rider won’t get where she wants to go. Also discussed is the path—the environment which we can manipulate to steer ourselves into the desired habits and behaviours. [See also: Slim by Design by Brian Wansink re: changing the environment to facilitate change].I think the examples given in Switch are much more applicable to the work place than to the individual household. I’ve been trying to get myself to do basic housework as I go each week, rather than storing up misery for myself on the weekends. But so far, I just can’t get my elephant to give a damn about the situation. The mahout tries her best, but very little housework gets done.  The authors also use an example of teaching a monkey to use a skateboard, using mango bits as rewards. They suggest that lavish use of rewards will help with eliciting the desired behaviour. I have used this strategy on myself with limited success—do X and then you can read a chapter of your book or phone someone you want to talk to. The tricky thing is then to stop at one chapter and do another chore before reading the next chapter (my elephant is a tricky one). Another suggestion in the book is linkages of behaviours—look for a bright spot in your routine, something that you have no problem doing, then link it to another desired action. This was how I trained myself to floss my teeth EVERY evening. I slotted that task in between washing my face and brushing my teeth. After a year and a half of this, I am finally to the point that it takes a major catastrophe to prevent me from flossing. However, I’m still working on linking setting up my coffee maker in the evening to doing any dishes that won’t go in the dishwasher. That was my one New Year’s Resolution for 2015 and at the 6 month point, I still haven’t performed this task reliably. Unfortunate, as both my elephant & mahout enjoy getting up to a clean kitchen.The Heaths also take a page out of the FlyLady’s book [Sink Reflections : FlyLady’s Babystep Guide to Overcoming Chaos] by recommending breaking tasks down into tiny sections—making the goal so small that the emotional elephant isn’t spooked by it. Marla Cilley (the FlyLady) recommends 5 minute cleaning bursts on the theory that you can force yourself to do almost anything for only 5 minutes and that a small success will almost always carry you along to do more. This works for me to some extent—some days I designate as “It bugs me so I fix it” days. If I notice a dusty window sill, I go get a cloth and clean it. Then I may go and check all the other window sills and make sure they are clean too. I notice a grimy light switch—suddenly it’s “clean all the light switches” day. I also have experience with trying to manipulate my environment to make being tidy an easy option. [See Organizing from the Inside Out by Julie Morgenstern for more tips on this]. I’ve moved my filing cabinet to the dining room where I seem to like to open the mail. Sometimes the contents make it into the files, but once again, not on a reliable basis.So, I need to find myself a reliable EMOTIONAL reason to keep up with these tasks—and I haven’t come up with one yet. My solution to the situation is usually to invite guests, spurring myself to spruce up my apartment. So far, peer pressure is the only thing that works every time for me! And the Heaths also recommend that, so I may just have to stick with it and invite folks in more often.Wish there was a little more to the book than that—I am apparently an awfully recalcitrant housekeeper."
10,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"This is by far the best and most practical book on behavior change I've read so far. The book was written to address the change at the individual, organizational, and community level and I found it to be extremely useful when helping my clients reach their fitness and health goals. I was initally introduced to the work of brothers Heath through their book ""Made to Stick"" which is a another great read. So what are you gonna get out of this?For starters you'll learn the exact framework how to deal with bad behaviors and change them for beneficial ones. In the book the process of change is described as involving 2 sides of your mind, your emotional and rational thinking. The overpowering emotional mind is refereed to as as the Elephant. The elephant is the part of us that gives into cravings, instincts and has very little self-control. And is also the key to motivation. The rational, decision-making part of us is secondary and it sits on the Elephant as the Rider. The Rider is the one that deals with self-control, decisions and setting big goals. And is also prone to overthinking, and getting paralyzed by over-analyzing. (Both terms were originally mentioned in Jonathan Haidt's great book Happiness Hypothesis.)The reason why behavior change is so hard for most people is because there's a conflict between the 2 elements of your mind. And the small goal oriented Rider is the part that usually loses to the instant gratification seeking Elephant. And to make a truly lasting change in your life, the Elephant and the Rider need to unite on the same path. Overall this book offers a great practical framework how to adjust both the Rider and the Elephant in ways that will allow the change to occur and stick. As I said before this is the best book on change I've read and I would highly recommend it. It's gonna positively impact all areas of your life."
11,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2314568-steve,3,"I read this book for two reasons. First, it was a selection on the 2014 Air Force Chief of Staff Reading List, and second, a coworker recommended it. As a management engineer, change is my job, or I should say, getting people, functions, and businesses to change is my job, and I’m interested in books like this and how I can apply concepts and ideas presented. There were some interesting theories and notions in this book, but it is highly repetitive and somewhat tedious.“Switch” suffers from three main problems. First, it focuses on techniques to facilitate change in organizations and individuals, and while it occasionally cites interesting work in cognitive and social psychology, the justification for the techniques is anecdotal: “Technique X worked at company Y in particular instance Z, and so it’s obviously a valid technique that’s always applicable.” There’s no attempt at any sort of rigorous scientific testing of such a claim. For example, the authors claim that you cannot focus on why a proposed change is failing to take hold, but must instead identify the pockets where change is working, figure out why it works there, and then emulate the successes elsewhere. They describe several case studies where this approach has led to successful change, including a project to improve childhood nutrition in Vietnam, and an intervention with a misbehaving ninth grader. Finding the bright spots is a good thing to do, but the hypothesis that it is always the best approach, that it will always trump analysis and correction of failure, is simply ludicrous. Anyone trained in the proper use of the scientific method will want to scream at instance after instance of this type of claim without support.The second problem with “Switch” is the use of overly-cute language. The book’s central claim is that effective change requires three things: engaging the rational, data-driven perspective of the people who must make the change; ensure they have an emotional stake in the change; and make the change process as easy as possible for them by manipulating the environment. To describe this triad of requirements, the authors use a metaphorical rider (the rational perspective) on an elephant (the emotional component) moving down a path (the change context). They use this metaphor in paragraph after paragraph, until their message is drowned out by the cutesy language. This pervades the book, even beyond the rider-elephant-path triad. For example, near the end of the book, where they’re describing how to keep change momentum going, they talk about positive reinforcement, and provide the example of a monkey trainer who rewards her charge with bits of mango for each small action she performs correctly. A page or two later, they proclaim “If you want your boss or your team to change, you better get a little less stingy with the mango.” Seriously?This book is about twice as long as it needed to be to convey its key points, but “Switch” does contain some common-sense approaches to effecting change. It presents some reasonable change strategies, and having them in one’s change-management toolbox is a good thing. But surely there is a way to present them without using silly, repetitive language, and without claiming that these are the only effective ways to create change."
12,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36873041-amanda-never-mandy,2,"This book was boring as shit. I would read a paragraph and then fall asleep. The concepts it discussed were no-brainers and there was really nothing more to pull from this read. It’s not that I went in with a closed mind, it’s just that it didn’t light up any new thought pathways in my overstuffed brain. The writing made me feel like the authors were trying too hard to be my friend having these high five do you know what I mean moments that made me shake my head in disgust. Their tone read as if they were talking down to or felt superior to the reader which didn’t match the content provided.I guess if someone was clueless on this topic it would be a good read or maybe if they needed more motivation to change or some bullshit like that. I don’t know. This is me trying to find that one nice thing to say and it seems pretty pathetic. It’s like I am trying to sell you on a product that I didn’t like myself, “The drink tastes like how cat piss smells but if that’s your thing, go for it.” Two stars to a book that my rider and elephant agreed sucked a big fat one."
13,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5550397-britany,3,"A fellow colleague recommended this book to me, and I have to say that it read pretty quick. The chapters are broken down into numbered anecdotes. Examples and stories of these concepts. These stories made the book relatable and easier to digest. The concept is that change is difficult, but using some key theories, you too can change anything. A behavior, a concept, a strategy, or a mindset. "
14,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35942740-obsidian,5,"So this is the first of the books I had to read for my training this summer. I have to say that ""Switch"" was my favorite just because it really gets down into why change is hard for people and organizations. And it shows how small changes can build into such big successes. I am at an organization right now going through some upheaval since our boss was let go after our employee feedback survey and overall morale dropped over three years. Of course looking back now and after completing my training I can point out where things went wrong. Ignoring feedback from employees, refusing to adjust to others and listen, having ""process"" improvements every couple of months and not sticking with one approach, etc. It's no wonder I was full of stress and would wake up grinding my teeth. The book really focuses on what is called the elephant, the rider, and the path. And that the elephant for many of us are dealing with emotions. The rider is supposed to be the rational part of yourself. And the path is where you want the elephant to go. Well you would think that it would be pretty easy to steer an elephant right? Nope. It's really hard. In fact it takes a lot to control the elephant so that you can get to the path you want to go.The Heath's do a great job of putting in a ton of case study work in this book that I found fascinating. My favorite was of the man given a finite amount of time to improve nutrition and pretty much solve hunger in I believe it was Thailand. And then him realizing after studying mothers in some villages how they were able to make sure that their children were fed and not suffering from malnutrition. He had those mothers show the other mothers and from there all of this knowledge was passed on. It seems like such a small thing, but it wasn't.I have dealt with some employees this past year that I want them to get on the path and I know it's my job to keep control of my elephant so that I don't show frustration or impatience and have to clearly show them why the path in the end will be worth it. It definitely helped me rethink some things and how I interact with others. "

16,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,4,"My father was a man who was fleet of foot and fleet of mind – with the highest levels of self discipline that I have ever encountered. The one thing he didn’t understand were human beings, and why they did things, or even worse, why they didn’t do things. He was completely flummoxed by mankind’s shortcomings. I wish he was still alive. I wish I could press this book into his hands and say “Here is your chance to understand.”As well as writing a primer on human nature, Chip and Dan Heath have constructed a wonderful self-help edifice around the concept of a little man (our rational side), upon a big elephant (our emotional side – weak, instinctual and full of desire for instant gratification.) Then finally there is the environment, and our habits within the environment.I had heard quite a lot of the advice before, but with the exception of a couple of the examples I had never heard about the experiments or case studies behind the advice. Well, they were utterly incredible! Throughout the book I kept muttering “good grief”, or “I don’t believe it!” or “how amazing!” It was such an eye-opening read. The background research really gave the advice enormous impact. It became so much more than a simple set of directives. In the authors' terms - my elephant was well and truly engaged.I also laughed a lot. That was nice too. As self-help books go, I think this one is outstanding. Highly recommended.Note - read after seeing this excellent review by Trevor"
17,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"Of the three books I've read by the Heaths, Switch is the weakest. The strength of their method is to present solid info with illustrative stories but it seems like they didn't do their homework on this one. The overall message of the book about habit/person/environment is valid but nothing new. The plus value the authors can add is from the stories they choose, so they need to get those right. For example, the story they probably bring up the most is about a campaign to get people to switch to 1% milk. The problem is that if you know much about obesity research, you wouldn't expect this simple switch to work very well to improve health outcomes (see Good Calories, Bad Calories). I looked up the article they cite for this and it offers zero evidence that the intervention decreases weight or increases fitness (nor does a follow-up by the authors written years later). So I looked up the topic in general and found that there is some epidemiological evidence that drinking 1% vs. whole milk actually increases weight rather than the opposite. The 1% milk story is an example of how NOT to do public health behavior change. Many of the other stories are psychology experiments in artificial circumstances or just anecdotes, and it's hard to generalize from those."
18,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666282-nick,4,"Switch is like the Heath brothers earlier book, Made to Stick, in that the ideas in it are not new, just better expressed. Chip and Dan are great storytellers and they have made change (i.e. behavioral change) simple and easy by reducing it to 3 steps: Direct the Rider (provide clear direction for the rational mind), Motivate the Elephant (engage people's emotions) and Shape the Path (make the change easier by changing the situation in key ways). Similarly, their first book took the sophisticated and elegant work of Robert Cialdini and made it accessible and simple. The rest of us writers are envious, of course, because the gift of clarity and simplicity is a profound one rarely bestowed. "
19,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin,3,"Well, a pretty good book. There's nothing here I haven't read elsewhere. this is a book giving the same steps you will read about in most ""beat bad habits"" books (change routine etc.).It's related through the use of examples which makes it accessible.

21,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3027045-cindy-frewen-wuellner,5,"I bought this book last April 2010, skimmed it, set it aside. looked like another management book, not transformative (along the lines of say Good to Great). Yesterday on the twitter chat I host, a couple of people said it changed their lives. I thought that about Howard Gardners books on change. My mental models change. Picking it back up and reading it cover to cover in the last 24 hours, I can see why they related to it. the Heaths find a pattern for changing behavior that is simple, sensible, and memorable. They have three components - rational, emotional, and situational. They call them: Directing the Rider (rational, scripting critical moves, point to the destination); Motivate the Elephant (emotional, make it easy to comply, appeal to the image/pathos); and Shape the Path (situation the change.) They offer cases right and left. I liked the safety goggles in the factory story. 1. Rather than allow for ambiguity of ""wear now"" and ""not now,"" the manager said to wear them all the time (Directing the rider.) 2. Instead of the nerdy goggles, they got new hip goggles to appeal to the macho staff (Motivating the herd). 3. A big blue line around the whole factory floor meant wear goggles inside this line. A cut out of a man dressed in safety clothes at the doors showed proper apparel and reminded them to don their goggles (Shape the path.) Safety rose 21% in a factory with an above-average safety record. the authors prove their points and make it simple to digest. I wont forget elephant, rider, and path. and as a futures/architect, change is part of my core business. Its useful to have another tool, for business, and for me. I immediately started thinking how to resituate some habits. Make a mission; make it easy to embrace the new habit."
22,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44105134-manik-sukoco,4,"Have you ever made a New Year's Resolution to lose weight, exercise more, kick a bad habit, and then the next week slipped back into the same old routine? There is a reason that people, organizations, and societies many times fall into this trap of trying to make a big change; and shortly thereafter fall back into the same old rut. Can't we just change by trying harder? According to the authors, trying harder will never result in lasting change. All that it will do is tire the ""Rider.""The authors explain that when we try to change, we have to use both the logical (the Rider) and the emotional (the Elephant) parts of our brain. The Rider is the part of us that decides to lose weight, but (as Chip and Dan illustrate) the Elephant is that part of us that goes hunting for the Cheetos in the pantry late at night. The Elephant will always take the easiest and most familiar course, whereas the Rider tries to take the most logical course. The Rider (our self-control or will power) will only allow us to re-route the Elephant for a short while before tiring. In order to make an effective ""Switch"" we must appeal to emotion (the Elephant). However, when the Elephant encounters an obstacle he will try to revert to the comfortable way of doing thingsChange is hard; however, since reading ""Switch"", I now understand the psychology behind effective change. Thanks to Chip and Dan Heath for an excellent job. "
23,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,3,"I have to admit that I didn't read it carefully. Mostly it's a more self-helpy version of lots of pop-psych books I've been reading lately. And it's a little too general, in that it assumes most ppl are very similar to one another (even when it reports success rates of, say, 18% before & 35% now).But it's got some terrific guidelines, mantras, examples, and actions, so if you're motivated but unsure about how to begin to make the change you want to see in your life or your team, it's worth checking out. Or maybe check out www.switchthebook.com/resources first."
24,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2616572-jay-connor,5,"Finally a book about change that starts with the end in mind. In most of the prior extensive literature of this area from self-help to management categories, authors and gurus extoll the nobility of the effort rather than the achievement of the result. It is also nice to see recommendations based on research rather than the ego-stroking when-I-was-in-charge polemics of many past CEOs of now marginally successful corporations (e.g., ""Execution"").The authors pulled from studies conducted over decades in psychology, sociology and other fields to shed light on how we can make successful changes. The power of many of the studies and observations is how counter-intuitive they appear. Thus, explaining why change is so hard -- we are not programed for it and our well-meaning ""gut instincts"" are often at 180 degree odds of sustaining the change we seek. Think of the Bush Presidency. While I am most fascinated with change in a community and societal context, the examples here, which also include individual and organizational levels, are very helpful and instructive. I think this is because, as the authors stress, ""when change works, it tends to follow a pattern. The people who change have clear direction, ample motivation and a supportive environment."" This aligns very directly with the best practices we present to communities and discussed in our book: ""Community Visions, Community Solutions."" For a powerful recent example see Erie Together on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3RDVu...Well, if there's a pattern to follow, why don't we? The basic problem is that ""the brain has two independent systems at work at all times,"" the authors explain. ""First, there's what we call the emotional side. It's the part of you that is instinctive, that feels pain and pleasure. Second, there's the rational side, also known as the reflective or conscious system. It's the part of you that deliberates and analyzes and looks into the future."" In essence, the rational mind wants change and the emotional mind wants comfort. But don't let the terms fool you ... oftentimes we have seen the rational mind of a businessman in a community gathering embrace the emotional comfort of ""lets just do something"" rather than invest the process time to draw a clear, rational, path to the solution. One concept, which the authors present, has fundamental implications, especially in communities, for all three elements of change: clear direction; motivation and environmental supports. They call it Fundamental Attribution Error -- a deep-rooted tendency to attribute people's behavior to ""the way they are rather than the situation they are in."" This gives rise in community to a whole set of broad-brush dysfunctions: blame, ""those people,"" claims of lack of personal responsibility, etc. For example, we have seen children from the lowest socio-economic strata, who for years were thought of as ""those kids"" who will never make it, perform equal to their counterparts when the community's expectation changed. We have seen in the communities we have worked with, over time, a desire to know what they didn't know. When they see that so much of our failure in communities is situational and not ""those people,"" they see that in fact they have power over the situations their community has created. And that is the SWITCH."
25,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2233542-mike,4,"Of all the pop-psychology books I've read recently, this is easily my favorite. Now, when someone says, ""This author is so insightful and intelligent,"" you can be pretty sure what they really mean is, ""I agree with everything he says,"" and I admit there is a certain amount of that in my review. However, I did pick up some ideas, plus it's always nice to reinforce your world view.Many, many years ago (decades actually) I was visiting a relative. The door to the garage was the main entrance to the house, and it didn't have a closer or a spring. As a result, it was usually left open when the kids went in or out. This caused almost constant emotional turmoil that was really unpleasant. Further, the failure to close the door was repeatedly referred to as a character defect in the children. To myself, I said, ""Sheesh, buy a closer for that door."" And right then I invented one of my life mantras, ""Seek mechanical solutions to emotional problems."" (Ask Adam if he remembers me saying this.) So, I was happy to see someone else with the same philosophy.This book is about motivating change. The authors focus on three areas: The intellect (which they call the ""rider""), the emotions (which they call the ""elephant), and the environment (the ""path""). They would call my screen door situation an example of ""smoothing the path"". I loved the idea of a human being described as the rider and the elephant. I am trying to lose weight. Or, at least, my rider is. Losing weight is easy, you just have to eat less and/or exercise more. But it really seems like I am two people in one body. The rider says ""No Cold Stone Creamery!"", but the elephant seems to be able, at times, to just turn the rider off, and I find myself walking into the ice cream store almost puppet-like. Who is in control here? A lot of the book is devoted to ways the rider can trick the elephant, because the elephant, being so much bigger, usually gets its way.I was also impressed by the author's discussion of ""growth"" mindset vs ""fixed"" mindset. A fixed mindset is the belief that people are either good at something or not, and it's pretty hard to change. The growth mindset is the belief that given enough time, anybody can become an expert at anything. I will admit to something of a ""fixed"" mindset. It just seems obvious to me that some people are good at some things and other are not. But what the authors pointed out, which I hadn't followed through in my mind, was the implications of the fixed mindset. For example, people with a fixed mindset get discouraged easily by failure, because they take it as evidence of a particular trait, not as a position on the path to mastery.Like all books of this ilk, it's filled with dubious psychological experiments that are provided as proof, but probably are full of investigator bias and other scientific holes if you really looked carefully. But it's not really the point that 47% of college seniors did this or that, the point of the book is to provide common sense methods to motivate yourself and others, and I think it accomplishes that."

Otherwise, I never would have picked it up (I never read inspirational/leadership-type nonfiction). From here, I'll just quote verbatim the review I gave of this to the other attendees:""Switch""...is all about how to make a change. Big, little, personal, institutional, societal…any kind of change in any context can be understood by the overarching metaphor the Heath brothers use: a Rider (reason/analytical appeal) on an Elephant (feeling/emotion), traveling a Path (the situation/environment/direction the change must go). The three elements of the metaphor form the structure of the book, and the authors richly illustrate each element and its sub-parts by using real-life examples, ranging from hospitals and schools, to Target and Brasilata (a very large can-manufacturing company in Brazil). You meet a teacher who inspired a class of 1st graders, almost all of whom could barely read or didn’t even know the alphabet, to perform at 3rd-grade levels by year’s end. You meet a Save the Children worker sent to open the first office in Vietnam (with next to no resources of any kind, and no support from the Vietnamese government), who in six months reached 2.2 million people in 265 villages, dramatically reducing childhood malnutrition. The Heaths also cite volumes of published research, using those experiments to vet their statements at each step. There are several side-bar “case studies” which are also drawn from real situations needing change, where you are offered the chance to think about what you might do to make the “switch,” and walk you through the change step by step.The three elements of making a switch: Direct the Rider, Motivate the Elephant, and Shape the Path, are further described and faceted into steps. It’s a clear primer for making a change.I found ""Switch"" very readable and thought-provoking. It serves as an excellent manual on leadership from any level in an organization or environment, and on how to create and foster innovation with very few resources. It got me thinking creatively about changes coming (or changes not coming, but needed!) in my own organization and my personal life. My sole quibble with the book is that I found it had a few too many humorous “asides,” which can work (Mary Roach’s books are nothing but well-researched humorous asides, and I enjoy them immensely), but the Heaths’ I found fell a little flat and momentarily distracting. I do highly recommend this book."
27,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5985613-angie,5,"Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard by Chip Heath and Dan Heath I found this book to be a revelation. It’s smart and delivers on its promise. By the end of the book, I had a much clearer perspective on to make change. One of the reasons that I like this book so much is that it focuses on the systems in place – not the people. Too many books focuses on the people and start from the assumption that there is something wrong with them: they are lazy or they are dumb. These assumptions lead only to two solutions: inspiring pep talks or more training. Switch focuses on the environment and the systems that are in place that lead to a given result. The Heath brothers argue that to be successful you have to change the systems, the environment or the person’s mindset. They go through all the emotional pieces that make people resistant to change. A great example of the book’s ideology takes place at a factory. This factory has struggled with safety. Workers are getting their hands caught in one particular rate at an unacceptable rate. Now, some ways to deal with this could have been to “educate” the workers on the dangers of getting their hands caught in the machine, or to create a punishment/incentive scheme. The managers look at the problem and realized that no one wants to get their hand stuck so they devised a safety mechanism where in order to operate the machine, two buttons a arms length apart had to be pressed. If both buttons were not pressed, the machine would turn off. Now it was impossible to both run the machine and get your hand caught. Genius. I highly recommend this book. It is one of the few management books I plan to purchase and go back to over and over. "
28,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1608811-david,5,"Let me be clear: I HATE most self-helpy/businessy books. They're usually simplistic/obvious, preachy, vague, or ""jargony"". Switch is none of those things. Sure, you'll be introduced to some jargon, but it's just three terms (Rider, Elephant, and Shaping the Path), you'll learn them within minutes, and they'll be used consistently throughout the rest of the book. I learned some things about human nature that surprised me. At first, the results of some of the cited studies seemed to run counter to common-sense. But upon further reflection, the results explain much about why some attempts to change fail and why some succeed. There are no magic tricks, but there sure are some neat ideas.I really like the fact that the examples used in the book apply to single individuals as well as to groups, businesses, or even whole countries. The concepts, the authors are at pains to point out, are universal. This is great, because once you learn the ideas, you find yourself thinking of all sorts of ways they could be applied.Switch is a well-written, very convincing book."

However, there were a lot of new insights in the book because they combined some of this research to approach a new problem. So they take Haidt's rider and elephant and some of the behavioral econ and habit stuff and give really good advice about helping people or organizations make changes. The section I found most illuminating was early in the book about finding bright spots--instead of focusing on the problem you need to solve, look to see if others have solved it and see what they're doing.

32,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3056629-jenn-jr,4,"I enjoyed this book as an audio book -- and was quite impressed with the way the book was structured. Even without taking notes -- I was up to my elbows in my annual fall tomato sauce processing -- I feel like I have absorbed the main points because of the redundant, cyclical nature of the book's structure. The biggest challenge to implementing change is approached using the metaphor of the rider/elephant (ego/id). While most people begin to address changes with intellect and logic, you have to consider the emotion and passion that will cause any change effort to rise or fall.To make a change successful - you have to consider both, because the elephant can quickly exhaust the rider and cause the change to fail. The authors present many excellent case studies -- which make it seem as though this model is easily applied in just about any situation. As they say, hindsight is 20/20 -- I'd love to be able to identify situations where someone seeking to create a change actively thought of it in terms of ""rider/elephant."" Perhaps the example of the ""Designated Driver"" campaign is one of those.There are two key lessons for me from the book:1. Bright Spots -- look at places where a change is successful, figure out why it is successful and expand that.2. Identify environmental issues that contribute to a behavior you want to change -- person vs situation problem. Much of the rest of the advice is not new to me -- such as SMART goals. I'll refer you to Amir's excellent review if you want more details about the recommendations in the bok."
33,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5354517-lora,4,"I've been thinking a lot the last few years about the uncertain times we live in. As an accidental technologist, I've frequently been asked (or pushed, even) to be a change agent within large organizations and small. I wouldn't say I've always been successful, no matter how many late nights I put in, or innovative ideas I thought up. Not even big budgets or talented folks have been a guarantee of success. I've found myself asking, often,in these transitional times, how do we get over uncertainty and ""analysis paralysis"" to support change?Wondering and research led me to SWITCH, How to Change Things When Change is Hard, by Chip Heath and Dan Heath.The theory Heath & Heath espose is that the brain is hard-wired to respond to uncertainty, conflict, and chaos with visceral precepts that make us our own worst enemies. They talk about the brain in metaphor, as a rider on an elephant. The elephant is the emotional, instinctual, feeling portion of our brains-while the rider is the rational analyzer. We live through the combination of both. We need both elephant and rider to move us ahead.Their script for guiding change is a combination that begins with appealing to the rational rider, removing blocks that cause panicked over-analysis and stagnation by simplifying the critical path to change and identifying the where and what of the destination. Let me say that again, simplifying. (Geez, I have sucked at that). Second, by naming the feeling that joins the elephant's animal instinct to a cause, working to make change feel manageable, and by investing in people's need to enjoy accomplishment along the way.The Heath brother's true gift is the way they've melted down stories presented in a very Malcolm Gladwell-esque sort of way to (following their own philosophy) meted steps. I found myself in moments of I-could-have-had-a-V8 head slapping, and realization that of course, a transition I was advocating didn't work. <> I also wondered why I had not consulted friends who are psychologists and sociologists for guidance on how to be a better advocate for change. As I've thought a great deal about this book, I've also begun looking for success stories around me which mirror the wisdom in addressing rider and elephant...perhaps, more on those, another time.So, I'll leave you with this-if you're thinking about transitions in an organization, a group, your own life, or society in general, SWITCH contains some insight and armor I think we may all need in the days ahead."
34,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/261343-matt-kelley,3,"This is a quick read and one that's sure to be very helpful to just about every reader -- the clear change strategies the Heaths discuss here can apply to both organizations and individuals and there are a few takeaways that I'll remember for a long time. I'm a big fan of 'Made to Stick,' and I look at stickiness as one the Heaths' specialties. They tell stories and give tips that you can remember and act upon. They also summarize piles of social science studies that end up proving great fodder when you're trying to sell an idea for change.I read it mostly with mission-focused organizations in mind, and I found the advice and research here quite useful. My only complaint is that it got a bit poppy and fluffy at times, seeming to retrace its steps and reiterate ideas one too many times. Some of the studies they cite are well known and should be given a sentence or two rather than a page.In a nutshell, the Heaths suggest a three prong strategy (and borrow a metaphor -- from author Jonathan Haidt -- of a person riding an elephant) to make change happen:> Direct the Rider: Outline clear steps and make a rational case for them. Give the logical side of our brains a clear and achievable next step (and end goal) to focus on.> Motivate the Elephant: Get us riled up. Inspire our emotional brain with personal stories, colorful demonstrations and a picture of what success might look like. > Clear the Path: Remove obstacles to the end goal, find out what's stopping people from taking actions that seem easy.Switch might be an oversimplified intro to change management, but the Heaths know how to make this material sticky and actionable. I'll definitely recommend this to nonprofit professionals and many others."

Some of the tactics mentioned in this book are not unheard of. Having said that there are some that are uncommon like the concept of looking at bright spots and b&w goals. The authors have used both corporate and individual examples to show how it works. The corporate ones are particularly useful since you can identify with it and possibly try to implement it within your organization. I found the concept of solutions based therapy to be very interesting. Its a different way of tackling a problem, it gets straight down to business. "

The book is based around the mental model of human behaviour as a Rider and the Elephant:- The rider is rational and can see a path ahead. (System 2)- The elephant is irrational and driven by emotion and instinct. (System 1)A summary of the key ideas below:Here are the three things you have to do to successfully implement any change:Direct the Rider: Provide crystal clear directions to the rational part of a human nature. The rational part of the brain is the one that deliberates, analyzes and looks into the future. It’s also called the reflective or conscious system. What often looks like resistance from the rational part is frequently just a lack of clarity.1. Find the bright spots – Investigate what’s already working and clone it [Jerry  Sternin in Vietnam, solutions-focused therapy]2. Script the critical moves – Provide crystal clear guidance with specific behaviors [1% milk, four rules at the Brazilian railroad] 3. Point to the destination – Know where you’re going and why it’s worth it [""You'll be third graders soon."" ""No dry holes” at BP]Motivate the Elephant: The rational part demands a tremendous amount of self-control, which comes in limited resources. That’s why laziness often seems like exhaustion. The only way for a change to last is to have an emotional drive. That’s why people’s emotional side needs to be engaged and they must believe they are competent enough to make the change. The emotional part of human nature is the part that is instinctive and feels pain and pleasure.1. Find the feeling – Knowing something won’t ignite a change, feeling something will [Piling gloves on the table, the chemotherapy video game.  Robyn Waters’s demos at Target]2. Shrink the change – Break down the change until it no longer spooks the Elephant [The 5-Minute Room Rescue, procurement reform]3. Grow your people – Install the growth mindset and properly prepare for failure [Brasilata’s ""inventors"", junior-high math kids' turnaround]Shape the Path: What many times looks like a people problem is only a situation problem. The situation, including the surrounding environment, is called the Path. When you properly shape the Path or, in other words, tweak the environment, you make change more likely to happen.1. Tweak the environment – When the situation changes, the behavior changes [Throwing out the phone system at Rackspace, 1-Click ordering, simplifying the online time sheet]2. Build habits – Look for ways to encourage new habits with triggers and checklists [Setting ""action triggers."" eating two bowls of soup while dieting, using checklists]3. Rally the Herd – Behavior is contagious, so help it spread [""Fataki"" in Tanzania, ""free spaces"" in hospitals, seeding the tip jar]"
40,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100223327-vivek-srivastava,4,"This book contains well-conceived and pragmatic steps towards change of behaviour, culture or process in a wide range of domains. The author has successfully managed to give the account of these steps in a highly riveting manner with pithy message:  ""The people who change have clear direction, ample motivation and a supportive environment"" These three elements are symbolised as ""Direct the Rider"", ""Motivate the Elephant"" and ""Shape the Path"" which is ingeniously catchy and intuitive. When all these three actions can be done, then dramatic changes happen (though change can be managed with one or two of these actions as well).Following key concepts are covered in the book:Direct the Rider - Clear direction and goal, reduce ambiguityMotivate the Elephant - Burning platform concept or use of shock, giving headstart, taking cue from bright spots, shrink the change (into multiple small wins), expectation of failure, promoting growth mindsetShape the Path - Fundamental Attribution Error, environment tweaking, action triggers or preloading decisions , creating and reinforcing behaviours through rewardsThe book attempts to re-orient our approach of change from ANALYZE-THINK-CHANGE to SEE-FEEL-CHANGE.Many of the concepts in this book are similar to the ones discussed in other remarkable books such as ""The Power of Habit"" by Charles Duhigg, ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear and ""Influence"" by Robert Cialdini. But there is one thing that makes this book stand out: Its succinct message in the form of a memorable metaphor."
41,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/880021-david-sasaki,3,"Chip and Dan Heath's Switch is propaganda manual for the social activist. If your job, like mine, is to present people with information in order to change their behavior, then this is a worthwhile book. It reads quickly, and while most of the advice is obvious in hindsight, it is organized in a way that, in its sum, is enlightening. Habits are notoriously difficult to change — whether it is what we eat, how we procrastinate, how we speak in public, our how we respond to a particular pet peeve. In order to help make change easier, the authors recommend three main types of activities:Tap into your audience's rational side. The authors use Jonathan Haidt's metaphor of a rider sitting atop an elephant to describe the relationship between the rational and emotional sides of our brains. The ""rational rider"" does its best to deliberately steer the ""emotional elephant"" down the path that is most logical. Our rational side knows that we should eat egg whites and tomatoes for breakfast, but it's incredibly difficult to steer the elephant away from the pastry, coffee, and cigarette. Our rational side knows that millions of children die from malnutrition every year, but our emotional elephant pays attention to the two people who died in a terrorist attack. We are ruled by our emotions much more than anything resembling rationality. But still, the authors suggest that we prime the elephant by waking up the rider with a convincing, rational argument.Point out where your social change argument has already been successful. Find out why it has worked and how it can be replicated. Describe how the world would look different if that successful social change were replicated widely. Focus on those critical steps to implement the change, but don't overwhelm your audience with details that distract from the crucial, critical steps.Motivate your audience's emotional side. Again, the 'emotional elephant' dictates our habits and behaviors much more than our ""rational rider."" In order to change the ingrained habits of our elephants, we must use emotional appeals. We have to make people feel. This is why Al Gore emphasized the (ultimately fictitious) story of drowning polar bears to communicate the urgency of climate change. Drowning polar bears are able to do what graphs and statistics aren't — tap into the emotional side of our brain that is subconsciously responsible for so much of our behavior.Make people feel. Break down the ""milestones"" of change until they are so small that they no longer intimidate our ingrained laziness. Appeal to your audience's sense of identity. If your goal is to change people's energy consumption behavior, then cultivate a sense of ""green identity"" so that they feel like they are part of a movement. (One interesting study cited in the book found that individuals are more likely to become involved in their communities if they first display a small bumper sticker that cultivates a sense of ""civic identity."")Shape the path. Once you have appealed to your audience's rational and emotional side, it's time to define the small, concrete steps that must be taken in order to achieve social change. Too often compelling social change campaigns fail because they don't offer clearly defined steps that individuals can take to make a real difference. They tell the heart-breaking stories, demonstrate all the data, and cultivate a sense of identity with bumper-stickers, t-shirts, and Facebook profile badges. And then they just leave it there, as if change will magically occur as a result. Shaping the path to change is the most difficult step — it's where you're ask people to change their behavior. Instead of taking 10-minute showers, now you're asking them to take just five minutes to save water. Instead of throwing all trash into the same can, you're asking them to take the time to recycle. Instead of drafting policy in a small committee of experts, now you're asking your government leaders to take into consideration a vast amount of contradictory public input.Make things simple by removing unnecessary steps. If you want your employees to deliver information on time, then make that process easier by removing all the non-crucial steps. Alter the environment to promote new behaviors. If you want more collaboration in your office, consider an open space layout. If you want more reflection, then consider adding more spaces for solitude. Help your audience build new habits. Giving away a cheap, plastic timer might help people keep their showers to just five minutes. Insisting on the use of checklists at work can build new habits. Finally, remind people that ""everyone is doing it."" Our behavior always depends on social cues. If you can show your neighbor that 90% of the neighborhood is taking five-minute showers and they are among the minority that takes 10-minute showers, it is more likely that they will change their behavior. Peer pressure works.Like I said, this is all obvious in hindsight, and we can think of many marketing and social action campaigns that follow the script line by line. But most don't, and as a result they tend to be less effective. By the end of the book the authors had me convinced that every effective social action campaign — whether you're trying to change the behavior of your government or your children — depends on informing someone's rational side, provoking their emotional side, and creating a clear step-by-step path to change."

This is a book to help you change things at the individual, organizational, and societal level. The Heath brothers, Chip and Dan make use of recent psychological case studies and an engaging writing style that not only entertains but provide readers with interesting insights into the psychology of change. This intriguing 320-page book is broken out by the following three sections: Direct the Rider, Motivate the Elephant, and Shape the Path. Positives:1.	Engaging, accessible prose on a fascinating topic. Change.2.	Interesting case studies that cover a spectrum of the human experience and how it relates to change.3.	The authors have a great command of the topic and made it fun for the readers.4.	The essence of change, “Ultimately, all change efforts boil down to the same mission: Can you get people to start behaving in a new way?”5.	One of the main ideas of the book is the notion that we have a rational side (Rider) and the emotional side (Elephant). Taking a page from Jonathan Haidt's popular book The Happiness Hypothesis, the authors drive this analogy throughout the book. "" If you want to change things, you’ve got to appeal to both.""6.	The book is full of interesting facts many of which are counterintuitive. ""So when you hear people say that change is hard because people are lazy or resistant, that’s just flat wrong. In fact, the opposite is true: Change is hard because people wear themselves out. And that’s the second surprise about change: What looks like laziness is often exhaustion.""7.	Many of the findings of this book are very practical. ""If you want people to change, you must provide crystal-clear direction.""8.	The three-part framework of the book, "" Direct the Rider, Motivate the Elephant, and Shape the Path."" ""If you can do all three at once, dramatic change can happen even if you don’t have lots of power or resources behind you.""9.	The understanding that big changes can happen despite people having few resources and little structural authority. 10.	The bright spots... “What’s working and how can we do more of it?” That’s the bright-spot philosophy in a single question.""11.	Understanding decision paralysis. As Barry Schwartz puts it in his book The Paradox of Choice, as we face more and more options, “we become overloaded. Choice no longer liberates, it debilitates. It might even be said to tyrannize.”12.	The importance of describing a compelling destination. ""When you describe a compelling destination, you’re helping to correct one of the Rider’s great weaknesses—the tendency to get lost in analysis.""13.	The Target case study was very interesting and it provided an interesting change perspective: from ANALYZE-THINK-CHANGE to the more likely SEE-FEEL-CHANGE. 14.	The great concept of shrinking the change, "" One way to motivate action, then, is to make people feel as though they’re already closer to the finish line than they might have thought.""15.	Growing your people..."" It shows us that people are receptive to developing new identities, that identities “grow” from small beginnings. Once you start seeing yourself as a “concerned citizen,” you’ll want to keep acting like one.""16.	Tweaking the environment really resonated with me, sound, practical guidelines. "" Tweaking the environment is about making the right behaviors a little bit easier and the wrong behaviors a little bit harder. It’s that simple.""17.	The two strategies to shaping the path. ""(1) tweaking the environment and (2) building habits.""18.	The power of the herd, ""In situations where your herd has embraced the right behavior, publicize it. For instance, if 80 percent of your team submits time sheets on time, make sure the other 20 percent knows the group norm.""19.	The essence of change, ""Change isn’t an event; it’s a process.""20.	An excellent appendix that ties everything together. 21.	A short but excellent suggested reading list.Negatives:1.	Light on neuroscience. The authors purposely intended this book to be for the layperson.2.	I'm a little skeptical at the end results of some of the cases.3.	I would have preferred better terms than Elephant and Rider. Yes on the concept but the terms were lacking.4.	Kindle didn't link notes. In summary, this book was a lot of fun to read. It provided countless cases of interest and the research provided was insightful and surprisingly practical. Much of what I have learned from this book can be applied not only to my personal life but to my work. If you want to learn what it takes to make a change then by all means get this book, I highly recommend it!Further suggestions: “The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do In Life and Business” by Charles Duhigg, “Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us” by Daniel H.

Here is the formula for successful change: ""To change behavior, you've got to direct the Rider, motivate the Elephant, and shape the Path. It you can do all three at once dramatic change can happen.""Direct the Rider: We all have a Rider part of the brain that provides planning and direction. However, the Rider is prone to analysis paralysis. One technique to appeal to the Rider in others is to identify the bright spots.

However, the Elephant is easily demoralized. One technique to appeal to the Elephant in others is to shrink the change. Break large challenges into smaller, manageable tasks that can be acknowledged and rewarded.Shape the Path: We can influence behavior in others by simply making the journey easier.

There are three subsections under each of these steps.1. The Rider (our analytical self). Give clear guidance to the Rider to address his tendency for analysis paralysis in any change situation2. The Elephant (our emotional self). No action or change takes place unless our emotional self is bought in, motivated, has clarity and is not ‘spooked’. He is slow to move but steadfast when put in motion3. The Path – Most change problems are about situations, not people – and these can be controlled. Create a path that minimizes friction while reinforcing the needs of the driver and the elephant, and you can make big changes happen more easilyThe most profound statement in the book is simply this – Big changes start small. We often shoot ourselves in the foot even before we even start when we believe that in order to make big changes, we need to do something really big and consistently.Some of the solutions stated in the book are:– Narrow in on something that works – then copy and promote it– Script Critical Moves– Begin with the End in mind – But begin. Don’t overly analyze.– Emotion (elephant) and Logic (Rider) have to work together.– Find the key that creates the Emotion.– Break Big Goals into small Achievable Tasks– To make changes, change the environment, even if it’s a small change.– Change habits by inculcating new ones.– Keep a support groupAll in all, I loved the book and found it really thought-provoking. That is believe is an important ingredient of a successful book. The examples were very recent (like Amazon) and some of them were pretty unheard of (Brian Wansink & the Pop-Corn Story, Jerry Sternin in Vietnam, the Five-Minute Room Rescue, “Fataki” in Tanzania).So if you are looking for a Fresh New Approach to Change and one that would most seriously and positively work, I believe this is the book you must purchase.Overall RatingA perfect 10 out of 10.Loy Machedoloymachedo.com"
51,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2490942-david,3,"The authors address a simple paradox that is both obvious but somewhat illusive: we all want to improve and we know that improvement requires change, so why is it so hard to do? To answer this, the authors do some good analysis and show examples. At the end of the book, I felt I had some good tools to help me in my quest for change and my power to change others, but it takes more than a few tools to fix an engine. Still, tools are good things. The tools introduced here that stood out to me included the following concepts: • Recognizing that our rational selves are largely dominated by our emotional selves (we are like rational riders on an emotional elephant) and we must coax the elephant, not reason with it, while directing and supporting the exhaustible rider.• “Search for the bright spots”—find where change has worked and replicate it.• Shrink the change, as to not make the task seem so overwhelming.• Specificity—define your goals as specific actions to be done at a certain time, place, and for a certain duration, rather that setting goals that are really just wishful outcomes. Use the desired outcome for keeping your eye on the prize, but focus on the steps.• Use action triggers as setups to pave the way for desired behavior. Anticipate how you’ll try to fool yourself and have a strategy to foil the ambush.I also liked some other concepts they introduced, such as TBU—true but useless, to designate information that may be valid but not actionable; and “Shamo didn’t learn to jump through the hoops by her trainer bitching at her.” All in all, a worthwhile read but won’t change the world."
52,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2976142-thomas-edmund,5,"In my mind there are two forms of non-fiction books on the market. The gimicky and the genuine. One glance at the average rating of Switch will tell you that this piece is the real deal.In a nutshell, switch is basically a thesis in how to effect positive change. The authors target three must hit areas, the rider, the elephant and the path. The rider is the rational part of the human individual, cold analytical and intellegent the rider can direct our behaviour, but only when 'the elephant' or the emotional part of our being is in some form of agreement. The elephant (or our emotions are)is a powerful animal able to carry us far and with great power, but tends to be skittish and moody, and in particular gets anxious when travelling new paths. 'The path' is of course the road in which the rider and elephant walk on.The authors basic premise is that if you can direct the rider (yours or anyone elses) through clear, concise and attractive propositions, tame the elephant through enthusiasm, positive reinforcement and self esteem and make the path an easy road, then change can happen. 'Change' includes any form of improvement from self, to organisational, to societal; throughout the book we see examples from fixing malnutrition in vietnam to improving the economy of small towns and getting up on time in the morning.Switch is an awfully good book written in witty plainspeak that doesn't float down from the ivory tower of academia or oversimplify things to the point of moronity. If you haven't already read this book you're missing out."

Very entertaining to read, SWITCH details why change can be so difficult for individuals, companies and cultures - and how change can be affected without bloodshed or force. It's a book that is immediately applicable to my life, as I have a Rider whose usual rules aren't working, an Elephant that is increasingly stubborn and fearful, and a Path full of obstacles (most of them put there by the Elephant.) While the terms are not the most elegant (and aren't even original to the Heaths, who borrowed them from someone else), they are catchy and intuitive - smoothing the Path of the reader to understanding, as it were. Now when I want to throw a tantrum because my job search is frustrating, I know it's just the recalcitrant Elephant trying to throw the Rider and so get out of working hard. A tough truth to swallow, but it makes it easier for me to reframe the situation and affect the change that needs to happen.SWITCH is not a self-help book - I'd put it in the ""business leadership"" category - but it's an insightful look into how people make decisions and how behavior can be shaped. I'm applying it to my own situation, but as the book makes clear, the ideas can be applied to changing your school, your place of work, or even the world.

55,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/901342-jacob,5,"Another fantastic effort from Chip and Dan Heath. These guys put A LOT of effort into making their work readable, memorable, and actionable so you can actually put their advice to work. It shows in the quality of their writing. In this particular case, they are looking at how to make change happen at the personal, organizational, and societal level when you don't have a lot of direct power. They break it down into tactics for helpinga) your mind to understand better what to do;b) your emotions to support making the change and sticking with it; andc) your environment to make it easier to change and harder not to.In addition to the inspiring success stories, there is at least one ""failure story"", which is the current Food Pyramid. I know, criticizing the Food Pyramid is like fighting a cripple, but at least there is a bad example included in the book. It's great to see failure examples and analyze why they failed and how they might have succeeded, and I wish there were a few more of those kind of examples.As always, bonus points for mentioning Portland, Oregon (Lincoln High School which I pass by on workdays), San Francisco, the TV show Mr. Belvedere, and Rackspace, a company in a field closely related to my current employer."

This was an easy, enjoyable read that really spoke to me as I try to navigate some potential changes in my own life.Chip and Dan Heath make the argument that substantial changes--in business, personal life, or relationships--are sustainable only when the person making the changes is properly motivated. The rational and emotional minds must be in agreement about the benefit of the change, the environment must nurture the change, and the change must be small enough to feel easily attainable. They present evidence for their argument with a series of case studies ranging from couples in counseling to industrial workers trying to decrease workplace accidents to non-profit workers trying to educate people in third-world countries. The quality of the data varies from study to study, and there's certainly a bit of reductive logic in some of their stories, but that's the kind of thing one comes to expect from self-helpy books. There's a nice reference section in the back of the Kindle edition that provides the reader with an opportunity to do more of their own research."
57,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1338233-laura,5,"I've read a lot of books about change. This one I'd recommend to ANYONE who is trying to make changes in their home, work, or personal life. This is a powerful framework that is easy to use (rare!) With so many amazing case studies and great research to back up the process (and give you lots of ideas on how to actually use the principle ideas), this is one of those rare gems that will help you out across the many areas/roles/jobs in your life. The simple metaphor given at the beginning of the book is that our emotional side is an Elephant, and our rational side is its Rider. Even though the Rider seems to have control and the reins, the Elephant's size means that if there is a disagreement over direction, the Rider often loses. (think weight loss for example). This metaphor coupled with the insight that our stores of ""self-control"" are limited, and if you use them up, then you have less to use on the next activity (ie, don't try to change too many things at once! Your self-control/will can get tired!) Extraordinary results come out of these insights. I highly recommend. "
58,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6108634-therese,4,"I ended up recommending this book to everybody in my division at work. It was written very engagingly with a Malcolm Gladwell-style discussion of a lot of different research from different fields, sociology, psychology, management science, and so on. I really liked the way it was structured around the central metaphor of riding an elephant and trying to steer where it goes - the rider can pull the reins, but if the elephant decides it wants to go a different way, the elephant is going to win, the analogy being to the rational thinking mind trying to control the rest of the self. For me one of the best takeaways was the idea of looking at ""bright sides"" - in a situation with a lot of failure, look at what is working and succeeding and expand on that. There were some really cool examples of how that approach led to major improvements in social programs as well as more personal situations."
59,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5590773-juvoni,3,"In a similar fashion to the Heath brother’s other two books Made to Stick and Decisive, using a core analogy, they write a simple, story-driven narrative, backed with years of research in psychology, sociology and other fields showing us the patterns of creating change. The core analogies used are The Rider, which represents our rational mind, the thinker and The Elephant, which represents the emotional mind, the feeler. Switch was just different color paint on the same old car. If you've read The Power of Habit, Willpower of other habit related books Switch will seem repetitive, and there are only so many places they can take the analogy. If you are new to behavioral science, you can learn something thing from Switch, as it's written in a very simple manner. "

It discusses change, at a behavioral level, and uses a simple model (of a rider representing the mind, an elephant representing emotions, and a path representing the environment) to give different tips regarding how a change can be achieved, especially when change is difficult to achieve in that situation. I do strongly recommend everyone read this book. It will help you make desirable changes at both your personal and professional lives."

72,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60057377-stephen-lubin,5,"Switch was a great book. It has a simple title but the book really covers a lot. Its main premise is about how you can people to act differently on any scale: individual, small group, large group, society. It distills down all of the complex ideas of change into a simple action plan: Direct the rider, motivate the elephant, shape the path. With this simple formula, you can plan and initiate any change. This is a book that gives the reader a ton of insight without having to do any of the work. The authors have researched a great number of case studies, performed actual change work themselves, analyzed everything, and packaged it all into a neat little teachable formula. I was really in awe that I was able to get so much from this and all I had to do was read it. I thought their case studies were great and each one was very applicable to the lessons being taught. Change is all around us. You may have a new initiative at work and you need to get your team on board or you may want to change a personal habit, or you may want your spouse to do something differently; the point is that change is a constant and if you can learn how it works you can be more effective in your life. This book will make you better at change, on any scale. Excellent book and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys this genre.Notes From Reading:Your brain has two sides. Rational and emotional. Your mind is not one mind. Throwing away sweets on a diet is your rational side preparing for your emotional side. Your rational side plans and thinks long term. Your emotional side is instant gratification. Most things fail because you can’t keep your emotional side on the path long enough. Direct the rider - provide crystal clear clarityEngage the elephant - get the emotional sideShape the path - change the environment Some is not a numberSoon is not a timeThe power of bright spots. Things that are already working really well in that environment and situation. The rider looks at problems. What’s not working and going wrong. Show the rider where to go with bright spots. What’s working right now and how do we do more of it?Miracle solution thinkingBad is stronger than good. We focus on problems. Imagine feeling joy every time you turned on a light. If a report card came back with 5 A’s and 1 F where would your focus be? We think about problems we think of negative. Negative asymmetrical The most compelling path is the status quo because it is the most familiar. Ambiguity can be paralyzing. The hardest part of change is in the details and a lot of resistance to change. Change can be attributed to a lack of details. Eliminate ambiguity. Bring your goal into everyday behavior. Script the critical moves. Critical moves are the 80/20 moves. See feel change is the method to get the elephant on boardStarting an unpleasant task is always worse than continuing it i.e. cleaning the houseInstant Habits - Action Triggers :When I do this I will do that. Removes the friction of the decision. Your environment has as much to do with your habits as the habits themselves. Change your environment to help change your habits. Checklist prevent mistakes from overconfidence The things that are mission-critical will not get overlooked. You are doing things because you see your peers do them. Peer perception is just as powerful as peer pressure. Keeping the switch going! Positive reinforcement is vitally important. Think of the way animal trainers get animals to do things, they give a reward every time the animal does something correctly. When your child is learning to walk you praise them every time they make a successful attempt at it. Praise the bright spots. We naturally tend to be negative and communal complaining is a strong force at work but if you want to see change then praise the moments of good. It does not have to be condescending or a power struggle. Think of the way you praise someone at the gym, “good job, now one more rep” It's vital we start praising the good. "
73,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4722985-rob-thompson,3,"About the book: Switch examines why it is often difficult for people to switch their behavior, and how, by understanding the mind, it is possible to find shortcuts that make change easier. Through scientific studies and anecdotes, Switch provides simple yet effective tools for implementing changes.About the author: Chip Heath is a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford University, and his brother Dan Heath is a senior fellow at Duke University. They have co-authored two other bestsellers: Made to Stick and Decisive.My highlights:Implementing change is like riding an elephant: choose a direction, give your elephant some peanuts and stick to an easy path.An excellent analogy for examining behavioral change is that of an elephant and its rider trying to follow a certain path. The elephant, being a powerful, stubborn creature, represents the emotional side of people, looking for a quick payoff rather than long-term benefits. The rider in turn represents the rational side that knows what should be done, and can tug at the elephant’s reins to exert some small degree of control over it. Finally, the path represents the situation in which the change is to take place.Find the bright spots, learn from them and spread them around.Find and focus on the so-called bright spots: specific situations or areas where change has already succeeded. Then figure out how change was achieved and leverage these lessons to make the change more widespread.Find the bright spots, learn from them and spread them around.Make the path look well-trodden: show people they are following the herd.Humans are herd animals: in situations where we’re not sure how to behave, we look to others for cues.When trying to change people’s behavior, you can take advantage of this tendency if you demonstrate that the majority of the herd is rallying around the change.Find the minority who support your change and help them strengthen their case by giving them their own space within which to discuss the benefits of the change.Eventually, there will be an inevitable conflict between the “conservatives” and the “reformers.” While this is not desirable, it is necessary.Make the path look well-trodden: show people they are following the herd. Final summaryThe key message in this book is:When you want to change your behavior, three key components affect your chances of success: The rider represents your analytical side, and he needs a clear direction to move in. The elephant represents your emotional side, and it needs to be motivated to walk in the rider’s chosen direction. Finally, the path represents situational factors that are in play, which is why you must shape it to make it easy to follow."
74,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75229826-frances,3,"I have read a fair amount of business/professional development books like this one and this one is unremarkable. Just right exactly in the middle of the road. Like most books of this nature, it *easily* could have been a long article on LinkedIn, maybe a three-part series. Some of the advice is useful. I liked its suggestions and will probably use it as an occasional reference. Other than that, I have the unpleasant feeling you get when you realize you're never getting the time you spent reading a book back. It was just...fantastically mediocre.The authors talk about mental illness and substance abuse in ways that show (a) they don't know what they're talking about and (b) they are depressingly ignorant and privileged people. On page 35, the authors briefly explore (though I feel like the word ""explore"" is too respected a word to use here) solutions-focused therapy. Why go to classical therapist? ""After five years and $50,000, you discover it's all your mom's fault."" It's just a sentence, but its flippant, dismissive tone toward mental health issues and contributes to stigma. I have complex PTSD and I can tell you firsthand that while solutions-focused therapy could probably help me be more organized, it likely wouldn't help me deal with my nightmares or emotional regulation. Little sentences like these keep people from seeking treatment.The bigger problem I had was with how they describe the Vietnam veteran's addition to opium and how it just magically disappeared when he came back home. In ""analyzing"" his success, they say, ""You'd create well-publicized sanctions against drug use. You'd keep the drug economy underground, making former soldiers sneak around to obtain and use drugs. You'd make sure their girlfriends gave them a hard time about their drug use. You'd set up special taboos so that the soldiers would feel derelict, even pathetic, if they kept using."" Great job, Heath brothers, looks like you solved the problem of drug addiction. (Obviously, I'm joking. All of these ""methods"" have been tried, and their effects have been widely derided as ineffective and harmful.) The ridiculous amount of unearned confidence exhibited in these passages (and others) makes it difficult to take anything else they say seriously."
75,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1384268-meredith,5,"This is a super practical, well explained, memorable framework on how to help change happen. I read it because one of my friends who is a behavioral change expert told me this was the best intro book to the concepts. It impressively is relevant across individuals trying to make change in our own lives, leaders wanting to change organizations, and community organizers wanting to spark community wide changes. The main advice is: guide the rider, motivate the elephant, and shape the path. Guide the rider: help our overly analytical rational minds with a very clear, simple target that does not give them analysis paralysis. for example, drink 1% milk is a much more effective and long lasting public health message than ‘eat healthy and exercise’ or even, ‘follow the food pyramid.’ For motivate the elephant, it says our emotional mind has the majority of the say in our decisions, and our elephants are motivated by emotions rather than rational logic. Therefore, in order to make big, long lasting changes, we have to speak directly to our elephants. For example, an executive who wanted to overhaul the company wide procurement system was much more effective at motivating urgent change by collecting hundreds of gloves from different manufacturing plants, labeling them with prices, and piling them all on the board room table for people to see, touch, and feel, than just doing a bunch of excel models and PowerPoint presentations. The pile of gloves was much more motivating to our elephants than any logical argument could be. And finally, shape the path: often, because of the fundamental attribution error, what seems like a people problem is actually a people problem. For example, if you want people to eat less popcorn, instead of launching a public health campaign, just regulate movie theatres to give smaller containers of popcorn. That is much easier and often much more effective. Our most effective Change efforts involve combining all three of the aspects of this framework that is simple and practical to remember and apply. If you want to make a change in your world, on a micro to macro level, I recommend this book as inspiration. "
76,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63967257-dave-neary,5,"I really enjoyed this book, particularly some of the practical exercises in the book, and I would like to start using it for some changes. The analogy of rider, elephant, and path made sense to me, and the few pages at the end of the book summarising the framework, and offering some common patterns for addressing barriers to change, were worth the price of admission on their own.The high level summary is that we resist change if the ""rider"" (our analytical tendencies) don't see an obvious way to make progress, the ""elephant"" (our emotional instincts) are not motivated to go along with the logic, or the ""path"" (the environment that we work in) does not make change easy. For each of these, some techniques are offered to get around the immediate issue - all of the solutions in the book address all three of these to some extent. For example: To ""direct the rider"", you can identify bright spots - teams or individuals who are doing better than others, and identify the things they do differently - then ""script the critical moves"" - condense the change you want to make into an easy checklist or set of actions people can follow - and ""point to the destination"" - remind people what the over-arching end goal is. To ""motivate the elephant"", look for ways that you can ""find the feeling"" - look for a way to get a visceral, emotional reaction (positive toward change, or negative about the status quo), ""shrink the change"" (people are scared of the big pile of laundry, but are happy to spend 10 minutes folding), and ""grow your people"" - tap into people's strong sense of identity, cultivate a growth mindset. Finally, ""shape the path"" - make it easy for people to do the right thing. ""Tweak the environment"" to make it easy for people to do the right things - for example, if people don't submit expense reports on time, where is a good place to remind people? How do you make the task easier? ""Build habits"" - set action triggers so that people do the right thing when some physical thing happens (like the seatbelt noise in the car), or use check-lists to ensure you haven't skipped an important step - and ""rally the herd"" - harness positive peer pressure to reinforce positive behaviour.Full of valuable lessons and anecdotes, it is one of the most useful business books I have read in a long time."
77,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/178942-eric-anest,5,"One of the most helpful books I've read in 2017. Early in the book, the authors say that if you want to change something (yourself, others, your company, or even the world around you), you have to address both the mental and emotional challenges of making that change. Memorably, the authors use the image of someone trying to ride an elephant: you have to give clear direction to the rider (the mental), but you also have to motivate the elephant (the emotional). In addition, you have to ""shape the path"" so that when rider and elephant are working together, they have a common destination.Below is the authors' summary of the book:Direct the Rider Follow the bright spots. Investigate what's working and clone it. Script the critical moves. Don't think big picture, think in terms of specific behaviors. Point to the destination. Change is easier when you know where you're going and why it's worth it.Motivate the Elephant Find the feeling. Knowing something isn't enough to cause change. Make people feel something. Shrink the change. Break down the change until it no longer spooks the Elephant. Grow your people. Cultivate a sense of identity and instill the growth mindset.Shape the Path Tweak the environment. When the situation changes, the behavior changes. So change the situation. Build habits. When behavior is habitual, it's ""free""--it doesn't mentally tax the Rider. Look for ways to encourage habits (e.g., setting situational ""action triggers""). Rally the herd. Behavior is contagious. Help it spread."

Might sound like a disadvantage because emotional decision are not always rations. However its not always bad as it can make you work harder than usual, put blood and sweat for something you believe in. Or it can make you dive-in to take the bullet for a loved one. Even the best of sacrifices are emotionally driven. The Rider - Now that is the logical, analytical part in all of us. It does all these deductive decisions that are precisely calculated. However, its not all good because it could be too critical that it ends up crippling it self not knowing which direction to ride in, due to over thinking and over calculating. The Pathway - That is one of the most important elements. Because if the Rider controls the motivated elephant effectively, BUT they have no pathway, then they simply cannot move. Situations affect our decisions and they authors draw upon this in many examples, like schools, hospitals, companies and societies.This is just the gist of the book. The three elements have a lot of depth to them and this book beautifully shows how all three elements interact and depend on one another.Must read for Leaders, Decision Makers, Students, Parents basically everybody"

Find what's working and think how I can do more of it. Solves a lot of the ""not invented here"" challenges too.Focus on behaviours, not goals and outcomes. Reminds me of the Growth without Goals philosophy. Daily habits and behaviours are the best way I can initiation change in myself and others.People don't analyze => think => change.

(specific instructions)*To get a “free ride” in implementing change, build new habits and make the environment enforce them. (create triggers and checklists)*Make the path look well-trodden: show people they are following the herd. (when majority supports the initiative, make it more visible. When small group has adapted it, give them space to grow). “What’s working, and how can we do more of it?” Sounds simple, doesn’t it? Yet, in the real world, this obvious question is almost never asked. Instead, the question we ask is more problem focused: “What’s broken, and how do we fix it?”"
81,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4047156-christopher-perrin,4,"We all have something we want to change. It might be an organization; it might be your home. All of us, if we’re honest, want to change ourselves. If you work for a school, I am sure you can create a quick list of five items you would like to change that would improve the institution. So how do you set out to make a change? Another book by Chip and Dan Heath might change the way you think about change. They have written Switch: How to Change Things When Change is Hard, their second collaborative book. They also wrote Made to Stick, a book I enjoyed enough to make me pick up Switch. One has to admire the way the Heath brothers write: they start with some entertaining anecdotes that illustrate the entire sweep of the book, a few stories that illustrate their premise that in order to affect change you must provide people with clear direction, ample motivation and a supportive environment. Change, they say, tends to follow a pattern and we should pay attention to that pattern. That is the heart of the book. But these three insights (seem basic don’t they?) come to life in the dozens of stories and studies that the brothers cite. Nothing is left to didactic prose. Metaphors, along with stories abound.The brothers start their book recounting a study that showed that people will eat more popcorn if you put the popcorn in larger containers. The study showed that people eating out of large container would eat 53% more popcorn than those eating out of medium-sized container—even when the popcorn was five days old. Later on in the book the brothers cite another person who discovered that people will eat less food when it served on smaller plates. These studies point out that sometimes “what looks like a people problem is often a situation problem.” Change the environment, and you might change behavior. Certainly a good schoolteacher can tell you as much. Teachers spend a good deal of time setting up their room and creating and environment “that is conducive to learning.” Even a pleasantly-designed book (preferably a hardback) with a spacious and readable font is more likely to be read and enjoyed. I can still remember resisting several great books that came to me on crammed pages of newsprint with banal covers. The same book in hardback—where’s a comfy chair and a quiet place? What kind of books do you give your students?The Heath brothers also cite a study that shows that people grow tired when they work for long periods exerting self-control. The study showed that a group of college students who had to resist eating freshly-baked chocolate-chip cookies became mentally drained while they instead completed an experiment in which they had to eat radishes (they were told the other group coming in would experiment on the cookies). When these cookie-resisters were asked to solve an unsolvable geometric problem as a group, they gave up after just eight minutes while the other, cookie-eating group spent nineteen minutes on the task, trying thirty-four times to solve the puzzle. The point: directly supervising your behavior is draining. Therefore what sometimes looks like resistance or laziness may just be exhaustion. Is there a school application? Sure. Think of those fidgety boys who must strain their little minds to keep pencil on paper during math class. Many are not worth teaching by 1pm, appearing lazy and disengaged. Are they simply mentally worn-out from supervising their behavior? Quite possibly. Why does recess bring them back to life? For twenty minutes they run about like mad men supervising virtually nothing. Mental strength returns. In another place in Switch, the Heath brothers suggest that presenting others with a clear destination is crucial for motivating and leading people to change. Their first illustration features a first grade teacher who announced to her students that they would be reading as third graders (yes, third graders) by the end of the year. The teacher knew the reading standards for third grade and believed she could get the students to that level. The class, of course, was captivated and energized. They rallied to this noble goal and learned that they were scholars and addressed each other as such. A scholar, they learned, was easy to define: “A scholar is someone who lives to learn and is good at it.” At springtime her class was reading at second grade level and she held a graduation ceremony for them. By the end of the year, 90% of the class was reading at the third grade level. The Heath brothers maintain that a clear, ambitious goal (reading like third graders) united this class and dissolved their resistance to change. Does your school (or class, or leadership team) have a clear picture of the destination you seek? Can you define the character, knowledge and skill a graduate of your school should possess? Clearly, in writing?The classical Christian educator might point out that lasting change comes from the heart of a child that is led to love God and neighbor. Furthermore, shouldn’t we be skeptical of change that is based on changing the environment? I found nothing Switch that contradicted changes that comes from spiritual transformation. But change as a broad concept cannot be reduced only to the spiritual dimension as profoundly important as that dimension is. And who can deny that our environment does contribute to our disposition, mood and work? The Heath brothers do not argue that change is determined by environment, just that it is one important factor that shapes change—along with other factors. The Heath brothers bring to us something akin to the wisdom literature of Scripture—they have observed practical ways humans are motivated, influenced and conditioned to change. We might read in the Proverbs that “the plans of the diligent lead to profit as surely as haste leads to poverty” (Pr. 21:5). The Heath brothers also reduce their findings to some proverbial expressions: What looks like a people problem is often a situation problem. What looks like laziness is often exhaustion. Clarity dissolves resistance. Switch just might do more that suggest some proverbial change for your school. It might help you change as well. "

The process the authors describe for change is relevant to personal and family life as well as to organizational change.Easy to read, well-written, and sometimes laugh-out-loud hilarious, medical professionals will especially appreciate all the examples of organizational change in the hospital setting (a deeply entrenched industry).This book also addresses decision paralysis, which often happens when people are faced with too many options.It also addresses the fact that self-control is an exhaustible resource. What looks like laziness is sometimes exhaustion. And what looks like opposition is sometimes lack of clarity. E.g., when you tell a child, ""Stop misbehaving,"" what does that mean? If you say instead, ""Please do not interrupt me when I am talking,"" that is easily understood. Likewise, when a boss tells employees they need to ""be more productive,"" what does that mean? If instead employees are told, ""You need to please respond to all emails and phone messages within 48 hours,"" that is clearly and easily understood.The book also discusses the Fundamental Attribution Error, namely, what looks like a people/character problem is often a situation problem.You will get a ton of good info and methods out of this book!"
83,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4354905-jonathan-brooker,5,"This writing style of the Heath brothers that is reminiscent of Malcolm Gladwell is some of the most absolutely enjoyable reading for me to consume. It stimulates the mind for creativity while delivering study after study (that could frankly kill creativity or brain power at all). It moves the heart (something perhaps hard to imagine from a business-directed book). And it reads like narrative, perhaps because of all of the metaphors and stories used. The value of this book is its simplicity. Whereas many books like this are criticized for taking 200+ pages to say something a page or two could say, these authors embrace both realities. They freely offer a cliff notes version of their content, which I will now soon be putting up in my office to keep as a regular reminder. And they offer 200+ pages of gold that builds on that casing of raw quality content.Change is one of the most formidable opponents because we have such strong emotional reactions, mental hurtles, and situational struggles to it. Yet we know that improvement comes when we can figure out and make the right changes. This book wonderfully walks the reader through how they can go from start to finish (and all those hurtles in between) in navigating change. It's specific enough to be useful and vague enough in its application to be useful to just about anyone in leadership (whether a CEO or parent)."
84,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6068401-dave-b,2,"An interesting read with helpful points. At times this book felt to clinical without the foundation of statistical data. The points of the book are very straight forward theoretically: We change habits and organizations by directing the rider (our analytic side), motivating the elephant (our emotional side) and setting the path (establishing constraints). There are a series of steps for each of the three aspects but I won’t go into that detail for this review. Although the points are useful for change management I didn’t always agree with the litany of examples. The author picks and crafts examples that reinforce the argument (honestly speaking this is what most leadership/management books do). The problem is that most of the examples lack a force of belief in the concept presented. Most examples could have been argued for or against the topic. There are other times where the example can have one slight change and the argument falls flat. With 75-80 percent of the book containing examples for the key points I couldn’t give this book more than 2 stars it was ok. I would have gained as much insight from a two page article in the Harvard Review. "

I don't know who said that, but they should read this book.I don't typically read non-fiction, especially not the motivational / self-help variety, but a group of teachers at my school read Switch as part of an online summer book club. I can't turn down a free book, a group chat, and a $50 stipend.Surprise! It's good stuff. Switch is packed with stories of real life problems that inspired positive changes. It teaches us about the psychology of change (super interesting tidbits) and how we can successfully adjust our own behavior as well as influence the behavior of groups.Nobody can deny there's a lot of things in this world that need fixing. Change can and should happen on every level. In a perfect world it would be the political leaders of every nation studying Switch as their book club selection of the month. But start with yourself and see where it takes you."
86,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64528406-david-gutierrez,4,"I will give 4 starts because the audio book narration is horrible. The voice is monotonous, linear and  almost without any intonation . To make any difference between the narrator and a robot you will need to be an expert in sound systems. However the book itself is fantastic. I personally learnt a lot of things from it . For example to make big changes , it does not matter too much the understanding of the fact , or your agreement with the facts. It is important an emotional connection to the issue. And that could very likely promote the change.I was told this a lot of time in my life , however it was not until I read this book, with plenty of examples that the analytical mind on me succumbed to the simple fact of rise an emotion on others to make changes. I still feel this cynical , but I guess it is worth it when you are trying to accomplish better for others.Another thing was the recognition efforts before the recognition of goals.But then again , as Charles Chaplin said; In this life we are all beginners , there is no time for anything else.DG"
87,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6697194-liz,5,"I loved this book. Possibly one of the best non-fiction books I have ever read. The Heath brothers as the authors are incredibly clever and taking everyone's research and synthesizing it into a conversational read that is both interesting and sticks. In this book they clearly explain why change is hard, how we self sabotage, and how to make change possible for ourselves, our teams and organisations. With lots of examples and stories that you will remember. The key is message is that our brain is two systems- emotional (elephant) and thinker (Rider). In order to create change successfully we have to engage both systems and provide a very clear and easy path. So many gems in this book that I am using across a lot of spheres in my life. Would highly recommend whatever the change you are hoping to make."
88,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49300992-laurelin,5,"Switch: How to Change Things When Change is Hard is one of the rare books I actually feel compelled to buy and not just borrow so that I can revisit it over and over again whenever I'm facing a roadblock at work or in my personal life. I actually had to stop reading the book before bed because rather than relaxing me into sleep, it fired up my mind with ideas. I found all of the lessons extremely helpful and illustrative. I loved the inspiring stories, simple but effective tips, and easy-to-read prose. The book is a prime example of an actually helpful self-help book, and I've already printed out the summary of the book's main messages to tack onto my whiteboard at work. I'm excited to tell all my friends and coworkers about Switch, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to make a big change in their lives!"
89,0385528752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87028796-katherine-coble,5,"Excellent book that I'm actually going to use in counseling my clients who hire us for change communications. It really speaks to the simple reasons why change is so hard and what we can do to make it easier. The basic idea is that we're governed by a rational side and an emotional side (duh) and that we can do three basic things to make change easier. Direct the rider (the rational side) by giving clear direction, following bright spots, scripting critical moves and pointing to the destination. Second, we can motivate the elephant (the emotional side) by finding the feeling, shrinking the change and growing people. Last, we can shape the path to make the journey of change easier by tweaking the environment, building habits and rallying the herd. There are a lot of great examples of what each of these things mean in more detail and ways to implement them. Probably my favorite line from this book (and there were MANY) was in the section about how we have to reinforce all of the things we put in place if we want our change to stick: ""Shamu didn't learn to jump through a hoop because her trainer was bitching at her. She learned because she had a trainer who was patient and focused and reinforced every step of the journey."""
