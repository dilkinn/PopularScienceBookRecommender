0,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7319106-kim-pallister,1,"This was a horrible book. I gave up on it a third of the way through. I'm not sure why people give the author high marks. Perhaps his earlier works are better and he phone this one in.The book claims to look at scientific advances in a number of fields (computers, biology, etc), and drawing from interviews with hundreds of leading scientists, make predictions about the next 90 years.What it does instead is the worst kind of pop-science futurism. The author picks and chooses from science that supports his favorite hypotheses, and then draws them out to extreme predictions. In doing so he pays almost no attention to factors that could influence other directions, gives no insight into his calculations (if any were done) on how to get to the endpoint. I'm OK with the idea of making concepts accessible to the layperson, but the leap from there to ""trust me, I'm a scientist"" is one that goes too far.In addition, the areas of the book he covered that I have some expertise in (silicon design and manufacturing, augmented reality, virtual reality) were so riddled with error, unimaginative future use cases, and misuse of terminology, that I couldn't trust him on other areas in which I'm not an expert.To add insult to injury, he uses a horrible amount of adverb-laden hyperbole. The first chapter alone had enough ""we will have the power of the gods of mythology!"" mentions that I almost didn't make it to chapter two."
1,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,4,"ENGLISHWhat a significant and visionary milestone in the evolution of the entertaining non-fiction book. How difficult it sometimes has to be to breathe life into the scientific genre can be measured by the memory of the response to textbooks at school, which can happily be described as mixed. In some areas, more competition and free competition would pay off in exceptional cases. The book can be used as an example of the gems that non-fiction authors can master, as a collection of future technologies, trimmed for readability for laypersons and pure entertainment value. As the author has already subdivided into possible, unlikely and impossible technologies in previous works, in this book, he divides the 21st century into three periods and uses selected thematic blocks to show the future development in time-lapse. The topic is located in the theoretically possible, but still untried and the unconfirmed terrain. The trick, especially in category three at the end of the century, which is sometimes hard to believe, is that all technologies, machines, materials, and processes have already been tried out and their realization is possible. Of course, the time to implementation is estimated, but no thought of the book is mere guesswork or science-fiction. Instead, it is based on verifiable facts for which Kaku has interviewed several scientists, visited their laboratories and refined them into a compressed compendium. In particular, the apparent structure and easy-to-understand language let one visually walk through the considerable number of pages in no time.Especially for fans of Futurism and all related genres, there are mountains of ideas and fantasy creations whose realizability does not harm the imagination in any way. Instead, on the contrary, it gives additional impetus to the notion that, if achievements that are impossible shortly become possible, the developmental thrust will be all the more astonishing in centuries. It is also amazing how many founding fathers of science fiction have correctly predicted the development down to the last detail. Also, how many current genre representatives, due to the galloping research, run the risk of accidentally slipping into the typical genre of novels, as their visionary ideas suddenly become an everyday occurrence overnight.The grandiose ability of Kaku to make all the boring and dust-dry natural sciences so lively and exciting should be a guiding principle for authors of all non-fiction literature. Mainly if they write for the education sector, as understandability and entertainment value, especially in this area, unfortunately, often fall by the wayside. The only unworkable utopia is that internationally successful and wealthy authors are beginning to transform the antiquated school material. Alternatively, underpaid schoolbook authors will be kissed overnight by the Muse and mutate into dazzling narrators. Unfortunately, both will not happen so soon, even though it would be so important, given the educational misery and partly old foundations, to sow the enthusiasm for knowledge acquisition where one would expect it. At school.GERMANWelch ein famoser und visionärer Meilenstein in der Evolution des unterhaltsamen Sachbuchs.Wie schwer es mitunter sein muss, dem Wissenschaftsgenre Leben einzuhauchen, lässt sich an der Erinnerung an die Resonanz auf Schulbücher ermessen, welche mit Glück als durchwachsen bezeichnet werden kann. In manchen Bereichen würde sich mehr Konkurrenz und freier Wettbewerb ausnahmsweise eben doch auszahlen. Als Beispiel für die Perlen, die Sachbuchautoren gelingen können, kann diese auf Lesbarkeit für Laien und Unterhaltungswert getrimmte Sammlung zukünftiger Technologien gelten. Wie der Autor schon in vorangegangenen Werken eine Unterteilung in mögliche, unwahrscheinliche und unmögliche Technologien vorgenommen hat, so unterteilt er in diesem Buch das 21 Jahrhundert in 3 Zeiträume und zeigt anhand ausgewählter Themenblöcke die zukünftige Entwicklung im Zeitraffer. Dabei ist die Thematik im rein theoretisch möglichen, aber noch unerprobten und unbestätigten Terrain angesiedelt. Der, besonders in Kategorie 3 gegen Ende des Jahrhundert mitunter schwer zu glaubende, Kniff an der Sache ist, dass sämtliche Technologien, Maschinen, Materialien und Verfahren bereits erprobt wurden und ihre Realisierung möglich ist. Natürlich sind die Zeiträume bis zur Verwirklichung Schätzungen, nur entspricht kein Gedanke des Buches bloßer Vermutung oder Science-Fiction. Sondern fußt auf überprüfbaren Fakten, für deren Zusammentragung Kaku etliche Wissenschaftler interviewt, deren Laboratorien besichtigt und zu einem komprimierten Kompendium zusammengepresst hat. Besonders die übersichtliche Struktur und angenehm verständliche Sprache lassen einen die beträchtliche Seitenanzahl im Nu visuell durchwandern.Gerade für Freunde von Futurismus und allen damit zusammenhängenden Genres finden sich Berge an Ideen und Fantasiegebilden, deren Realisierbarkeit der Imagination in keiner Weise schadet. Sondern sie im Gegenteil durch die Vorstellung zusätzlich beflügelt, dass wenn in so verhältnismäßig naher Zukunft unmöglich gedachte Errungenschaften möglich sein werden, der Entwicklungsschub in Jahrhunderten noch umso erstaunlicher anmuten wird. Erstaunlich ist auch, wie viele Gründerväter der Science Fiction die Entwicklung bis ins Detail richtig prognostiziert haben. Und wie viele aktuelle Genrevertreter aufgrund der galoppierenden Forschung Gefahr laufen, unbeabsichtigt ins normale Romangenre zu rutschen, da ihre gerade noch visionären Ideen über Nacht plötzlich Alltag werden. Die grandiose Fähigkeit Kakus, all die als langweilig und staubtrocken gebrandmarkten Naturwissenschaften so lebendig und spannend zu gestalten, sollte Autoren sämtlicher Sachliteratur ein Leitbild sein. Besonders wenn sie für den Bildungssektor schreiben, da Verständlichkeit und Unterhaltungswert gerade in diesem Bereich leider häufig auf der Strecke bleiben. Womit die einzige undurchführbare Utopie wohl ist, dass international erfolgreiche und wohlhabende Autoren beginnen den antiquierten Schulstoff umzugestalten. Oder unterbezahlte Schulbuchautoren über Nacht von der Muse geküsst werden und zu blendenden Erzählern mutieren. Beides wird leider nicht so bald geschehen, obwohl es angesichts von Bildungsmiseren und einem teils antiquierten Fundamenten ruhenden Lernstoff so wichtig wäre, die Begeisterung für Wissenserwerb dort zu säen, wo man ihn eigentlich vermuten würde. In der Schule."
2,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,5,"Lot of thrilling stuff here in one competent package from a scientist who puts on a futurologist’s hat to give us a tour of how far science will advance and change society over the next 100 years. His topics cut a broad swath with chapters on each of the following: computers, artificial intelligence, medicine, nanotechnology, energy, space travel, wealth, and humanity’s stages of civilization. It’s fun to hear from a knowledgeable writer just how likely it is we will achieve many of the themes of science fiction. Ordinarily, I digest technological progress in little blips of news pieces or brief magazine features that tend to bounce off my mind. I know from my own experience how science accomplishments get hyped and distorted in the media. For these reasons, it was very satisfying to get updates and reasoned projections on a wide variety of fields of work The doubling of computer processing power each year has gone on for decades, conforming to Moore’s Law. Continued shrinking of transistor size driving this progression will soon reach a limit based on quantum limits to how small circuit templates can be etched. Still, before that limit is reached, computing capacity will be astounding and cheap processing power will be emdedded everywhere imaginable. Some of you will have played with the Android mobile phone voice interface Siri. I asked it ""Why is There Air?"", and in seconds it gave me a link to the Bill Cosby routine video from 1964. Pretty handy power already here. The recent release of Google glasses points the way to where portable computing combined with wireless Internet access might take us. Kaku projects that the only screen we will need in the future will a transparent one within contact lenses. Circuits with microlasers are under way that can beam data or video images right on the retina.Computing power readily translates into great success in playing chess, which is based on picking the best move from projecting zillions of possible responses of the opponent. However, true artificial intelligence (AI) progress is stuck in a rut. Attempts to program in autonomy are stymied by barriers in achieving performance based on common sense, and pattern recognition is barely at the level of the mosquito. But “bottom up” approaches for robots learning from errors are beginning to hold promise, and simulations based on brain circuitry are becoming a focus. On the question of when computers with advanced articifical intelliegence will achieve self consciousness (“singularity” in sci fi parlance), Kaku doesn’t know whether to side with those that say 20 years, others who say 100 years, or still others who say never. Unlike the Termnator scenario with Skynet starting a machine-human war, the author thinks we will make sure our robots are kind, addressing the contradictions possible in Asimovs 3 laws and avoiding the temptation to automate Predator drones in warfare. The medicine section of the book was fun for me due to my background in biomedical science and recent work on telemedicine programs. Having a computer interface through contact lenses and wireless voice control should prove pretty effective in medical care and emergency medicine. Kaku book predicts that within 100 years humans will to be able to control computers with their mind. Already we have paraplegics with scalp sensors linked to computer controls that they can write email and play 3D games. Next will be mind-controlled arms and legs for such patients. So maybe we won't have war with machines like Terminator movies make hay with. Biotechnology fused with nanotechnology has a lot of room for speculative scenarios. And if the genetic folks look like they are headed toward bringing back the mammoth, should we try to recover the Neanderthal? Would we put them in a zoo or Harvard? Are we on the way to being able to make a Jurassic Park? Though DNA is too degraded, maybe we can make a generic dinosaur by interpolating between bird and lizard genomes to recreated the ancestral genes. If the snake retains the genes for legs in a suppressed state, maybe some ancient genes are already in there.Nanotechnology’s promise of “making something from nothing” is still far from achieving machines that can carry out molecular assembly from raw materials. Still Kaku does a good job in covering early stages in progress along these lines and the technical issues involved. He has a nicely concentrated discussion over the implications of a future society where jobs and work are largely unneeded. The worker’s mantra of “each according to his ability” will change into “to each according to his desire.” Similar to many sci fi renderings, many believe that:…without the motivating factor of scarcity and money, it could lead to a self-indulgent, degenerate society that sinks to its lowest level. Only a handful of the most artistically motivated will strive to write poetry. The rest of us, the critics’ claim, will become good-for-nothing loafers and slackers. For the future of energy, he is deft and informative about progress on initiatives such as hydrogen powered cars, fusion plants, solar energy plants in orbit, and frictionless transportation using magnetic lifting driven with superconductivity. For the future of space travel, he seems reasonable in his projections for colonies on the moons of Earth and other planets and exploration of asteroids. Serious work is going on the dream of a space elevator, but prospects for massive production of materials strong enough to sustain such a device are unclear. Kaku favors the likelihood of detecting an alien civilization, but he is pretty cautious in predicting the sci fi dream of spaceships with “ramjet” engines scooping up hydrogen as fuel for a fusion engine or with antimatter drives. Instead he seems to favor unmanned interstellar exploration by tiny craft with self-replicating miniature robots, possibly in the form swarming nanobots that can join up in various ways to morph into diverse machines.The book is an easy read for people with only modest scientific literacy. For sci fi fans, it should whet their appetite even more for wonders of the future."
3,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,1,"This books is more about the TECHNOLOGY of the future than the physics thereof.Really, if you've kept up with Tech news, you can just skip reading this book...I counted no fewer than 34 references to ""God"" or ""gods"", a bad sign on it's own.There is more time dedicated to ancient mythology than to actual physics!The most annoying is the indicative future used without proper qualifiers.For example, he says something ""will happen"", instead of examining the LIKELIHOOD that it will happen.This is Kaku's worst writing habit, his hyperbolic/extreme language a close second.He loves to use words like ""telepathy"" and ""magic"" when he really means mind-machine interfaces and advanced technology.His over-confident tone is made worse by the preposterousness of some of the claims!Kaku bizarrely champions Kurzweil and like-mined wearers of tinfoil hats.The whole singularity silliness is transparent nonsense to computer scientists.Kaku's proposed ""Caveman principle"" is moronic, he really needs to re-read ""The Selfish Gene""...This book is full of historical inaccuracies, if not dubious over-simplifications.Kaku blames human aging on 2nd law of thermodynamics, which is entirely incorrect.Aging is caused primarily by the shortening of telomeres, which is controlled by the genes.He goes on to correctly describe this, but his description contradicts this prior, false claim.The book is full of these outrageous claims which seem not to be meant literally at all.Rather, his writing style is to vomit extreme sounding language at the reader, presumably for entertainment.This ""Discovery Channel"" bullshit is horribly offensive, and intellectually dishonest.Kaku colorfully describes frogs and flies as ""lower organisms"", as if to mock readers with a High School education.As if to prove how out of touch he is, Kaku proposes it will soon be common place to have one's genome on CD-ROM.CD-ROM? Who still uses CD-ROMs?! Get with the program, grandpa!!I can't count the number of times I vented my frustration by saying ""cool story, bro"" aloud while reading this book...On a lighter note, the book includes a good commentary on economic bubble, and the changing world of music/newspapers.The final message of the book is that ""the people living today are the most important ever"".This is justified by our being the generation building a ""planetary civilization"".I can't stand this sort of arrogant, self-centered grandiosity."
4,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2624548-robert-kroese,3,"I got this book out of the local library because I heard the author on NPR and the book sounded interesting. I'm doing research for a near-future sci-fi novel and this sounded right up my alley.First of all, the title is a misnomer. This book should be called Technology of the Future, as it's only tangentially about physics. The prose is painfully bad at times, tending toward cliches and mixed metaphors. Consider this gem, for example:""Like a kid in a candy store, he delights in delving into uncharted territory, making breakthroughs in a wide range of hot button topics.""Or this one:""In a word, perhaps no.""I found the references to Greek mythology and current cinema strained and pointless, and most of the content of the book is dumbed down to an almost ridiculous degree. It's also somewhat vague, repetitive and occasionally self-contradictory. Kaku is very ""gee whiz isn't this neat"" about everything and his attempt to deal with the social and ethical ramifications of the technologies he's gushing about read like essays written for a high school English assignment.Still, there are some really cool ideas hidden amongst the nonsense, so if you get the book from the library like I did and skim through all the blather, it's worth picking up."
5,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2758662-marty-essen,5,"This is probably not a book some hard-core science fuddy-duddy is going to enjoy. But if you are just fascinated by learning new things or contemplating the future, this soft-core science book is for you.For me, any book that makes learning fun is a good one. Just think of how many people will pick up Professor Kaku's book that haven't read much more than a science-related newspaper article since high school!My favorite sections of Physics of the Future were the chapters on the Future of Energy (especially his discussion on global warming) and the Future of Space Travel (especially his discussion on nanoships). But so much is covered here that most people will find something that piques their interest.Professor Kaku has a gift for making learning about science wonderful and exciting. And in this book, he'll make you ""think of the possibilities!""Marty Essen, author of Cool Creatures, Hot Planet: Exploring the Seven Continents"
6,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2764493-mike-mullin,3,"Excellent when Kaku focuses on technology, physics or string theory. When he veers onto other topics such as history, education, or culture Kaku produces about one WTF? statement per page. Not only are his opinions on these subjects often totally unsupported by evidence, they occasionally contradict other assertions found a few pages away. Even when Kaku sticks with what he knows, his predictions for the future seem almost laughably optimistic and naive. Every problem has a technological solution that, like a glittery rainbow unicorn, will swoop down to make us happier and wealthier. Never mind that all technologies have dark sides--in one blackly humorous passage Kaku extols the virtues of antimatter as rocket fuel while briefly sweeping over its potential as a global suicide device. By the fiftieth time Kaku used the phrase ""In the future,"" I was thinking: In the future, we'll all have access to drugs as good as the ones Kaku's taking right now."
7,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17430801-faith,5,"I had not heard of this author until I read that former President Clinton was reading a couple of his books. Now I plan to read more by him. This book gave me a lot to think about and explained technology and concepts in a way that made them accessible to me. Fortunately, the author writes about a lot more than physics. He covers many areas of the sciences and social sciences and interweaves ideas from various disciplines in a comprehensible and entertaining manner."

9,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"A light fun albeit selective exploration of the future of technology. From internet connected contact lenses and magnetic cars to starships and designer children, Kaku identifies many of the possible advances to occur in the next 100 years. If his optimistic presentation holds it will be a great time to live. His greatest concern seems to be global warming which in his hopeful projections, mankind is able to handle. However he just touches the problem of man’s violent history and leaves out the future of weaponry and other sinister uses of technology. With all the conflict in the world as I read this from the Ukraine to Africa to the Middle East to Ferguson Missouri, it is hard for me to feel as upbeat as the author. Kaku’s wondrous world of 2100 could be, but will it? Perhaps his quote of Gandhi at the end best expresses the challenges we humans face to make it another 100 years:The Roots of Violence:Wealth without work,Pleasure without conscience,Knowledge without character,Commerce without morality,Science without humanityWorship without sacrifice,Politics without principles."

But now I kinda do! Michio Kaku made it all accessible while not dumbing it down at all - he's just got a great writing voice and way of expressing things that's easy to follow. Obviously knows what he's talking about and cares about giving you as much information, in as engaging a way as possible. In general just a lot of fun to read and experience!"
11,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75241261-armina-salemi,5,What else could I ask for?
12,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2494540-colin-bendell,4,"Wow. I'm super excited about the future! Michio Kaku connects work being accomplished the labs with the applications in the future. This isn't about imagining some mythical utopia, but looking at the discoveries and inventions that exist today and how they can be combined and utilized in the future once the economies of scale and mass production are flushed out. For example: We already can remotely control micro robots and we have the ability to analyze cells on a single micro chip. In the future we should be able to inject micro controlled robots into the blood stream that then can perform biopsies and analyze the results instantaneously. The only odd thing about the book is that Kaku seemed to reference 'Pentium' chips numerous times in the first half. It was almost as if the first part of the book was written a decade ago when people still knew what Pentium chips were.On a personal note, I am not filled with dread of a future when moores law has hit a physical ceiling where chips can't get any faster. What will we do?!"
13,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9021165-sam-lichtenstein,1,"I read a couple hundred pages on an airplane, and I regret having made an impulse-purchase of this book in the airport bookstore. Like others, I was disturbed by the poor writing (annoying tone, repetitive and useless allusions to mythology, weird Star Trek obsession...). And as others stressed (and which if I'd had more time before my flight I might have realized by skimming more thoroughly before purchasing), this book has practically no physics in it. At some point I might go back and read some of Kaku's predictions in more detail, but on the whole they strike me as no more illuminating than the guesses of anyone even modestly familiar with some of the early-stage technologies the author is riffing on. In particular, there is very little depth in his analysis of the impact caused by various technological shifts. For (what strikes me as) more incisive futurism, I suggest the work (especially on ""ems"" or whole-brain emulation) of economist Robin Hanson. "

One advantage of a patients intestines and detect cancers, without the inconvenience of sticking a 6 foot long tube up the large intestine.In addition, DNA chips are alsio being created which detect mutated genes when youblow on them. That'ss just a sample of the technology being created.I love the Michio Kaku's writing style, he is not only scientific but he describes the future in a way you can actually picture it your mind.An interesting book that predicts the future within the next decades to the next century by a physicist. So, I highly suggest this book if you like physics and technology."
15,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3440334-fred-forbes,4,"I had the pleasure of hearing Michio Kaku speak at a convention and figured if his books are as thought provoking as his speeches, I should grab one. He does write well but I think the title of this one is a bit misleading. It ranges far beyond physics to a variety of sciences to lay out a timeline of coming advances but most importantly it goes far beyond science to human relationships, economics and trade and personal lifestyle. Probably the most intriguing development to me it the incorporation of computers into a contact lens that is capable of being controlled telepathically and that can perform all the functions that current machines do and more. Pick up a copy in a bookstore or library, read the last section which describes a ""day in life"" of a person on New Year's day in 2100. If that doesn't pique your interest in knowing how he got there, probably not your type of book, but it was certainly mine!"
16,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350659-michael,5,"When I was little I had a book about what would happen in the future, and it was one of my favorite things. Heavy on illustrations. I remember that the pictures were of people in floating cars, buildings under water, that sort of thing. Fanciful and mostly just made up, but tons of fun to think about. I am wishing right now I knew where it was. I guess there's no way that book or anyone could have imagined what actually has happened! Much more impressive in many ways. Hell, the internet came out well after I started college. This is from a much respected physicist. Probably as well-known for hosting documentaries and such as any work he's done. A spokesman for Physics. He's on the Science Channel and Discovery Channel all the time. Even the History Channel. Michio Kaku. A celebrity scientist, very smart guy. Japanese descent, well-spoken, and able to convey the excitement of scientific discovery as well as anyone I've seen. He works at City College in NYC, where I was trying to be a doctor. Ha! Of course whatever particle physics classes he was teaching were waaay over my head. But I met him in the hall a couple of times and said ""Hey, love your shows!"" This book is great. He takes the large scale view of many differing technologies. Nanotech, biotech, genetics, computers, energy, robotics, space exploration, and more. And he speculates where these things are going, and often how they will converge. The book is both wildly speculative and well-grounded in current science. Tough to do. It has to be taken with a grain of salt, but Dr Kaku makes a solid case each and every time for where he thinks things are going. I am getting this one for dad."
17,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2700343-pamela-slytherpuff,1,"See more of my reviews at Bettering Me Up.I was really disappointed in this book. I was expecting more information on physics (darn the title for misleading me!) and was instead presented with a book about the future of technology. Which is cool, since that's my field of expertise and I've seen some of the things that Kaku mentioned in the book.There were some glaring omissions (where is Virgina Tech's CHARLI? And no DARwin? He's the RoboCup champ, for goodness sake!) in the AI section, though it's possible I skimmed over them while my mind was wandering. I'm not going back to check.After I finished the first two chapters, I could read no further.The writing made me cringe. I'm surprised that an editor didn't catch some mistakes: lack of proper grammar (especially colons and semicolons); repeating information from previous paragraphs; cliches and hyperbole; and so on. Kaku repeated the phrase ""it may take decades to accomplish this feat"" over and over. And over and over and over. Well, yes. This is a book about the future, right? (Darn the misleading title again!)"
18,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35931700-george-saoulidis,5,Great foundation for hard sci-fi inspiration. Mr Kaku is a well educated nerd and we love him for it.
19,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/679134-bryan-alexander,3,"Physics of the Future is a light, breezy account of where many scientists and technologists saw their fields advancing as of 2011. It's a nice historical document in that way, and also a very easy to read sketch of the future from an expert perspective. It's also a very positive, optimistic book.Michio Kaku breaks things down by scientific and technological disciplines, exploring each one in turn: artificial intelligence, energy, space travel, health care, computing (again), nanotechnology, and industry (dubbed ""wealth""). He invokes a mythological figure for each chapter, not to show off but to embody his thesis: ""By 2011, out destiny is to become like the gods we once worshipped and feared."" (10) Personally I think things will be as likely to turn out in terms of Lovecraftian horror.I give Kaku credit for doing the interviews underpinning this book. He connects with some fine folks, notably the criminally underappreciated Mark Weiser (19ff), sf writer Greg Benford (142)But I have many issues with Physics of the Future, starting with its tunnel vision. Yes, it's a book about scientific development, yet Kaku can't help himself from speculating about politics, business, and culture. These reflections are glancing blows, far too brief to be useful, and often simply naive or bizarre. There's a discussion of the entertainment industry without taking copyright seriously. He calls for a scramble for controlling the world, but doesn't see this as, say, destructive (unless he's fine with that: see 297). Kaku discourses on energy in the laboratory, which is fine (although too bullish on fusion for me), but then offers suggestions for companies that fly in the face of everything we know about the energy industries and their politics. His coda, a science fiction imagining of some days in the life in 2100, manages to envision a person's immediate experience while flailing into a cartoonish socio-cultural void.I can take issue with speculations in each chapter. There's not enough on peer to peer computing, for example. The wealth chapter (again, really about industrial production) is very friendly towards increasing total economic output and the options available to individuals, but isn't too interested in distribution, much less class or international politics, seeing things really as a matter of education. He's too pessimistic on space travel, missing the private sector and new national projects. Yes, it's easy to pick on another futurist, but when we make these forecasts they reveal much about our predispositions and research.By the book's end I was grumpy, and annoyed at the frequent lashings of Hollywood sf movies. Despite myself I did like the triumphant image of humans making a Kardashev Type I civilization. And Kaku's optimism, while I can poke holes in it, is something I personally need, being too easily disposed to a Slavic/academic melancholy. Maybe our dystopia-addled era can use a dose of Kaku."
20,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4867502-jennifer,3,"This was an interesting book for me. I'm a scientist myself, but my field, geology, tends to look into the past rather than the future. It made me more aware of the upcoming breakthroughs in physics, medicine and computers. I liked the fact the author is a quantum physicist himself and fully knowledgeable about these ideas and actually got to physically test and see the technology himself. I had no idea how far away we are from creating a true artificial intelligence and nanotechnology, but how close we are in major breakthroughs in medicine such as organ replacements or building a colony on moon. The latter is hindered by cost only, but the technology is there. The science is broken down very simple, so anyone can read this. The one irk I had was he has a very optimistic view of humanity and all these breakthroughs will be for the good of the people. History says that some inventions will have a dark side and there are people and societies that will exploit that. Examples include gunpowder, used originally for fireworks, now more used as a weapon and nuclear energy. "
21,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8811289-correen,5,"Kaku makes the complex understandable. That is, one does not understand the complexities but rather has a sense of what is happening. This book creates a sense of wonder. His look into the 22nd century seemed too pat but still challenging to the mind. Given how difficult it has been to find cures for cancer, parkinson's, or even the common cold, it is hard to consider how disease could be eradicated. On the other hand, the use of dust sized computers, seems quite possible.I would recommend this book for inquiring minds of most ilks. "
22,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/912138-alex-givant,5,"Excellent book about future of humankind. Each chapter divided by 3 portions: near future (until 2030), mid of the century (2030 to 2070) and far future (2070 to 2100). Considering he wrote this book 8 years ago we may be more advance that he projected."
23,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/153098-chris,2,"This book had potential but ultimately didn't do it for me. Kaku looks at current trends and developments in science, technology, genetics, medicine, etc. and attempts to picture how human life will be changed by 2100. Positives:Kaku gives a pleasant tour of the many fascinating discoveries and upcoming developments in science and technology. Also, props to him for attempting a thoughtful, well-reasoned guess at what the future will look like.Negatives:Kaku plays it way too safe. In his effort not to get anything wrong he really doesn't say anything that interesting about the distant future. His predictions feel pretty obvious in the near term, and extremely vague in the long term. Also, in a sense this book is a bit pointless. If you're interested in the topic you're probably already aware of most of the developments he describes. I'm not a scientist or a worker in medicine and technology, but just by keeping up on the most popular news stories in these areas I was already aware of almost everything he discussed. That's probably going to be true for most people interested in a book like this.Finally, I was a bit annoyed with his over-enthusiasm for technology and science. I'm a big fan of these things too, but he continuously downplays the potential negative aspects of technology and optimistically promotes their potential positives. It's as though he really believes the advancements of the next 100 years are going to turn us in the noble characters of Star Trek, and will only be used to improve us as a species. He also makes ridiculous conclusions based on sweeping historical generalities about human history, vastly oversimplifying (and offhandedly minimizing) religious beliefs, and essentially all cultures that existed before our glorious present. There's a strong feeling of 21st century elitism, looking down at all those who lived in the cultural dark ages before us. "
24,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595788-alex-telander,5,"Michio Kaku, a professor of physics at the CUNY Graduate Center, sure knows how to make science both gripping and interesting. After the great bestseller, Physics of the Impossible, which tackled all those great science fiction inventions we’ve heard so much about in books, going in detail about when these said inventions would plausibly be invented; he brings things closer to home in Physics of the Future, focusing on inventions developments over the next century.In his new book, Kaku goes into detail where the next hundred years will take us on a number of different subjects, and what possible great things humanity will come up with next. The chapters run the gamut from the future of the computer, AI, nanotechnology and medicine, to where the future of wealthy, energy, and humanity will take us. Each chapter is divided into three parts: the near future, covering the present until 2030; midcentury from 2030-2070; and the far future from 2070-2100. In each of these parts, Kaku covers important discoveries and inventions that will be developed, working off of the technology and knowledge of the current period.Kaku fans and science readers will love Physics of the Future because, while Physics of the Impossible was pretty disheartening to learn that a lot of the cool inventions like transporters and time travel would not be invented until many thousands of years in the future, Physics of the Future covers a lot of fascinating technology that will be developed in many of our lifetimes.Originally written on September 21, 2011 ©Alex C.

25,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71311630-harrison-chang,5,"I absolutely loved reading Physics of the Future, by Michio Kaku. I have read Mr. Kaku's previous book: Physics of the Impossible. I bought this book and Physics of the Impossible back in the US during summer break and I was already very into science and the history of it. I became extremely fascinated by Mr. Kaku's theories and how he predicts the future of Mankind and Earth. My favorite parts of the book would be his predictions on future space travel, medicine, and nanotechnology. He wrote a lot about how we would reach Mars, our designs for spacecraft and also future cancer cures using nanotechnology. One of the most intriguing chapters was his explanation of the future of spacecraft designs, including the Ramjet Fusion theory, which uses a giant funnel that scoops hydrogen from space, since hydrogen is unlimited and would fuel the spacecraft. Another favorite would be the Orion Nuclear spacecraft, which uses mini-nuclear bombs dropped from a funnel, which would propel the craft at extreme speeds, but what was most fascinating was that this design worked and was tested in the 50s and early 60s but was discontinued in 1962 (due to the 1962 treaty banning above-ground detonation of nuclear devices, signed by the US and the Soviet Union). I was amazed by the numerous theories and the infinite possibilities of space travel, which triggered my love of astronomy and physics. This book was like taking a trip into the future and would be a must-read for any science-loving reader. I'd give it a 5 out of 5! "
26,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1240986-dave,2,"It's not bad, it's just not great either.I quickly got tired of the tone, which seems melodramatic. He talks incessantly about reclaiming the power the ancient gods were said to have, like the Greeks'.It also takes a while to get going and to understand the structure, which takes an area of technology and then explores it near, mid, and long term future.After all of that, I felt like I had heard of most of the technologies he talks about before. The most interesting parts are where he projects farthest out even past the year 2100, or when he talks about the large-scale societal effects of the technologies, rather than the technologies themselves. For example, what would it mean for capitalism to have a 'replicator' that can produce whatever the user needs? What would it mean for population when people are able to live substantially longer? What would it mean for competitiveness when parents can design their children to gene?He tends to be optimistic about all of these things, where a fiction author might take any one of these questions and explore what would happen if we made selfish choices. The book I read after was Oryx and Crake, which did just that."
27,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33746852-queenie,2,"2 things I'm certain of:1. Dr. Kaku is a sci-fi movie fanatic;2. Dr. Kaku loves Greek and Norse mythologies.Reading this 2011-book in 2018 is liken to going through a condensed, dumbed-down compilation of my Twitter feed speculations throughout the years / today's middle school intro science & technology textbook.It covers various topics in technological histories and advances such as computers, AI, biotechnology, nanotechnology, energy - briefly on fusion power and magnetism even-, climate change, space exploration. Some more amusing than others, all rather simply dabbled in.Interesting to note that we now have self-driving cars, genome-editing is possible with CRISPR Cas 9; androids exist (ahem, Sophia), despite not having a consciousness / common sense, yet. Let's see what Nasa's TESS will find on its space ex mission."

Some of them read like they should be part of a sci-fi blockbuster or thriller, but Michio Kaku weaved in actual research, observations, or scientific numbers/accounts to explain how or why they're more than possible. I particularly liked the bits about nanotechnology, gene sequencing, and space exploration."
29,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16311569-cindy-h,4,"I’m not gonna lie, 80% of this book was way over my head...but the parts I understood were beyond cool and fascinating. This was read for #PopSugar challenge a book about technology...."
30,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17648164-umair-khan,4,"What is the future going to be like? Physics of the Future tries to answer this question in an engaging, thought provoking and visionary account of the possibilities that, according to the author, Michio Kaku, will be transformed into reality in the coming decades. The book will not be a disappointment to fans of Kaku and can be considered as a sequel to his previous work, Visions, but with a more expansive view.Physics outlines four fundamental forces of nature: gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force and strong nuclear force. Kaku is of the opinion that each time a force of nature is understood by scientists and harnessed by engineers it sets in motion a chain reaction of novel and unique technologies determining the course of human development. In Physics, Kaku interviews more than 300 scientists and inventors who are working day and night to push the boundaries of science and technology. Essentially, the theme of the book is similar to the works of futurists like Ray Kurzweil, however, the treatment of the topic is more vivid and easier to understand.Kaku seems to be following the footsteps of visionary futurists like Leonardo da Vinci and Jules Verne. He explores the impact of physics on the areas of computer science, artificial intelligence, medicine, nanotechnology, alternative energy and space travel. Kaku scientifically predicts what new technologies will enter in the following decades, what will be achieved by the mid-21st century, and finally what we will accomplish by the end of it.The narrative, introducing prospects of controlling computers through the human mind, resurrecting extinct animals, travelling to other planets and genetically enhancing our disease resistance, is exciting to read. The author claims that we might even be able to bring back the Neanderthal. However, he pinpoints the ethical dilemmas associated with such achievements by quoting Richard Klein, an anthropologist at Stanford: “Are you going to put the Neanderthals in a zoo or in Harvard?”In the last chapter, Kaku introduces the reader to an imaginary character living in the 22nd century. Biologically, he is in his 70s but the age of his organs is mid-30s. He rides a self-driven car. Nano-bots monitor the crucial indicators of his health while roaming in his bloodstream. What distinguishes this book from works of science fiction is that every prediction in the book is based on research and supported by prototypes being developed across the globe.Kaku also analyses the economic and social history of our civilisation and explains that new technologies are the engines of both scientific and social change. He rightly points out that the economic recessions of the 1850s, 1920s and 2008 were due to the “speculative fever” created around specific sectors: the railroad, automotive stocks and real estate, respectively.He warns that when the British Empire was shifting its focus from scientific innovation to more mundane matters of power-play, the US was emerging as a leader in research and advancement of knowledge in all fields. However, if the majority of the US talent is going into the investment sector and managing the finances of others, in which region will the most brilliant minds pursue the cause of innovation and exploring the truth?Kaku further chalks out the ranking of civilisations which was first introduced in 1964 by Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev — on the basis of the energy they consume. This ranking was mainly proposed to identify the powers of extra terrestrial intelligent civilisations and classify them into three types. Type I consumes planetary sources of energy, mainly sunlight that falls on their planet; Type II consumes all the energy produced by their sun, while Type III consumes the energy produced by all the stars of their galaxy. Our current status is perhaps that of a Type 0 since we consume the energy of dead plants (oil and coal). Kaku estimates that given the economic growth rate we will be able to achieve the status of a Type I civilisation by the end of the century.Physics of the Future not only tells us what is probable and possible in the future, it also gives researchers and inventors a timescale to measure their successes against. Moreover, it makes the reader feel excited about the times we are living in, when we can expect ‘miracles’ to happen in our lifetimes. Kaku points out that “By 2100, our destiny is to become like the gods we once worshipped and feared.”SOURCE: http://www.dawn.com/news/634292/non-f..."
31,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3352854-david-skip-everling,2,"I'm not sure about anybody's ability to predict a century into the future (especially if you give credence to the idea of accelerating returns in technology), but I was willing to give this book a shot after hearing Michio Kaku in interviews. In particular he piqued my curiosity with the claim that all the ideas in the book are grounded on currently existing prototypes or established scientific theory.Now after having read it, I think Michio is only giving a survey of some select topics, and the only ones that I think he handled well were the ones most closely linked to physics (e.g. space travel, nanotechnology & quantum behavior, global power generation). The other fields he dives into, particularly his analysis and extrapolation of consumer technologies, were disappointingly off target or lacking in proper depth.The book is occasionally so superficial in its treatment of some prototyped technologies that it reads somewhat like painfully outdated sci-fi from Michio's childhood in the 50's. The book is written to be highly accessible, but he does uninformed readers a disservice by giving equal weight to illogical and 'improbable but not impossible' possibilities. My biggest problem with his predictions are that they center on only a set of technologies that Kaku has experience with, extrapolated all the way out to 2100 without much consideration of how all the unmentioned possibilities will change his visions for the future.As an example, Michio doesn't do the best job keeping our present circumstances and his far future predictions from mixing anachronistically: e.g. the frequently repeated ""...when we carry around our own genomes on a CD-ROM"" for a ""2030-2070"" range prediction. I worry that Michio Kaku is just paraphrasing some of the ideas out there without really thinking about them any more critically, like a mediocre science journalist or sci-fi writer. Again this could be an artifact of his intentionally writing this book to be broadly accessible, but I don't think he found the right balance.The best parts of the book are in the second half, particularly his chapters on The Future of: Energy, Space Travel, Wealth, and Humanity (respectively) and I did enjoy most of this material despite a scattering of the same problems mentioned above. Sadly, I think Michio Kaku completely botched his concluding chapter, ""A Day in the Life in 2100"", and I think the preceding Future of Humanity chapter would have been a much stronger ending. The ""Day in the Life"" conclusion is silly speculative fiction and the best (worst?) example in the entire book of his anachronistic and muddled sci-fi visions. Michio Kaku is great when talking about physics and large scale trends closely linked to humanity's knowledge of physics, but judging from this book alone he doesn't put together upcoming technologies into realistic or compelling future scenarios very well at all, ending up with an incomplete picture somewhere in the uncomfortable border between imaginative thinking and unwarranted speculation."
32,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,4,"This is a fascinating survey of what's actually happening in the cutting edge of science and technology. He walks through computers and vehicles and energy and space exploration and even culture. For each area he discussed deeply what's happening now, then gives thoughtful guesses to what will develop in early 21st century, mid-century, and late-century. His understanding of science is broad AND deep. His vision of the future of science is compelling. Some highlights: Tiny computer chips will be embedded in everything--almost literally--and we'll live in a cloud of data that's ridiculous. Robots will outnumber humans--but they won't be able to do anything but the physical tasks we program them to do (including driving our cars and planes). Magnetism will finally be mastered and we'll run our world on magnetic power rather than electric power. And by the end of the century remote control robots will be building a moon base for us to continue looking into the stars. However, I docked him a star because he displays a naive understanding of culture and history. He makes sweeping mistakes like seeing being religious as the enemy of science when history actually shows that many of the greatest science cultures were so precisely because of their religious beliefs, or his easy dismissal of cultural conflicts in the new world and his idea that once food and shelter are universal then haves and have nots won't be a real issue. So read this for the tech ideas and endure his comments about becoming like the gods of old and reaching cultural utopia. "
33,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"Michio Kaku is a great science writer (as well as being a physics professor), but futurology is a difficult subject to make interesting and all too often what you get is lists of 'in the future you will have an X that will do Y,' which gets dull fairly quickly.Where Kaku's approach is good (which is to base his ideas on physics) is in the future of energy. His chapter on space exploration is good too - he is a great enthusiast for this, and that comes across strongly here. The only proviso is that the main controlling factor on space exploration is not science but politics. A man wasn't put on the moon for science, but to put the Russians in their place. We haven't done much manned exploration since for the same reason. It's too expensive for science to control things.To be honest I was even less convinced about the consumer technology ideas. If space exploration is driven by politics, consumer purchases are driven by the market. Yes, the science & technology has to be able to deliver (so you couldn't have an iPhone 10 years ago), but it doesn't decide what will and won't become popular.The book finishes with a chapter on the way the world will be a single civilization (even if nations still exist in a weakened form) by the end of the century. This seemed the least science-supported speculation. If anything we seem to be fragmenting more.All in all, a good try - but futurology remains closer to fiction than popular science."

I get that he was trying to summarize everything he'd written in the book in an interesting way, but I'm not a huge fan of 2nd person povs and it came off as annoying and unneeded. "
35,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7070282-jenny-williams,5,"After reading this selection I strongly believe Michio Kaku is one of the brightest minds in his field. Physics Of The Impossible was an amazing book and this one blows it out of the water. I can't determine if I am so fond of it because of how advanced our technology will be in the near future or if I am truly fond of his writing. I know one thing for sure, some of the different advancements in technology is going to change the way we live life in way too many ways. What I mean by that is the advancement Kaku covers isn't technology like a new version of an XBOX or something of that sort. Michio Kaku covers advancement in technology like the worlds biggest atom smasher in Switzerland under a mountain, circling a mile exactly. This atom smasher is one of the biggest advancements in our technology opening doors to creating so much energy that we will be able to travel through space at a speed close to the speed of light. That's only the example I remembered best but there are so many throughout this book it excites you for our future. Kind of. "
36,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5431286-david,3,"Since I had already read the book ""Visions"" by the same writer nearly three years ago, this one did not really generate much of an interest within me due to the much common material. Although, for someone who may have never read ""Visions"" or ""Physics of the Impossible"" (which too I had read in 2011-12), I strongly feel that ""Physics of the Future"" can tend to become very interesting if one likes to ponder on how technological the world is going to get within the next century, and how far will it be feasible to apply and integrate it within our daily lives.A Good Book, but a vast majority was already included amongst the first two of his books on the same genre. The chapter on the Future of Wealth, was kind of new though!A 3-star because the content was not new for me; otherwise I would rate it with a 4-star."

In fact, the action of the first film is kicked off by a message recorded in 3D by Princess Leia and conveyed by the robot...""

I understand that for those who know a lot about physics and technology, it may be to easy, but for such people as I am, it was great. Well, I didn't like everything what I read (especially, the beginning) but later it got much better. I really enjoyed topics about artificial intelligence and robotics, the future of medicine and genetics. I hope that many forecasts will come true."

44,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27777097-thomas-jacob-jr,3,"An enjoyable, cursory overview of some of the most exciting technological achievements we may expect mankind to engage with over the next century. I came across Michio Kaku, as I am sure many others have, by watching an interview on television a few years ago, and I was struck by his loquaciousness and intelligence. Describing contemporary scientific concepts, especially quantum physics, in a way that a layman can understand is no small feat. In Physics of the Future, Kaku focuses on several industries (private space exploration, computer technology, medicine, and others) and tries to predict what respective advances we may expect by 2100. Oftentimes he uses examples from popular science fiction, specifically Star Trek, as a frame of reference. This book definitely falls into the 'pop science' category, with only brief asides into more technical and mathematical information. Any fans of popular science fiction work in film, television, or literature will be already be aware of many of the concepts here, and truthfully, any one of them could easily fill an entire book by itself (the 'recommended reading' section at the end is a goldmine for further exploration). Kaku sometimes makes sweeping generalizations without going into further detail that may seem presumptuous, but it is usually in attempt to keep the pace light. Also, since this was written in 2011, some sections appear a little dated even only six years later (an entire section on private space exploration, for example, doesn't mention either Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos, two of the forerunners in this field). Recommended for those looking for a brief overview of some of the exciting advances in technology that we can expect to look forward to over the course of our lifetime. For those looking for a deeper dive into any of the aforementioned subjects, the dozens of recommended works at the end should serve as an excellent primer. "
45,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,4,"Peering into the future of mankind and predicting what lies in store for us a few decades from now, has always been a dicey endeavour. In general, predictions pertaining to unchecked population growth, resultant famines, wars over access to resources, gloomy prospects for the future of developing nations etc have mostly proven to be unnecessary alarms rather than reality. A few major historical instances come to mind. Rev. Thomas Malthus in the late 18th century, Dr. Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University in the 1960s, and MIT's Club of Rome report in the 1970s were famous for damning our future, particularly that of India and China due to their large populations. We find that both India and China have done pretty well in the forty years since. On the other hand, predictions about the end of slavery, end of European colonialism, an era of less work and more leisure have all come true. It seems as though we tend to take both a gloomy and hopeful view of mankind and misjudge its potential for making correctives when it comes to how human beings, our societies, governments and institutions would behave in future under changing conditions.In contrast, predictions regarding scientific and technological advances in the fields of medicine, computers, biology, astronomy etc have more frequently proven to materialize successfully, at times sooner than expected. The Moore's Law comes to mind immediately. This book itself shows how accurately Jules Verne, in the mid 1800s, predicted life in Paris in the 1960s as consisting of skyscrapers, air-conditioning, TV, elevators, high-speed trains and fax machines. It seems as if we have a better grasp of machines and man's interactions with them and the development of this man-machine future. This book by theoretical Physicist Michio Kaku, crystal-gazes into this future as led by the advance of science and technology. Even if one does not accept all the projections, we end up learning a lot on what stunning possibilities are out there as we live out this century.The book is organized on what we can expect in the near term (by 2030), the mid term (2030-2070) and the long term (2070-2100). The future is explored through the domains of Computers, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Medicine, Nanotechnology, Energy and Space Travel. But it is not just speculation from a Theoretical Physicist. The author had discussed with hundreds of scientists who actually work today on these ideas and had compiled out of this interaction, what is possible in these three time periods. The presentation and language in the book is simple and accessible even to the average non-science minded reader and that, in my view, is a great positive about the book. I shall outline here some of the future products and possibilities given by Dr.Kaku which grabbed my mind:MRI machines which are just a foot long, looking like cell phones which can be passed over the human body and detect cancer (2030)Computers which scan fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) patterns in the brain and decipher a person's stream of consciousness and thereby detect what he/she is thinking (2070-2100)Computers being able to reconstruct a person's facial features given a strand of DNA from that person'e hair or bloodTissue engineering to manufacture a whole body part by extracting a few cells from the bodyResurrection of extinct life forms like the Mammoth or the NeanderthalNano-particles which enter and kill only cancer cells and leave healthy tissue untouchedchanging one shape to another at the push of a button, just like the T-1000 in 'Terminator-2'Molecular Replicators, capable of creating almost anything we want, the same way that nature can “take hamburgers and vegetables and turn them into a baby.”Fusion plants dotting the countryside by mid centuryLanding on an asteroid or on a moon of planet Mars, Space ElevatorsThe final couple of chapters deal with the future of humanity, planetary civilizations and how life would look in 2100. One can feel the child-like enthusiasm of Dr.Kaku in writing about all these possibilities and it makes the book enjoyable reading. He uses references to popular sci-fi movies from Hollywood to illustrate many of the ideas. In fact, as I read the book, I developed a greater respect for movie makers like that of the Terminator, Matrix, Star Wars, Avatar and so on.We have heard recently of anxieties being expressed about Artificial Intelligence and its destructive potential by luminaries like Bill Gates and Elon Musk. The eminent futurist, Ray Kurzweil has suggested in his work 'The Singularity is Near' that by 2045, a $1000 computer would be a billion times more intelligent than all humans combined and hence creating an uncontrolled runaway singularity. But others like Douglas Hofstadter and Mitch Kapor have dismissed these notions. This book discusses this topic substantially and believes that mankind will develop 'friendly AI' and use it to enhance itself rather than letting itself be ruled by mean-minded robots. Dr.Kaku shows six reasons why there are major roadblocks to such a singularity.On the negative side, just as in other books on the future, this one also has its tiresome speculation on the 'sick men of Asia'. Dr.Kaku quotes a report by Peter Schwartz of the Global Business Network on the dire future that is likely in the demographic nightmare of South Asia. Sea level rise due to Global warming in the latter half of this century could cause massive flooding and chaos, resulting in millions of refugees across the borders of Bangladesh into India. Governments could lose all authority and collapse, resulting in nightmarish looting and rioting. Rising tensions and chaos and inability to control may result in nations resorting to nuclear weapons!It is only scientists who tell us that Human societies, weather and climate are non-linear systems and even a very small change could have a massive effect, called the butterfly effect, making it difficult to predict the long-term futures. Then, I don't see how the author is so sure of destructive global warming in the future and also the consequent behavior of south Asians. In spite of being repeatedly wrong, futurists cannot seem to resist making dire predictions for the future of nations with large populations.The book is enjoyable reading and educative as well. I strongly recommend reading it. Even though Physics plays an important role in all the science that is discussed in the book, I am unsure of whether 'Physics of the Future' is the most meaningful title for the book. When I picked up the book initially, I thought it would be a book on String Theory."
46,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645507-jason-schneeberger,5,"I don't usually do book reviews this long anymore, but this one that I won't soon forget. If ever. Based off of the known laws of nature, author and world renowned theoretical physicist Michio Kaku met with, and interviewed, 300 of the leading scientists in the world about what our world will be like in the year 2100 through the ever increasing advancements of technology. This book lays out the most likely scenario of computers, AI, medicine, nanotechnology, energy, space travel and wealth from those interviews and how they will shape the world by the year 2100.Oh what a fantastic and thought provoking book this was! It's great to read a book about the future that isn't nihilistic, apocalyptic and negative, but rather hopeful and full of wonder! Sure, the very real threats of chaos, nuclear war, global warming etc are addressed in this book, but in ways that give rise to ways around such problems instead of weakly giving into them.I'm always wondering why every sci-fi movie based in the future has to be apocalyptic, or negative about where the world is going? It's easy to see the bad decisions we are making as humans that drive this thinking and make it seem like a sure reality to come, but where are the optimistic stories? Where are the stories that show us prospering and thriving as a world in the future? Those ideas and thoughts are in this book! Hopefully some good screenwriters and filmmakers will get inspired and make a movie based off the ideas in this book. I want to see it! Almost all of us alive now will not get to experience the world in the year 2100. Not unless of course the age reversal science described in the book becomes a reality (and it seems as though it's a very real possibility in the second half of this century), but this book brings much to the imagination of looking out a window, into the world at the dawn of the 22nd century. I can't say think of anything bad to say about this one. I absolutely loved everything about it. BUY IT!"
47,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Informed speculations engagingly presentedIt’s easy to see that Professor Kaku had a lot of fun writing this book since more than anything (at least for this reader) this book was a pleasure to read.Typically Kaku begins each chapter with some reference to the ancient gods or some other form of mythology or folklore, mainly for contrast or to highlight human yearnings that are being fulfilled today or may be fulfilled in the near future. He then mixes in some science fiction movies, stories or novels that he likes or finds instructive (or not). He adds some personal research and experiences with some of the great minds of our time as he makes his predictions, speculations and guesses on where we are going and when we are going to get there. Partly because of his celebrity and partly because of his wide-ranging knowledge and sharp intelligence (not to mention his charm) Kaku is able to talk with Nobel Prize winners and other cutting edge scientists and engineers all over the world the way most people talk to their neighbors. Areas of interest, each with its own chapter are computers, artificial intelligence, medicine, nanotechnology, energy, space travel, wealth (i.e., economics), and what life will be like in the future on a day-to-day basis. Each chapter gives Kaku’s speculations for the “Near Future (Present to 2030),” “Midcentury (2030 to 2070),” and the “Far Future (2070 to 2100).”I’m going to try to NOT second guess Kaku but I do want to focus on a few areas of personal interest and add a comment or two. “It is a law of evolution that fitter species arise to displace unfit species; and perhaps humans will be lost in the shuffle, eventually winding up in zoos where our robotic creations come to stare at us…Perhaps that is our role in history, to give birth to our evolutionary successors.” (p. 100)I think this is likely, especially if you add our genetically engineered successors. If so we can then think of ourselves as the “intelligent designers” of the demigods to come.Kaku weighs in on the possibility of our robotic creations becoming more intelligent than humans. (Seems very likely.) He speculates on robots producing “ever-smarter” robots that might “devour the resources of the planet in their insatiable quest to become ever more intelligent.” (p. 101) This can be seen as a near corollary of the idea that robots will become our masters and take over the planet. Since robots can only do what is programmed into them, these ideas depend on poor or malicious programming. (Beware the black hats of the future!)On page 116 Kaku points out that “there is no universally accepted definition of ‘smart.’” He doesn’t elaborate but I want to say that the unstated question is “smart for what”? Is the goal, e.g., happiness or world domination? A different kind of smarts might be required in each case.In talking about what jobs will still be available for humans in the midcentury future, Kaku makes the excellent point that those jobs will require “nonrepetitive work that requires pattern recognition.” (p. 305) He includes garbage collectors, police officers, construction workers, gardeners, and plumbers. However where I live as soon as they get a robot to drive the truck garbage collection will be a completely automated task. We have plastic containers set out on the street which are picked up and emptied by a mechanical arm from the truck. (Yes, the future is now.)In Chapter 8 “Future of Humanity” Kaku presents Nikolai Kardashev’s Type I, II, and III Civilizations based on energy consumption. (A Type II civilization, for example, consumes all the energy from their sun.) What I found interesting is Kaku’s statement that we “are leading to a single point: the creation of a planetary civilization.” (p. 327) I think the term “planetary civilization” is what we need to replace the currently (in some quarters) offensive term, “world government.”Kaku makes the sharp point that movies with “cross-cultural themes…packed with internationally recognized celebrities, are big money makers for Hollywood.” He sees this as “evidence of an emerging planetary culture.” (p. 334) He adds on the next page that “Local cultures will continue to survive, coexisting side by side with the larger global culture.”Some of Kaku’s dreams (perhaps) are room temperature super conductors and space elevators, to name just two that are highly speculative but would be amazing if realized.In the chapter on artificial intelligence, Kaku gives his three-pointed definition of consciousness. (Actually with becoming modesty he writes, “…if I were to venture a guess.”) In my book “The World Is Not as We Think It Is” I also give a three-pointed definition:“One: awareness of the world (including awareness of our self and our processes, that is, self-awareness).Two: self-identity. Notice that awareness of self is different from this identification with self.Three: experience or sensation, the feelings we get when we experience the world. This is sometimes called “phenomenal consciousness.” An example would be the subjective experience of the color red, or the taste of a strawberry.” (p. 82)Here is Kaku’s delineation from page 97:“1. sensing and recognizing the environment2. self-awareness3. planning for the future by setting goals and plans, that is, simulating the future and plotting strategy.”The slight differences are instructive. He leaves out self-identification, perhaps rightly so; and I leave out planning for the future. Also I presume that Kaku includes self-awareness in his first component. Personally I would include planning for the future in my first component, “awareness of the world” as well; however to emphasize “simulating the future” is a fine thing to do since humans are on another level in the animal kingdom when it comes to imagining what might happen.I should mention that in writing this book Kaku did not just tune into the zeitgeist but actually read prognosticators from the past. Two who did well were Benjamin Franklin and the Marquis de Condorcet. Since Kaku’s predictions are mostly favorable for humans, I hope his predictions do as well. --Dennis Littrell, author of “Hard Science and the Unknowable”"
48,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7227342-richard,3,"Michio Kaku's book, Physics of the Future, concludes with a comprehensive prediction of what life will like in 2100 as the subtitle indicates. The majority of the book is made up of predictions about how technology will evolve in the intervening years.The book was written in 2011, so some its contents are already dated. Interestingly, certain predictions about the near future have already come to pass. Other predictions appear to be a little delayed. To be clear, Mr. Kaku is very humble in the introduction about the ability to predict the future. One of the concrete statements he makes about the future is the idea there is a great deal to be optimistic about. He examines individuals in the past who were pessimistic about the development of technology, and he shows how wrong these individuals proved to be in time. For this reason, I think he is correct to say the future belongs to the optimists.I enjoyed the book; however, I don't think it is worth more than 3 stars. It has some important ideas, but the audience is narrow to a certain extant. It seems to offer inspiration to the future scientists who will make these breakthroughs; however, it isn't as relevant to the average reader. We will eventually see the changes predicted, but they are mostly decades away. "
49,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467608-serro,4,"This is a great book by a great physicist. I only rate it 4 stars because his thoughts and predictions can only be tested in 2100. I promise to raise my rating to 5 starts in 2100 if his predictions are correct. That is because according to Michio Kaku medicine will evolve greatly allowing people to live a lot longer than now. Not that I don't plan on living for 113 years as it is.The reader will find insights about the future of computers and AI, medicine and nanotechnology, space travel and energy. Kaku also takes on the nature of humanity as a whole in the next 100 years.And bear in mind these are not the predictions of Nostradamus, Michi Kaku knows first hand what he writes about."
50,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55246199-erin,3,"I love Michio Kaku! I'm only giving this one 3 Stars because it is pretty similar to some of his other works and he repeats these concepts. This is only noticable since I have read his other books, but if you haven't and are interested in theoretical physics, give this a try!"
51,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20481392-james-biser,4,"This scientist has an interesting view of what will happen at the end of the current century. Because he studies what is happening with our culture, he can anticipate what advancements will be made and when we can expect them. This is a good read:"
52,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1080484-teji,4,"The author’s passion for both physics and science-fiction is evident throughout this piece of speculative non-fiction. The work explores several areas of emerging technology and applied science, not just quantum physics. As the author notes, his predictions are “reasoned estimates of when the prototype technologies of today will finally reach maturity”. His extrapolation of what he thinks is likely to occur in the near (2010-2030), mid (2030-20700, and far (2070-2100) future, are intriguing and thought provoking. The organization is very repetitive-- almost as if it were written as a series of articles that were later post-edited into a book format (although I don't think that is the case). Also, the writing is a little dry in places-- but not intolerably so. Additionally, when speaking of the future, the author tends to geek out and engage in overwrought, almost giddy, statements about the “godlike” powers technology will grant humans within the next century. These flaws aside, overall, the writing is coherent and accessible. It will be interesting to see how well his forecasts for the next couple of decades hold-up.Quotes(view spoiler)[[In his novel, Paris in the Twentieth Century, written in 1863, Jules Verne] “predicted that Paris in 1960 would have glass skyscrapers, air conditioning, TV, elevators, high-speed trains, gasoline-powered automobiles, fax machines, and even something resembling the Internet…just a few years later he made another spectacular prediction. In 1865, he wrote From the Earth to the Moon, in which he predicted the details of the mission that sent our astronauts to the moon…He accurately predicted the size of the space capsule to within a few percent, the location of the launch site in Florida…the weightlessness that the astronauts would experience, and the final splashdown in the ocean…How was Jules Verne able to predict 100 years into the future with such breathtaking accuracy? His biographers have noted that, although Verne was not a scientist himself he constantly sought out scientists…He amassed a vast archive summarizing the great scientific discoveries of his time. Verne, more than others, realized that science was the engine shaking the foundations of civilization, propelling it into a new century with unexpected marvels and miracles.” -Introduction“Another great prophet of technology was Leonardo da Vinci, painter, thinker, and visionary…Like Jules Verne, Leonardo was able to get profound insights into the future by consulting a handful of forward-thinking individuals of his time…In addition, Leonardo was always experimenting, building, and sketching models, a key attribute of anyone who wants to translate thinking into reality.” -Introduction“As William Gibson…once said, ‘The future is already here. It’s just unevenly distributed.” -Introduction“Predictions for the future, with a few exceptions, have always underestimated the pace of technological progress.” -IntroductionThere are four fundamental forces in nature that drive the entire universe: gravity (unlocking the force of gravity helped to pave the way for the Industrial Revolution and the introduction of steam power, especially the locomotive), electromagnetic force (this unleashed the electronic revolution that has created a bounty of scientific wonders), and the two nuclear forces: the weak and strong forces. “When Einstein wrote down e=mc^2 and when the atom was split in the 1930s, scientists for the first time began to understand the forces that light up the heavens…the secret behind the stars…it also held out the promise that one day we would be able to harness this power on the earth”… quantum theory “has given us the transistor, the laser, and the digital resolution that is the driving force behind modern society. -Introduction“Exponential growth is often hard to grasp, since our minds think linearly. It is so gradual that you sometimes cannot experience the change at all. But over decades, it can completely alter everything around us. According to Moore's law, every Christmas your new computer games are almost twice as powerful (in terms of the number of transistors) as those from the previous year. Furthermore, as the years pass, this incremental gain becomes monumental. For example, when you receive a birthday card in the mail, it often has a chip that sings ‘Happy Birthday’ to you. Remarkably, that chip has more computer power than all the Allied forces of 1945. Hitler, Churchill, or Roosevelt might have killed to get that chip…Today, your cell phone has more computer power than all of NASA back in 1969, when it placed two astronauts on the moon…” Ch1“Today, when we enter a room, we automatically look for the light switch since we assume that the walls are electrified. In the future, the first thing we will do on entering a room…is to assume the room is intelligent…Around 2020, the price of a chip may also drop to about a penny…then we will have millions of chips distributed everywhere in our environment, silently carrying out our orders.” -Ch1“One reason why Moore's law has relentlessly increased the power of chips is because UV light can be tuned so that its wavelength is smaller and smaller, making it possible to etch increasingly tiny transistors onto silicon wafers. Since UV light has a wavelength as small as 10 nanometers, this means that the smallest transistor that you can etch is thirty atoms across…But this process cannot go on forever…You can even calculate roughly when Moore’s law will finally collapse: when you finally hit transistors the size of individual atoms… According to the laws of physics, eventually the Age of Silicon will come to a close, as we enter the Post-Silicon Era. Transistors will be so small that quantum theory or atomic physics takes over and electrons leak out of the wires…At that point, according to the laws of physics, the quantum theory takes over. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that you cannot know both the position and the velocity of any particle…at the atomic level you simply cannot know where the electron is, so it can never be confined precisely in an ultrathin wire or layer and it necessarily leaks out, causing the circuit to short-circuit.” Ch1“However, scans of the human brain clearly show that thinking is spread out over large parts of the brain...Digital computers can calculate at nearly the speed of light. he human brain, by contrast, is incredibly slow. Nerve impulses travel at an excruciatingly slow pace of about 200 miles per hour. But the brain more than makes up for this because it is massively parallel… In a race, a superfast single processor is left in the dust by a superslow parallel processor.” Ch2“While hardware had grown [exponentially] by the ability to etch smaller and smaller transistors onto a wafer, software is totally different; it requires a human to sit down with a pencil and paper to write code. That is the bottleneck: the human. Software, like all human creative activity, progresses in fits and starts, with brilliant insights and long stretches of drudgery and stagnation.” Ch2“…genetic analysis shows that aging is concentrated in the ""engine"" of the cell, the mitochondria, or the cell’s power plant. This has allowed scientists to…look for ways to accelerate the gene repair process inside the mitochondria to reverse the effects of aging.” Ch3“Normally, we don’t see quantum forces at work in everyday life. But quantum forces are everywhere…if we are largely empty, then why can’t we walk through walls?...The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons can exit in the same quantum state. Hence, when two nearly identical electrons get too close, they repel each other. This is the reason objects appear to be solid, which is an illusion…When we sit on a chair...we are hovering above the chair, floating less than a nanometer above it, repelled by the chair’s electrical and quantum forces.” Ch4“The quantum theory has only one thing going for it: it is correct. Its accuracy has been measured to one part in ten billion, making it the most successful physical theory of all time.” Ch4“Science and technology are the engines of prosperity…” Ch7“The combination of changing social conditions and the mastery of the four forces propelled Europe to the forefront of nations. But technologies are dynamic, changing all the time. They are born, evolve, and rise and fall…technologies obey certain laws of evolution. Mass technologies usually evolve in four basic stages…In stage I, the products of technology are so precious that they are closely guarded. Paper, when it was invented in the form of papyrus by the ancient Egyptians…was so precious that one papyrus scroll was closely guarded by scores of priests…Paper entered stage II around 1450, when Gutenberg invented the movable type…one person could possess one book containing the knowledge of hundreds of scrolls. Before Gutenberg, there were only 30,000 books in all Europe. By 1500, there were 9 million books…By around 1930, paper hit stage III, when the cost fell to a penny a sheet. This made possible the personal library, where one person could possess hundreds of books. Paper became an ordinary commodity…Paper is everywhere and nowhere, invisible and ubiquitous. Now we are in stage IV, where paper is a fashion statement. We decorate our world with paper of all colors, shapes, and sizes. The largest source of urban waste is paper. So paper evolved from being a closely guarded commodity to being waste.” Running water, electricity, and computer have followed the same pattern. Ch7“But as technologies evolve, they create abrupt changes in the economy that sometimes lead to social dislocations. In any revolution, there are winners and losers…What jobs will flourish by midcentury? How will the evolution of technology change the way we work? We can partially determine the answer by asking a simple question: What are the limitations of robots? As we have seen, there are at least two basic stumbling blocks to artificial intelligence: pattern recognition and common sense. Therefore, the jobs that will survive in the future are…ones that require these two abilities.” Ch7“Developing nations may be able to take advantage of the information revolution. They can, in principle, leapfrog past the developed nations in many areas. In the developed world, telephone companies had to tediously wire up every home or farm at great cost. But a developing nation does not have to wire up its country, since cell phone technology can excel in rural areas without any roads or infrastructure. Also, developing nations have the advantage that they do not have to rebuild an aging infrastructure…” Ch7“…the Unites States has maintained its dominance in science and technology in spite of the fact that U.S. students often score dead last when it comes to essential subjects like science and math…(It should also be pointed out that this ranking corresponds roughly to the number of days that students were in school. China, which ranked number 1, averaged 251 days of instruction per year, while the United States averaged only 178 days per year.) It seems like a mystery that, despite these awful numbers, the United States continues to do well internationally in science and technology, until you realize that much of the U.S science [talent] comes from overseas. The United States has a secret weapon, the H1B visa…But the H1B visa is only a stopgap measure. The United States cannot continue to live off foreign scientists, many of whom are beginning to return to China and India as their economies improve…The United States will eventually have to overhaul its archaic, sclerotic education system. At present, poorly prepared high school students flood the job market and universities…Employers continually bemoan the fact that they have to take one year to train their new hires to bring them up to speed. And the universities are burdened by having to create new layers of remedial courses to compensate for the poor high school education system…” Ch7“When physicists try to analyze civilizations, we rank them on the basis of the energy they consume. This ranking was first introduced in 1964 by Russian astrophysicists Nikolai Kardashev…he proposed three theoretical types: A Type I civilization is planetary, consuming the sliver of sunlight that falls on their planet, or about 10^17 watts. A Type II civilization is stellar, consuming all the energy that their sun emits, or 10^27 watts. A Type III civilization is galactic, consuming the energy of billions of stars, or about 10^37 watts…Each type is separated by a factor of 10 billion: a Type III civilization consumes 10 billion times more energy than at Type II civilization…which in turn consumes 10 billion times more energy than a Type I civilization. According to the classification, our present-day civilization is Type 0. We don’t even rate on this scale, since we get our energy from dead plants, that is from oil and coal. (Carl Sagan, generalizing this classification...[estimated] that we are actually a Type .7 civilization…we can mathematically estimate that we will attain Type I status in about 100 years, given an average rate of economic growth.” Ch8“Also, if room temperature superconductors are found in this century, it means a complete overhaul of our energy requirements. Waste heat, in the form of friction, will be greatly reduced, increasing the efficiency of our machines. As we mentioned, the majority of our energy consumption, especially transportation, goes into overcoming friction…it would take almost no energy to move from California to New York if there were no friction.” Ch8 (hide spoiler)]"
53,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9619705-anna,0,I just want to see an updated version of this book explaining why most of short term predictions didn't work out.
54,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,2,"The book was extremely informative about current trends in science (and some technology). It lives up to its title in discussing physics of the future. The author is a skilled writer who is gifted at communicating highly abstract and obscure ideas.So why only two stars?I did have some issues with the overall books and how this project was carried out. Some were more troubling than others. The major issues include:1) Too much scientific triumphalism -- The clear storyline in the book is that science will render most of the troubles of life either moot or less relevant. Diseases will go away, aging will be suppressed, and immortality lies around the corner! Hovercraft will be developed, robots will be everywhere and solve our problems, and traditional issues of scarcity re health and food will go away. I suspect that this technological paradise is being oversold, just a bit. Lifespan has been extended, but arguably more by prenatal and care for newborns, coupled with public health measures such as mass inoculation coupled with the aggressive combating of traditional killers like smallpox. We still haven't figured out much regarding the flu or the common cold! Yes there has been progress, but is heaven really that near? Have we proven ourselves worthy of godlike status?2) There is very little on economics throughout the book. The author has apparently read some of Thurow's futurist work but not much else. Science and technology need to be brought to market and commercialized before they can hope to revolutionize our lives. Perhaps the government will do it all?? Well the government might fund defense research and NSF grants but last I heard it still did limited work on commercialization.3) What about politics? The twentieth century brought amazing advances in science and technology but also rule by thugs, gangsters, and murderers that applied technology to the extermination of millions. Oh Brave New World . . . . !4) The author pushes his futurist motivation -- using a near future, mid future, and far future framework, but in the end it comes down to extrapolation between two poles - heaven or catastrophe, with the chance of catastrophe severely discounted. Not much of a choice!5) The author raises the need for education in science and technology, suggesting that they have read Goldin and Katz, but only talk about it in the context of H1B visas and information intensive jobs that go wanting. What about the increasing numbers of people in the US who are almost completely left out of the new age because of their poor education and training? Kaku may be setting up the world of Wells' Time Machine without knowing it. How can we move into a scientific and technology heaven, when most people are fit to work at Wal-Mart at best? What will all the dummies do once the robots take over our jobs? . . . which negative utopia comes to mind? the Matrix??6) This could be partially excused, since no author is perfect and the book is informative. What is more troubling about the book is that it is two or three chapters too long and the extra chapters detract from the book's value. Once the author moves from the descriptive and commentary and mild extrapolation in most ot the book to a more normative tone when he discusses the evolution of a planetary civilization, he loses me completely. He takes a framework by Kardashev to identify civilizations we might encounter from space and order them by energy use (???) and applies it to how our civilization might develop. Note here, we are using a framework with absolutely no data or experience behind it, with the exception of the sci-fi movie genre, and turning it into the summary framework for a book purporting to provide an update to general readers on the state of research in physics!! Needless to say I was not convinced and was chuckling - for the wrong reasons -- as I worked through the end of the book. This appears to be a common problem in big reach synthesis boos -- Ian Morris' book on why the West rules comes to mind, although the latter is a much better book overall.5) By the end of the book, I was wondering if there were particular reasons why Kaku appeared to have ""lost it"" when he just should have stopped writing fifty pages sooner.6) Overall, I don't regret reading it. I just regret finishing it."
55,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12945730-jack-ferreira,3,"I like Michio Kaku, he seems like a pretty cool, down to earth guy. I'll get some criticism out of the way, because overall I did enjoy the book.I have seen interviews and tv shows he's been in and though I do like him sometimes his atitude bothers me for some reason. I can't quite put my finger on it, maybe it has something to do with this slightly over-pandering way of explaining things. It looks like he thinks the only way his readers will understand what he's saying is by constantly referencing Star Treck, Star Wars and other products of science fiction which really isn't needed. I understood him perfectly well when he talked about portable MRI machines and DNA chips before he felt the need to display a picture of a Star Treck ""tricorder"" (just in case we couldn't grasp the idea by ourselves). I thought these constant references were a bit odd because this isn't a hard book to comprehend. It's not necessarily insulting but at the same time it feels a little condescending. This is especialy present in the final chapter (""A Day in a Life in 2100""). It was completely unecessary and cringeworthy, he may be a great theoretical physicist but he is not a great writer (outside of non-fiction, at least). That said, I learnt a lot from this book. I will probably forget most of it, I admit, but it made me feel up to date on our current technological advancements. I liked the way he split up each chapter, making it nicely organized and easy to navigate through. It was great reading about realistic predictions for the future of computers, AI, energy, nanotechnology and space travel. The future of wealth was also discussed which took me by surprise and I sincerely apreciated it, since it really is something important to consider.As he talks about the future of humanity he introduces some very interesting concepts. It leaves me excited for things to come and curious of how it will change our way of life.Obviously, we should all take these predictions with a grain of salt. I'm sure Michio Kaku has more or less figured out the near future, but up to the year 2100 he gets quite vague. Some people see it as a bad thing, but I don't blame him. Any book we read, from an author who goes out of his areas of expertise must not be taken for granted. I have seen people comment on misuse of terminology and a lot of non consideration for alternate scenarios. This is why I love people like Richard Dawkins, who write books within their fields and whose content I absolutely trust.It's a nice book if you don't look upon it as a definitive guide to the future.I am now in the mood for some science fiction though."
56,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53461468-rasty,5,"Its amazing when you first read that book , it's not about how science developed or anything like that , but its about how science will develop and will shape our destiny or thoughts to our whole world , michio kaku one of my favorite writers about science , and that was amazing from him :)"
57,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5526063-mary-jean-harris,3,"This was quite a good book with lots of fascinating predictions for the future, as well as a survey of technologies currently being developed. I'd give it 3.5 stars (you need 1/2 stars, Goodreads!). Michio Kaku writes about the places he's visited, mostly research labs, that are working on new technologies, including bioengineering, nanotechnology, quantum computers, robotics, gene therapy, self-driving cars, space travel, and space elevators. Kaku's enthusiasm for these future changes is undying throughout the book, and it makes an enjoyable read. I can't agree with him that all this will result in positive change for the future though, especially as technology becomes more invasive and embedded into our lives, drawing us even further apart from the natural world as well as opening up the possibility for people (and governments and organizations) to control us in this system. It sounds eerily similar to the matrix, but Kaku doesn't seem overly concerned about any of these issues.Additionally, Kaku unfortunately falls into the trap of global warming hysteria: he takes it for granted that humanity is causing a climate crisis, a position that is highly contented and strewn with propaganda. As a scientist analysing a complicated issue, Kaku does not apply his own standards of rational inquiry to this issue and instead accepts the politically correct position that, even if he dug a little deep into the issue before writing the book, he would realize is not supported by many climate scientists.Also, although I liked the last chapter about ""a day in the life in 2100"" overall, it was really corny and, for some reason, the main guy we're following works at an office with only men...do no females work in the industry?. Also, this online dating stuff has become prevalent and people just do it naturally, something I find really creepy.But despite these problems with the book, it was a great read overall and definitely accessible to the general public."
58,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4617137-sangita-takhur,4,"To me the big question is: how fast will our technology progress in the coming years? I know it is very difficult to give a solid logical answer to this question. I liked the book but I do not agree with Kaku on many points. I think Kaku used almost a linear model for predicting the future. I think we need more imaginative power for predicting the future. Like Kaku I too believe that, gene technology, computers, artificial intelligence and robots will advance rapidly. The book is composed of the following nine chapters: 1. Future of the Computer: Mind over Matter, 2. Future of AI: Rise of the Machines, 3. Future of Medicine: Perfection and Beyond, 4. Nanotechnology: Everything from Nothing?, 5. Future of Energy: Energy from the Stars, 6. Future of Space Travel: To the Stars, 7. Future of Wealth, 8. Future of Humanity: Planetary Civilization, and 9. A Day in the Life in 2100. Kaku's approach is excellent, as if he is talking to a lay person, but he writes with a simple eloquence that makes these complex concepts accessible to the non-Physicist mind.Michio is too good in predicting the limitations of the technologies. One may argue that Michio's idea of robots and computers is similar to the AI from the movies in the 1990s, but we have to think year 2020 much brighter. Development on medicine, synthetic biology and nanotechnology is almost ignored. I was expecting more about quantum biology but that too is missing. But overall I liked the book. The book is good enough to stimulate our imagination."
59,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/153756-jeffrey,4,"A fascinating look at how the world might change in the future, while also giving some good basic information on various subjects - for example, Kaku breaks down how gene therapy works, and also what it could lead to. Kaku's style of writing is informative and accessible, and the only time I found myself starting to lose focus was during the fictional narrative covering a typical day in 2100. In a way, that section suffers from a lack of imagination in what people would be like, despite having well thought out possibilities for technology; it seems more like an example of what someone from today would act like if we had all of that technology today. Still, that got me thinking about things... like, one hundred years ago, someone wouldn't have even been able to conceive of the internet, but even if they could imagine it, they probably wouldn't be able to foresee the rise of things like social media, youtube, etc. and how those things are changing the way humanity deals with privacy and public appearance.Kaku's pretty optimistic about the future (he even only mentions the idea of humanity going extinct one time), so this book is at times almost like a really well researched version of the cliched utopian future. Fortunately the book's foundation is in science and balances that vision with various realistic possibilities, and in any case it's a great source of basic information related to physics for the layperson."
60,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17648164-umair-khan,4,"What is the future going to be like? Physics of the Future tries to answer this question in an engaging, thought provoking and visionary account of the possibilities that, according to the author, Michio Kaku, will be transformed into reality in the coming decades. The book will not be a disappointment to fans of Kaku and can be considered as a sequel to his previous work, Visions, but with a more expansive view.Physics outlines four fundamental forces of nature: gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force and strong nuclear force. Kaku is of the opinion that each time a force of nature is understood by scientists and harnessed by engineers it sets in motion a chain reaction of novel and unique technologies determining the course of human development. In Physics, Kaku interviews more than 300 scientists and inventors who are working day and night to push the boundaries of science and technology. Essentially, the theme of the book is similar to the works of futurists like Ray Kurzweil, however, the treatment of the topic is more vivid and easier to understand.Kaku seems to be following the footsteps of visionary futurists like Leonardo da Vinci and Jules Verne. He explores the impact of physics on the areas of computer science, artificial intelligence, medicine, nanotechnology, alternative energy and space travel. Kaku scientifically predicts what new technologies will enter in the following decades, what will be achieved by the mid-21st century, and finally what we will accomplish by the end of it.The narrative, introducing prospects of controlling computers through the human mind, resurrecting extinct animals, travelling to other planets and genetically enhancing our disease resistance, is exciting to read. The author claims that we might even be able to bring back the Neanderthal. However, he pinpoints the ethical dilemmas associated with such achievements by quoting Richard Klein, an anthropologist at Stanford: “Are you going to put the Neanderthals in a zoo or in Harvard?”In the last chapter, Kaku introduces the reader to an imaginary character living in the 22nd century. Biologically, he is in his 70s but the age of his organs is mid-30s. He rides a self-driven car. Nano-bots monitor the crucial indicators of his health while roaming in his bloodstream. What distinguishes this book from works of science fiction is that every prediction in the book is based on research and supported by prototypes being developed across the globe.Kaku also analyses the economic and social history of our civilisation and explains that new technologies are the engines of both scientific and social change. He rightly points out that the economic recessions of the 1850s, 1920s and 2008 were due to the “speculative fever” created around specific sectors: the railroad, automotive stocks and real estate, respectively.He warns that when the British Empire was shifting its focus from scientific innovation to more mundane matters of power-play, the US was emerging as a leader in research and advancement of knowledge in all fields. However, if the majority of the US talent is going into the investment sector and managing the finances of others, in which region will the most brilliant minds pursue the cause of innovation and exploring the truth?Kaku further chalks out the ranking of civilisations which was first introduced in 1964 by Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev — on the basis of the energy they consume. This ranking was mainly proposed to identify the powers of extra terrestrial intelligent civilisations and classify them into three types. Type I consumes planetary sources of energy, mainly sunlight that falls on their planet; Type II consumes all the energy produced by their sun, while Type III consumes the energy produced by all the stars of their galaxy. Our current status is perhaps that of a Type 0 since we consume the energy of dead plants (oil and coal). Kaku estimates that given the economic growth rate we will be able to achieve the status of a Type I civilisation by the end of the century.Physics of the Future not only tells us what is probable and possible in the future, it also gives researchers and inventors a timescale to measure their successes against. Moreover, it makes the reader feel excited about the times we are living in, when we can expect ‘miracles’ to happen in our lifetimes. Kaku points out that “By 2100, our destiny is to become like the gods we once worshipped and feared.”SOURCE: http://www.dawn.com/news/634292/non-f..."
61,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3352854-david-skip-everling,2,"I'm not sure about anybody's ability to predict a century into the future (especially if you give credence to the idea of accelerating returns in technology), but I was willing to give this book a shot after hearing Michio Kaku in interviews. In particular he piqued my curiosity with the claim that all the ideas in the book are grounded on currently existing prototypes or established scientific theory.Now after having read it, I think Michio is only giving a survey of some select topics, and the only ones that I think he handled well were the ones most closely linked to physics (e.g. space travel, nanotechnology & quantum behavior, global power generation). The other fields he dives into, particularly his analysis and extrapolation of consumer technologies, were disappointingly off target or lacking in proper depth.The book is occasionally so superficial in its treatment of some prototyped technologies that it reads somewhat like painfully outdated sci-fi from Michio's childhood in the 50's. The book is written to be highly accessible, but he does uninformed readers a disservice by giving equal weight to illogical and 'improbable but not impossible' possibilities. My biggest problem with his predictions are that they center on only a set of technologies that Kaku has experience with, extrapolated all the way out to 2100 without much consideration of how all the unmentioned possibilities will change his visions for the future.As an example, Michio doesn't do the best job keeping our present circumstances and his far future predictions from mixing anachronistically: e.g. the frequently repeated ""...when we carry around our own genomes on a CD-ROM"" for a ""2030-2070"" range prediction. I worry that Michio Kaku is just paraphrasing some of the ideas out there without really thinking about them any more critically, like a mediocre science journalist or sci-fi writer. Again this could be an artifact of his intentionally writing this book to be broadly accessible, but I don't think he found the right balance.The best parts of the book are in the second half, particularly his chapters on The Future of: Energy, Space Travel, Wealth, and Humanity (respectively) and I did enjoy most of this material despite a scattering of the same problems mentioned above. Sadly, I think Michio Kaku completely botched his concluding chapter, ""A Day in the Life in 2100"", and I think the preceding Future of Humanity chapter would have been a much stronger ending. The ""Day in the Life"" conclusion is silly speculative fiction and the best (worst?) example in the entire book of his anachronistic and muddled sci-fi visions. Michio Kaku is great when talking about physics and large scale trends closely linked to humanity's knowledge of physics, but judging from this book alone he doesn't put together upcoming technologies into realistic or compelling future scenarios very well at all, ending up with an incomplete picture somewhere in the uncomfortable border between imaginative thinking and unwarranted speculation."
62,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,4,"This is a fascinating survey of what's actually happening in the cutting edge of science and technology. He walks through computers and vehicles and energy and space exploration and even culture. For each area he discussed deeply what's happening now, then gives thoughtful guesses to what will develop in early 21st century, mid-century, and late-century. His understanding of science is broad AND deep. His vision of the future of science is compelling. Some highlights: Tiny computer chips will be embedded in everything--almost literally--and we'll live in a cloud of data that's ridiculous. Robots will outnumber humans--but they won't be able to do anything but the physical tasks we program them to do (including driving our cars and planes). Magnetism will finally be mastered and we'll run our world on magnetic power rather than electric power. And by the end of the century remote control robots will be building a moon base for us to continue looking into the stars. However, I docked him a star because he displays a naive understanding of culture and history. He makes sweeping mistakes like seeing being religious as the enemy of science when history actually shows that many of the greatest science cultures were so precisely because of their religious beliefs, or his easy dismissal of cultural conflicts in the new world and his idea that once food and shelter are universal then haves and have nots won't be a real issue. So read this for the tech ideas and endure his comments about becoming like the gods of old and reaching cultural utopia. "
63,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"Michio Kaku is a great science writer (as well as being a physics professor), but futurology is a difficult subject to make interesting and all too often what you get is lists of 'in the future you will have an X that will do Y,' which gets dull fairly quickly.Where Kaku's approach is good (which is to base his ideas on physics) is in the future of energy. His chapter on space exploration is good too - he is a great enthusiast for this, and that comes across strongly here. The only proviso is that the main controlling factor on space exploration is not science but politics. A man wasn't put on the moon for science, but to put the Russians in their place. We haven't done much manned exploration since for the same reason. It's too expensive for science to control things.To be honest I was even less convinced about the consumer technology ideas. If space exploration is driven by politics, consumer purchases are driven by the market. Yes, the science & technology has to be able to deliver (so you couldn't have an iPhone 10 years ago), but it doesn't decide what will and won't become popular.The book finishes with a chapter on the way the world will be a single civilization (even if nations still exist in a weakened form) by the end of the century. This seemed the least science-supported speculation. If anything we seem to be fragmenting more.All in all, a good try - but futurology remains closer to fiction than popular science."

65,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7070282-jenny-williams,5,"After reading this selection I strongly believe Michio Kaku is one of the brightest minds in his field. Physics Of The Impossible was an amazing book and this one blows it out of the water. I can't determine if I am so fond of it because of how advanced our technology will be in the near future or if I am truly fond of his writing. I know one thing for sure, some of the different advancements in technology is going to change the way we live life in way too many ways. What I mean by that is the advancement Kaku covers isn't technology like a new version of an XBOX or something of that sort. Michio Kaku covers advancement in technology like the worlds biggest atom smasher in Switzerland under a mountain, circling a mile exactly. This atom smasher is one of the biggest advancements in our technology opening doors to creating so much energy that we will be able to travel through space at a speed close to the speed of light. That's only the example I remembered best but there are so many throughout this book it excites you for our future. Kind of. "

Although, for someone who may have never read ""Visions"" or ""Physics of the Impossible"" (which too I had read in 2011-12), I strongly feel that ""Physics of the Future"" can tend to become very interesting if one likes to ponder on how technological the world is going to get within the next century, and how far will it be feasible to apply and integrate it within our daily lives.A Good Book, but a vast majority was already included amongst the first two of his books on the same genre. The chapter on the Future of Wealth, was kind of new though!A 3-star because the content was not new for me; otherwise I would rate it with a 4-star."

In fact, the action of the first film is kicked off by a message recorded in 3D by Princess Leia and conveyed by the robot...""

74,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27777097-thomas-jacob-jr,3,"An enjoyable, cursory overview of some of the most exciting technological achievements we may expect mankind to engage with over the next century. I came across Michio Kaku, as I am sure many others have, by watching an interview on television a few years ago, and I was struck by his loquaciousness and intelligence. Describing contemporary scientific concepts, especially quantum physics, in a way that a layman can understand is no small feat. In Physics of the Future, Kaku focuses on several industries (private space exploration, computer technology, medicine, and others) and tries to predict what respective advances we may expect by 2100. Oftentimes he uses examples from popular science fiction, specifically Star Trek, as a frame of reference. This book definitely falls into the 'pop science' category, with only brief asides into more technical and mathematical information. Any fans of popular science fiction work in film, television, or literature will be already be aware of many of the concepts here, and truthfully, any one of them could easily fill an entire book by itself (the 'recommended reading' section at the end is a goldmine for further exploration). Kaku sometimes makes sweeping generalizations without going into further detail that may seem presumptuous, but it is usually in attempt to keep the pace light. Also, since this was written in 2011, some sections appear a little dated even only six years later (an entire section on private space exploration, for example, doesn't mention either Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos, two of the forerunners in this field). Recommended for those looking for a brief overview of some of the exciting advances in technology that we can expect to look forward to over the course of our lifetime. For those looking for a deeper dive into any of the aforementioned subjects, the dozens of recommended works at the end should serve as an excellent primer. "
75,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,4,"Peering into the future of mankind and predicting what lies in store for us a few decades from now, has always been a dicey endeavour. In general, predictions pertaining to unchecked population growth, resultant famines, wars over access to resources, gloomy prospects for the future of developing nations etc have mostly proven to be unnecessary alarms rather than reality. A few major historical instances come to mind. Rev. Thomas Malthus in the late 18th century, Dr. Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University in the 1960s, and MIT's Club of Rome report in the 1970s were famous for damning our future, particularly that of India and China due to their large populations. We find that both India and China have done pretty well in the forty years since. On the other hand, predictions about the end of slavery, end of European colonialism, an era of less work and more leisure have all come true. It seems as though we tend to take both a gloomy and hopeful view of mankind and misjudge its potential for making correctives when it comes to how human beings, our societies, governments and institutions would behave in future under changing conditions.In contrast, predictions regarding scientific and technological advances in the fields of medicine, computers, biology, astronomy etc have more frequently proven to materialize successfully, at times sooner than expected. The Moore's Law comes to mind immediately. This book itself shows how accurately Jules Verne, in the mid 1800s, predicted life in Paris in the 1960s as consisting of skyscrapers, air-conditioning, TV, elevators, high-speed trains and fax machines. It seems as if we have a better grasp of machines and man's interactions with them and the development of this man-machine future. This book by theoretical Physicist Michio Kaku, crystal-gazes into this future as led by the advance of science and technology. Even if one does not accept all the projections, we end up learning a lot on what stunning possibilities are out there as we live out this century.The book is organized on what we can expect in the near term (by 2030), the mid term (2030-2070) and the long term (2070-2100). The future is explored through the domains of Computers, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Medicine, Nanotechnology, Energy and Space Travel. But it is not just speculation from a Theoretical Physicist. The author had discussed with hundreds of scientists who actually work today on these ideas and had compiled out of this interaction, what is possible in these three time periods. The presentation and language in the book is simple and accessible even to the average non-science minded reader and that, in my view, is a great positive about the book. I shall outline here some of the future products and possibilities given by Dr.Kaku which grabbed my mind:MRI machines which are just a foot long, looking like cell phones which can be passed over the human body and detect cancer (2030)Computers which scan fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) patterns in the brain and decipher a person's stream of consciousness and thereby detect what he/she is thinking (2070-2100)Computers being able to reconstruct a person's facial features given a strand of DNA from that person'e hair or bloodTissue engineering to manufacture a whole body part by extracting a few cells from the bodyResurrection of extinct life forms like the Mammoth or the NeanderthalNano-particles which enter and kill only cancer cells and leave healthy tissue untouchedchanging one shape to another at the push of a button, just like the T-1000 in 'Terminator-2'Molecular Replicators, capable of creating almost anything we want, the same way that nature can “take hamburgers and vegetables and turn them into a baby.”Fusion plants dotting the countryside by mid centuryLanding on an asteroid or on a moon of planet Mars, Space ElevatorsThe final couple of chapters deal with the future of humanity, planetary civilizations and how life would look in 2100. One can feel the child-like enthusiasm of Dr.Kaku in writing about all these possibilities and it makes the book enjoyable reading. He uses references to popular sci-fi movies from Hollywood to illustrate many of the ideas. In fact, as I read the book, I developed a greater respect for movie makers like that of the Terminator, Matrix, Star Wars, Avatar and so on.We have heard recently of anxieties being expressed about Artificial Intelligence and its destructive potential by luminaries like Bill Gates and Elon Musk. The eminent futurist, Ray Kurzweil has suggested in his work 'The Singularity is Near' that by 2045, a $1000 computer would be a billion times more intelligent than all humans combined and hence creating an uncontrolled runaway singularity. But others like Douglas Hofstadter and Mitch Kapor have dismissed these notions. This book discusses this topic substantially and believes that mankind will develop 'friendly AI' and use it to enhance itself rather than letting itself be ruled by mean-minded robots. Dr.Kaku shows six reasons why there are major roadblocks to such a singularity.On the negative side, just as in other books on the future, this one also has its tiresome speculation on the 'sick men of Asia'. Dr.Kaku quotes a report by Peter Schwartz of the Global Business Network on the dire future that is likely in the demographic nightmare of South Asia. Sea level rise due to Global warming in the latter half of this century could cause massive flooding and chaos, resulting in millions of refugees across the borders of Bangladesh into India. Governments could lose all authority and collapse, resulting in nightmarish looting and rioting. Rising tensions and chaos and inability to control may result in nations resorting to nuclear weapons!It is only scientists who tell us that Human societies, weather and climate are non-linear systems and even a very small change could have a massive effect, called the butterfly effect, making it difficult to predict the long-term futures. Then, I don't see how the author is so sure of destructive global warming in the future and also the consequent behavior of south Asians. In spite of being repeatedly wrong, futurists cannot seem to resist making dire predictions for the future of nations with large populations.The book is enjoyable reading and educative as well. I strongly recommend reading it. Even though Physics plays an important role in all the science that is discussed in the book, I am unsure of whether 'Physics of the Future' is the most meaningful title for the book. When I picked up the book initially, I thought it would be a book on String Theory."
76,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645507-jason-schneeberger,5,"I don't usually do book reviews this long anymore, but this one that I won't soon forget. If ever. Based off of the known laws of nature, author and world renowned theoretical physicist Michio Kaku met with, and interviewed, 300 of the leading scientists in the world about what our world will be like in the year 2100 through the ever increasing advancements of technology. This book lays out the most likely scenario of computers, AI, medicine, nanotechnology, energy, space travel and wealth from those interviews and how they will shape the world by the year 2100.Oh what a fantastic and thought provoking book this was! It's great to read a book about the future that isn't nihilistic, apocalyptic and negative, but rather hopeful and full of wonder! Sure, the very real threats of chaos, nuclear war, global warming etc are addressed in this book, but in ways that give rise to ways around such problems instead of weakly giving into them.I'm always wondering why every sci-fi movie based in the future has to be apocalyptic, or negative about where the world is going? It's easy to see the bad decisions we are making as humans that drive this thinking and make it seem like a sure reality to come, but where are the optimistic stories? Where are the stories that show us prospering and thriving as a world in the future? Those ideas and thoughts are in this book! Hopefully some good screenwriters and filmmakers will get inspired and make a movie based off the ideas in this book. I want to see it! Almost all of us alive now will not get to experience the world in the year 2100. Not unless of course the age reversal science described in the book becomes a reality (and it seems as though it's a very real possibility in the second half of this century), but this book brings much to the imagination of looking out a window, into the world at the dawn of the 22nd century. I can't say think of anything bad to say about this one. I absolutely loved everything about it. BUY IT!"
77,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Informed speculations engagingly presentedIt’s easy to see that Professor Kaku had a lot of fun writing this book since more than anything (at least for this reader) this book was a pleasure to read.Typically Kaku begins each chapter with some reference to the ancient gods or some other form of mythology or folklore, mainly for contrast or to highlight human yearnings that are being fulfilled today or may be fulfilled in the near future. He then mixes in some science fiction movies, stories or novels that he likes or finds instructive (or not). He adds some personal research and experiences with some of the great minds of our time as he makes his predictions, speculations and guesses on where we are going and when we are going to get there. Partly because of his celebrity and partly because of his wide-ranging knowledge and sharp intelligence (not to mention his charm) Kaku is able to talk with Nobel Prize winners and other cutting edge scientists and engineers all over the world the way most people talk to their neighbors. Areas of interest, each with its own chapter are computers, artificial intelligence, medicine, nanotechnology, energy, space travel, wealth (i.e., economics), and what life will be like in the future on a day-to-day basis. Each chapter gives Kaku’s speculations for the “Near Future (Present to 2030),” “Midcentury (2030 to 2070),” and the “Far Future (2070 to 2100).”I’m going to try to NOT second guess Kaku but I do want to focus on a few areas of personal interest and add a comment or two. “It is a law of evolution that fitter species arise to displace unfit species; and perhaps humans will be lost in the shuffle, eventually winding up in zoos where our robotic creations come to stare at us…Perhaps that is our role in history, to give birth to our evolutionary successors.” (p. 100)I think this is likely, especially if you add our genetically engineered successors. If so we can then think of ourselves as the “intelligent designers” of the demigods to come.Kaku weighs in on the possibility of our robotic creations becoming more intelligent than humans. (Seems very likely.) He speculates on robots producing “ever-smarter” robots that might “devour the resources of the planet in their insatiable quest to become ever more intelligent.” (p. 101) This can be seen as a near corollary of the idea that robots will become our masters and take over the planet. Since robots can only do what is programmed into them, these ideas depend on poor or malicious programming. (Beware the black hats of the future!)On page 116 Kaku points out that “there is no universally accepted definition of ‘smart.’” He doesn’t elaborate but I want to say that the unstated question is “smart for what”? Is the goal, e.g., happiness or world domination? A different kind of smarts might be required in each case.In talking about what jobs will still be available for humans in the midcentury future, Kaku makes the excellent point that those jobs will require “nonrepetitive work that requires pattern recognition.” (p. 305) He includes garbage collectors, police officers, construction workers, gardeners, and plumbers. However where I live as soon as they get a robot to drive the truck garbage collection will be a completely automated task. We have plastic containers set out on the street which are picked up and emptied by a mechanical arm from the truck. (Yes, the future is now.)In Chapter 8 “Future of Humanity” Kaku presents Nikolai Kardashev’s Type I, II, and III Civilizations based on energy consumption. (A Type II civilization, for example, consumes all the energy from their sun.) What I found interesting is Kaku’s statement that we “are leading to a single point: the creation of a planetary civilization.” (p. 327) I think the term “planetary civilization” is what we need to replace the currently (in some quarters) offensive term, “world government.”Kaku makes the sharp point that movies with “cross-cultural themes…packed with internationally recognized celebrities, are big money makers for Hollywood.” He sees this as “evidence of an emerging planetary culture.” (p. 334) He adds on the next page that “Local cultures will continue to survive, coexisting side by side with the larger global culture.”Some of Kaku’s dreams (perhaps) are room temperature super conductors and space elevators, to name just two that are highly speculative but would be amazing if realized.In the chapter on artificial intelligence, Kaku gives his three-pointed definition of consciousness. (Actually with becoming modesty he writes, “…if I were to venture a guess.”) In my book “The World Is Not as We Think It Is” I also give a three-pointed definition:“One: awareness of the world (including awareness of our self and our processes, that is, self-awareness).Two: self-identity. Notice that awareness of self is different from this identification with self.Three: experience or sensation, the feelings we get when we experience the world. This is sometimes called “phenomenal consciousness.” An example would be the subjective experience of the color red, or the taste of a strawberry.” (p. 82)Here is Kaku’s delineation from page 97:“1. sensing and recognizing the environment2. self-awareness3. planning for the future by setting goals and plans, that is, simulating the future and plotting strategy.”The slight differences are instructive. He leaves out self-identification, perhaps rightly so; and I leave out planning for the future. Also I presume that Kaku includes self-awareness in his first component. Personally I would include planning for the future in my first component, “awareness of the world” as well; however to emphasize “simulating the future” is a fine thing to do since humans are on another level in the animal kingdom when it comes to imagining what might happen.I should mention that in writing this book Kaku did not just tune into the zeitgeist but actually read prognosticators from the past. Two who did well were Benjamin Franklin and the Marquis de Condorcet. Since Kaku’s predictions are mostly favorable for humans, I hope his predictions do as well. --Dennis Littrell, author of “Hard Science and the Unknowable”"
78,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7227342-richard,3,"Michio Kaku's book, Physics of the Future, concludes with a comprehensive prediction of what life will like in 2100 as the subtitle indicates. The majority of the book is made up of predictions about how technology will evolve in the intervening years.The book was written in 2011, so some its contents are already dated. Interestingly, certain predictions about the near future have already come to pass. Other predictions appear to be a little delayed. To be clear, Mr. Kaku is very humble in the introduction about the ability to predict the future. One of the concrete statements he makes about the future is the idea there is a great deal to be optimistic about. He examines individuals in the past who were pessimistic about the development of technology, and he shows how wrong these individuals proved to be in time. For this reason, I think he is correct to say the future belongs to the optimists.I enjoyed the book; however, I don't think it is worth more than 3 stars. It has some important ideas, but the audience is narrow to a certain extant. It seems to offer inspiration to the future scientists who will make these breakthroughs; however, it isn't as relevant to the average reader. We will eventually see the changes predicted, but they are mostly decades away. "
79,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467608-serro,4,"This is a great book by a great physicist. I only rate it 4 stars because his thoughts and predictions can only be tested in 2100. I promise to raise my rating to 5 starts in 2100 if his predictions are correct. That is because according to Michio Kaku medicine will evolve greatly allowing people to live a lot longer than now. Not that I don't plan on living for 113 years as it is.The reader will find insights about the future of computers and AI, medicine and nanotechnology, space travel and energy. Kaku also takes on the nature of humanity as a whole in the next 100 years.And bear in mind these are not the predictions of Nostradamus, Michi Kaku knows first hand what he writes about."

I'm only giving this one 3 Stars because it is pretty similar to some of his other works and he repeats these concepts. This is only noticable since I have read his other books, but if you haven't and are interested in theoretical physics, give this a try!"

Because he studies what is happening with our culture, he can anticipate what advancements will be made and when we can expect them. This is a good read:"
82,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1080484-teji,4,"The author’s passion for both physics and science-fiction is evident throughout this piece of speculative non-fiction. The work explores several areas of emerging technology and applied science, not just quantum physics. As the author notes, his predictions are “reasoned estimates of when the prototype technologies of today will finally reach maturity”. His extrapolation of what he thinks is likely to occur in the near (2010-2030), mid (2030-20700, and far (2070-2100) future, are intriguing and thought provoking. The organization is very repetitive-- almost as if it were written as a series of articles that were later post-edited into a book format (although I don't think that is the case). Also, the writing is a little dry in places-- but not intolerably so. Additionally, when speaking of the future, the author tends to geek out and engage in overwrought, almost giddy, statements about the “godlike” powers technology will grant humans within the next century. These flaws aside, overall, the writing is coherent and accessible. It will be interesting to see how well his forecasts for the next couple of decades hold-up.Quotes(view spoiler)[[In his novel, Paris in the Twentieth Century, written in 1863, Jules Verne] “predicted that Paris in 1960 would have glass skyscrapers, air conditioning, TV, elevators, high-speed trains, gasoline-powered automobiles, fax machines, and even something resembling the Internet…just a few years later he made another spectacular prediction. In 1865, he wrote From the Earth to the Moon, in which he predicted the details of the mission that sent our astronauts to the moon…He accurately predicted the size of the space capsule to within a few percent, the location of the launch site in Florida…the weightlessness that the astronauts would experience, and the final splashdown in the ocean…How was Jules Verne able to predict 100 years into the future with such breathtaking accuracy? His biographers have noted that, although Verne was not a scientist himself he constantly sought out scientists…He amassed a vast archive summarizing the great scientific discoveries of his time. Verne, more than others, realized that science was the engine shaking the foundations of civilization, propelling it into a new century with unexpected marvels and miracles.” -Introduction“Another great prophet of technology was Leonardo da Vinci, painter, thinker, and visionary…Like Jules Verne, Leonardo was able to get profound insights into the future by consulting a handful of forward-thinking individuals of his time…In addition, Leonardo was always experimenting, building, and sketching models, a key attribute of anyone who wants to translate thinking into reality.” -Introduction“As William Gibson…once said, ‘The future is already here. It’s just unevenly distributed.” -Introduction“Predictions for the future, with a few exceptions, have always underestimated the pace of technological progress.” -IntroductionThere are four fundamental forces in nature that drive the entire universe: gravity (unlocking the force of gravity helped to pave the way for the Industrial Revolution and the introduction of steam power, especially the locomotive), electromagnetic force (this unleashed the electronic revolution that has created a bounty of scientific wonders), and the two nuclear forces: the weak and strong forces. “When Einstein wrote down e=mc^2 and when the atom was split in the 1930s, scientists for the first time began to understand the forces that light up the heavens…the secret behind the stars…it also held out the promise that one day we would be able to harness this power on the earth”… quantum theory “has given us the transistor, the laser, and the digital resolution that is the driving force behind modern society. -Introduction“Exponential growth is often hard to grasp, since our minds think linearly. It is so gradual that you sometimes cannot experience the change at all. But over decades, it can completely alter everything around us. According to Moore's law, every Christmas your new computer games are almost twice as powerful (in terms of the number of transistors) as those from the previous year. Furthermore, as the years pass, this incremental gain becomes monumental. For example, when you receive a birthday card in the mail, it often has a chip that sings ‘Happy Birthday’ to you. Remarkably, that chip has more computer power than all the Allied forces of 1945. Hitler, Churchill, or Roosevelt might have killed to get that chip…Today, your cell phone has more computer power than all of NASA back in 1969, when it placed two astronauts on the moon…” Ch1“Today, when we enter a room, we automatically look for the light switch since we assume that the walls are electrified. In the future, the first thing we will do on entering a room…is to assume the room is intelligent…Around 2020, the price of a chip may also drop to about a penny…then we will have millions of chips distributed everywhere in our environment, silently carrying out our orders.” -Ch1“One reason why Moore's law has relentlessly increased the power of chips is because UV light can be tuned so that its wavelength is smaller and smaller, making it possible to etch increasingly tiny transistors onto silicon wafers. Since UV light has a wavelength as small as 10 nanometers, this means that the smallest transistor that you can etch is thirty atoms across…But this process cannot go on forever…You can even calculate roughly when Moore’s law will finally collapse: when you finally hit transistors the size of individual atoms… According to the laws of physics, eventually the Age of Silicon will come to a close, as we enter the Post-Silicon Era. Transistors will be so small that quantum theory or atomic physics takes over and electrons leak out of the wires…At that point, according to the laws of physics, the quantum theory takes over. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that you cannot know both the position and the velocity of any particle…at the atomic level you simply cannot know where the electron is, so it can never be confined precisely in an ultrathin wire or layer and it necessarily leaks out, causing the circuit to short-circuit.” Ch1“However, scans of the human brain clearly show that thinking is spread out over large parts of the brain...Digital computers can calculate at nearly the speed of light. he human brain, by contrast, is incredibly slow. Nerve impulses travel at an excruciatingly slow pace of about 200 miles per hour. But the brain more than makes up for this because it is massively parallel… In a race, a superfast single processor is left in the dust by a superslow parallel processor.” Ch2“While hardware had grown [exponentially] by the ability to etch smaller and smaller transistors onto a wafer, software is totally different; it requires a human to sit down with a pencil and paper to write code. That is the bottleneck: the human. Software, like all human creative activity, progresses in fits and starts, with brilliant insights and long stretches of drudgery and stagnation.” Ch2“…genetic analysis shows that aging is concentrated in the ""engine"" of the cell, the mitochondria, or the cell’s power plant. This has allowed scientists to…look for ways to accelerate the gene repair process inside the mitochondria to reverse the effects of aging.” Ch3“Normally, we don’t see quantum forces at work in everyday life. But quantum forces are everywhere…if we are largely empty, then why can’t we walk through walls?...The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons can exit in the same quantum state. Hence, when two nearly identical electrons get too close, they repel each other. This is the reason objects appear to be solid, which is an illusion…When we sit on a chair...we are hovering above the chair, floating less than a nanometer above it, repelled by the chair’s electrical and quantum forces.” Ch4“The quantum theory has only one thing going for it: it is correct. Its accuracy has been measured to one part in ten billion, making it the most successful physical theory of all time.” Ch4“Science and technology are the engines of prosperity…” Ch7“The combination of changing social conditions and the mastery of the four forces propelled Europe to the forefront of nations. But technologies are dynamic, changing all the time. They are born, evolve, and rise and fall…technologies obey certain laws of evolution. Mass technologies usually evolve in four basic stages…In stage I, the products of technology are so precious that they are closely guarded. Paper, when it was invented in the form of papyrus by the ancient Egyptians…was so precious that one papyrus scroll was closely guarded by scores of priests…Paper entered stage II around 1450, when Gutenberg invented the movable type…one person could possess one book containing the knowledge of hundreds of scrolls. Before Gutenberg, there were only 30,000 books in all Europe. By 1500, there were 9 million books…By around 1930, paper hit stage III, when the cost fell to a penny a sheet. This made possible the personal library, where one person could possess hundreds of books. Paper became an ordinary commodity…Paper is everywhere and nowhere, invisible and ubiquitous. Now we are in stage IV, where paper is a fashion statement. We decorate our world with paper of all colors, shapes, and sizes. The largest source of urban waste is paper. So paper evolved from being a closely guarded commodity to being waste.” Running water, electricity, and computer have followed the same pattern. Ch7“But as technologies evolve, they create abrupt changes in the economy that sometimes lead to social dislocations. In any revolution, there are winners and losers…What jobs will flourish by midcentury? How will the evolution of technology change the way we work? We can partially determine the answer by asking a simple question: What are the limitations of robots? As we have seen, there are at least two basic stumbling blocks to artificial intelligence: pattern recognition and common sense. Therefore, the jobs that will survive in the future are…ones that require these two abilities.” Ch7“Developing nations may be able to take advantage of the information revolution. They can, in principle, leapfrog past the developed nations in many areas. In the developed world, telephone companies had to tediously wire up every home or farm at great cost. But a developing nation does not have to wire up its country, since cell phone technology can excel in rural areas without any roads or infrastructure. Also, developing nations have the advantage that they do not have to rebuild an aging infrastructure…” Ch7“…the Unites States has maintained its dominance in science and technology in spite of the fact that U.S. students often score dead last when it comes to essential subjects like science and math…(It should also be pointed out that this ranking corresponds roughly to the number of days that students were in school. China, which ranked number 1, averaged 251 days of instruction per year, while the United States averaged only 178 days per year.) It seems like a mystery that, despite these awful numbers, the United States continues to do well internationally in science and technology, until you realize that much of the U.S science [talent] comes from overseas. The United States has a secret weapon, the H1B visa…But the H1B visa is only a stopgap measure. The United States cannot continue to live off foreign scientists, many of whom are beginning to return to China and India as their economies improve…The United States will eventually have to overhaul its archaic, sclerotic education system. At present, poorly prepared high school students flood the job market and universities…Employers continually bemoan the fact that they have to take one year to train their new hires to bring them up to speed. And the universities are burdened by having to create new layers of remedial courses to compensate for the poor high school education system…” Ch7“When physicists try to analyze civilizations, we rank them on the basis of the energy they consume. This ranking was first introduced in 1964 by Russian astrophysicists Nikolai Kardashev…he proposed three theoretical types: A Type I civilization is planetary, consuming the sliver of sunlight that falls on their planet, or about 10^17 watts. A Type II civilization is stellar, consuming all the energy that their sun emits, or 10^27 watts. A Type III civilization is galactic, consuming the energy of billions of stars, or about 10^37 watts…Each type is separated by a factor of 10 billion: a Type III civilization consumes 10 billion times more energy than at Type II civilization…which in turn consumes 10 billion times more energy than a Type I civilization. According to the classification, our present-day civilization is Type 0. We don’t even rate on this scale, since we get our energy from dead plants, that is from oil and coal. (Carl Sagan, generalizing this classification...[estimated] that we are actually a Type .7 civilization…we can mathematically estimate that we will attain Type I status in about 100 years, given an average rate of economic growth.” Ch8“Also, if room temperature superconductors are found in this century, it means a complete overhaul of our energy requirements. Waste heat, in the form of friction, will be greatly reduced, increasing the efficiency of our machines. As we mentioned, the majority of our energy consumption, especially transportation, goes into overcoming friction…it would take almost no energy to move from California to New York if there were no friction.” Ch8 (hide spoiler)]"
83,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9619705-anna,0,I just want to see an updated version of this book explaining why most of short term predictions didn't work out.
84,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,2,"The book was extremely informative about current trends in science (and some technology). It lives up to its title in discussing physics of the future. The author is a skilled writer who is gifted at communicating highly abstract and obscure ideas.So why only two stars?I did have some issues with the overall books and how this project was carried out. Some were more troubling than others. The major issues include:1) Too much scientific triumphalism -- The clear storyline in the book is that science will render most of the troubles of life either moot or less relevant. Diseases will go away, aging will be suppressed, and immortality lies around the corner! Hovercraft will be developed, robots will be everywhere and solve our problems, and traditional issues of scarcity re health and food will go away. I suspect that this technological paradise is being oversold, just a bit. Lifespan has been extended, but arguably more by prenatal and care for newborns, coupled with public health measures such as mass inoculation coupled with the aggressive combating of traditional killers like smallpox. We still haven't figured out much regarding the flu or the common cold! Yes there has been progress, but is heaven really that near? Have we proven ourselves worthy of godlike status?2) There is very little on economics throughout the book. The author has apparently read some of Thurow's futurist work but not much else. Science and technology need to be brought to market and commercialized before they can hope to revolutionize our lives. Perhaps the government will do it all?? Well the government might fund defense research and NSF grants but last I heard it still did limited work on commercialization.3) What about politics? The twentieth century brought amazing advances in science and technology but also rule by thugs, gangsters, and murderers that applied technology to the extermination of millions. Oh Brave New World . . . . !4) The author pushes his futurist motivation -- using a near future, mid future, and far future framework, but in the end it comes down to extrapolation between two poles - heaven or catastrophe, with the chance of catastrophe severely discounted. Not much of a choice!5) The author raises the need for education in science and technology, suggesting that they have read Goldin and Katz, but only talk about it in the context of H1B visas and information intensive jobs that go wanting. What about the increasing numbers of people in the US who are almost completely left out of the new age because of their poor education and training? Kaku may be setting up the world of Wells' Time Machine without knowing it. How can we move into a scientific and technology heaven, when most people are fit to work at Wal-Mart at best? What will all the dummies do once the robots take over our jobs? . . . which negative utopia comes to mind? the Matrix??6) This could be partially excused, since no author is perfect and the book is informative. What is more troubling about the book is that it is two or three chapters too long and the extra chapters detract from the book's value. Once the author moves from the descriptive and commentary and mild extrapolation in most ot the book to a more normative tone when he discusses the evolution of a planetary civilization, he loses me completely. He takes a framework by Kardashev to identify civilizations we might encounter from space and order them by energy use (???) and applies it to how our civilization might develop. Note here, we are using a framework with absolutely no data or experience behind it, with the exception of the sci-fi movie genre, and turning it into the summary framework for a book purporting to provide an update to general readers on the state of research in physics!! Needless to say I was not convinced and was chuckling - for the wrong reasons -- as I worked through the end of the book. This appears to be a common problem in big reach synthesis boos -- Ian Morris' book on why the West rules comes to mind, although the latter is a much better book overall.5) By the end of the book, I was wondering if there were particular reasons why Kaku appeared to have ""lost it"" when he just should have stopped writing fifty pages sooner.6) Overall, I don't regret reading it. I just regret finishing it."
85,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12945730-jack-ferreira,3,"I like Michio Kaku, he seems like a pretty cool, down to earth guy. I'll get some criticism out of the way, because overall I did enjoy the book.I have seen interviews and tv shows he's been in and though I do like him sometimes his atitude bothers me for some reason. I can't quite put my finger on it, maybe it has something to do with this slightly over-pandering way of explaining things. It looks like he thinks the only way his readers will understand what he's saying is by constantly referencing Star Treck, Star Wars and other products of science fiction which really isn't needed. I understood him perfectly well when he talked about portable MRI machines and DNA chips before he felt the need to display a picture of a Star Treck ""tricorder"" (just in case we couldn't grasp the idea by ourselves). I thought these constant references were a bit odd because this isn't a hard book to comprehend. It's not necessarily insulting but at the same time it feels a little condescending. This is especialy present in the final chapter (""A Day in a Life in 2100""). It was completely unecessary and cringeworthy, he may be a great theoretical physicist but he is not a great writer (outside of non-fiction, at least). That said, I learnt a lot from this book. I will probably forget most of it, I admit, but it made me feel up to date on our current technological advancements. I liked the way he split up each chapter, making it nicely organized and easy to navigate through. It was great reading about realistic predictions for the future of computers, AI, energy, nanotechnology and space travel. The future of wealth was also discussed which took me by surprise and I sincerely apreciated it, since it really is something important to consider.As he talks about the future of humanity he introduces some very interesting concepts. It leaves me excited for things to come and curious of how it will change our way of life.Obviously, we should all take these predictions with a grain of salt. I'm sure Michio Kaku has more or less figured out the near future, but up to the year 2100 he gets quite vague. Some people see it as a bad thing, but I don't blame him. Any book we read, from an author who goes out of his areas of expertise must not be taken for granted. I have seen people comment on misuse of terminology and a lot of non consideration for alternate scenarios. This is why I love people like Richard Dawkins, who write books within their fields and whose content I absolutely trust.It's a nice book if you don't look upon it as a definitive guide to the future.I am now in the mood for some science fiction though."
86,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53461468-rasty,5,"Its amazing when you first read that book , it's not about how science developed or anything like that , but its about how science will develop and will shape our destiny or thoughts to our whole world , michio kaku one of my favorite writers about science , and that was amazing from him :)"
87,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5526063-mary-jean-harris,3,"This was quite a good book with lots of fascinating predictions for the future, as well as a survey of technologies currently being developed. I'd give it 3.5 stars (you need 1/2 stars, Goodreads!). Michio Kaku writes about the places he's visited, mostly research labs, that are working on new technologies, including bioengineering, nanotechnology, quantum computers, robotics, gene therapy, self-driving cars, space travel, and space elevators. Kaku's enthusiasm for these future changes is undying throughout the book, and it makes an enjoyable read. I can't agree with him that all this will result in positive change for the future though, especially as technology becomes more invasive and embedded into our lives, drawing us even further apart from the natural world as well as opening up the possibility for people (and governments and organizations) to control us in this system. It sounds eerily similar to the matrix, but Kaku doesn't seem overly concerned about any of these issues.Additionally, Kaku unfortunately falls into the trap of global warming hysteria: he takes it for granted that humanity is causing a climate crisis, a position that is highly contented and strewn with propaganda. As a scientist analysing a complicated issue, Kaku does not apply his own standards of rational inquiry to this issue and instead accepts the politically correct position that, even if he dug a little deep into the issue before writing the book, he would realize is not supported by many climate scientists.Also, although I liked the last chapter about ""a day in the life in 2100"" overall, it was really corny and, for some reason, the main guy we're following works at an office with only men...do no females work in the industry?. Also, this online dating stuff has become prevalent and people just do it naturally, something I find really creepy.But despite these problems with the book, it was a great read overall and definitely accessible to the general public."
88,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4617137-sangita-takhur,4,"To me the big question is: how fast will our technology progress in the coming years? I know it is very difficult to give a solid logical answer to this question. I liked the book but I do not agree with Kaku on many points. I think Kaku used almost a linear model for predicting the future. I think we need more imaginative power for predicting the future. Like Kaku I too believe that, gene technology, computers, artificial intelligence and robots will advance rapidly. The book is composed of the following nine chapters: 1. Future of the Computer: Mind over Matter, 2. Future of AI: Rise of the Machines, 3. Future of Medicine: Perfection and Beyond, 4. Nanotechnology: Everything from Nothing?, 5. Future of Energy: Energy from the Stars, 6. Future of Space Travel: To the Stars, 7. Future of Wealth, 8. Future of Humanity: Planetary Civilization, and 9. A Day in the Life in 2100. Kaku's approach is excellent, as if he is talking to a lay person, but he writes with a simple eloquence that makes these complex concepts accessible to the non-Physicist mind.Michio is too good in predicting the limitations of the technologies. One may argue that Michio's idea of robots and computers is similar to the AI from the movies in the 1990s, but we have to think year 2020 much brighter. Development on medicine, synthetic biology and nanotechnology is almost ignored. I was expecting more about quantum biology but that too is missing. But overall I liked the book. The book is good enough to stimulate our imagination."
89,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/153756-jeffrey,4,"A fascinating look at how the world might change in the future, while also giving some good basic information on various subjects - for example, Kaku breaks down how gene therapy works, and also what it could lead to. Kaku's style of writing is informative and accessible, and the only time I found myself starting to lose focus was during the fictional narrative covering a typical day in 2100. In a way, that section suffers from a lack of imagination in what people would be like, despite having well thought out possibilities for technology; it seems more like an example of what someone from today would act like if we had all of that technology today. Still, that got me thinking about things... like, one hundred years ago, someone wouldn't have even been able to conceive of the internet, but even if they could imagine it, they probably wouldn't be able to foresee the rise of things like social media, youtube, etc. and how those things are changing the way humanity deals with privacy and public appearance.Kaku's pretty optimistic about the future (he even only mentions the idea of humanity going extinct one time), so this book is at times almost like a really well researched version of the cliched utopian future. Fortunately the book's foundation is in science and balances that vision with various realistic possibilities, and in any case it's a great source of basic information related to physics for the layperson."
90,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17648164-umair-khan,4,"What is the future going to be like? Physics of the Future tries to answer this question in an engaging, thought provoking and visionary account of the possibilities that, according to the author, Michio Kaku, will be transformed into reality in the coming decades. The book will not be a disappointment to fans of Kaku and can be considered as a sequel to his previous work, Visions, but with a more expansive view.Physics outlines four fundamental forces of nature: gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force and strong nuclear force. Kaku is of the opinion that each time a force of nature is understood by scientists and harnessed by engineers it sets in motion a chain reaction of novel and unique technologies determining the course of human development. In Physics, Kaku interviews more than 300 scientists and inventors who are working day and night to push the boundaries of science and technology. Essentially, the theme of the book is similar to the works of futurists like Ray Kurzweil, however, the treatment of the topic is more vivid and easier to understand.Kaku seems to be following the footsteps of visionary futurists like Leonardo da Vinci and Jules Verne. He explores the impact of physics on the areas of computer science, artificial intelligence, medicine, nanotechnology, alternative energy and space travel. Kaku scientifically predicts what new technologies will enter in the following decades, what will be achieved by the mid-21st century, and finally what we will accomplish by the end of it.The narrative, introducing prospects of controlling computers through the human mind, resurrecting extinct animals, travelling to other planets and genetically enhancing our disease resistance, is exciting to read. The author claims that we might even be able to bring back the Neanderthal. However, he pinpoints the ethical dilemmas associated with such achievements by quoting Richard Klein, an anthropologist at Stanford: “Are you going to put the Neanderthals in a zoo or in Harvard?”In the last chapter, Kaku introduces the reader to an imaginary character living in the 22nd century. Biologically, he is in his 70s but the age of his organs is mid-30s. He rides a self-driven car. Nano-bots monitor the crucial indicators of his health while roaming in his bloodstream. What distinguishes this book from works of science fiction is that every prediction in the book is based on research and supported by prototypes being developed across the globe.Kaku also analyses the economic and social history of our civilisation and explains that new technologies are the engines of both scientific and social change. He rightly points out that the economic recessions of the 1850s, 1920s and 2008 were due to the “speculative fever” created around specific sectors: the railroad, automotive stocks and real estate, respectively.He warns that when the British Empire was shifting its focus from scientific innovation to more mundane matters of power-play, the US was emerging as a leader in research and advancement of knowledge in all fields. However, if the majority of the US talent is going into the investment sector and managing the finances of others, in which region will the most brilliant minds pursue the cause of innovation and exploring the truth?Kaku further chalks out the ranking of civilisations which was first introduced in 1964 by Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev — on the basis of the energy they consume. This ranking was mainly proposed to identify the powers of extra terrestrial intelligent civilisations and classify them into three types. Type I consumes planetary sources of energy, mainly sunlight that falls on their planet; Type II consumes all the energy produced by their sun, while Type III consumes the energy produced by all the stars of their galaxy. Our current status is perhaps that of a Type 0 since we consume the energy of dead plants (oil and coal). Kaku estimates that given the economic growth rate we will be able to achieve the status of a Type I civilisation by the end of the century.Physics of the Future not only tells us what is probable and possible in the future, it also gives researchers and inventors a timescale to measure their successes against. Moreover, it makes the reader feel excited about the times we are living in, when we can expect ‘miracles’ to happen in our lifetimes. Kaku points out that “By 2100, our destiny is to become like the gods we once worshipped and feared.”SOURCE: http://www.dawn.com/news/634292/non-f..."
91,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3352854-david-skip-everling,2,"I'm not sure about anybody's ability to predict a century into the future (especially if you give credence to the idea of accelerating returns in technology), but I was willing to give this book a shot after hearing Michio Kaku in interviews. In particular he piqued my curiosity with the claim that all the ideas in the book are grounded on currently existing prototypes or established scientific theory.Now after having read it, I think Michio is only giving a survey of some select topics, and the only ones that I think he handled well were the ones most closely linked to physics (e.g. space travel, nanotechnology & quantum behavior, global power generation). The other fields he dives into, particularly his analysis and extrapolation of consumer technologies, were disappointingly off target or lacking in proper depth.The book is occasionally so superficial in its treatment of some prototyped technologies that it reads somewhat like painfully outdated sci-fi from Michio's childhood in the 50's. The book is written to be highly accessible, but he does uninformed readers a disservice by giving equal weight to illogical and 'improbable but not impossible' possibilities. My biggest problem with his predictions are that they center on only a set of technologies that Kaku has experience with, extrapolated all the way out to 2100 without much consideration of how all the unmentioned possibilities will change his visions for the future.As an example, Michio doesn't do the best job keeping our present circumstances and his far future predictions from mixing anachronistically: e.g. the frequently repeated ""...when we carry around our own genomes on a CD-ROM"" for a ""2030-2070"" range prediction. I worry that Michio Kaku is just paraphrasing some of the ideas out there without really thinking about them any more critically, like a mediocre science journalist or sci-fi writer. Again this could be an artifact of his intentionally writing this book to be broadly accessible, but I don't think he found the right balance.The best parts of the book are in the second half, particularly his chapters on The Future of: Energy, Space Travel, Wealth, and Humanity (respectively) and I did enjoy most of this material despite a scattering of the same problems mentioned above. Sadly, I think Michio Kaku completely botched his concluding chapter, ""A Day in the Life in 2100"", and I think the preceding Future of Humanity chapter would have been a much stronger ending. The ""Day in the Life"" conclusion is silly speculative fiction and the best (worst?) example in the entire book of his anachronistic and muddled sci-fi visions. Michio Kaku is great when talking about physics and large scale trends closely linked to humanity's knowledge of physics, but judging from this book alone he doesn't put together upcoming technologies into realistic or compelling future scenarios very well at all, ending up with an incomplete picture somewhere in the uncomfortable border between imaginative thinking and unwarranted speculation."
92,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,4,"This is a fascinating survey of what's actually happening in the cutting edge of science and technology. He walks through computers and vehicles and energy and space exploration and even culture. For each area he discussed deeply what's happening now, then gives thoughtful guesses to what will develop in early 21st century, mid-century, and late-century. His understanding of science is broad AND deep. His vision of the future of science is compelling. Some highlights: Tiny computer chips will be embedded in everything--almost literally--and we'll live in a cloud of data that's ridiculous. Robots will outnumber humans--but they won't be able to do anything but the physical tasks we program them to do (including driving our cars and planes). Magnetism will finally be mastered and we'll run our world on magnetic power rather than electric power. And by the end of the century remote control robots will be building a moon base for us to continue looking into the stars. However, I docked him a star because he displays a naive understanding of culture and history. He makes sweeping mistakes like seeing being religious as the enemy of science when history actually shows that many of the greatest science cultures were so precisely because of their religious beliefs, or his easy dismissal of cultural conflicts in the new world and his idea that once food and shelter are universal then haves and have nots won't be a real issue. So read this for the tech ideas and endure his comments about becoming like the gods of old and reaching cultural utopia. "
93,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"Michio Kaku is a great science writer (as well as being a physics professor), but futurology is a difficult subject to make interesting and all too often what you get is lists of 'in the future you will have an X that will do Y,' which gets dull fairly quickly.Where Kaku's approach is good (which is to base his ideas on physics) is in the future of energy. His chapter on space exploration is good too - he is a great enthusiast for this, and that comes across strongly here. The only proviso is that the main controlling factor on space exploration is not science but politics. A man wasn't put on the moon for science, but to put the Russians in their place. We haven't done much manned exploration since for the same reason. It's too expensive for science to control things.To be honest I was even less convinced about the consumer technology ideas. If space exploration is driven by politics, consumer purchases are driven by the market. Yes, the science & technology has to be able to deliver (so you couldn't have an iPhone 10 years ago), but it doesn't decide what will and won't become popular.The book finishes with a chapter on the way the world will be a single civilization (even if nations still exist in a weakened form) by the end of the century. This seemed the least science-supported speculation. If anything we seem to be fragmenting more.All in all, a good try - but futurology remains closer to fiction than popular science."

I get that he was trying to summarize everything he'd written in the book in an interesting way, but I'm not a huge fan of 2nd person povs and it came off as annoying and unneeded. "
95,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7070282-jenny-williams,5,"After reading this selection I strongly believe Michio Kaku is one of the brightest minds in his field. Physics Of The Impossible was an amazing book and this one blows it out of the water. I can't determine if I am so fond of it because of how advanced our technology will be in the near future or if I am truly fond of his writing. I know one thing for sure, some of the different advancements in technology is going to change the way we live life in way too many ways. What I mean by that is the advancement Kaku covers isn't technology like a new version of an XBOX or something of that sort. Michio Kaku covers advancement in technology like the worlds biggest atom smasher in Switzerland under a mountain, circling a mile exactly. This atom smasher is one of the biggest advancements in our technology opening doors to creating so much energy that we will be able to travel through space at a speed close to the speed of light. That's only the example I remembered best but there are so many throughout this book it excites you for our future. Kind of. "
96,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5431286-david,3,"Since I had already read the book ""Visions"" by the same writer nearly three years ago, this one did not really generate much of an interest within me due to the much common material. Although, for someone who may have never read ""Visions"" or ""Physics of the Impossible"" (which too I had read in 2011-12), I strongly feel that ""Physics of the Future"" can tend to become very interesting if one likes to ponder on how technological the world is going to get within the next century, and how far will it be feasible to apply and integrate it within our daily lives.A Good Book, but a vast majority was already included amongst the first two of his books on the same genre. The chapter on the Future of Wealth, was kind of new though!A 3-star because the content was not new for me; otherwise I would rate it with a 4-star."

In fact, the action of the first film is kicked off by a message recorded in 3D by Princess Leia and conveyed by the robot...""

I understand that for those who know a lot about physics and technology, it may be to easy, but for such people as I am, it was great. Well, I didn't like everything what I read (especially, the beginning) but later it got much better. I really enjoyed topics about artificial intelligence and robotics, the future of medicine and genetics. I hope that many forecasts will come true."

104,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27777097-thomas-jacob-jr,3,"An enjoyable, cursory overview of some of the most exciting technological achievements we may expect mankind to engage with over the next century. I came across Michio Kaku, as I am sure many others have, by watching an interview on television a few years ago, and I was struck by his loquaciousness and intelligence. Describing contemporary scientific concepts, especially quantum physics, in a way that a layman can understand is no small feat. In Physics of the Future, Kaku focuses on several industries (private space exploration, computer technology, medicine, and others) and tries to predict what respective advances we may expect by 2100. Oftentimes he uses examples from popular science fiction, specifically Star Trek, as a frame of reference. This book definitely falls into the 'pop science' category, with only brief asides into more technical and mathematical information. Any fans of popular science fiction work in film, television, or literature will be already be aware of many of the concepts here, and truthfully, any one of them could easily fill an entire book by itself (the 'recommended reading' section at the end is a goldmine for further exploration). Kaku sometimes makes sweeping generalizations without going into further detail that may seem presumptuous, but it is usually in attempt to keep the pace light. Also, since this was written in 2011, some sections appear a little dated even only six years later (an entire section on private space exploration, for example, doesn't mention either Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos, two of the forerunners in this field). Recommended for those looking for a brief overview of some of the exciting advances in technology that we can expect to look forward to over the course of our lifetime. For those looking for a deeper dive into any of the aforementioned subjects, the dozens of recommended works at the end should serve as an excellent primer. "
105,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,4,"Peering into the future of mankind and predicting what lies in store for us a few decades from now, has always been a dicey endeavour. In general, predictions pertaining to unchecked population growth, resultant famines, wars over access to resources, gloomy prospects for the future of developing nations etc have mostly proven to be unnecessary alarms rather than reality. A few major historical instances come to mind. Rev. Thomas Malthus in the late 18th century, Dr. Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University in the 1960s, and MIT's Club of Rome report in the 1970s were famous for damning our future, particularly that of India and China due to their large populations. We find that both India and China have done pretty well in the forty years since. On the other hand, predictions about the end of slavery, end of European colonialism, an era of less work and more leisure have all come true. It seems as though we tend to take both a gloomy and hopeful view of mankind and misjudge its potential for making correctives when it comes to how human beings, our societies, governments and institutions would behave in future under changing conditions.In contrast, predictions regarding scientific and technological advances in the fields of medicine, computers, biology, astronomy etc have more frequently proven to materialize successfully, at times sooner than expected. The Moore's Law comes to mind immediately. This book itself shows how accurately Jules Verne, in the mid 1800s, predicted life in Paris in the 1960s as consisting of skyscrapers, air-conditioning, TV, elevators, high-speed trains and fax machines. It seems as if we have a better grasp of machines and man's interactions with them and the development of this man-machine future. This book by theoretical Physicist Michio Kaku, crystal-gazes into this future as led by the advance of science and technology. Even if one does not accept all the projections, we end up learning a lot on what stunning possibilities are out there as we live out this century.The book is organized on what we can expect in the near term (by 2030), the mid term (2030-2070) and the long term (2070-2100). The future is explored through the domains of Computers, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Medicine, Nanotechnology, Energy and Space Travel. But it is not just speculation from a Theoretical Physicist. The author had discussed with hundreds of scientists who actually work today on these ideas and had compiled out of this interaction, what is possible in these three time periods. The presentation and language in the book is simple and accessible even to the average non-science minded reader and that, in my view, is a great positive about the book. I shall outline here some of the future products and possibilities given by Dr.Kaku which grabbed my mind:MRI machines which are just a foot long, looking like cell phones which can be passed over the human body and detect cancer (2030)Computers which scan fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) patterns in the brain and decipher a person's stream of consciousness and thereby detect what he/she is thinking (2070-2100)Computers being able to reconstruct a person's facial features given a strand of DNA from that person'e hair or bloodTissue engineering to manufacture a whole body part by extracting a few cells from the bodyResurrection of extinct life forms like the Mammoth or the NeanderthalNano-particles which enter and kill only cancer cells and leave healthy tissue untouchedchanging one shape to another at the push of a button, just like the T-1000 in 'Terminator-2'Molecular Replicators, capable of creating almost anything we want, the same way that nature can “take hamburgers and vegetables and turn them into a baby.”Fusion plants dotting the countryside by mid centuryLanding on an asteroid or on a moon of planet Mars, Space ElevatorsThe final couple of chapters deal with the future of humanity, planetary civilizations and how life would look in 2100. One can feel the child-like enthusiasm of Dr.Kaku in writing about all these possibilities and it makes the book enjoyable reading. He uses references to popular sci-fi movies from Hollywood to illustrate many of the ideas. In fact, as I read the book, I developed a greater respect for movie makers like that of the Terminator, Matrix, Star Wars, Avatar and so on.We have heard recently of anxieties being expressed about Artificial Intelligence and its destructive potential by luminaries like Bill Gates and Elon Musk. The eminent futurist, Ray Kurzweil has suggested in his work 'The Singularity is Near' that by 2045, a $1000 computer would be a billion times more intelligent than all humans combined and hence creating an uncontrolled runaway singularity. But others like Douglas Hofstadter and Mitch Kapor have dismissed these notions. This book discusses this topic substantially and believes that mankind will develop 'friendly AI' and use it to enhance itself rather than letting itself be ruled by mean-minded robots. Dr.Kaku shows six reasons why there are major roadblocks to such a singularity.On the negative side, just as in other books on the future, this one also has its tiresome speculation on the 'sick men of Asia'. Dr.Kaku quotes a report by Peter Schwartz of the Global Business Network on the dire future that is likely in the demographic nightmare of South Asia. Sea level rise due to Global warming in the latter half of this century could cause massive flooding and chaos, resulting in millions of refugees across the borders of Bangladesh into India. Governments could lose all authority and collapse, resulting in nightmarish looting and rioting. Rising tensions and chaos and inability to control may result in nations resorting to nuclear weapons!It is only scientists who tell us that Human societies, weather and climate are non-linear systems and even a very small change could have a massive effect, called the butterfly effect, making it difficult to predict the long-term futures. Then, I don't see how the author is so sure of destructive global warming in the future and also the consequent behavior of south Asians. In spite of being repeatedly wrong, futurists cannot seem to resist making dire predictions for the future of nations with large populations.The book is enjoyable reading and educative as well. I strongly recommend reading it. Even though Physics plays an important role in all the science that is discussed in the book, I am unsure of whether 'Physics of the Future' is the most meaningful title for the book. When I picked up the book initially, I thought it would be a book on String Theory."
106,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645507-jason-schneeberger,5,"I don't usually do book reviews this long anymore, but this one that I won't soon forget. If ever. Based off of the known laws of nature, author and world renowned theoretical physicist Michio Kaku met with, and interviewed, 300 of the leading scientists in the world about what our world will be like in the year 2100 through the ever increasing advancements of technology. This book lays out the most likely scenario of computers, AI, medicine, nanotechnology, energy, space travel and wealth from those interviews and how they will shape the world by the year 2100.Oh what a fantastic and thought provoking book this was! It's great to read a book about the future that isn't nihilistic, apocalyptic and negative, but rather hopeful and full of wonder! Sure, the very real threats of chaos, nuclear war, global warming etc are addressed in this book, but in ways that give rise to ways around such problems instead of weakly giving into them.I'm always wondering why every sci-fi movie based in the future has to be apocalyptic, or negative about where the world is going? It's easy to see the bad decisions we are making as humans that drive this thinking and make it seem like a sure reality to come, but where are the optimistic stories? Where are the stories that show us prospering and thriving as a world in the future? Those ideas and thoughts are in this book! Hopefully some good screenwriters and filmmakers will get inspired and make a movie based off the ideas in this book. I want to see it! Almost all of us alive now will not get to experience the world in the year 2100. Not unless of course the age reversal science described in the book becomes a reality (and it seems as though it's a very real possibility in the second half of this century), but this book brings much to the imagination of looking out a window, into the world at the dawn of the 22nd century. I can't say think of anything bad to say about this one. I absolutely loved everything about it. BUY IT!"
107,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Informed speculations engagingly presentedIt’s easy to see that Professor Kaku had a lot of fun writing this book since more than anything (at least for this reader) this book was a pleasure to read.Typically Kaku begins each chapter with some reference to the ancient gods or some other form of mythology or folklore, mainly for contrast or to highlight human yearnings that are being fulfilled today or may be fulfilled in the near future. He then mixes in some science fiction movies, stories or novels that he likes or finds instructive (or not). He adds some personal research and experiences with some of the great minds of our time as he makes his predictions, speculations and guesses on where we are going and when we are going to get there. Partly because of his celebrity and partly because of his wide-ranging knowledge and sharp intelligence (not to mention his charm) Kaku is able to talk with Nobel Prize winners and other cutting edge scientists and engineers all over the world the way most people talk to their neighbors. Areas of interest, each with its own chapter are computers, artificial intelligence, medicine, nanotechnology, energy, space travel, wealth (i.e., economics), and what life will be like in the future on a day-to-day basis. Each chapter gives Kaku’s speculations for the “Near Future (Present to 2030),” “Midcentury (2030 to 2070),” and the “Far Future (2070 to 2100).”I’m going to try to NOT second guess Kaku but I do want to focus on a few areas of personal interest and add a comment or two. “It is a law of evolution that fitter species arise to displace unfit species; and perhaps humans will be lost in the shuffle, eventually winding up in zoos where our robotic creations come to stare at us…Perhaps that is our role in history, to give birth to our evolutionary successors.” (p. 100)I think this is likely, especially if you add our genetically engineered successors. If so we can then think of ourselves as the “intelligent designers” of the demigods to come.Kaku weighs in on the possibility of our robotic creations becoming more intelligent than humans. (Seems very likely.) He speculates on robots producing “ever-smarter” robots that might “devour the resources of the planet in their insatiable quest to become ever more intelligent.” (p. 101) This can be seen as a near corollary of the idea that robots will become our masters and take over the planet. Since robots can only do what is programmed into them, these ideas depend on poor or malicious programming. (Beware the black hats of the future!)On page 116 Kaku points out that “there is no universally accepted definition of ‘smart.’” He doesn’t elaborate but I want to say that the unstated question is “smart for what”? Is the goal, e.g., happiness or world domination? A different kind of smarts might be required in each case.In talking about what jobs will still be available for humans in the midcentury future, Kaku makes the excellent point that those jobs will require “nonrepetitive work that requires pattern recognition.” (p. 305) He includes garbage collectors, police officers, construction workers, gardeners, and plumbers. However where I live as soon as they get a robot to drive the truck garbage collection will be a completely automated task. We have plastic containers set out on the street which are picked up and emptied by a mechanical arm from the truck. (Yes, the future is now.)In Chapter 8 “Future of Humanity” Kaku presents Nikolai Kardashev’s Type I, II, and III Civilizations based on energy consumption. (A Type II civilization, for example, consumes all the energy from their sun.) What I found interesting is Kaku’s statement that we “are leading to a single point: the creation of a planetary civilization.” (p. 327) I think the term “planetary civilization” is what we need to replace the currently (in some quarters) offensive term, “world government.”Kaku makes the sharp point that movies with “cross-cultural themes…packed with internationally recognized celebrities, are big money makers for Hollywood.” He sees this as “evidence of an emerging planetary culture.” (p. 334) He adds on the next page that “Local cultures will continue to survive, coexisting side by side with the larger global culture.”Some of Kaku’s dreams (perhaps) are room temperature super conductors and space elevators, to name just two that are highly speculative but would be amazing if realized.In the chapter on artificial intelligence, Kaku gives his three-pointed definition of consciousness. (Actually with becoming modesty he writes, “…if I were to venture a guess.”) In my book “The World Is Not as We Think It Is” I also give a three-pointed definition:“One: awareness of the world (including awareness of our self and our processes, that is, self-awareness).Two: self-identity. Notice that awareness of self is different from this identification with self.Three: experience or sensation, the feelings we get when we experience the world. This is sometimes called “phenomenal consciousness.” An example would be the subjective experience of the color red, or the taste of a strawberry.” (p. 82)Here is Kaku’s delineation from page 97:“1. sensing and recognizing the environment2. self-awareness3. planning for the future by setting goals and plans, that is, simulating the future and plotting strategy.”The slight differences are instructive. He leaves out self-identification, perhaps rightly so; and I leave out planning for the future. Also I presume that Kaku includes self-awareness in his first component. Personally I would include planning for the future in my first component, “awareness of the world” as well; however to emphasize “simulating the future” is a fine thing to do since humans are on another level in the animal kingdom when it comes to imagining what might happen.I should mention that in writing this book Kaku did not just tune into the zeitgeist but actually read prognosticators from the past. Two who did well were Benjamin Franklin and the Marquis de Condorcet. Since Kaku’s predictions are mostly favorable for humans, I hope his predictions do as well. --Dennis Littrell, author of “Hard Science and the Unknowable”"
108,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7227342-richard,3,"Michio Kaku's book, Physics of the Future, concludes with a comprehensive prediction of what life will like in 2100 as the subtitle indicates. The majority of the book is made up of predictions about how technology will evolve in the intervening years.The book was written in 2011, so some its contents are already dated. Interestingly, certain predictions about the near future have already come to pass. Other predictions appear to be a little delayed. To be clear, Mr. Kaku is very humble in the introduction about the ability to predict the future. One of the concrete statements he makes about the future is the idea there is a great deal to be optimistic about. He examines individuals in the past who were pessimistic about the development of technology, and he shows how wrong these individuals proved to be in time. For this reason, I think he is correct to say the future belongs to the optimists.I enjoyed the book; however, I don't think it is worth more than 3 stars. It has some important ideas, but the audience is narrow to a certain extant. It seems to offer inspiration to the future scientists who will make these breakthroughs; however, it isn't as relevant to the average reader. We will eventually see the changes predicted, but they are mostly decades away. "
109,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467608-serro,4,"This is a great book by a great physicist. I only rate it 4 stars because his thoughts and predictions can only be tested in 2100. I promise to raise my rating to 5 starts in 2100 if his predictions are correct. That is because according to Michio Kaku medicine will evolve greatly allowing people to live a lot longer than now. Not that I don't plan on living for 113 years as it is.The reader will find insights about the future of computers and AI, medicine and nanotechnology, space travel and energy. Kaku also takes on the nature of humanity as a whole in the next 100 years.And bear in mind these are not the predictions of Nostradamus, Michi Kaku knows first hand what he writes about."

112,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1080484-teji,4,"The author’s passion for both physics and science-fiction is evident throughout this piece of speculative non-fiction. The work explores several areas of emerging technology and applied science, not just quantum physics. As the author notes, his predictions are “reasoned estimates of when the prototype technologies of today will finally reach maturity”. His extrapolation of what he thinks is likely to occur in the near (2010-2030), mid (2030-20700, and far (2070-2100) future, are intriguing and thought provoking. The organization is very repetitive-- almost as if it were written as a series of articles that were later post-edited into a book format (although I don't think that is the case). Also, the writing is a little dry in places-- but not intolerably so. Additionally, when speaking of the future, the author tends to geek out and engage in overwrought, almost giddy, statements about the “godlike” powers technology will grant humans within the next century. These flaws aside, overall, the writing is coherent and accessible. It will be interesting to see how well his forecasts for the next couple of decades hold-up.Quotes(view spoiler)[[In his novel, Paris in the Twentieth Century, written in 1863, Jules Verne] “predicted that Paris in 1960 would have glass skyscrapers, air conditioning, TV, elevators, high-speed trains, gasoline-powered automobiles, fax machines, and even something resembling the Internet…just a few years later he made another spectacular prediction. In 1865, he wrote From the Earth to the Moon, in which he predicted the details of the mission that sent our astronauts to the moon…He accurately predicted the size of the space capsule to within a few percent, the location of the launch site in Florida…the weightlessness that the astronauts would experience, and the final splashdown in the ocean…How was Jules Verne able to predict 100 years into the future with such breathtaking accuracy? His biographers have noted that, although Verne was not a scientist himself he constantly sought out scientists…He amassed a vast archive summarizing the great scientific discoveries of his time. Verne, more than others, realized that science was the engine shaking the foundations of civilization, propelling it into a new century with unexpected marvels and miracles.” -Introduction“Another great prophet of technology was Leonardo da Vinci, painter, thinker, and visionary…Like Jules Verne, Leonardo was able to get profound insights into the future by consulting a handful of forward-thinking individuals of his time…In addition, Leonardo was always experimenting, building, and sketching models, a key attribute of anyone who wants to translate thinking into reality.” -Introduction“As William Gibson…once said, ‘The future is already here. It’s just unevenly distributed.” -Introduction“Predictions for the future, with a few exceptions, have always underestimated the pace of technological progress.” -IntroductionThere are four fundamental forces in nature that drive the entire universe: gravity (unlocking the force of gravity helped to pave the way for the Industrial Revolution and the introduction of steam power, especially the locomotive), electromagnetic force (this unleashed the electronic revolution that has created a bounty of scientific wonders), and the two nuclear forces: the weak and strong forces. “When Einstein wrote down e=mc^2 and when the atom was split in the 1930s, scientists for the first time began to understand the forces that light up the heavens…the secret behind the stars…it also held out the promise that one day we would be able to harness this power on the earth”… quantum theory “has given us the transistor, the laser, and the digital resolution that is the driving force behind modern society. -Introduction“Exponential growth is often hard to grasp, since our minds think linearly. It is so gradual that you sometimes cannot experience the change at all. But over decades, it can completely alter everything around us. According to Moore's law, every Christmas your new computer games are almost twice as powerful (in terms of the number of transistors) as those from the previous year. Furthermore, as the years pass, this incremental gain becomes monumental. For example, when you receive a birthday card in the mail, it often has a chip that sings ‘Happy Birthday’ to you. Remarkably, that chip has more computer power than all the Allied forces of 1945. Hitler, Churchill, or Roosevelt might have killed to get that chip…Today, your cell phone has more computer power than all of NASA back in 1969, when it placed two astronauts on the moon…” Ch1“Today, when we enter a room, we automatically look for the light switch since we assume that the walls are electrified. In the future, the first thing we will do on entering a room…is to assume the room is intelligent…Around 2020, the price of a chip may also drop to about a penny…then we will have millions of chips distributed everywhere in our environment, silently carrying out our orders.” -Ch1“One reason why Moore's law has relentlessly increased the power of chips is because UV light can be tuned so that its wavelength is smaller and smaller, making it possible to etch increasingly tiny transistors onto silicon wafers. Since UV light has a wavelength as small as 10 nanometers, this means that the smallest transistor that you can etch is thirty atoms across…But this process cannot go on forever…You can even calculate roughly when Moore’s law will finally collapse: when you finally hit transistors the size of individual atoms… According to the laws of physics, eventually the Age of Silicon will come to a close, as we enter the Post-Silicon Era. Transistors will be so small that quantum theory or atomic physics takes over and electrons leak out of the wires…At that point, according to the laws of physics, the quantum theory takes over. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that you cannot know both the position and the velocity of any particle…at the atomic level you simply cannot know where the electron is, so it can never be confined precisely in an ultrathin wire or layer and it necessarily leaks out, causing the circuit to short-circuit.” Ch1“However, scans of the human brain clearly show that thinking is spread out over large parts of the brain...Digital computers can calculate at nearly the speed of light. he human brain, by contrast, is incredibly slow. Nerve impulses travel at an excruciatingly slow pace of about 200 miles per hour. But the brain more than makes up for this because it is massively parallel… In a race, a superfast single processor is left in the dust by a superslow parallel processor.” Ch2“While hardware had grown [exponentially] by the ability to etch smaller and smaller transistors onto a wafer, software is totally different; it requires a human to sit down with a pencil and paper to write code. That is the bottleneck: the human. Software, like all human creative activity, progresses in fits and starts, with brilliant insights and long stretches of drudgery and stagnation.” Ch2“…genetic analysis shows that aging is concentrated in the ""engine"" of the cell, the mitochondria, or the cell’s power plant. This has allowed scientists to…look for ways to accelerate the gene repair process inside the mitochondria to reverse the effects of aging.” Ch3“Normally, we don’t see quantum forces at work in everyday life. But quantum forces are everywhere…if we are largely empty, then why can’t we walk through walls?...The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons can exit in the same quantum state. Hence, when two nearly identical electrons get too close, they repel each other. This is the reason objects appear to be solid, which is an illusion…When we sit on a chair...we are hovering above the chair, floating less than a nanometer above it, repelled by the chair’s electrical and quantum forces.” Ch4“The quantum theory has only one thing going for it: it is correct. Its accuracy has been measured to one part in ten billion, making it the most successful physical theory of all time.” Ch4“Science and technology are the engines of prosperity…” Ch7“The combination of changing social conditions and the mastery of the four forces propelled Europe to the forefront of nations. But technologies are dynamic, changing all the time. They are born, evolve, and rise and fall…technologies obey certain laws of evolution. Mass technologies usually evolve in four basic stages…In stage I, the products of technology are so precious that they are closely guarded. Paper, when it was invented in the form of papyrus by the ancient Egyptians…was so precious that one papyrus scroll was closely guarded by scores of priests…Paper entered stage II around 1450, when Gutenberg invented the movable type…one person could possess one book containing the knowledge of hundreds of scrolls. Before Gutenberg, there were only 30,000 books in all Europe. By 1500, there were 9 million books…By around 1930, paper hit stage III, when the cost fell to a penny a sheet. This made possible the personal library, where one person could possess hundreds of books. Paper became an ordinary commodity…Paper is everywhere and nowhere, invisible and ubiquitous. Now we are in stage IV, where paper is a fashion statement. We decorate our world with paper of all colors, shapes, and sizes. The largest source of urban waste is paper. So paper evolved from being a closely guarded commodity to being waste.” Running water, electricity, and computer have followed the same pattern. Ch7“But as technologies evolve, they create abrupt changes in the economy that sometimes lead to social dislocations. In any revolution, there are winners and losers…What jobs will flourish by midcentury? How will the evolution of technology change the way we work? We can partially determine the answer by asking a simple question: What are the limitations of robots? As we have seen, there are at least two basic stumbling blocks to artificial intelligence: pattern recognition and common sense. Therefore, the jobs that will survive in the future are…ones that require these two abilities.” Ch7“Developing nations may be able to take advantage of the information revolution. They can, in principle, leapfrog past the developed nations in many areas. In the developed world, telephone companies had to tediously wire up every home or farm at great cost. But a developing nation does not have to wire up its country, since cell phone technology can excel in rural areas without any roads or infrastructure. Also, developing nations have the advantage that they do not have to rebuild an aging infrastructure…” Ch7“…the Unites States has maintained its dominance in science and technology in spite of the fact that U.S. students often score dead last when it comes to essential subjects like science and math…(It should also be pointed out that this ranking corresponds roughly to the number of days that students were in school. China, which ranked number 1, averaged 251 days of instruction per year, while the United States averaged only 178 days per year.) It seems like a mystery that, despite these awful numbers, the United States continues to do well internationally in science and technology, until you realize that much of the U.S science [talent] comes from overseas. The United States has a secret weapon, the H1B visa…But the H1B visa is only a stopgap measure. The United States cannot continue to live off foreign scientists, many of whom are beginning to return to China and India as their economies improve…The United States will eventually have to overhaul its archaic, sclerotic education system. At present, poorly prepared high school students flood the job market and universities…Employers continually bemoan the fact that they have to take one year to train their new hires to bring them up to speed. And the universities are burdened by having to create new layers of remedial courses to compensate for the poor high school education system…” Ch7“When physicists try to analyze civilizations, we rank them on the basis of the energy they consume. This ranking was first introduced in 1964 by Russian astrophysicists Nikolai Kardashev…he proposed three theoretical types: A Type I civilization is planetary, consuming the sliver of sunlight that falls on their planet, or about 10^17 watts. A Type II civilization is stellar, consuming all the energy that their sun emits, or 10^27 watts. A Type III civilization is galactic, consuming the energy of billions of stars, or about 10^37 watts…Each type is separated by a factor of 10 billion: a Type III civilization consumes 10 billion times more energy than at Type II civilization…which in turn consumes 10 billion times more energy than a Type I civilization. According to the classification, our present-day civilization is Type 0. We don’t even rate on this scale, since we get our energy from dead plants, that is from oil and coal. (Carl Sagan, generalizing this classification...[estimated] that we are actually a Type .7 civilization…we can mathematically estimate that we will attain Type I status in about 100 years, given an average rate of economic growth.” Ch8“Also, if room temperature superconductors are found in this century, it means a complete overhaul of our energy requirements. Waste heat, in the form of friction, will be greatly reduced, increasing the efficiency of our machines. As we mentioned, the majority of our energy consumption, especially transportation, goes into overcoming friction…it would take almost no energy to move from California to New York if there were no friction.” Ch8 (hide spoiler)]"
113,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9619705-anna,0,I just want to see an updated version of this book explaining why most of short term predictions didn't work out.
114,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,2,"The book was extremely informative about current trends in science (and some technology). It lives up to its title in discussing physics of the future. The author is a skilled writer who is gifted at communicating highly abstract and obscure ideas.So why only two stars?I did have some issues with the overall books and how this project was carried out. Some were more troubling than others. The major issues include:1) Too much scientific triumphalism -- The clear storyline in the book is that science will render most of the troubles of life either moot or less relevant. Diseases will go away, aging will be suppressed, and immortality lies around the corner! Hovercraft will be developed, robots will be everywhere and solve our problems, and traditional issues of scarcity re health and food will go away. I suspect that this technological paradise is being oversold, just a bit. Lifespan has been extended, but arguably more by prenatal and care for newborns, coupled with public health measures such as mass inoculation coupled with the aggressive combating of traditional killers like smallpox. We still haven't figured out much regarding the flu or the common cold! Yes there has been progress, but is heaven really that near? Have we proven ourselves worthy of godlike status?2) There is very little on economics throughout the book. The author has apparently read some of Thurow's futurist work but not much else. Science and technology need to be brought to market and commercialized before they can hope to revolutionize our lives. Perhaps the government will do it all?? Well the government might fund defense research and NSF grants but last I heard it still did limited work on commercialization.3) What about politics? The twentieth century brought amazing advances in science and technology but also rule by thugs, gangsters, and murderers that applied technology to the extermination of millions. Oh Brave New World . . . . !4) The author pushes his futurist motivation -- using a near future, mid future, and far future framework, but in the end it comes down to extrapolation between two poles - heaven or catastrophe, with the chance of catastrophe severely discounted. Not much of a choice!5) The author raises the need for education in science and technology, suggesting that they have read Goldin and Katz, but only talk about it in the context of H1B visas and information intensive jobs that go wanting. What about the increasing numbers of people in the US who are almost completely left out of the new age because of their poor education and training? Kaku may be setting up the world of Wells' Time Machine without knowing it. How can we move into a scientific and technology heaven, when most people are fit to work at Wal-Mart at best? What will all the dummies do once the robots take over our jobs? . . . which negative utopia comes to mind? the Matrix??6) This could be partially excused, since no author is perfect and the book is informative. What is more troubling about the book is that it is two or three chapters too long and the extra chapters detract from the book's value. Once the author moves from the descriptive and commentary and mild extrapolation in most ot the book to a more normative tone when he discusses the evolution of a planetary civilization, he loses me completely. He takes a framework by Kardashev to identify civilizations we might encounter from space and order them by energy use (???) and applies it to how our civilization might develop. Note here, we are using a framework with absolutely no data or experience behind it, with the exception of the sci-fi movie genre, and turning it into the summary framework for a book purporting to provide an update to general readers on the state of research in physics!! Needless to say I was not convinced and was chuckling - for the wrong reasons -- as I worked through the end of the book. This appears to be a common problem in big reach synthesis boos -- Ian Morris' book on why the West rules comes to mind, although the latter is a much better book overall.5) By the end of the book, I was wondering if there were particular reasons why Kaku appeared to have ""lost it"" when he just should have stopped writing fifty pages sooner.6) Overall, I don't regret reading it. I just regret finishing it."
115,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12945730-jack-ferreira,3,"I like Michio Kaku, he seems like a pretty cool, down to earth guy. I'll get some criticism out of the way, because overall I did enjoy the book.I have seen interviews and tv shows he's been in and though I do like him sometimes his atitude bothers me for some reason. I can't quite put my finger on it, maybe it has something to do with this slightly over-pandering way of explaining things. It looks like he thinks the only way his readers will understand what he's saying is by constantly referencing Star Treck, Star Wars and other products of science fiction which really isn't needed. I understood him perfectly well when he talked about portable MRI machines and DNA chips before he felt the need to display a picture of a Star Treck ""tricorder"" (just in case we couldn't grasp the idea by ourselves). I thought these constant references were a bit odd because this isn't a hard book to comprehend. It's not necessarily insulting but at the same time it feels a little condescending. This is especialy present in the final chapter (""A Day in a Life in 2100""). It was completely unecessary and cringeworthy, he may be a great theoretical physicist but he is not a great writer (outside of non-fiction, at least). That said, I learnt a lot from this book. I will probably forget most of it, I admit, but it made me feel up to date on our current technological advancements. I liked the way he split up each chapter, making it nicely organized and easy to navigate through. It was great reading about realistic predictions for the future of computers, AI, energy, nanotechnology and space travel. The future of wealth was also discussed which took me by surprise and I sincerely apreciated it, since it really is something important to consider.As he talks about the future of humanity he introduces some very interesting concepts. It leaves me excited for things to come and curious of how it will change our way of life.Obviously, we should all take these predictions with a grain of salt. I'm sure Michio Kaku has more or less figured out the near future, but up to the year 2100 he gets quite vague. Some people see it as a bad thing, but I don't blame him. Any book we read, from an author who goes out of his areas of expertise must not be taken for granted. I have seen people comment on misuse of terminology and a lot of non consideration for alternate scenarios. This is why I love people like Richard Dawkins, who write books within their fields and whose content I absolutely trust.It's a nice book if you don't look upon it as a definitive guide to the future.I am now in the mood for some science fiction though."
116,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53461468-rasty,5,"Its amazing when you first read that book , it's not about how science developed or anything like that , but its about how science will develop and will shape our destiny or thoughts to our whole world , michio kaku one of my favorite writers about science , and that was amazing from him :)"
117,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5526063-mary-jean-harris,3,"This was quite a good book with lots of fascinating predictions for the future, as well as a survey of technologies currently being developed. I'd give it 3.5 stars (you need 1/2 stars, Goodreads!). Michio Kaku writes about the places he's visited, mostly research labs, that are working on new technologies, including bioengineering, nanotechnology, quantum computers, robotics, gene therapy, self-driving cars, space travel, and space elevators. Kaku's enthusiasm for these future changes is undying throughout the book, and it makes an enjoyable read. I can't agree with him that all this will result in positive change for the future though, especially as technology becomes more invasive and embedded into our lives, drawing us even further apart from the natural world as well as opening up the possibility for people (and governments and organizations) to control us in this system. It sounds eerily similar to the matrix, but Kaku doesn't seem overly concerned about any of these issues.Additionally, Kaku unfortunately falls into the trap of global warming hysteria: he takes it for granted that humanity is causing a climate crisis, a position that is highly contented and strewn with propaganda. As a scientist analysing a complicated issue, Kaku does not apply his own standards of rational inquiry to this issue and instead accepts the politically correct position that, even if he dug a little deep into the issue before writing the book, he would realize is not supported by many climate scientists.Also, although I liked the last chapter about ""a day in the life in 2100"" overall, it was really corny and, for some reason, the main guy we're following works at an office with only men...do no females work in the industry?. Also, this online dating stuff has become prevalent and people just do it naturally, something I find really creepy.But despite these problems with the book, it was a great read overall and definitely accessible to the general public."
118,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4617137-sangita-takhur,4,"To me the big question is: how fast will our technology progress in the coming years? I know it is very difficult to give a solid logical answer to this question. I liked the book but I do not agree with Kaku on many points. I think Kaku used almost a linear model for predicting the future. I think we need more imaginative power for predicting the future. Like Kaku I too believe that, gene technology, computers, artificial intelligence and robots will advance rapidly. The book is composed of the following nine chapters: 1. Future of the Computer: Mind over Matter, 2. Future of AI: Rise of the Machines, 3. Future of Medicine: Perfection and Beyond, 4. Nanotechnology: Everything from Nothing?, 5. Future of Energy: Energy from the Stars, 6. Future of Space Travel: To the Stars, 7. Future of Wealth, 8. Future of Humanity: Planetary Civilization, and 9. A Day in the Life in 2100. Kaku's approach is excellent, as if he is talking to a lay person, but he writes with a simple eloquence that makes these complex concepts accessible to the non-Physicist mind.Michio is too good in predicting the limitations of the technologies. One may argue that Michio's idea of robots and computers is similar to the AI from the movies in the 1990s, but we have to think year 2020 much brighter. Development on medicine, synthetic biology and nanotechnology is almost ignored. I was expecting more about quantum biology but that too is missing. But overall I liked the book. The book is good enough to stimulate our imagination."
119,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/153756-jeffrey,4,"A fascinating look at how the world might change in the future, while also giving some good basic information on various subjects - for example, Kaku breaks down how gene therapy works, and also what it could lead to. Kaku's style of writing is informative and accessible, and the only time I found myself starting to lose focus was during the fictional narrative covering a typical day in 2100. In a way, that section suffers from a lack of imagination in what people would be like, despite having well thought out possibilities for technology; it seems more like an example of what someone from today would act like if we had all of that technology today. Still, that got me thinking about things... like, one hundred years ago, someone wouldn't have even been able to conceive of the internet, but even if they could imagine it, they probably wouldn't be able to foresee the rise of things like social media, youtube, etc. and how those things are changing the way humanity deals with privacy and public appearance.Kaku's pretty optimistic about the future (he even only mentions the idea of humanity going extinct one time), so this book is at times almost like a really well researched version of the cliched utopian future. Fortunately the book's foundation is in science and balances that vision with various realistic possibilities, and in any case it's a great source of basic information related to physics for the layperson."
120,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17648164-umair-khan,4,"What is the future going to be like? Physics of the Future tries to answer this question in an engaging, thought provoking and visionary account of the possibilities that, according to the author, Michio Kaku, will be transformed into reality in the coming decades. The book will not be a disappointment to fans of Kaku and can be considered as a sequel to his previous work, Visions, but with a more expansive view.Physics outlines four fundamental forces of nature: gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force and strong nuclear force. Kaku is of the opinion that each time a force of nature is understood by scientists and harnessed by engineers it sets in motion a chain reaction of novel and unique technologies determining the course of human development. In Physics, Kaku interviews more than 300 scientists and inventors who are working day and night to push the boundaries of science and technology. Essentially, the theme of the book is similar to the works of futurists like Ray Kurzweil, however, the treatment of the topic is more vivid and easier to understand.Kaku seems to be following the footsteps of visionary futurists like Leonardo da Vinci and Jules Verne. He explores the impact of physics on the areas of computer science, artificial intelligence, medicine, nanotechnology, alternative energy and space travel. Kaku scientifically predicts what new technologies will enter in the following decades, what will be achieved by the mid-21st century, and finally what we will accomplish by the end of it.The narrative, introducing prospects of controlling computers through the human mind, resurrecting extinct animals, travelling to other planets and genetically enhancing our disease resistance, is exciting to read. The author claims that we might even be able to bring back the Neanderthal. However, he pinpoints the ethical dilemmas associated with such achievements by quoting Richard Klein, an anthropologist at Stanford: “Are you going to put the Neanderthals in a zoo or in Harvard?”In the last chapter, Kaku introduces the reader to an imaginary character living in the 22nd century. Biologically, he is in his 70s but the age of his organs is mid-30s. He rides a self-driven car. Nano-bots monitor the crucial indicators of his health while roaming in his bloodstream. What distinguishes this book from works of science fiction is that every prediction in the book is based on research and supported by prototypes being developed across the globe.Kaku also analyses the economic and social history of our civilisation and explains that new technologies are the engines of both scientific and social change. He rightly points out that the economic recessions of the 1850s, 1920s and 2008 were due to the “speculative fever” created around specific sectors: the railroad, automotive stocks and real estate, respectively.He warns that when the British Empire was shifting its focus from scientific innovation to more mundane matters of power-play, the US was emerging as a leader in research and advancement of knowledge in all fields. However, if the majority of the US talent is going into the investment sector and managing the finances of others, in which region will the most brilliant minds pursue the cause of innovation and exploring the truth?Kaku further chalks out the ranking of civilisations which was first introduced in 1964 by Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev — on the basis of the energy they consume. This ranking was mainly proposed to identify the powers of extra terrestrial intelligent civilisations and classify them into three types. Type I consumes planetary sources of energy, mainly sunlight that falls on their planet; Type II consumes all the energy produced by their sun, while Type III consumes the energy produced by all the stars of their galaxy. Our current status is perhaps that of a Type 0 since we consume the energy of dead plants (oil and coal). Kaku estimates that given the economic growth rate we will be able to achieve the status of a Type I civilisation by the end of the century.Physics of the Future not only tells us what is probable and possible in the future, it also gives researchers and inventors a timescale to measure their successes against. Moreover, it makes the reader feel excited about the times we are living in, when we can expect ‘miracles’ to happen in our lifetimes. Kaku points out that “By 2100, our destiny is to become like the gods we once worshipped and feared.”SOURCE: http://www.dawn.com/news/634292/non-f..."
121,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3352854-david-skip-everling,2,"I'm not sure about anybody's ability to predict a century into the future (especially if you give credence to the idea of accelerating returns in technology), but I was willing to give this book a shot after hearing Michio Kaku in interviews. In particular he piqued my curiosity with the claim that all the ideas in the book are grounded on currently existing prototypes or established scientific theory.Now after having read it, I think Michio is only giving a survey of some select topics, and the only ones that I think he handled well were the ones most closely linked to physics (e.g. space travel, nanotechnology & quantum behavior, global power generation). The other fields he dives into, particularly his analysis and extrapolation of consumer technologies, were disappointingly off target or lacking in proper depth.The book is occasionally so superficial in its treatment of some prototyped technologies that it reads somewhat like painfully outdated sci-fi from Michio's childhood in the 50's. The book is written to be highly accessible, but he does uninformed readers a disservice by giving equal weight to illogical and 'improbable but not impossible' possibilities. My biggest problem with his predictions are that they center on only a set of technologies that Kaku has experience with, extrapolated all the way out to 2100 without much consideration of how all the unmentioned possibilities will change his visions for the future.As an example, Michio doesn't do the best job keeping our present circumstances and his far future predictions from mixing anachronistically: e.g. the frequently repeated ""...when we carry around our own genomes on a CD-ROM"" for a ""2030-2070"" range prediction. I worry that Michio Kaku is just paraphrasing some of the ideas out there without really thinking about them any more critically, like a mediocre science journalist or sci-fi writer. Again this could be an artifact of his intentionally writing this book to be broadly accessible, but I don't think he found the right balance.The best parts of the book are in the second half, particularly his chapters on The Future of: Energy, Space Travel, Wealth, and Humanity (respectively) and I did enjoy most of this material despite a scattering of the same problems mentioned above. Sadly, I think Michio Kaku completely botched his concluding chapter, ""A Day in the Life in 2100"", and I think the preceding Future of Humanity chapter would have been a much stronger ending. The ""Day in the Life"" conclusion is silly speculative fiction and the best (worst?) example in the entire book of his anachronistic and muddled sci-fi visions. Michio Kaku is great when talking about physics and large scale trends closely linked to humanity's knowledge of physics, but judging from this book alone he doesn't put together upcoming technologies into realistic or compelling future scenarios very well at all, ending up with an incomplete picture somewhere in the uncomfortable border between imaginative thinking and unwarranted speculation."
122,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,4,"This is a fascinating survey of what's actually happening in the cutting edge of science and technology. He walks through computers and vehicles and energy and space exploration and even culture. For each area he discussed deeply what's happening now, then gives thoughtful guesses to what will develop in early 21st century, mid-century, and late-century. His understanding of science is broad AND deep. His vision of the future of science is compelling. Some highlights: Tiny computer chips will be embedded in everything--almost literally--and we'll live in a cloud of data that's ridiculous. Robots will outnumber humans--but they won't be able to do anything but the physical tasks we program them to do (including driving our cars and planes). Magnetism will finally be mastered and we'll run our world on magnetic power rather than electric power. And by the end of the century remote control robots will be building a moon base for us to continue looking into the stars. However, I docked him a star because he displays a naive understanding of culture and history. He makes sweeping mistakes like seeing being religious as the enemy of science when history actually shows that many of the greatest science cultures were so precisely because of their religious beliefs, or his easy dismissal of cultural conflicts in the new world and his idea that once food and shelter are universal then haves and have nots won't be a real issue. So read this for the tech ideas and endure his comments about becoming like the gods of old and reaching cultural utopia. "
123,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"Michio Kaku is a great science writer (as well as being a physics professor), but futurology is a difficult subject to make interesting and all too often what you get is lists of 'in the future you will have an X that will do Y,' which gets dull fairly quickly.Where Kaku's approach is good (which is to base his ideas on physics) is in the future of energy. His chapter on space exploration is good too - he is a great enthusiast for this, and that comes across strongly here. The only proviso is that the main controlling factor on space exploration is not science but politics. A man wasn't put on the moon for science, but to put the Russians in their place. We haven't done much manned exploration since for the same reason. It's too expensive for science to control things.To be honest I was even less convinced about the consumer technology ideas. If space exploration is driven by politics, consumer purchases are driven by the market. Yes, the science & technology has to be able to deliver (so you couldn't have an iPhone 10 years ago), but it doesn't decide what will and won't become popular.The book finishes with a chapter on the way the world will be a single civilization (even if nations still exist in a weakened form) by the end of the century. This seemed the least science-supported speculation. If anything we seem to be fragmenting more.All in all, a good try - but futurology remains closer to fiction than popular science."

I get that he was trying to summarize everything he'd written in the book in an interesting way, but I'm not a huge fan of 2nd person povs and it came off as annoying and unneeded. "
125,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7070282-jenny-williams,5,"After reading this selection I strongly believe Michio Kaku is one of the brightest minds in his field. Physics Of The Impossible was an amazing book and this one blows it out of the water. I can't determine if I am so fond of it because of how advanced our technology will be in the near future or if I am truly fond of his writing. I know one thing for sure, some of the different advancements in technology is going to change the way we live life in way too many ways. What I mean by that is the advancement Kaku covers isn't technology like a new version of an XBOX or something of that sort. Michio Kaku covers advancement in technology like the worlds biggest atom smasher in Switzerland under a mountain, circling a mile exactly. This atom smasher is one of the biggest advancements in our technology opening doors to creating so much energy that we will be able to travel through space at a speed close to the speed of light. That's only the example I remembered best but there are so many throughout this book it excites you for our future. Kind of. "
126,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5431286-david,3,"Since I had already read the book ""Visions"" by the same writer nearly three years ago, this one did not really generate much of an interest within me due to the much common material. Although, for someone who may have never read ""Visions"" or ""Physics of the Impossible"" (which too I had read in 2011-12), I strongly feel that ""Physics of the Future"" can tend to become very interesting if one likes to ponder on how technological the world is going to get within the next century, and how far will it be feasible to apply and integrate it within our daily lives.A Good Book, but a vast majority was already included amongst the first two of his books on the same genre. The chapter on the Future of Wealth, was kind of new though!A 3-star because the content was not new for me; otherwise I would rate it with a 4-star."

In fact, the action of the first film is kicked off by a message recorded in 3D by Princess Leia and conveyed by the robot..."" (Paraphrased.)Mr Kaku, please stop going into detail about science-fiction films!"

I understand that for those who know a lot about physics and technology, it may be to easy, but for such people as I am, it was great. Well, I didn't like everything what I read (especially, the beginning) but later it got much better. I really enjoyed topics about artificial intelligence and robotics, the future of medicine and genetics. I hope that many forecasts will come true."

134,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27777097-thomas-jacob-jr,3,"An enjoyable, cursory overview of some of the most exciting technological achievements we may expect mankind to engage with over the next century. I came across Michio Kaku, as I am sure many others have, by watching an interview on television a few years ago, and I was struck by his loquaciousness and intelligence. Describing contemporary scientific concepts, especially quantum physics, in a way that a layman can understand is no small feat. In Physics of the Future, Kaku focuses on several industries (private space exploration, computer technology, medicine, and others) and tries to predict what respective advances we may expect by 2100. Oftentimes he uses examples from popular science fiction, specifically Star Trek, as a frame of reference. This book definitely falls into the 'pop science' category, with only brief asides into more technical and mathematical information. Any fans of popular science fiction work in film, television, or literature will be already be aware of many of the concepts here, and truthfully, any one of them could easily fill an entire book by itself (the 'recommended reading' section at the end is a goldmine for further exploration). Kaku sometimes makes sweeping generalizations without going into further detail that may seem presumptuous, but it is usually in attempt to keep the pace light. Also, since this was written in 2011, some sections appear a little dated even only six years later (an entire section on private space exploration, for example, doesn't mention either Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos, two of the forerunners in this field). Recommended for those looking for a brief overview of some of the exciting advances in technology that we can expect to look forward to over the course of our lifetime. For those looking for a deeper dive into any of the aforementioned subjects, the dozens of recommended works at the end should serve as an excellent primer. "
135,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,4,"Peering into the future of mankind and predicting what lies in store for us a few decades from now, has always been a dicey endeavour. In general, predictions pertaining to unchecked population growth, resultant famines, wars over access to resources, gloomy prospects for the future of developing nations etc have mostly proven to be unnecessary alarms rather than reality. A few major historical instances come to mind. Rev. Thomas Malthus in the late 18th century, Dr. Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University in the 1960s, and MIT's Club of Rome report in the 1970s were famous for damning our future, particularly that of India and China due to their large populations. We find that both India and China have done pretty well in the forty years since. On the other hand, predictions about the end of slavery, end of European colonialism, an era of less work and more leisure have all come true. It seems as though we tend to take both a gloomy and hopeful view of mankind and misjudge its potential for making correctives when it comes to how human beings, our societies, governments and institutions would behave in future under changing conditions.In contrast, predictions regarding scientific and technological advances in the fields of medicine, computers, biology, astronomy etc have more frequently proven to materialize successfully, at times sooner than expected. The Moore's Law comes to mind immediately. This book itself shows how accurately Jules Verne, in the mid 1800s, predicted life in Paris in the 1960s as consisting of skyscrapers, air-conditioning, TV, elevators, high-speed trains and fax machines. It seems as if we have a better grasp of machines and man's interactions with them and the development of this man-machine future. This book by theoretical Physicist Michio Kaku, crystal-gazes into this future as led by the advance of science and technology. Even if one does not accept all the projections, we end up learning a lot on what stunning possibilities are out there as we live out this century.The book is organized on what we can expect in the near term (by 2030), the mid term (2030-2070) and the long term (2070-2100). The future is explored through the domains of Computers, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Medicine, Nanotechnology, Energy and Space Travel. But it is not just speculation from a Theoretical Physicist. The author had discussed with hundreds of scientists who actually work today on these ideas and had compiled out of this interaction, what is possible in these three time periods. The presentation and language in the book is simple and accessible even to the average non-science minded reader and that, in my view, is a great positive about the book. I shall outline here some of the future products and possibilities given by Dr.Kaku which grabbed my mind:MRI machines which are just a foot long, looking like cell phones which can be passed over the human body and detect cancer (2030)Computers which scan fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) patterns in the brain and decipher a person's stream of consciousness and thereby detect what he/she is thinking (2070-2100)Computers being able to reconstruct a person's facial features given a strand of DNA from that person'e hair or bloodTissue engineering to manufacture a whole body part by extracting a few cells from the bodyResurrection of extinct life forms like the Mammoth or the NeanderthalNano-particles which enter and kill only cancer cells and leave healthy tissue untouchedchanging one shape to another at the push of a button, just like the T-1000 in 'Terminator-2'Molecular Replicators, capable of creating almost anything we want, the same way that nature can “take hamburgers and vegetables and turn them into a baby.”Fusion plants dotting the countryside by mid centuryLanding on an asteroid or on a moon of planet Mars, Space ElevatorsThe final couple of chapters deal with the future of humanity, planetary civilizations and how life would look in 2100. One can feel the child-like enthusiasm of Dr.Kaku in writing about all these possibilities and it makes the book enjoyable reading. He uses references to popular sci-fi movies from Hollywood to illustrate many of the ideas. In fact, as I read the book, I developed a greater respect for movie makers like that of the Terminator, Matrix, Star Wars, Avatar and so on.We have heard recently of anxieties being expressed about Artificial Intelligence and its destructive potential by luminaries like Bill Gates and Elon Musk. The eminent futurist, Ray Kurzweil has suggested in his work 'The Singularity is Near' that by 2045, a $1000 computer would be a billion times more intelligent than all humans combined and hence creating an uncontrolled runaway singularity. But others like Douglas Hofstadter and Mitch Kapor have dismissed these notions. This book discusses this topic substantially and believes that mankind will develop 'friendly AI' and use it to enhance itself rather than letting itself be ruled by mean-minded robots. Dr.Kaku shows six reasons why there are major roadblocks to such a singularity.On the negative side, just as in other books on the future, this one also has its tiresome speculation on the 'sick men of Asia'. Dr.Kaku quotes a report by Peter Schwartz of the Global Business Network on the dire future that is likely in the demographic nightmare of South Asia. Sea level rise due to Global warming in the latter half of this century could cause massive flooding and chaos, resulting in millions of refugees across the borders of Bangladesh into India. Governments could lose all authority and collapse, resulting in nightmarish looting and rioting. Rising tensions and chaos and inability to control may result in nations resorting to nuclear weapons!It is only scientists who tell us that Human societies, weather and climate are non-linear systems and even a very small change could have a massive effect, called the butterfly effect, making it difficult to predict the long-term futures. Then, I don't see how the author is so sure of destructive global warming in the future and also the consequent behavior of south Asians. In spite of being repeatedly wrong, futurists cannot seem to resist making dire predictions for the future of nations with large populations.The book is enjoyable reading and educative as well. I strongly recommend reading it. Even though Physics plays an important role in all the science that is discussed in the book, I am unsure of whether 'Physics of the Future' is the most meaningful title for the book. When I picked up the book initially, I thought it would be a book on String Theory."
136,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645507-jason-schneeberger,5,"I don't usually do book reviews this long anymore, but this one that I won't soon forget. If ever. Based off of the known laws of nature, author and world renowned theoretical physicist Michio Kaku met with, and interviewed, 300 of the leading scientists in the world about what our world will be like in the year 2100 through the ever increasing advancements of technology. This book lays out the most likely scenario of computers, AI, medicine, nanotechnology, energy, space travel and wealth from those interviews and how they will shape the world by the year 2100.Oh what a fantastic and thought provoking book this was! It's great to read a book about the future that isn't nihilistic, apocalyptic and negative, but rather hopeful and full of wonder! Sure, the very real threats of chaos, nuclear war, global warming etc are addressed in this book, but in ways that give rise to ways around such problems instead of weakly giving into them.I'm always wondering why every sci-fi movie based in the future has to be apocalyptic, or negative about where the world is going? It's easy to see the bad decisions we are making as humans that drive this thinking and make it seem like a sure reality to come, but where are the optimistic stories? Where are the stories that show us prospering and thriving as a world in the future? Those ideas and thoughts are in this book! Hopefully some good screenwriters and filmmakers will get inspired and make a movie based off the ideas in this book. I want to see it! Almost all of us alive now will not get to experience the world in the year 2100. Not unless of course the age reversal science described in the book becomes a reality (and it seems as though it's a very real possibility in the second half of this century), but this book brings much to the imagination of looking out a window, into the world at the dawn of the 22nd century. I can't say think of anything bad to say about this one. I absolutely loved everything about it. BUY IT!"
137,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Informed speculations engagingly presentedIt’s easy to see that Professor Kaku had a lot of fun writing this book since more than anything (at least for this reader) this book was a pleasure to read.Typically Kaku begins each chapter with some reference to the ancient gods or some other form of mythology or folklore, mainly for contrast or to highlight human yearnings that are being fulfilled today or may be fulfilled in the near future. He then mixes in some science fiction movies, stories or novels that he likes or finds instructive (or not). He adds some personal research and experiences with some of the great minds of our time as he makes his predictions, speculations and guesses on where we are going and when we are going to get there. Partly because of his celebrity and partly because of his wide-ranging knowledge and sharp intelligence (not to mention his charm) Kaku is able to talk with Nobel Prize winners and other cutting edge scientists and engineers all over the world the way most people talk to their neighbors. Areas of interest, each with its own chapter are computers, artificial intelligence, medicine, nanotechnology, energy, space travel, wealth (i.e., economics), and what life will be like in the future on a day-to-day basis. Each chapter gives Kaku’s speculations for the “Near Future (Present to 2030),” “Midcentury (2030 to 2070),” and the “Far Future (2070 to 2100).”I’m going to try to NOT second guess Kaku but I do want to focus on a few areas of personal interest and add a comment or two. “It is a law of evolution that fitter species arise to displace unfit species; and perhaps humans will be lost in the shuffle, eventually winding up in zoos where our robotic creations come to stare at us…Perhaps that is our role in history, to give birth to our evolutionary successors.” (p. 100)I think this is likely, especially if you add our genetically engineered successors. If so we can then think of ourselves as the “intelligent designers” of the demigods to come.Kaku weighs in on the possibility of our robotic creations becoming more intelligent than humans. (Seems very likely.) He speculates on robots producing “ever-smarter” robots that might “devour the resources of the planet in their insatiable quest to become ever more intelligent.” (p. 101) This can be seen as a near corollary of the idea that robots will become our masters and take over the planet. Since robots can only do what is programmed into them, these ideas depend on poor or malicious programming. (Beware the black hats of the future!)On page 116 Kaku points out that “there is no universally accepted definition of ‘smart.’” He doesn’t elaborate but I want to say that the unstated question is “smart for what”? Is the goal, e.g., happiness or world domination? A different kind of smarts might be required in each case.In talking about what jobs will still be available for humans in the midcentury future, Kaku makes the excellent point that those jobs will require “nonrepetitive work that requires pattern recognition.” (p. 305) He includes garbage collectors, police officers, construction workers, gardeners, and plumbers. However where I live as soon as they get a robot to drive the truck garbage collection will be a completely automated task. We have plastic containers set out on the street which are picked up and emptied by a mechanical arm from the truck. (Yes, the future is now.)In Chapter 8 “Future of Humanity” Kaku presents Nikolai Kardashev’s Type I, II, and III Civilizations based on energy consumption. (A Type II civilization, for example, consumes all the energy from their sun.) What I found interesting is Kaku’s statement that we “are leading to a single point: the creation of a planetary civilization.” (p. 327) I think the term “planetary civilization” is what we need to replace the currently (in some quarters) offensive term, “world government.”Kaku makes the sharp point that movies with “cross-cultural themes…packed with internationally recognized celebrities, are big money makers for Hollywood.” He sees this as “evidence of an emerging planetary culture.” (p. 334) He adds on the next page that “Local cultures will continue to survive, coexisting side by side with the larger global culture.”Some of Kaku’s dreams (perhaps) are room temperature super conductors and space elevators, to name just two that are highly speculative but would be amazing if realized.In the chapter on artificial intelligence, Kaku gives his three-pointed definition of consciousness. (Actually with becoming modesty he writes, “…if I were to venture a guess.”) In my book “The World Is Not as We Think It Is” I also give a three-pointed definition:“One: awareness of the world (including awareness of our self and our processes, that is, self-awareness).Two: self-identity. Notice that awareness of self is different from this identification with self.Three: experience or sensation, the feelings we get when we experience the world. This is sometimes called “phenomenal consciousness.” An example would be the subjective experience of the color red, or the taste of a strawberry.” (p. 82)Here is Kaku’s delineation from page 97:“1. sensing and recognizing the environment2. self-awareness3. planning for the future by setting goals and plans, that is, simulating the future and plotting strategy.”The slight differences are instructive. He leaves out self-identification, perhaps rightly so; and I leave out planning for the future. Also I presume that Kaku includes self-awareness in his first component. Personally I would include planning for the future in my first component, “awareness of the world” as well; however to emphasize “simulating the future” is a fine thing to do since humans are on another level in the animal kingdom when it comes to imagining what might happen.I should mention that in writing this book Kaku did not just tune into the zeitgeist but actually read prognosticators from the past. Two who did well were Benjamin Franklin and the Marquis de Condorcet. Since Kaku’s predictions are mostly favorable for humans, I hope his predictions do as well. --Dennis Littrell, author of “Hard Science and the Unknowable”"
138,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7227342-richard,3,"Michio Kaku's book, Physics of the Future, concludes with a comprehensive prediction of what life will like in 2100 as the subtitle indicates. The majority of the book is made up of predictions about how technology will evolve in the intervening years.The book was written in 2011, so some its contents are already dated. Interestingly, certain predictions about the near future have already come to pass. Other predictions appear to be a little delayed. To be clear, Mr. Kaku is very humble in the introduction about the ability to predict the future. One of the concrete statements he makes about the future is the idea there is a great deal to be optimistic about. He examines individuals in the past who were pessimistic about the development of technology, and he shows how wrong these individuals proved to be in time. For this reason, I think he is correct to say the future belongs to the optimists.I enjoyed the book; however, I don't think it is worth more than 3 stars. It has some important ideas, but the audience is narrow to a certain extant. It seems to offer inspiration to the future scientists who will make these breakthroughs; however, it isn't as relevant to the average reader. We will eventually see the changes predicted, but they are mostly decades away. "
139,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467608-serro,4,"This is a great book by a great physicist. I only rate it 4 stars because his thoughts and predictions can only be tested in 2100. I promise to raise my rating to 5 starts in 2100 if his predictions are correct. That is because according to Michio Kaku medicine will evolve greatly allowing people to live a lot longer than now. Not that I don't plan on living for 113 years as it is.The reader will find insights about the future of computers and AI, medicine and nanotechnology, space travel and energy. Kaku also takes on the nature of humanity as a whole in the next 100 years.And bear in mind these are not the predictions of Nostradamus, Michi Kaku knows first hand what he writes about."

142,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1080484-teji,4,"The author’s passion for both physics and science-fiction is evident throughout this piece of speculative non-fiction. The work explores several areas of emerging technology and applied science, not just quantum physics. As the author notes, his predictions are “reasoned estimates of when the prototype technologies of today will finally reach maturity”. His extrapolation of what he thinks is likely to occur in the near (2010-2030), mid (2030-20700, and far (2070-2100) future, are intriguing and thought provoking. The organization is very repetitive-- almost as if it were written as a series of articles that were later post-edited into a book format (although I don't think that is the case). Also, the writing is a little dry in places-- but not intolerably so. Additionally, when speaking of the future, the author tends to geek out and engage in overwrought, almost giddy, statements about the “godlike” powers technology will grant humans within the next century. These flaws aside, overall, the writing is coherent and accessible. It will be interesting to see how well his forecasts for the next couple of decades hold-up.Quotes(view spoiler)[[In his novel, Paris in the Twentieth Century, written in 1863, Jules Verne] “predicted that Paris in 1960 would have glass skyscrapers, air conditioning, TV, elevators, high-speed trains, gasoline-powered automobiles, fax machines, and even something resembling the Internet…just a few years later he made another spectacular prediction. In 1865, he wrote From the Earth to the Moon, in which he predicted the details of the mission that sent our astronauts to the moon…He accurately predicted the size of the space capsule to within a few percent, the location of the launch site in Florida…the weightlessness that the astronauts would experience, and the final splashdown in the ocean…How was Jules Verne able to predict 100 years into the future with such breathtaking accuracy? His biographers have noted that, although Verne was not a scientist himself he constantly sought out scientists…He amassed a vast archive summarizing the great scientific discoveries of his time. Verne, more than others, realized that science was the engine shaking the foundations of civilization, propelling it into a new century with unexpected marvels and miracles.” -Introduction“Another great prophet of technology was Leonardo da Vinci, painter, thinker, and visionary…Like Jules Verne, Leonardo was able to get profound insights into the future by consulting a handful of forward-thinking individuals of his time…In addition, Leonardo was always experimenting, building, and sketching models, a key attribute of anyone who wants to translate thinking into reality.” -Introduction“As William Gibson…once said, ‘The future is already here. It’s just unevenly distributed.” -Introduction“Predictions for the future, with a few exceptions, have always underestimated the pace of technological progress.” -IntroductionThere are four fundamental forces in nature that drive the entire universe: gravity (unlocking the force of gravity helped to pave the way for the Industrial Revolution and the introduction of steam power, especially the locomotive), electromagnetic force (this unleashed the electronic revolution that has created a bounty of scientific wonders), and the two nuclear forces: the weak and strong forces. “When Einstein wrote down e=mc^2 and when the atom was split in the 1930s, scientists for the first time began to understand the forces that light up the heavens…the secret behind the stars…it also held out the promise that one day we would be able to harness this power on the earth”… quantum theory “has given us the transistor, the laser, and the digital resolution that is the driving force behind modern society. -Introduction“Exponential growth is often hard to grasp, since our minds think linearly. It is so gradual that you sometimes cannot experience the change at all. But over decades, it can completely alter everything around us. According to Moore's law, every Christmas your new computer games are almost twice as powerful (in terms of the number of transistors) as those from the previous year. Furthermore, as the years pass, this incremental gain becomes monumental. For example, when you receive a birthday card in the mail, it often has a chip that sings ‘Happy Birthday’ to you. Remarkably, that chip has more computer power than all the Allied forces of 1945. Hitler, Churchill, or Roosevelt might have killed to get that chip…Today, your cell phone has more computer power than all of NASA back in 1969, when it placed two astronauts on the moon…” Ch1“Today, when we enter a room, we automatically look for the light switch since we assume that the walls are electrified. In the future, the first thing we will do on entering a room…is to assume the room is intelligent…Around 2020, the price of a chip may also drop to about a penny…then we will have millions of chips distributed everywhere in our environment, silently carrying out our orders.” -Ch1“One reason why Moore's law has relentlessly increased the power of chips is because UV light can be tuned so that its wavelength is smaller and smaller, making it possible to etch increasingly tiny transistors onto silicon wafers. Since UV light has a wavelength as small as 10 nanometers, this means that the smallest transistor that you can etch is thirty atoms across…But this process cannot go on forever…You can even calculate roughly when Moore’s law will finally collapse: when you finally hit transistors the size of individual atoms… According to the laws of physics, eventually the Age of Silicon will come to a close, as we enter the Post-Silicon Era. Transistors will be so small that quantum theory or atomic physics takes over and electrons leak out of the wires…At that point, according to the laws of physics, the quantum theory takes over. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that you cannot know both the position and the velocity of any particle…at the atomic level you simply cannot know where the electron is, so it can never be confined precisely in an ultrathin wire or layer and it necessarily leaks out, causing the circuit to short-circuit.” Ch1“However, scans of the human brain clearly show that thinking is spread out over large parts of the brain...Digital computers can calculate at nearly the speed of light. he human brain, by contrast, is incredibly slow. Nerve impulses travel at an excruciatingly slow pace of about 200 miles per hour. But the brain more than makes up for this because it is massively parallel… In a race, a superfast single processor is left in the dust by a superslow parallel processor.” Ch2“While hardware had grown [exponentially] by the ability to etch smaller and smaller transistors onto a wafer, software is totally different; it requires a human to sit down with a pencil and paper to write code. That is the bottleneck: the human. Software, like all human creative activity, progresses in fits and starts, with brilliant insights and long stretches of drudgery and stagnation.” Ch2“…genetic analysis shows that aging is concentrated in the ""engine"" of the cell, the mitochondria, or the cell’s power plant. This has allowed scientists to…look for ways to accelerate the gene repair process inside the mitochondria to reverse the effects of aging.” Ch3“Normally, we don’t see quantum forces at work in everyday life. But quantum forces are everywhere…if we are largely empty, then why can’t we walk through walls?...The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons can exit in the same quantum state. Hence, when two nearly identical electrons get too close, they repel each other. This is the reason objects appear to be solid, which is an illusion…When we sit on a chair...we are hovering above the chair, floating less than a nanometer above it, repelled by the chair’s electrical and quantum forces.” Ch4“The quantum theory has only one thing going for it: it is correct. Its accuracy has been measured to one part in ten billion, making it the most successful physical theory of all time.” Ch4“Science and technology are the engines of prosperity…” Ch7“The combination of changing social conditions and the mastery of the four forces propelled Europe to the forefront of nations. But technologies are dynamic, changing all the time. They are born, evolve, and rise and fall…technologies obey certain laws of evolution. Mass technologies usually evolve in four basic stages…In stage I, the products of technology are so precious that they are closely guarded. Paper, when it was invented in the form of papyrus by the ancient Egyptians…was so precious that one papyrus scroll was closely guarded by scores of priests…Paper entered stage II around 1450, when Gutenberg invented the movable type…one person could possess one book containing the knowledge of hundreds of scrolls. Before Gutenberg, there were only 30,000 books in all Europe. By 1500, there were 9 million books…By around 1930, paper hit stage III, when the cost fell to a penny a sheet. This made possible the personal library, where one person could possess hundreds of books. Paper became an ordinary commodity…Paper is everywhere and nowhere, invisible and ubiquitous. Now we are in stage IV, where paper is a fashion statement. We decorate our world with paper of all colors, shapes, and sizes. The largest source of urban waste is paper. So paper evolved from being a closely guarded commodity to being waste.” Running water, electricity, and computer have followed the same pattern. Ch7“But as technologies evolve, they create abrupt changes in the economy that sometimes lead to social dislocations. In any revolution, there are winners and losers…What jobs will flourish by midcentury? How will the evolution of technology change the way we work? We can partially determine the answer by asking a simple question: What are the limitations of robots? As we have seen, there are at least two basic stumbling blocks to artificial intelligence: pattern recognition and common sense. Therefore, the jobs that will survive in the future are…ones that require these two abilities.” Ch7“Developing nations may be able to take advantage of the information revolution. They can, in principle, leapfrog past the developed nations in many areas. In the developed world, telephone companies had to tediously wire up every home or farm at great cost. But a developing nation does not have to wire up its country, since cell phone technology can excel in rural areas without any roads or infrastructure. Also, developing nations have the advantage that they do not have to rebuild an aging infrastructure…” Ch7“…the Unites States has maintained its dominance in science and technology in spite of the fact that U.S. students often score dead last when it comes to essential subjects like science and math…(It should also be pointed out that this ranking corresponds roughly to the number of days that students were in school. China, which ranked number 1, averaged 251 days of instruction per year, while the United States averaged only 178 days per year.) It seems like a mystery that, despite these awful numbers, the United States continues to do well internationally in science and technology, until you realize that much of the U.S science [talent] comes from overseas. The United States has a secret weapon, the H1B visa…But the H1B visa is only a stopgap measure. The United States cannot continue to live off foreign scientists, many of whom are beginning to return to China and India as their economies improve…The United States will eventually have to overhaul its archaic, sclerotic education system. At present, poorly prepared high school students flood the job market and universities…Employers continually bemoan the fact that they have to take one year to train their new hires to bring them up to speed. And the universities are burdened by having to create new layers of remedial courses to compensate for the poor high school education system…” Ch7“When physicists try to analyze civilizations, we rank them on the basis of the energy they consume. This ranking was first introduced in 1964 by Russian astrophysicists Nikolai Kardashev…he proposed three theoretical types: A Type I civilization is planetary, consuming the sliver of sunlight that falls on their planet, or about 10^17 watts. A Type II civilization is stellar, consuming all the energy that their sun emits, or 10^27 watts. A Type III civilization is galactic, consuming the energy of billions of stars, or about 10^37 watts…Each type is separated by a factor of 10 billion: a Type III civilization consumes 10 billion times more energy than at Type II civilization…which in turn consumes 10 billion times more energy than a Type I civilization. According to the classification, our present-day civilization is Type 0. We don’t even rate on this scale, since we get our energy from dead plants, that is from oil and coal. (Carl Sagan, generalizing this classification...[estimated] that we are actually a Type .7 civilization…we can mathematically estimate that we will attain Type I status in about 100 years, given an average rate of economic growth.” Ch8“Also, if room temperature superconductors are found in this century, it means a complete overhaul of our energy requirements. Waste heat, in the form of friction, will be greatly reduced, increasing the efficiency of our machines. As we mentioned, the majority of our energy consumption, especially transportation, goes into overcoming friction…it would take almost no energy to move from California to New York if there were no friction.” Ch8 (hide spoiler)]"

The author is a skilled writer who is gifted at communicating highly abstract and obscure ideas.So why only two stars?I did have some issues with the overall books and how this project was carried out. Some were more troubling than others. The major issues include:1) Too much scientific triumphalism -- The clear storyline in the book is that science will render most of the troubles of life either moot or less relevant. Diseases will go away, aging will be suppressed, and immortality lies around the corner! Hovercraft will be developed, robots will be everywhere and solve our problems, and traditional issues of scarcity re health and food will go away. I suspect that this technological paradise is being oversold, just a bit. Lifespan has been extended, but arguably more by prenatal and care for newborns, coupled with public health measures such as mass inoculation coupled with the aggressive combating of traditional killers like smallpox. We still haven't figured out much regarding the flu or the common cold! Yes there has been progress, but is heaven really that near? Have we proven ourselves worthy of godlike status?2) There is very little on economics throughout the book. The author has apparently read some of Thurow's futurist work but not much else. Science and technology need to be brought to market and commercialized before they can hope to revolutionize our lives. Perhaps the government will do it all?? Well the government might fund defense research and NSF grants but last I heard it still did limited work on commercialization.3) What about politics? The twentieth century brought amazing advances in science and technology but also rule by thugs, gangsters, and murderers that applied technology to the extermination of millions. Oh Brave New World . . . . !4) The author pushes his futurist motivation -- using a near future, mid future, and far future framework, but in the end it comes down to extrapolation between two poles - heaven or catastrophe, with the chance of catastrophe severely discounted. Not much of a choice!5) The author raises the need for education in science and technology, suggesting that they have read Goldin and Katz, but only talk about it in the context of H1B visas and information intensive jobs that go wanting. What about the increasing numbers of people in the US who are almost completely left out of the new age because of their poor education and training? Kaku may be setting up the world of Wells' Time Machine without knowing it. How can we move into a scientific and technology heaven, when most people are fit to work at Wal-Mart at best? What will all the dummies do once the robots take over our jobs? . . . which negative utopia comes to mind? the Matrix??6) This could be partially excused, since no author is perfect and the book is informative. What is more troubling about the book is that it is two or three chapters too long and the extra chapters detract from the book's value. Once the author moves from the descriptive and commentary and mild extrapolation in most ot the book to a more normative tone when he discusses the evolution of a planetary civilization, he loses me completely. He takes a framework by Kardashev to identify civilizations we might encounter from space and order them by energy use (???) and applies it to how our civilization might develop. Note here, we are using a framework with absolutely no data or experience behind it, with the exception of the sci-fi movie genre, and turning it into the summary framework for a book purporting to provide an update to general readers on the state of research in physics!! Needless to say I was not convinced and was chuckling - for the wrong reasons -- as I worked through the end of the book. This appears to be a common problem in big reach synthesis boos -- Ian Morris' book on why the West rules comes to mind, although the latter is a much better book overall.5) By the end of the book, I was wondering if there were particular reasons why Kaku appeared to have ""lost it"" when he just should have stopped writing fifty pages sooner.6) Overall, I don't regret reading it. I just regret finishing it."
145,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12945730-jack-ferreira,3,"I like Michio Kaku, he seems like a pretty cool, down to earth guy. I'll get some criticism out of the way, because overall I did enjoy the book.I have seen interviews and tv shows he's been in and though I do like him sometimes his atitude bothers me for some reason. I can't quite put my finger on it, maybe it has something to do with this slightly over-pandering way of explaining things. It looks like he thinks the only way his readers will understand what he's saying is by constantly referencing Star Treck, Star Wars and other products of science fiction which really isn't needed. I understood him perfectly well when he talked about portable MRI machines and DNA chips before he felt the need to display a picture of a Star Treck ""tricorder"" (just in case we couldn't grasp the idea by ourselves). I thought these constant references were a bit odd because this isn't a hard book to comprehend. It's not necessarily insulting but at the same time it feels a little condescending. This is especialy present in the final chapter (""A Day in a Life in 2100""). It was completely unecessary and cringeworthy, he may be a great theoretical physicist but he is not a great writer (outside of non-fiction, at least). That said, I learnt a lot from this book. I will probably forget most of it, I admit, but it made me feel up to date on our current technological advancements. I liked the way he split up each chapter, making it nicely organized and easy to navigate through. It was great reading about realistic predictions for the future of computers, AI, energy, nanotechnology and space travel. The future of wealth was also discussed which took me by surprise and I sincerely apreciated it, since it really is something important to consider.As he talks about the future of humanity he introduces some very interesting concepts. It leaves me excited for things to come and curious of how it will change our way of life.Obviously, we should all take these predictions with a grain of salt. I'm sure Michio Kaku has more or less figured out the near future, but up to the year 2100 he gets quite vague. Some people see it as a bad thing, but I don't blame him. Any book we read, from an author who goes out of his areas of expertise must not be taken for granted. I have seen people comment on misuse of terminology and a lot of non consideration for alternate scenarios. This is why I love people like Richard Dawkins, who write books within their fields and whose content I absolutely trust.It's a nice book if you don't look upon it as a definitive guide to the future.I am now in the mood for some science fiction though."
146,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53461468-rasty,5,"Its amazing when you first read that book , it's not about how science developed or anything like that , but its about how science will develop and will shape our destiny or thoughts to our whole world , michio kaku one of my favorite writers about science , and that was amazing from him :)"
147,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5526063-mary-jean-harris,3,"This was quite a good book with lots of fascinating predictions for the future, as well as a survey of technologies currently being developed. I'd give it 3.5 stars (you need 1/2 stars, Goodreads!). Michio Kaku writes about the places he's visited, mostly research labs, that are working on new technologies, including bioengineering, nanotechnology, quantum computers, robotics, gene therapy, self-driving cars, space travel, and space elevators. Kaku's enthusiasm for these future changes is undying throughout the book, and it makes an enjoyable read. I can't agree with him that all this will result in positive change for the future though, especially as technology becomes more invasive and embedded into our lives, drawing us even further apart from the natural world as well as opening up the possibility for people (and governments and organizations) to control us in this system. It sounds eerily similar to the matrix, but Kaku doesn't seem overly concerned about any of these issues.Additionally, Kaku unfortunately falls into the trap of global warming hysteria: he takes it for granted that humanity is causing a climate crisis, a position that is highly contented and strewn with propaganda. As a scientist analysing a complicated issue, Kaku does not apply his own standards of rational inquiry to this issue and instead accepts the politically correct position that, even if he dug a little deep into the issue before writing the book, he would realize is not supported by many climate scientists.Also, although I liked the last chapter about ""a day in the life in 2100"" overall, it was really corny and, for some reason, the main guy we're following works at an office with only men...do no females work in the industry?. Also, this online dating stuff has become prevalent and people just do it naturally, something I find really creepy.But despite these problems with the book, it was a great read overall and definitely accessible to the general public."
148,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4617137-sangita-takhur,4,"To me the big question is: how fast will our technology progress in the coming years? I know it is very difficult to give a solid logical answer to this question. I liked the book but I do not agree with Kaku on many points. I think Kaku used almost a linear model for predicting the future. I think we need more imaginative power for predicting the future. Like Kaku I too believe that, gene technology, computers, artificial intelligence and robots will advance rapidly. The book is composed of the following nine chapters: 1. Future of the Computer: Mind over Matter, 2. Future of AI: Rise of the Machines, 3. Future of Medicine: Perfection and Beyond, 4. Nanotechnology: Everything from Nothing?, 5. Future of Energy: Energy from the Stars, 6. Future of Space Travel: To the Stars, 7. Future of Wealth, 8. Future of Humanity: Planetary Civilization, and 9. A Day in the Life in 2100. Kaku's approach is excellent, as if he is talking to a lay person, but he writes with a simple eloquence that makes these complex concepts accessible to the non-Physicist mind.Michio is too good in predicting the limitations of the technologies. One may argue that Michio's idea of robots and computers is similar to the AI from the movies in the 1990s, but we have to think year 2020 much brighter. Development on medicine, synthetic biology and nanotechnology is almost ignored. I was expecting more about quantum biology but that too is missing. But overall I liked the book. The book is good enough to stimulate our imagination."
149,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/153756-jeffrey,4,"A fascinating look at how the world might change in the future, while also giving some good basic information on various subjects - for example, Kaku breaks down how gene therapy works, and also what it could lead to. Kaku's style of writing is informative and accessible, and the only time I found myself starting to lose focus was during the fictional narrative covering a typical day in 2100. In a way, that section suffers from a lack of imagination in what people would be like, despite having well thought out possibilities for technology; it seems more like an example of what someone from today would act like if we had all of that technology today. Still, that got me thinking about things... like, one hundred years ago, someone wouldn't have even been able to conceive of the internet, but even if they could imagine it, they probably wouldn't be able to foresee the rise of things like social media, youtube, etc. and how those things are changing the way humanity deals with privacy and public appearance.Kaku's pretty optimistic about the future (he even only mentions the idea of humanity going extinct one time), so this book is at times almost like a really well researched version of the cliched utopian future. Fortunately the book's foundation is in science and balances that vision with various realistic possibilities, and in any case it's a great source of basic information related to physics for the layperson."
150,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17648164-umair-khan,4,"What is the future going to be like? Physics of the Future tries to answer this question in an engaging, thought provoking and visionary account of the possibilities that, according to the author, Michio Kaku, will be transformed into reality in the coming decades. The book will not be a disappointment to fans of Kaku and can be considered as a sequel to his previous work, Visions, but with a more expansive view.Physics outlines four fundamental forces of nature: gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force and strong nuclear force. Kaku is of the opinion that each time a force of nature is understood by scientists and harnessed by engineers it sets in motion a chain reaction of novel and unique technologies determining the course of human development. In Physics, Kaku interviews more than 300 scientists and inventors who are working day and night to push the boundaries of science and technology. Essentially, the theme of the book is similar to the works of futurists like Ray Kurzweil, however, the treatment of the topic is more vivid and easier to understand.Kaku seems to be following the footsteps of visionary futurists like Leonardo da Vinci and Jules Verne. He explores the impact of physics on the areas of computer science, artificial intelligence, medicine, nanotechnology, alternative energy and space travel. Kaku scientifically predicts what new technologies will enter in the following decades, what will be achieved by the mid-21st century, and finally what we will accomplish by the end of it.The narrative, introducing prospects of controlling computers through the human mind, resurrecting extinct animals, travelling to other planets and genetically enhancing our disease resistance, is exciting to read. The author claims that we might even be able to bring back the Neanderthal. However, he pinpoints the ethical dilemmas associated with such achievements by quoting Richard Klein, an anthropologist at Stanford: “Are you going to put the Neanderthals in a zoo or in Harvard?”In the last chapter, Kaku introduces the reader to an imaginary character living in the 22nd century. Biologically, he is in his 70s but the age of his organs is mid-30s. He rides a self-driven car. Nano-bots monitor the crucial indicators of his health while roaming in his bloodstream. What distinguishes this book from works of science fiction is that every prediction in the book is based on research and supported by prototypes being developed across the globe.Kaku also analyses the economic and social history of our civilisation and explains that new technologies are the engines of both scientific and social change. He rightly points out that the economic recessions of the 1850s, 1920s and 2008 were due to the “speculative fever” created around specific sectors: the railroad, automotive stocks and real estate, respectively.He warns that when the British Empire was shifting its focus from scientific innovation to more mundane matters of power-play, the US was emerging as a leader in research and advancement of knowledge in all fields. However, if the majority of the US talent is going into the investment sector and managing the finances of others, in which region will the most brilliant minds pursue the cause of innovation and exploring the truth?Kaku further chalks out the ranking of civilisations which was first introduced in 1964 by Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev — on the basis of the energy they consume. This ranking was mainly proposed to identify the powers of extra terrestrial intelligent civilisations and classify them into three types. Type I consumes planetary sources of energy, mainly sunlight that falls on their planet; Type II consumes all the energy produced by their sun, while Type III consumes the energy produced by all the stars of their galaxy. Our current status is perhaps that of a Type 0 since we consume the energy of dead plants (oil and coal). Kaku estimates that given the economic growth rate we will be able to achieve the status of a Type I civilisation by the end of the century.Physics of the Future not only tells us what is probable and possible in the future, it also gives researchers and inventors a timescale to measure their successes against. Moreover, it makes the reader feel excited about the times we are living in, when we can expect ‘miracles’ to happen in our lifetimes. Kaku points out that “By 2100, our destiny is to become like the gods we once worshipped and feared.”SOURCE: http://www.dawn.com/news/634292/non-f..."
151,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3352854-david-skip-everling,2,"I'm not sure about anybody's ability to predict a century into the future (especially if you give credence to the idea of accelerating returns in technology), but I was willing to give this book a shot after hearing Michio Kaku in interviews. In particular he piqued my curiosity with the claim that all the ideas in the book are grounded on currently existing prototypes or established scientific theory.Now after having read it, I think Michio is only giving a survey of some select topics, and the only ones that I think he handled well were the ones most closely linked to physics (e.g. space travel, nanotechnology & quantum behavior, global power generation). The other fields he dives into, particularly his analysis and extrapolation of consumer technologies, were disappointingly off target or lacking in proper depth.The book is occasionally so superficial in its treatment of some prototyped technologies that it reads somewhat like painfully outdated sci-fi from Michio's childhood in the 50's. The book is written to be highly accessible, but he does uninformed readers a disservice by giving equal weight to illogical and 'improbable but not impossible' possibilities. My biggest problem with his predictions are that they center on only a set of technologies that Kaku has experience with, extrapolated all the way out to 2100 without much consideration of how all the unmentioned possibilities will change his visions for the future.As an example, Michio doesn't do the best job keeping our present circumstances and his far future predictions from mixing anachronistically: e.g. the frequently repeated ""...when we carry around our own genomes on a CD-ROM"" for a ""2030-2070"" range prediction. I worry that Michio Kaku is just paraphrasing some of the ideas out there without really thinking about them any more critically, like a mediocre science journalist or sci-fi writer. Again this could be an artifact of his intentionally writing this book to be broadly accessible, but I don't think he found the right balance.The best parts of the book are in the second half, particularly his chapters on The Future of: Energy, Space Travel, Wealth, and Humanity (respectively) and I did enjoy most of this material despite a scattering of the same problems mentioned above. Sadly, I think Michio Kaku completely botched his concluding chapter, ""A Day in the Life in 2100"", and I think the preceding Future of Humanity chapter would have been a much stronger ending. The ""Day in the Life"" conclusion is silly speculative fiction and the best (worst?) example in the entire book of his anachronistic and muddled sci-fi visions. Michio Kaku is great when talking about physics and large scale trends closely linked to humanity's knowledge of physics, but judging from this book alone he doesn't put together upcoming technologies into realistic or compelling future scenarios very well at all, ending up with an incomplete picture somewhere in the uncomfortable border between imaginative thinking and unwarranted speculation."
152,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,4,"This is a fascinating survey of what's actually happening in the cutting edge of science and technology. He walks through computers and vehicles and energy and space exploration and even culture. For each area he discussed deeply what's happening now, then gives thoughtful guesses to what will develop in early 21st century, mid-century, and late-century. His understanding of science is broad AND deep. His vision of the future of science is compelling. Some highlights: Tiny computer chips will be embedded in everything--almost literally--and we'll live in a cloud of data that's ridiculous. Robots will outnumber humans--but they won't be able to do anything but the physical tasks we program them to do (including driving our cars and planes). Magnetism will finally be mastered and we'll run our world on magnetic power rather than electric power. And by the end of the century remote control robots will be building a moon base for us to continue looking into the stars. However, I docked him a star because he displays a naive understanding of culture and history. He makes sweeping mistakes like seeing being religious as the enemy of science when history actually shows that many of the greatest science cultures were so precisely because of their religious beliefs, or his easy dismissal of cultural conflicts in the new world and his idea that once food and shelter are universal then haves and have nots won't be a real issue. So read this for the tech ideas and endure his comments about becoming like the gods of old and reaching cultural utopia. "
153,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"Michio Kaku is a great science writer (as well as being a physics professor), but futurology is a difficult subject to make interesting and all too often what you get is lists of 'in the future you will have an X that will do Y,' which gets dull fairly quickly.Where Kaku's approach is good (which is to base his ideas on physics) is in the future of energy. His chapter on space exploration is good too - he is a great enthusiast for this, and that comes across strongly here. The only proviso is that the main controlling factor on space exploration is not science but politics. A man wasn't put on the moon for science, but to put the Russians in their place. We haven't done much manned exploration since for the same reason. It's too expensive for science to control things.To be honest I was even less convinced about the consumer technology ideas. If space exploration is driven by politics, consumer purchases are driven by the market. Yes, the science & technology has to be able to deliver (so you couldn't have an iPhone 10 years ago), but it doesn't decide what will and won't become popular.The book finishes with a chapter on the way the world will be a single civilization (even if nations still exist in a weakened form) by the end of the century. This seemed the least science-supported speculation. If anything we seem to be fragmenting more.All in all, a good try - but futurology remains closer to fiction than popular science."

155,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7070282-jenny-williams,5,"After reading this selection I strongly believe Michio Kaku is one of the brightest minds in his field. Physics Of The Impossible was an amazing book and this one blows it out of the water. I can't determine if I am so fond of it because of how advanced our technology will be in the near future or if I am truly fond of his writing. I know one thing for sure, some of the different advancements in technology is going to change the way we live life in way too many ways. What I mean by that is the advancement Kaku covers isn't technology like a new version of an XBOX or something of that sort. Michio Kaku covers advancement in technology like the worlds biggest atom smasher in Switzerland under a mountain, circling a mile exactly. This atom smasher is one of the biggest advancements in our technology opening doors to creating so much energy that we will be able to travel through space at a speed close to the speed of light. That's only the example I remembered best but there are so many throughout this book it excites you for our future. Kind of. "

Although, for someone who may have never read ""Visions"" or ""Physics of the Impossible"" (which too I had read in 2011-12), I strongly feel that ""Physics of the Future"" can tend to become very interesting if one likes to ponder on how technological the world is going to get within the next century, and how far will it be feasible to apply and integrate it within our daily lives.A Good Book, but a vast majority was already included amongst the first two of his books on the same genre. The chapter on the Future of Wealth, was kind of new though!A 3-star because the content was not new for me; otherwise I would rate it with a 4-star."

In fact, the action of the first film is kicked off by a message recorded in 3D by Princess Leia and conveyed by the robot...""

I understand that for those who know a lot about physics and technology, it may be to easy, but for such people as I am, it was great. Well, I didn't like everything what I read (especially, the beginning) but later it got much better.

164,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27777097-thomas-jacob-jr,3,"An enjoyable, cursory overview of some of the most exciting technological achievements we may expect mankind to engage with over the next century. I came across Michio Kaku, as I am sure many others have, by watching an interview on television a few years ago, and I was struck by his loquaciousness and intelligence. Describing contemporary scientific concepts, especially quantum physics, in a way that a layman can understand is no small feat. In Physics of the Future, Kaku focuses on several industries (private space exploration, computer technology, medicine, and others) and tries to predict what respective advances we may expect by 2100. Oftentimes he uses examples from popular science fiction, specifically Star Trek, as a frame of reference. This book definitely falls into the 'pop science' category, with only brief asides into more technical and mathematical information. Any fans of popular science fiction work in film, television, or literature will be already be aware of many of the concepts here, and truthfully, any one of them could easily fill an entire book by itself (the 'recommended reading' section at the end is a goldmine for further exploration). Kaku sometimes makes sweeping generalizations without going into further detail that may seem presumptuous, but it is usually in attempt to keep the pace light. Also, since this was written in 2011, some sections appear a little dated even only six years later (an entire section on private space exploration, for example, doesn't mention either Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos, two of the forerunners in this field). Recommended for those looking for a brief overview of some of the exciting advances in technology that we can expect to look forward to over the course of our lifetime. For those looking for a deeper dive into any of the aforementioned subjects, the dozens of recommended works at the end should serve as an excellent primer. "
165,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,4,"Peering into the future of mankind and predicting what lies in store for us a few decades from now, has always been a dicey endeavour. In general, predictions pertaining to unchecked population growth, resultant famines, wars over access to resources, gloomy prospects for the future of developing nations etc have mostly proven to be unnecessary alarms rather than reality. A few major historical instances come to mind. Rev. Thomas Malthus in the late 18th century, Dr. Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University in the 1960s, and MIT's Club of Rome report in the 1970s were famous for damning our future, particularly that of India and China due to their large populations. We find that both India and China have done pretty well in the forty years since. On the other hand, predictions about the end of slavery, end of European colonialism, an era of less work and more leisure have all come true. It seems as though we tend to take both a gloomy and hopeful view of mankind and misjudge its potential for making correctives when it comes to how human beings, our societies, governments and institutions would behave in future under changing conditions.In contrast, predictions regarding scientific and technological advances in the fields of medicine, computers, biology, astronomy etc have more frequently proven to materialize successfully, at times sooner than expected. The Moore's Law comes to mind immediately. This book itself shows how accurately Jules Verne, in the mid 1800s, predicted life in Paris in the 1960s as consisting of skyscrapers, air-conditioning, TV, elevators, high-speed trains and fax machines. It seems as if we have a better grasp of machines and man's interactions with them and the development of this man-machine future. This book by theoretical Physicist Michio Kaku, crystal-gazes into this future as led by the advance of science and technology. Even if one does not accept all the projections, we end up learning a lot on what stunning possibilities are out there as we live out this century.The book is organized on what we can expect in the near term (by 2030), the mid term (2030-2070) and the long term (2070-2100). The future is explored through the domains of Computers, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Medicine, Nanotechnology, Energy and Space Travel. But it is not just speculation from a Theoretical Physicist. The author had discussed with hundreds of scientists who actually work today on these ideas and had compiled out of this interaction, what is possible in these three time periods. The presentation and language in the book is simple and accessible even to the average non-science minded reader and that, in my view, is a great positive about the book. I shall outline here some of the future products and possibilities given by Dr.Kaku which grabbed my mind:MRI machines which are just a foot long, looking like cell phones which can be passed over the human body and detect cancer (2030)Computers which scan fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) patterns in the brain and decipher a person's stream of consciousness and thereby detect what he/she is thinking (2070-2100)Computers being able to reconstruct a person's facial features given a strand of DNA from that person'e hair or bloodTissue engineering to manufacture a whole body part by extracting a few cells from the bodyResurrection of extinct life forms like the Mammoth or the NeanderthalNano-particles which enter and kill only cancer cells and leave healthy tissue untouchedchanging one shape to another at the push of a button, just like the T-1000 in 'Terminator-2'Molecular Replicators, capable of creating almost anything we want, the same way that nature can “take hamburgers and vegetables and turn them into a baby.”Fusion plants dotting the countryside by mid centuryLanding on an asteroid or on a moon of planet Mars, Space ElevatorsThe final couple of chapters deal with the future of humanity, planetary civilizations and how life would look in 2100. One can feel the child-like enthusiasm of Dr.Kaku in writing about all these possibilities and it makes the book enjoyable reading. He uses references to popular sci-fi movies from Hollywood to illustrate many of the ideas. In fact, as I read the book, I developed a greater respect for movie makers like that of the Terminator, Matrix, Star Wars, Avatar and so on.We have heard recently of anxieties being expressed about Artificial Intelligence and its destructive potential by luminaries like Bill Gates and Elon Musk. The eminent futurist, Ray Kurzweil has suggested in his work 'The Singularity is Near' that by 2045, a $1000 computer would be a billion times more intelligent than all humans combined and hence creating an uncontrolled runaway singularity. But others like Douglas Hofstadter and Mitch Kapor have dismissed these notions. This book discusses this topic substantially and believes that mankind will develop 'friendly AI' and use it to enhance itself rather than letting itself be ruled by mean-minded robots. Dr.Kaku shows six reasons why there are major roadblocks to such a singularity.On the negative side, just as in other books on the future, this one also has its tiresome speculation on the 'sick men of Asia'. Dr.Kaku quotes a report by Peter Schwartz of the Global Business Network on the dire future that is likely in the demographic nightmare of South Asia. Sea level rise due to Global warming in the latter half of this century could cause massive flooding and chaos, resulting in millions of refugees across the borders of Bangladesh into India. Governments could lose all authority and collapse, resulting in nightmarish looting and rioting. Rising tensions and chaos and inability to control may result in nations resorting to nuclear weapons!It is only scientists who tell us that Human societies, weather and climate are non-linear systems and even a very small change could have a massive effect, called the butterfly effect, making it difficult to predict the long-term futures. Then, I don't see how the author is so sure of destructive global warming in the future and also the consequent behavior of south Asians. In spite of being repeatedly wrong, futurists cannot seem to resist making dire predictions for the future of nations with large populations.The book is enjoyable reading and educative as well. I strongly recommend reading it. Even though Physics plays an important role in all the science that is discussed in the book, I am unsure of whether 'Physics of the Future' is the most meaningful title for the book. When I picked up the book initially, I thought it would be a book on String Theory."

Based off of the known laws of nature, author and world renowned theoretical physicist Michio Kaku met with, and interviewed, 300 of the leading scientists in the world about what our world will be like in the year 2100 through the ever increasing advancements of technology. This book lays out the most likely scenario of computers, AI, medicine, nanotechnology, energy, space travel and wealth from those interviews and how they will shape the world by the year 2100.Oh what a fantastic and thought provoking book this was! It's great to read a book about the future that isn't nihilistic, apocalyptic and negative, but rather hopeful and full of wonder! Sure, the very real threats of chaos, nuclear war, global warming etc are addressed in this book, but in ways that give rise to ways around such problems instead of weakly giving into them.I'm always wondering why every sci-fi movie based in the future has to be apocalyptic, or negative about where the world is going? It's easy to see the bad decisions we are making as humans that drive this thinking and make it seem like a sure reality to come, but where are the optimistic stories? Where are the stories that show us prospering and thriving as a world in the future? Those ideas and thoughts are in this book! Hopefully some good screenwriters and filmmakers will get inspired and make a movie based off the ideas in this book. I want to see it! Almost all of us alive now will not get to experience the world in the year 2100. Not unless of course the age reversal science described in the book becomes a reality (and it seems as though it's a very real possibility in the second half of this century), but this book brings much to the imagination of looking out a window, into the world at the dawn of the 22nd century. I can't say think of anything bad to say about this one. I absolutely loved everything about it. BUY IT!"
167,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Informed speculations engagingly presentedIt’s easy to see that Professor Kaku had a lot of fun writing this book since more than anything (at least for this reader) this book was a pleasure to read.Typically Kaku begins each chapter with some reference to the ancient gods or some other form of mythology or folklore, mainly for contrast or to highlight human yearnings that are being fulfilled today or may be fulfilled in the near future. He then mixes in some science fiction movies, stories or novels that he likes or finds instructive (or not). He adds some personal research and experiences with some of the great minds of our time as he makes his predictions, speculations and guesses on where we are going and when we are going to get there. Partly because of his celebrity and partly because of his wide-ranging knowledge and sharp intelligence (not to mention his charm) Kaku is able to talk with Nobel Prize winners and other cutting edge scientists and engineers all over the world the way most people talk to their neighbors. Areas of interest, each with its own chapter are computers, artificial intelligence, medicine, nanotechnology, energy, space travel, wealth (i.e., economics), and what life will be like in the future on a day-to-day basis. Each chapter gives Kaku’s speculations for the “Near Future (Present to 2030),” “Midcentury (2030 to 2070),” and the “Far Future (2070 to 2100).”I’m going to try to NOT second guess Kaku but I do want to focus on a few areas of personal interest and add a comment or two. “It is a law of evolution that fitter species arise to displace unfit species; and perhaps humans will be lost in the shuffle, eventually winding up in zoos where our robotic creations come to stare at us…Perhaps that is our role in history, to give birth to our evolutionary successors.” (p. 100)I think this is likely, especially if you add our genetically engineered successors. If so we can then think of ourselves as the “intelligent designers” of the demigods to come.Kaku weighs in on the possibility of our robotic creations becoming more intelligent than humans. (Seems very likely.) He speculates on robots producing “ever-smarter” robots that might “devour the resources of the planet in their insatiable quest to become ever more intelligent.” (p. 101) This can be seen as a near corollary of the idea that robots will become our masters and take over the planet. Since robots can only do what is programmed into them, these ideas depend on poor or malicious programming. (Beware the black hats of the future!)On page 116 Kaku points out that “there is no universally accepted definition of ‘smart.’” He doesn’t elaborate but I want to say that the unstated question is “smart for what”? Is the goal, e.g., happiness or world domination? A different kind of smarts might be required in each case.In talking about what jobs will still be available for humans in the midcentury future, Kaku makes the excellent point that those jobs will require “nonrepetitive work that requires pattern recognition.” (p. 305) He includes garbage collectors, police officers, construction workers, gardeners, and plumbers. However where I live as soon as they get a robot to drive the truck garbage collection will be a completely automated task. We have plastic containers set out on the street which are picked up and emptied by a mechanical arm from the truck. (Yes, the future is now.)In Chapter 8 “Future of Humanity” Kaku presents Nikolai Kardashev’s Type I, II, and III Civilizations based on energy consumption. (A Type II civilization, for example, consumes all the energy from their sun.) What I found interesting is Kaku’s statement that we “are leading to a single point: the creation of a planetary civilization.” (p. 327) I think the term “planetary civilization” is what we need to replace the currently (in some quarters) offensive term, “world government.”Kaku makes the sharp point that movies with “cross-cultural themes…packed with internationally recognized celebrities, are big money makers for Hollywood.” He sees this as “evidence of an emerging planetary culture.” (p. 334) He adds on the next page that “Local cultures will continue to survive, coexisting side by side with the larger global culture.”Some of Kaku’s dreams (perhaps) are room temperature super conductors and space elevators, to name just two that are highly speculative but would be amazing if realized.In the chapter on artificial intelligence, Kaku gives his three-pointed definition of consciousness. (Actually with becoming modesty he writes, “…if I were to venture a guess.”) In my book “The World Is Not as We Think It Is” I also give a three-pointed definition:“One: awareness of the world (including awareness of our self and our processes, that is, self-awareness).Two: self-identity. Notice that awareness of self is different from this identification with self.Three: experience or sensation, the feelings we get when we experience the world. This is sometimes called “phenomenal consciousness.” An example would be the subjective experience of the color red, or the taste of a strawberry.” (p. 82)Here is Kaku’s delineation from page 97:“1. sensing and recognizing the environment2. self-awareness3. planning for the future by setting goals and plans, that is, simulating the future and plotting strategy.”The slight differences are instructive. He leaves out self-identification, perhaps rightly so; and I leave out planning for the future. Also I presume that Kaku includes self-awareness in his first component. Personally I would include planning for the future in my first component, “awareness of the world” as well; however to emphasize “simulating the future” is a fine thing to do since humans are on another level in the animal kingdom when it comes to imagining what might happen.I should mention that in writing this book Kaku did not just tune into the zeitgeist but actually read prognosticators from the past. Two who did well were Benjamin Franklin and the Marquis de Condorcet. Since Kaku’s predictions are mostly favorable for humans, I hope his predictions do as well. --Dennis Littrell, author of “Hard Science and the Unknowable”"
168,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7227342-richard,3,"Michio Kaku's book, Physics of the Future, concludes with a comprehensive prediction of what life will like in 2100 as the subtitle indicates. The majority of the book is made up of predictions about how technology will evolve in the intervening years.The book was written in 2011, so some its contents are already dated. Interestingly, certain predictions about the near future have already come to pass. Other predictions appear to be a little delayed. To be clear, Mr. Kaku is very humble in the introduction about the ability to predict the future. One of the concrete statements he makes about the future is the idea there is a great deal to be optimistic about. He examines individuals in the past who were pessimistic about the development of technology, and he shows how wrong these individuals proved to be in time. For this reason, I think he is correct to say the future belongs to the optimists.I enjoyed the book; however, I don't think it is worth more than 3 stars. It has some important ideas, but the audience is narrow to a certain extant. It seems to offer inspiration to the future scientists who will make these breakthroughs; however, it isn't as relevant to the average reader. We will eventually see the changes predicted, but they are mostly decades away. "
169,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467608-serro,4,"This is a great book by a great physicist. I only rate it 4 stars because his thoughts and predictions can only be tested in 2100. I promise to raise my rating to 5 starts in 2100 if his predictions are correct. That is because according to Michio Kaku medicine will evolve greatly allowing people to live a lot longer than now. Not that I don't plan on living for 113 years as it is.The reader will find insights about the future of computers and AI, medicine and nanotechnology, space travel and energy. Kaku also takes on the nature of humanity as a whole in the next 100 years.And bear in mind these are not the predictions of Nostradamus, Michi Kaku knows first hand what he writes about."
170,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55246199-erin,3,"I love Michio Kaku! I'm only giving this one 3 Stars because it is pretty similar to some of his other works and he repeats these concepts. This is only noticable since I have read his other books, but if you haven't and are interested in theoretical physics, give this a try!"
171,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20481392-james-biser,4,"This scientist has an interesting view of what will happen at the end of the current century. Because he studies what is happening with our culture, he can anticipate what advancements will be made and when we can expect them. This is a good read:"
172,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1080484-teji,4,"The author’s passion for both physics and science-fiction is evident throughout this piece of speculative non-fiction. The work explores several areas of emerging technology and applied science, not just quantum physics. As the author notes, his predictions are “reasoned estimates of when the prototype technologies of today will finally reach maturity”. His extrapolation of what he thinks is likely to occur in the near (2010-2030), mid (2030-20700, and far (2070-2100) future, are intriguing and thought provoking. The organization is very repetitive-- almost as if it were written as a series of articles that were later post-edited into a book format (although I don't think that is the case). Also, the writing is a little dry in places-- but not intolerably so. Additionally, when speaking of the future, the author tends to geek out and engage in overwrought, almost giddy, statements about the “godlike” powers technology will grant humans within the next century. These flaws aside, overall, the writing is coherent and accessible. It will be interesting to see how well his forecasts for the next couple of decades hold-up.Quotes(view spoiler)[[In his novel, Paris in the Twentieth Century, written in 1863, Jules Verne] “predicted that Paris in 1960 would have glass skyscrapers, air conditioning, TV, elevators, high-speed trains, gasoline-powered automobiles, fax machines, and even something resembling the Internet…just a few years later he made another spectacular prediction. In 1865, he wrote From the Earth to the Moon, in which he predicted the details of the mission that sent our astronauts to the moon…He accurately predicted the size of the space capsule to within a few percent, the location of the launch site in Florida…the weightlessness that the astronauts would experience, and the final splashdown in the ocean…How was Jules Verne able to predict 100 years into the future with such breathtaking accuracy? His biographers have noted that, although Verne was not a scientist himself he constantly sought out scientists…He amassed a vast archive summarizing the great scientific discoveries of his time. Verne, more than others, realized that science was the engine shaking the foundations of civilization, propelling it into a new century with unexpected marvels and miracles.” -Introduction“Another great prophet of technology was Leonardo da Vinci, painter, thinker, and visionary…Like Jules Verne, Leonardo was able to get profound insights into the future by consulting a handful of forward-thinking individuals of his time…In addition, Leonardo was always experimenting, building, and sketching models, a key attribute of anyone who wants to translate thinking into reality.” -Introduction“As William Gibson…once said, ‘The future is already here. It’s just unevenly distributed.” -Introduction“Predictions for the future, with a few exceptions, have always underestimated the pace of technological progress.” -IntroductionThere are four fundamental forces in nature that drive the entire universe: gravity (unlocking the force of gravity helped to pave the way for the Industrial Revolution and the introduction of steam power, especially the locomotive), electromagnetic force (this unleashed the electronic revolution that has created a bounty of scientific wonders), and the two nuclear forces: the weak and strong forces. “When Einstein wrote down e=mc^2 and when the atom was split in the 1930s, scientists for the first time began to understand the forces that light up the heavens…the secret behind the stars…it also held out the promise that one day we would be able to harness this power on the earth”… quantum theory “has given us the transistor, the laser, and the digital resolution that is the driving force behind modern society. -Introduction“Exponential growth is often hard to grasp, since our minds think linearly. It is so gradual that you sometimes cannot experience the change at all. But over decades, it can completely alter everything around us. According to Moore's law, every Christmas your new computer games are almost twice as powerful (in terms of the number of transistors) as those from the previous year. Furthermore, as the years pass, this incremental gain becomes monumental. For example, when you receive a birthday card in the mail, it often has a chip that sings ‘Happy Birthday’ to you. Remarkably, that chip has more computer power than all the Allied forces of 1945. Hitler, Churchill, or Roosevelt might have killed to get that chip…Today, your cell phone has more computer power than all of NASA back in 1969, when it placed two astronauts on the moon…” Ch1“Today, when we enter a room, we automatically look for the light switch since we assume that the walls are electrified. In the future, the first thing we will do on entering a room…is to assume the room is intelligent…Around 2020, the price of a chip may also drop to about a penny…then we will have millions of chips distributed everywhere in our environment, silently carrying out our orders.” -Ch1“One reason why Moore's law has relentlessly increased the power of chips is because UV light can be tuned so that its wavelength is smaller and smaller, making it possible to etch increasingly tiny transistors onto silicon wafers. Since UV light has a wavelength as small as 10 nanometers, this means that the smallest transistor that you can etch is thirty atoms across…But this process cannot go on forever…You can even calculate roughly when Moore’s law will finally collapse: when you finally hit transistors the size of individual atoms… According to the laws of physics, eventually the Age of Silicon will come to a close, as we enter the Post-Silicon Era. Transistors will be so small that quantum theory or atomic physics takes over and electrons leak out of the wires…At that point, according to the laws of physics, the quantum theory takes over. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that you cannot know both the position and the velocity of any particle…at the atomic level you simply cannot know where the electron is, so it can never be confined precisely in an ultrathin wire or layer and it necessarily leaks out, causing the circuit to short-circuit.” Ch1“However, scans of the human brain clearly show that thinking is spread out over large parts of the brain...Digital computers can calculate at nearly the speed of light. he human brain, by contrast, is incredibly slow. Nerve impulses travel at an excruciatingly slow pace of about 200 miles per hour. But the brain more than makes up for this because it is massively parallel… In a race, a superfast single processor is left in the dust by a superslow parallel processor.” Ch2“While hardware had grown [exponentially] by the ability to etch smaller and smaller transistors onto a wafer, software is totally different; it requires a human to sit down with a pencil and paper to write code. That is the bottleneck: the human. Software, like all human creative activity, progresses in fits and starts, with brilliant insights and long stretches of drudgery and stagnation.” Ch2“…genetic analysis shows that aging is concentrated in the ""engine"" of the cell, the mitochondria, or the cell’s power plant. This has allowed scientists to…look for ways to accelerate the gene repair process inside the mitochondria to reverse the effects of aging.” Ch3“Normally, we don’t see quantum forces at work in everyday life. But quantum forces are everywhere…if we are largely empty, then why can’t we walk through walls?...The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons can exit in the same quantum state. Hence, when two nearly identical electrons get too close, they repel each other. This is the reason objects appear to be solid, which is an illusion…When we sit on a chair...we are hovering above the chair, floating less than a nanometer above it, repelled by the chair’s electrical and quantum forces.” Ch4“The quantum theory has only one thing going for it: it is correct. Its accuracy has been measured to one part in ten billion, making it the most successful physical theory of all time.” Ch4“Science and technology are the engines of prosperity…” Ch7“The combination of changing social conditions and the mastery of the four forces propelled Europe to the forefront of nations. But technologies are dynamic, changing all the time. They are born, evolve, and rise and fall…technologies obey certain laws of evolution. Mass technologies usually evolve in four basic stages…In stage I, the products of technology are so precious that they are closely guarded. Paper, when it was invented in the form of papyrus by the ancient Egyptians…was so precious that one papyrus scroll was closely guarded by scores of priests…Paper entered stage II around 1450, when Gutenberg invented the movable type…one person could possess one book containing the knowledge of hundreds of scrolls. Before Gutenberg, there were only 30,000 books in all Europe. By 1500, there were 9 million books…By around 1930, paper hit stage III, when the cost fell to a penny a sheet. This made possible the personal library, where one person could possess hundreds of books. Paper became an ordinary commodity…Paper is everywhere and nowhere, invisible and ubiquitous. Now we are in stage IV, where paper is a fashion statement. We decorate our world with paper of all colors, shapes, and sizes. The largest source of urban waste is paper. So paper evolved from being a closely guarded commodity to being waste.” Running water, electricity, and computer have followed the same pattern. Ch7“But as technologies evolve, they create abrupt changes in the economy that sometimes lead to social dislocations. In any revolution, there are winners and losers…What jobs will flourish by midcentury? How will the evolution of technology change the way we work? We can partially determine the answer by asking a simple question: What are the limitations of robots? As we have seen, there are at least two basic stumbling blocks to artificial intelligence: pattern recognition and common sense. Therefore, the jobs that will survive in the future are…ones that require these two abilities.” Ch7“Developing nations may be able to take advantage of the information revolution. They can, in principle, leapfrog past the developed nations in many areas. In the developed world, telephone companies had to tediously wire up every home or farm at great cost. But a developing nation does not have to wire up its country, since cell phone technology can excel in rural areas without any roads or infrastructure. Also, developing nations have the advantage that they do not have to rebuild an aging infrastructure…” Ch7“…the Unites States has maintained its dominance in science and technology in spite of the fact that U.S. students often score dead last when it comes to essential subjects like science and math…(It should also be pointed out that this ranking corresponds roughly to the number of days that students were in school. China, which ranked number 1, averaged 251 days of instruction per year, while the United States averaged only 178 days per year.) It seems like a mystery that, despite these awful numbers, the United States continues to do well internationally in science and technology, until you realize that much of the U.S science [talent] comes from overseas. The United States has a secret weapon, the H1B visa…But the H1B visa is only a stopgap measure. The United States cannot continue to live off foreign scientists, many of whom are beginning to return to China and India as their economies improve…The United States will eventually have to overhaul its archaic, sclerotic education system. At present, poorly prepared high school students flood the job market and universities…Employers continually bemoan the fact that they have to take one year to train their new hires to bring them up to speed. And the universities are burdened by having to create new layers of remedial courses to compensate for the poor high school education system…” Ch7“When physicists try to analyze civilizations, we rank them on the basis of the energy they consume. This ranking was first introduced in 1964 by Russian astrophysicists Nikolai Kardashev…he proposed three theoretical types: A Type I civilization is planetary, consuming the sliver of sunlight that falls on their planet, or about 10^17 watts. A Type II civilization is stellar, consuming all the energy that their sun emits, or 10^27 watts. A Type III civilization is galactic, consuming the energy of billions of stars, or about 10^37 watts…Each type is separated by a factor of 10 billion: a Type III civilization consumes 10 billion times more energy than at Type II civilization…which in turn consumes 10 billion times more energy than a Type I civilization. According to the classification, our present-day civilization is Type 0. We don’t even rate on this scale, since we get our energy from dead plants, that is from oil and coal. (Carl Sagan, generalizing this classification...[estimated] that we are actually a Type .7 civilization…we can mathematically estimate that we will attain Type I status in about 100 years, given an average rate of economic growth.” Ch8“Also, if room temperature superconductors are found in this century, it means a complete overhaul of our energy requirements. Waste heat, in the form of friction, will be greatly reduced, increasing the efficiency of our machines. As we mentioned, the majority of our energy consumption, especially transportation, goes into overcoming friction…it would take almost no energy to move from California to New York if there were no friction.” Ch8 (hide spoiler)]"
173,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9619705-anna,0,I just want to see an updated version of this book explaining why most of short term predictions didn't work out.
174,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,2,"The book was extremely informative about current trends in science (and some technology). It lives up to its title in discussing physics of the future. The author is a skilled writer who is gifted at communicating highly abstract and obscure ideas.So why only two stars?I did have some issues with the overall books and how this project was carried out. Some were more troubling than others. The major issues include:1) Too much scientific triumphalism -- The clear storyline in the book is that science will render most of the troubles of life either moot or less relevant. Diseases will go away, aging will be suppressed, and immortality lies around the corner! Hovercraft will be developed, robots will be everywhere and solve our problems, and traditional issues of scarcity re health and food will go away. I suspect that this technological paradise is being oversold, just a bit. Lifespan has been extended, but arguably more by prenatal and care for newborns, coupled with public health measures such as mass inoculation coupled with the aggressive combating of traditional killers like smallpox. We still haven't figured out much regarding the flu or the common cold! Yes there has been progress, but is heaven really that near? Have we proven ourselves worthy of godlike status?2) There is very little on economics throughout the book. The author has apparently read some of Thurow's futurist work but not much else. Science and technology need to be brought to market and commercialized before they can hope to revolutionize our lives. Perhaps the government will do it all?? Well the government might fund defense research and NSF grants but last I heard it still did limited work on commercialization.3) What about politics? The twentieth century brought amazing advances in science and technology but also rule by thugs, gangsters, and murderers that applied technology to the extermination of millions. Oh Brave New World . . . . !4) The author pushes his futurist motivation -- using a near future, mid future, and far future framework, but in the end it comes down to extrapolation between two poles - heaven or catastrophe, with the chance of catastrophe severely discounted. Not much of a choice!5) The author raises the need for education in science and technology, suggesting that they have read Goldin and Katz, but only talk about it in the context of H1B visas and information intensive jobs that go wanting. What about the increasing numbers of people in the US who are almost completely left out of the new age because of their poor education and training? Kaku may be setting up the world of Wells' Time Machine without knowing it. How can we move into a scientific and technology heaven, when most people are fit to work at Wal-Mart at best? What will all the dummies do once the robots take over our jobs? . . . which negative utopia comes to mind? the Matrix??6) This could be partially excused, since no author is perfect and the book is informative. What is more troubling about the book is that it is two or three chapters too long and the extra chapters detract from the book's value. Once the author moves from the descriptive and commentary and mild extrapolation in most ot the book to a more normative tone when he discusses the evolution of a planetary civilization, he loses me completely. He takes a framework by Kardashev to identify civilizations we might encounter from space and order them by energy use (???) and applies it to how our civilization might develop. Note here, we are using a framework with absolutely no data or experience behind it, with the exception of the sci-fi movie genre, and turning it into the summary framework for a book purporting to provide an update to general readers on the state of research in physics!! Needless to say I was not convinced and was chuckling - for the wrong reasons -- as I worked through the end of the book. This appears to be a common problem in big reach synthesis boos -- Ian Morris' book on why the West rules comes to mind, although the latter is a much better book overall.5) By the end of the book, I was wondering if there were particular reasons why Kaku appeared to have ""lost it"" when he just should have stopped writing fifty pages sooner.6) Overall, I don't regret reading it. I just regret finishing it."
175,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12945730-jack-ferreira,3,"I like Michio Kaku, he seems like a pretty cool, down to earth guy. I'll get some criticism out of the way, because overall I did enjoy the book.I have seen interviews and tv shows he's been in and though I do like him sometimes his atitude bothers me for some reason. I can't quite put my finger on it, maybe it has something to do with this slightly over-pandering way of explaining things. It looks like he thinks the only way his readers will understand what he's saying is by constantly referencing Star Treck, Star Wars and other products of science fiction which really isn't needed. I understood him perfectly well when he talked about portable MRI machines and DNA chips before he felt the need to display a picture of a Star Treck ""tricorder"" (just in case we couldn't grasp the idea by ourselves). I thought these constant references were a bit odd because this isn't a hard book to comprehend. It's not necessarily insulting but at the same time it feels a little condescending. This is especialy present in the final chapter (""A Day in a Life in 2100""). It was completely unecessary and cringeworthy, he may be a great theoretical physicist but he is not a great writer (outside of non-fiction, at least). That said, I learnt a lot from this book. I will probably forget most of it, I admit, but it made me feel up to date on our current technological advancements. I liked the way he split up each chapter, making it nicely organized and easy to navigate through. It was great reading about realistic predictions for the future of computers, AI, energy, nanotechnology and space travel. The future of wealth was also discussed which took me by surprise and I sincerely apreciated it, since it really is something important to consider.As he talks about the future of humanity he introduces some very interesting concepts. It leaves me excited for things to come and curious of how it will change our way of life.Obviously, we should all take these predictions with a grain of salt. I'm sure Michio Kaku has more or less figured out the near future, but up to the year 2100 he gets quite vague. Some people see it as a bad thing, but I don't blame him. Any book we read, from an author who goes out of his areas of expertise must not be taken for granted. I have seen people comment on misuse of terminology and a lot of non consideration for alternate scenarios. This is why I love people like Richard Dawkins, who write books within their fields and whose content I absolutely trust.It's a nice book if you don't look upon it as a definitive guide to the future.I am now in the mood for some science fiction though."

I'd give it 3.5 stars (you need 1/2 stars, Goodreads!). Michio Kaku writes about the places he's visited, mostly research labs, that are working on new technologies, including bioengineering, nanotechnology, quantum computers, robotics, gene therapy, self-driving cars, space travel, and space elevators. Kaku's enthusiasm for these future changes is undying throughout the book, and it makes an enjoyable read. I can't agree with him that all this will result in positive change for the future though, especially as technology becomes more invasive and embedded into our lives, drawing us even further apart from the natural world as well as opening up the possibility for people (and governments and organizations) to control us in this system. It sounds eerily similar to the matrix, but Kaku doesn't seem overly concerned about any of these issues.Additionally, Kaku unfortunately falls into the trap of global warming hysteria: he takes it for granted that humanity is causing a climate crisis, a position that is highly contented and strewn with propaganda. As a scientist analysing a complicated issue, Kaku does not apply his own standards of rational inquiry to this issue and instead accepts the politically correct position that, even if he dug a little deep into the issue before writing the book, he would realize is not supported by many climate scientists.Also, although I liked the last chapter about ""a day in the life in 2100"" overall, it was really corny and, for some reason, the main guy we're following works at an office with only men...do no females work in the industry?. Also, this online dating stuff has become prevalent and people just do it naturally, something I find really creepy.But despite these problems with the book, it was a great read overall and definitely accessible to the general public."
178,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4617137-sangita-takhur,4,"To me the big question is: how fast will our technology progress in the coming years? I know it is very difficult to give a solid logical answer to this question. I liked the book but I do not agree with Kaku on many points. I think Kaku used almost a linear model for predicting the future. I think we need more imaginative power for predicting the future. Like Kaku I too believe that, gene technology, computers, artificial intelligence and robots will advance rapidly. The book is composed of the following nine chapters: 1. Future of the Computer: Mind over Matter, 2. Future of AI: Rise of the Machines, 3. Future of Medicine: Perfection and Beyond, 4. Nanotechnology: Everything from Nothing?, 5. Future of Energy: Energy from the Stars, 6. Future of Space Travel: To the Stars, 7. Future of Wealth, 8. Future of Humanity: Planetary Civilization, and 9. A Day in the Life in 2100. Kaku's approach is excellent, as if he is talking to a lay person, but he writes with a simple eloquence that makes these complex concepts accessible to the non-Physicist mind.Michio is too good in predicting the limitations of the technologies. One may argue that Michio's idea of robots and computers is similar to the AI from the movies in the 1990s, but we have to think year 2020 much brighter. Development on medicine, synthetic biology and nanotechnology is almost ignored. I was expecting more about quantum biology but that too is missing. But overall I liked the book. The book is good enough to stimulate our imagination."
179,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/153756-jeffrey,4,"A fascinating look at how the world might change in the future, while also giving some good basic information on various subjects - for example, Kaku breaks down how gene therapy works, and also what it could lead to. Kaku's style of writing is informative and accessible, and the only time I found myself starting to lose focus was during the fictional narrative covering a typical day in 2100. In a way, that section suffers from a lack of imagination in what people would be like, despite having well thought out possibilities for technology; it seems more like an example of what someone from today would act like if we had all of that technology today. Still, that got me thinking about things... like, one hundred years ago, someone wouldn't have even been able to conceive of the internet, but even if they could imagine it, they probably wouldn't be able to foresee the rise of things like social media, youtube, etc. and how those things are changing the way humanity deals with privacy and public appearance.Kaku's pretty optimistic about the future (he even only mentions the idea of humanity going extinct one time), so this book is at times almost like a really well researched version of the cliched utopian future. Fortunately the book's foundation is in science and balances that vision with various realistic possibilities, and in any case it's a great source of basic information related to physics for the layperson."
180,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17648164-umair-khan,4,"What is the future going to be like? Physics of the Future tries to answer this question in an engaging, thought provoking and visionary account of the possibilities that, according to the author, Michio Kaku, will be transformed into reality in the coming decades. The book will not be a disappointment to fans of Kaku and can be considered as a sequel to his previous work, Visions, but with a more expansive view.Physics outlines four fundamental forces of nature: gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force and strong nuclear force. Kaku is of the opinion that each time a force of nature is understood by scientists and harnessed by engineers it sets in motion a chain reaction of novel and unique technologies determining the course of human development. In Physics, Kaku interviews more than 300 scientists and inventors who are working day and night to push the boundaries of science and technology. Essentially, the theme of the book is similar to the works of futurists like Ray Kurzweil, however, the treatment of the topic is more vivid and easier to understand.Kaku seems to be following the footsteps of visionary futurists like Leonardo da Vinci and Jules Verne. He explores the impact of physics on the areas of computer science, artificial intelligence, medicine, nanotechnology, alternative energy and space travel. Kaku scientifically predicts what new technologies will enter in the following decades, what will be achieved by the mid-21st century, and finally what we will accomplish by the end of it.The narrative, introducing prospects of controlling computers through the human mind, resurrecting extinct animals, travelling to other planets and genetically enhancing our disease resistance, is exciting to read. The author claims that we might even be able to bring back the Neanderthal. However, he pinpoints the ethical dilemmas associated with such achievements by quoting Richard Klein, an anthropologist at Stanford: “Are you going to put the Neanderthals in a zoo or in Harvard?”In the last chapter, Kaku introduces the reader to an imaginary character living in the 22nd century. Biologically, he is in his 70s but the age of his organs is mid-30s. He rides a self-driven car. Nano-bots monitor the crucial indicators of his health while roaming in his bloodstream. What distinguishes this book from works of science fiction is that every prediction in the book is based on research and supported by prototypes being developed across the globe.Kaku also analyses the economic and social history of our civilisation and explains that new technologies are the engines of both scientific and social change. He rightly points out that the economic recessions of the 1850s, 1920s and 2008 were due to the “speculative fever” created around specific sectors: the railroad, automotive stocks and real estate, respectively.He warns that when the British Empire was shifting its focus from scientific innovation to more mundane matters of power-play, the US was emerging as a leader in research and advancement of knowledge in all fields. However, if the majority of the US talent is going into the investment sector and managing the finances of others, in which region will the most brilliant minds pursue the cause of innovation and exploring the truth?Kaku further chalks out the ranking of civilisations which was first introduced in 1964 by Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev — on the basis of the energy they consume. This ranking was mainly proposed to identify the powers of extra terrestrial intelligent civilisations and classify them into three types. Type I consumes planetary sources of energy, mainly sunlight that falls on their planet; Type II consumes all the energy produced by their sun, while Type III consumes the energy produced by all the stars of their galaxy. Our current status is perhaps that of a Type 0 since we consume the energy of dead plants (oil and coal). Kaku estimates that given the economic growth rate we will be able to achieve the status of a Type I civilisation by the end of the century.Physics of the Future not only tells us what is probable and possible in the future, it also gives researchers and inventors a timescale to measure their successes against. Moreover, it makes the reader feel excited about the times we are living in, when we can expect ‘miracles’ to happen in our lifetimes. Kaku points out that “By 2100, our destiny is to become like the gods we once worshipped and feared.”SOURCE: http://www.dawn.com/news/634292/non-f..."
181,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3352854-david-skip-everling,2,"I'm not sure about anybody's ability to predict a century into the future (especially if you give credence to the idea of accelerating returns in technology), but I was willing to give this book a shot after hearing Michio Kaku in interviews. In particular he piqued my curiosity with the claim that all the ideas in the book are grounded on currently existing prototypes or established scientific theory.Now after having read it, I think Michio is only giving a survey of some select topics, and the only ones that I think he handled well were the ones most closely linked to physics (e.g. space travel, nanotechnology & quantum behavior, global power generation). The other fields he dives into, particularly his analysis and extrapolation of consumer technologies, were disappointingly off target or lacking in proper depth.The book is occasionally so superficial in its treatment of some prototyped technologies that it reads somewhat like painfully outdated sci-fi from Michio's childhood in the 50's. The book is written to be highly accessible, but he does uninformed readers a disservice by giving equal weight to illogical and 'improbable but not impossible' possibilities. My biggest problem with his predictions are that they center on only a set of technologies that Kaku has experience with, extrapolated all the way out to 2100 without much consideration of how all the unmentioned possibilities will change his visions for the future.As an example, Michio doesn't do the best job keeping our present circumstances and his far future predictions from mixing anachronistically: e.g. the frequently repeated ""...when we carry around our own genomes on a CD-ROM"" for a ""2030-2070"" range prediction. I worry that Michio Kaku is just paraphrasing some of the ideas out there without really thinking about them any more critically, like a mediocre science journalist or sci-fi writer. Again this could be an artifact of his intentionally writing this book to be broadly accessible, but I don't think he found the right balance.The best parts of the book are in the second half, particularly his chapters on The Future of: Energy, Space Travel, Wealth, and Humanity (respectively) and I did enjoy most of this material despite a scattering of the same problems mentioned above. Sadly, I think Michio Kaku completely botched his concluding chapter, ""A Day in the Life in 2100"", and I think the preceding Future of Humanity chapter would have been a much stronger ending. The ""Day in the Life"" conclusion is silly speculative fiction and the best (worst?) example in the entire book of his anachronistic and muddled sci-fi visions. Michio Kaku is great when talking about physics and large scale trends closely linked to humanity's knowledge of physics, but judging from this book alone he doesn't put together upcoming technologies into realistic or compelling future scenarios very well at all, ending up with an incomplete picture somewhere in the uncomfortable border between imaginative thinking and unwarranted speculation."
182,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,4,"This is a fascinating survey of what's actually happening in the cutting edge of science and technology. He walks through computers and vehicles and energy and space exploration and even culture. For each area he discussed deeply what's happening now, then gives thoughtful guesses to what will develop in early 21st century, mid-century, and late-century. His understanding of science is broad AND deep. His vision of the future of science is compelling. Some highlights: Tiny computer chips will be embedded in everything--almost literally--and we'll live in a cloud of data that's ridiculous. Robots will outnumber humans--but they won't be able to do anything but the physical tasks we program them to do (including driving our cars and planes). Magnetism will finally be mastered and we'll run our world on magnetic power rather than electric power. And by the end of the century remote control robots will be building a moon base for us to continue looking into the stars. However, I docked him a star because he displays a naive understanding of culture and history. He makes sweeping mistakes like seeing being religious as the enemy of science when history actually shows that many of the greatest science cultures were so precisely because of their religious beliefs, or his easy dismissal of cultural conflicts in the new world and his idea that once food and shelter are universal then haves and have nots won't be a real issue. So read this for the tech ideas and endure his comments about becoming like the gods of old and reaching cultural utopia. "
183,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"Michio Kaku is a great science writer (as well as being a physics professor), but futurology is a difficult subject to make interesting and all too often what you get is lists of 'in the future you will have an X that will do Y,' which gets dull fairly quickly.Where Kaku's approach is good (which is to base his ideas on physics) is in the future of energy. His chapter on space exploration is good too - he is a great enthusiast for this, and that comes across strongly here. The only proviso is that the main controlling factor on space exploration is not science but politics. A man wasn't put on the moon for science, but to put the Russians in their place. We haven't done much manned exploration since for the same reason. It's too expensive for science to control things.To be honest I was even less convinced about the consumer technology ideas. If space exploration is driven by politics, consumer purchases are driven by the market. Yes, the science & technology has to be able to deliver (so you couldn't have an iPhone 10 years ago), but it doesn't decide what will and won't become popular.The book finishes with a chapter on the way the world will be a single civilization (even if nations still exist in a weakened form) by the end of the century. This seemed the least science-supported speculation. If anything we seem to be fragmenting more.All in all, a good try - but futurology remains closer to fiction than popular science."

I get that he was trying to summarize everything he'd written in the book in an interesting way, but I'm not a huge fan of 2nd person povs and it came off as annoying and unneeded. "
185,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7070282-jenny-williams,5,"After reading this selection I strongly believe Michio Kaku is one of the brightest minds in his field. Physics Of The Impossible was an amazing book and this one blows it out of the water. I can't determine if I am so fond of it because of how advanced our technology will be in the near future or if I am truly fond of his writing. I know one thing for sure, some of the different advancements in technology is going to change the way we live life in way too many ways. What I mean by that is the advancement Kaku covers isn't technology like a new version of an XBOX or something of that sort. Michio Kaku covers advancement in technology like the worlds biggest atom smasher in Switzerland under a mountain, circling a mile exactly. This atom smasher is one of the biggest advancements in our technology opening doors to creating so much energy that we will be able to travel through space at a speed close to the speed of light. That's only the example I remembered best but there are so many throughout this book it excites you for our future. Kind of. "
186,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5431286-david,3,"Since I had already read the book ""Visions"" by the same writer nearly three years ago, this one did not really generate much of an interest within me due to the much common material. Although, for someone who may have never read ""Visions"" or ""Physics of the Impossible"" (which too I had read in 2011-12), I strongly feel that ""Physics of the Future"" can tend to become very interesting if one likes to ponder on how technological the world is going to get within the next century, and how far will it be feasible to apply and integrate it within our daily lives.A Good Book, but a vast majority was already included amongst the first two of his books on the same genre. The chapter on the Future of Wealth, was kind of new though!A 3-star because the content was not new for me; otherwise I would rate it with a 4-star."

In fact, the action of the first film is kicked off by a message recorded in 3D by Princess Leia and conveyed by the robot...""

I understand that for those who know a lot about physics and technology, it may be to easy, but for such people as I am, it was great. Well, I didn't like everything what I read (especially, the beginning) but later it got much better.

194,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27777097-thomas-jacob-jr,3,"An enjoyable, cursory overview of some of the most exciting technological achievements we may expect mankind to engage with over the next century. I came across Michio Kaku, as I am sure many others have, by watching an interview on television a few years ago, and I was struck by his loquaciousness and intelligence. Describing contemporary scientific concepts, especially quantum physics, in a way that a layman can understand is no small feat. In Physics of the Future, Kaku focuses on several industries (private space exploration, computer technology, medicine, and others) and tries to predict what respective advances we may expect by 2100. Oftentimes he uses examples from popular science fiction, specifically Star Trek, as a frame of reference. This book definitely falls into the 'pop science' category, with only brief asides into more technical and mathematical information. Any fans of popular science fiction work in film, television, or literature will be already be aware of many of the concepts here, and truthfully, any one of them could easily fill an entire book by itself (the 'recommended reading' section at the end is a goldmine for further exploration). Kaku sometimes makes sweeping generalizations without going into further detail that may seem presumptuous, but it is usually in attempt to keep the pace light. Also, since this was written in 2011, some sections appear a little dated even only six years later (an entire section on private space exploration, for example, doesn't mention either Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos, two of the forerunners in this field). Recommended for those looking for a brief overview of some of the exciting advances in technology that we can expect to look forward to over the course of our lifetime. For those looking for a deeper dive into any of the aforementioned subjects, the dozens of recommended works at the end should serve as an excellent primer. "
195,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,4,"Peering into the future of mankind and predicting what lies in store for us a few decades from now, has always been a dicey endeavour. In general, predictions pertaining to unchecked population growth, resultant famines, wars over access to resources, gloomy prospects for the future of developing nations etc have mostly proven to be unnecessary alarms rather than reality. A few major historical instances come to mind. Rev. Thomas Malthus in the late 18th century, Dr. Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University in the 1960s, and MIT's Club of Rome report in the 1970s were famous for damning our future, particularly that of India and China due to their large populations. We find that both India and China have done pretty well in the forty years since. On the other hand, predictions about the end of slavery, end of European colonialism, an era of less work and more leisure have all come true. It seems as though we tend to take both a gloomy and hopeful view of mankind and misjudge its potential for making correctives when it comes to how human beings, our societies, governments and institutions would behave in future under changing conditions.In contrast, predictions regarding scientific and technological advances in the fields of medicine, computers, biology, astronomy etc have more frequently proven to materialize successfully, at times sooner than expected. The Moore's Law comes to mind immediately. This book itself shows how accurately Jules Verne, in the mid 1800s, predicted life in Paris in the 1960s as consisting of skyscrapers, air-conditioning, TV, elevators, high-speed trains and fax machines. It seems as if we have a better grasp of machines and man's interactions with them and the development of this man-machine future. This book by theoretical Physicist Michio Kaku, crystal-gazes into this future as led by the advance of science and technology. Even if one does not accept all the projections, we end up learning a lot on what stunning possibilities are out there as we live out this century.The book is organized on what we can expect in the near term (by 2030), the mid term (2030-2070) and the long term (2070-2100). The future is explored through the domains of Computers, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Medicine, Nanotechnology, Energy and Space Travel. But it is not just speculation from a Theoretical Physicist. The author had discussed with hundreds of scientists who actually work today on these ideas and had compiled out of this interaction, what is possible in these three time periods. The presentation and language in the book is simple and accessible even to the average non-science minded reader and that, in my view, is a great positive about the book. I shall outline here some of the future products and possibilities given by Dr.Kaku which grabbed my mind:MRI machines which are just a foot long, looking like cell phones which can be passed over the human body and detect cancer (2030)Computers which scan fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) patterns in the brain and decipher a person's stream of consciousness and thereby detect what he/she is thinking (2070-2100)Computers being able to reconstruct a person's facial features given a strand of DNA from that person'e hair or bloodTissue engineering to manufacture a whole body part by extracting a few cells from the bodyResurrection of extinct life forms like the Mammoth or the NeanderthalNano-particles which enter and kill only cancer cells and leave healthy tissue untouchedchanging one shape to another at the push of a button, just like the T-1000 in 'Terminator-2'Molecular Replicators, capable of creating almost anything we want, the same way that nature can “take hamburgers and vegetables and turn them into a baby.”Fusion plants dotting the countryside by mid centuryLanding on an asteroid or on a moon of planet Mars, Space ElevatorsThe final couple of chapters deal with the future of humanity, planetary civilizations and how life would look in 2100. One can feel the child-like enthusiasm of Dr.Kaku in writing about all these possibilities and it makes the book enjoyable reading. He uses references to popular sci-fi movies from Hollywood to illustrate many of the ideas. In fact, as I read the book, I developed a greater respect for movie makers like that of the Terminator, Matrix, Star Wars, Avatar and so on.We have heard recently of anxieties being expressed about Artificial Intelligence and its destructive potential by luminaries like Bill Gates and Elon Musk. The eminent futurist, Ray Kurzweil has suggested in his work 'The Singularity is Near' that by 2045, a $1000 computer would be a billion times more intelligent than all humans combined and hence creating an uncontrolled runaway singularity. But others like Douglas Hofstadter and Mitch Kapor have dismissed these notions. This book discusses this topic substantially and believes that mankind will develop 'friendly AI' and use it to enhance itself rather than letting itself be ruled by mean-minded robots. Dr.Kaku shows six reasons why there are major roadblocks to such a singularity.On the negative side, just as in other books on the future, this one also has its tiresome speculation on the 'sick men of Asia'. Dr.Kaku quotes a report by Peter Schwartz of the Global Business Network on the dire future that is likely in the demographic nightmare of South Asia. Sea level rise due to Global warming in the latter half of this century could cause massive flooding and chaos, resulting in millions of refugees across the borders of Bangladesh into India. Governments could lose all authority and collapse, resulting in nightmarish looting and rioting. Rising tensions and chaos and inability to control may result in nations resorting to nuclear weapons!It is only scientists who tell us that Human societies, weather and climate are non-linear systems and even a very small change could have a massive effect, called the butterfly effect, making it difficult to predict the long-term futures. Then, I don't see how the author is so sure of destructive global warming in the future and also the consequent behavior of south Asians. In spite of being repeatedly wrong, futurists cannot seem to resist making dire predictions for the future of nations with large populations.The book is enjoyable reading and educative as well. I strongly recommend reading it. Even though Physics plays an important role in all the science that is discussed in the book, I am unsure of whether 'Physics of the Future' is the most meaningful title for the book. When I picked up the book initially, I thought it would be a book on String Theory."
196,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645507-jason-schneeberger,5,"I don't usually do book reviews this long anymore, but this one that I won't soon forget. If ever. Based off of the known laws of nature, author and world renowned theoretical physicist Michio Kaku met with, and interviewed, 300 of the leading scientists in the world about what our world will be like in the year 2100 through the ever increasing advancements of technology. This book lays out the most likely scenario of computers, AI, medicine, nanotechnology, energy, space travel and wealth from those interviews and how they will shape the world by the year 2100.Oh what a fantastic and thought provoking book this was! It's great to read a book about the future that isn't nihilistic, apocalyptic and negative, but rather hopeful and full of wonder! Sure, the very real threats of chaos, nuclear war, global warming etc are addressed in this book, but in ways that give rise to ways around such problems instead of weakly giving into them.I'm always wondering why every sci-fi movie based in the future has to be apocalyptic, or negative about where the world is going? It's easy to see the bad decisions we are making as humans that drive this thinking and make it seem like a sure reality to come, but where are the optimistic stories? Where are the stories that show us prospering and thriving as a world in the future? Those ideas and thoughts are in this book! Hopefully some good screenwriters and filmmakers will get inspired and make a movie based off the ideas in this book. I want to see it! Almost all of us alive now will not get to experience the world in the year 2100. Not unless of course the age reversal science described in the book becomes a reality (and it seems as though it's a very real possibility in the second half of this century), but this book brings much to the imagination of looking out a window, into the world at the dawn of the 22nd century. I can't say think of anything bad to say about this one. I absolutely loved everything about it. BUY IT!"
197,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Informed speculations engagingly presentedIt’s easy to see that Professor Kaku had a lot of fun writing this book since more than anything (at least for this reader) this book was a pleasure to read.Typically Kaku begins each chapter with some reference to the ancient gods or some other form of mythology or folklore, mainly for contrast or to highlight human yearnings that are being fulfilled today or may be fulfilled in the near future. He then mixes in some science fiction movies, stories or novels that he likes or finds instructive (or not). He adds some personal research and experiences with some of the great minds of our time as he makes his predictions, speculations and guesses on where we are going and when we are going to get there. Partly because of his celebrity and partly because of his wide-ranging knowledge and sharp intelligence (not to mention his charm) Kaku is able to talk with Nobel Prize winners and other cutting edge scientists and engineers all over the world the way most people talk to their neighbors. Areas of interest, each with its own chapter are computers, artificial intelligence, medicine, nanotechnology, energy, space travel, wealth (i.e., economics), and what life will be like in the future on a day-to-day basis. Each chapter gives Kaku’s speculations for the “Near Future (Present to 2030),” “Midcentury (2030 to 2070),” and the “Far Future (2070 to 2100).”I’m going to try to NOT second guess Kaku but I do want to focus on a few areas of personal interest and add a comment or two. “It is a law of evolution that fitter species arise to displace unfit species; and perhaps humans will be lost in the shuffle, eventually winding up in zoos where our robotic creations come to stare at us…Perhaps that is our role in history, to give birth to our evolutionary successors.” (p. 100)I think this is likely, especially if you add our genetically engineered successors. If so we can then think of ourselves as the “intelligent designers” of the demigods to come.Kaku weighs in on the possibility of our robotic creations becoming more intelligent than humans. (Seems very likely.) He speculates on robots producing “ever-smarter” robots that might “devour the resources of the planet in their insatiable quest to become ever more intelligent.” (p. 101) This can be seen as a near corollary of the idea that robots will become our masters and take over the planet. Since robots can only do what is programmed into them, these ideas depend on poor or malicious programming. (Beware the black hats of the future!)On page 116 Kaku points out that “there is no universally accepted definition of ‘smart.’” He doesn’t elaborate but I want to say that the unstated question is “smart for what”? Is the goal, e.g., happiness or world domination? A different kind of smarts might be required in each case.In talking about what jobs will still be available for humans in the midcentury future, Kaku makes the excellent point that those jobs will require “nonrepetitive work that requires pattern recognition.” (p. 305) He includes garbage collectors, police officers, construction workers, gardeners, and plumbers. However where I live as soon as they get a robot to drive the truck garbage collection will be a completely automated task. We have plastic containers set out on the street which are picked up and emptied by a mechanical arm from the truck. (Yes, the future is now.)In Chapter 8 “Future of Humanity” Kaku presents Nikolai Kardashev’s Type I, II, and III Civilizations based on energy consumption. (A Type II civilization, for example, consumes all the energy from their sun.) What I found interesting is Kaku’s statement that we “are leading to a single point: the creation of a planetary civilization.” (p. 327) I think the term “planetary civilization” is what we need to replace the currently (in some quarters) offensive term, “world government.”Kaku makes the sharp point that movies with “cross-cultural themes…packed with internationally recognized celebrities, are big money makers for Hollywood.” He sees this as “evidence of an emerging planetary culture.” (p. 334) He adds on the next page that “Local cultures will continue to survive, coexisting side by side with the larger global culture.”Some of Kaku’s dreams (perhaps) are room temperature super conductors and space elevators, to name just two that are highly speculative but would be amazing if realized.In the chapter on artificial intelligence, Kaku gives his three-pointed definition of consciousness. (Actually with becoming modesty he writes, “…if I were to venture a guess.”) In my book “The World Is Not as We Think It Is” I also give a three-pointed definition:“One: awareness of the world (including awareness of our self and our processes, that is, self-awareness).Two: self-identity. Notice that awareness of self is different from this identification with self.Three: experience or sensation, the feelings we get when we experience the world. This is sometimes called “phenomenal consciousness.” An example would be the subjective experience of the color red, or the taste of a strawberry.” (p. 82)Here is Kaku’s delineation from page 97:“1. sensing and recognizing the environment2. self-awareness3. planning for the future by setting goals and plans, that is, simulating the future and plotting strategy.”The slight differences are instructive. He leaves out self-identification, perhaps rightly so; and I leave out planning for the future. Also I presume that Kaku includes self-awareness in his first component. Personally I would include planning for the future in my first component, “awareness of the world” as well; however to emphasize “simulating the future” is a fine thing to do since humans are on another level in the animal kingdom when it comes to imagining what might happen.I should mention that in writing this book Kaku did not just tune into the zeitgeist but actually read prognosticators from the past. Two who did well were Benjamin Franklin and the Marquis de Condorcet. Since Kaku’s predictions are mostly favorable for humans, I hope his predictions do as well. --Dennis Littrell, author of “Hard Science and the Unknowable”"
198,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7227342-richard,3,"Michio Kaku's book, Physics of the Future, concludes with a comprehensive prediction of what life will like in 2100 as the subtitle indicates. The majority of the book is made up of predictions about how technology will evolve in the intervening years.The book was written in 2011, so some its contents are already dated. Interestingly, certain predictions about the near future have already come to pass. Other predictions appear to be a little delayed. To be clear, Mr. Kaku is very humble in the introduction about the ability to predict the future. One of the concrete statements he makes about the future is the idea there is a great deal to be optimistic about. He examines individuals in the past who were pessimistic about the development of technology, and he shows how wrong these individuals proved to be in time. For this reason, I think he is correct to say the future belongs to the optimists.I enjoyed the book; however, I don't think it is worth more than 3 stars. It has some important ideas, but the audience is narrow to a certain extant. It seems to offer inspiration to the future scientists who will make these breakthroughs; however, it isn't as relevant to the average reader. We will eventually see the changes predicted, but they are mostly decades away. "
199,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467608-serro,4,"This is a great book by a great physicist. I only rate it 4 stars because his thoughts and predictions can only be tested in 2100. I promise to raise my rating to 5 starts in 2100 if his predictions are correct. That is because according to Michio Kaku medicine will evolve greatly allowing people to live a lot longer than now. Not that I don't plan on living for 113 years as it is.The reader will find insights about the future of computers and AI, medicine and nanotechnology, space travel and energy. Kaku also takes on the nature of humanity as a whole in the next 100 years.And bear in mind these are not the predictions of Nostradamus, Michi Kaku knows first hand what he writes about."
200,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55246199-erin,3,"I love Michio Kaku! I'm only giving this one 3 Stars because it is pretty similar to some of his other works and he repeats these concepts. This is only noticable since I have read his other books, but if you haven't and are interested in theoretical physics, give this a try!"
201,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20481392-james-biser,4,"This scientist has an interesting view of what will happen at the end of the current century. Because he studies what is happening with our culture, he can anticipate what advancements will be made and when we can expect them. This is a good read:"
202,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1080484-teji,4,"The author’s passion for both physics and science-fiction is evident throughout this piece of speculative non-fiction. The work explores several areas of emerging technology and applied science, not just quantum physics. As the author notes, his predictions are “reasoned estimates of when the prototype technologies of today will finally reach maturity”. His extrapolation of what he thinks is likely to occur in the near (2010-2030), mid (2030-20700, and far (2070-2100) future, are intriguing and thought provoking. The organization is very repetitive-- almost as if it were written as a series of articles that were later post-edited into a book format (although I don't think that is the case). Also, the writing is a little dry in places-- but not intolerably so. Additionally, when speaking of the future, the author tends to geek out and engage in overwrought, almost giddy, statements about the “godlike” powers technology will grant humans within the next century. These flaws aside, overall, the writing is coherent and accessible. It will be interesting to see how well his forecasts for the next couple of decades hold-up.Quotes(view spoiler)[[In his novel, Paris in the Twentieth Century, written in 1863, Jules Verne] “predicted that Paris in 1960 would have glass skyscrapers, air conditioning, TV, elevators, high-speed trains, gasoline-powered automobiles, fax machines, and even something resembling the Internet…just a few years later he made another spectacular prediction. In 1865, he wrote From the Earth to the Moon, in which he predicted the details of the mission that sent our astronauts to the moon…He accurately predicted the size of the space capsule to within a few percent, the location of the launch site in Florida…the weightlessness that the astronauts would experience, and the final splashdown in the ocean…How was Jules Verne able to predict 100 years into the future with such breathtaking accuracy? His biographers have noted that, although Verne was not a scientist himself he constantly sought out scientists…He amassed a vast archive summarizing the great scientific discoveries of his time. Verne, more than others, realized that science was the engine shaking the foundations of civilization, propelling it into a new century with unexpected marvels and miracles.” -Introduction“Another great prophet of technology was Leonardo da Vinci, painter, thinker, and visionary…Like Jules Verne, Leonardo was able to get profound insights into the future by consulting a handful of forward-thinking individuals of his time…In addition, Leonardo was always experimenting, building, and sketching models, a key attribute of anyone who wants to translate thinking into reality.” -Introduction“As William Gibson…once said, ‘The future is already here. It’s just unevenly distributed.” -Introduction“Predictions for the future, with a few exceptions, have always underestimated the pace of technological progress.” -IntroductionThere are four fundamental forces in nature that drive the entire universe: gravity (unlocking the force of gravity helped to pave the way for the Industrial Revolution and the introduction of steam power, especially the locomotive), electromagnetic force (this unleashed the electronic revolution that has created a bounty of scientific wonders), and the two nuclear forces: the weak and strong forces. “When Einstein wrote down e=mc^2 and when the atom was split in the 1930s, scientists for the first time began to understand the forces that light up the heavens…the secret behind the stars…it also held out the promise that one day we would be able to harness this power on the earth”… quantum theory “has given us the transistor, the laser, and the digital resolution that is the driving force behind modern society. -Introduction“Exponential growth is often hard to grasp, since our minds think linearly. It is so gradual that you sometimes cannot experience the change at all. But over decades, it can completely alter everything around us. According to Moore's law, every Christmas your new computer games are almost twice as powerful (in terms of the number of transistors) as those from the previous year. Furthermore, as the years pass, this incremental gain becomes monumental. For example, when you receive a birthday card in the mail, it often has a chip that sings ‘Happy Birthday’ to you. Remarkably, that chip has more computer power than all the Allied forces of 1945. Hitler, Churchill, or Roosevelt might have killed to get that chip…Today, your cell phone has more computer power than all of NASA back in 1969, when it placed two astronauts on the moon…” Ch1“Today, when we enter a room, we automatically look for the light switch since we assume that the walls are electrified. In the future, the first thing we will do on entering a room…is to assume the room is intelligent…Around 2020, the price of a chip may also drop to about a penny…then we will have millions of chips distributed everywhere in our environment, silently carrying out our orders.” -Ch1“One reason why Moore's law has relentlessly increased the power of chips is because UV light can be tuned so that its wavelength is smaller and smaller, making it possible to etch increasingly tiny transistors onto silicon wafers. Since UV light has a wavelength as small as 10 nanometers, this means that the smallest transistor that you can etch is thirty atoms across…But this process cannot go on forever…You can even calculate roughly when Moore’s law will finally collapse: when you finally hit transistors the size of individual atoms… According to the laws of physics, eventually the Age of Silicon will come to a close, as we enter the Post-Silicon Era. Transistors will be so small that quantum theory or atomic physics takes over and electrons leak out of the wires…At that point, according to the laws of physics, the quantum theory takes over. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that you cannot know both the position and the velocity of any particle…at the atomic level you simply cannot know where the electron is, so it can never be confined precisely in an ultrathin wire or layer and it necessarily leaks out, causing the circuit to short-circuit.” Ch1“However, scans of the human brain clearly show that thinking is spread out over large parts of the brain...Digital computers can calculate at nearly the speed of light. he human brain, by contrast, is incredibly slow. Nerve impulses travel at an excruciatingly slow pace of about 200 miles per hour. But the brain more than makes up for this because it is massively parallel… In a race, a superfast single processor is left in the dust by a superslow parallel processor.” Ch2“While hardware had grown [exponentially] by the ability to etch smaller and smaller transistors onto a wafer, software is totally different; it requires a human to sit down with a pencil and paper to write code. That is the bottleneck: the human. Software, like all human creative activity, progresses in fits and starts, with brilliant insights and long stretches of drudgery and stagnation.” Ch2“…genetic analysis shows that aging is concentrated in the ""engine"" of the cell, the mitochondria, or the cell’s power plant. This has allowed scientists to…look for ways to accelerate the gene repair process inside the mitochondria to reverse the effects of aging.” Ch3“Normally, we don’t see quantum forces at work in everyday life. But quantum forces are everywhere…if we are largely empty, then why can’t we walk through walls?...The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons can exit in the same quantum state. Hence, when two nearly identical electrons get too close, they repel each other. This is the reason objects appear to be solid, which is an illusion…When we sit on a chair...we are hovering above the chair, floating less than a nanometer above it, repelled by the chair’s electrical and quantum forces.” Ch4“The quantum theory has only one thing going for it: it is correct. Its accuracy has been measured to one part in ten billion, making it the most successful physical theory of all time.” Ch4“Science and technology are the engines of prosperity…” Ch7“The combination of changing social conditions and the mastery of the four forces propelled Europe to the forefront of nations. But technologies are dynamic, changing all the time. They are born, evolve, and rise and fall…technologies obey certain laws of evolution. Mass technologies usually evolve in four basic stages…In stage I, the products of technology are so precious that they are closely guarded. Paper, when it was invented in the form of papyrus by the ancient Egyptians…was so precious that one papyrus scroll was closely guarded by scores of priests…Paper entered stage II around 1450, when Gutenberg invented the movable type…one person could possess one book containing the knowledge of hundreds of scrolls. Before Gutenberg, there were only 30,000 books in all Europe. By 1500, there were 9 million books…By around 1930, paper hit stage III, when the cost fell to a penny a sheet. This made possible the personal library, where one person could possess hundreds of books. Paper became an ordinary commodity…Paper is everywhere and nowhere, invisible and ubiquitous. Now we are in stage IV, where paper is a fashion statement. We decorate our world with paper of all colors, shapes, and sizes. The largest source of urban waste is paper. So paper evolved from being a closely guarded commodity to being waste.” Running water, electricity, and computer have followed the same pattern. Ch7“But as technologies evolve, they create abrupt changes in the economy that sometimes lead to social dislocations. In any revolution, there are winners and losers…What jobs will flourish by midcentury? How will the evolution of technology change the way we work? We can partially determine the answer by asking a simple question: What are the limitations of robots? As we have seen, there are at least two basic stumbling blocks to artificial intelligence: pattern recognition and common sense. Therefore, the jobs that will survive in the future are…ones that require these two abilities.” Ch7“Developing nations may be able to take advantage of the information revolution. They can, in principle, leapfrog past the developed nations in many areas. In the developed world, telephone companies had to tediously wire up every home or farm at great cost. But a developing nation does not have to wire up its country, since cell phone technology can excel in rural areas without any roads or infrastructure. Also, developing nations have the advantage that they do not have to rebuild an aging infrastructure…” Ch7“…the Unites States has maintained its dominance in science and technology in spite of the fact that U.S. students often score dead last when it comes to essential subjects like science and math…(It should also be pointed out that this ranking corresponds roughly to the number of days that students were in school. China, which ranked number 1, averaged 251 days of instruction per year, while the United States averaged only 178 days per year.) It seems like a mystery that, despite these awful numbers, the United States continues to do well internationally in science and technology, until you realize that much of the U.S science [talent] comes from overseas. The United States has a secret weapon, the H1B visa…But the H1B visa is only a stopgap measure. The United States cannot continue to live off foreign scientists, many of whom are beginning to return to China and India as their economies improve…The United States will eventually have to overhaul its archaic, sclerotic education system. At present, poorly prepared high school students flood the job market and universities…Employers continually bemoan the fact that they have to take one year to train their new hires to bring them up to speed. And the universities are burdened by having to create new layers of remedial courses to compensate for the poor high school education system…” Ch7“When physicists try to analyze civilizations, we rank them on the basis of the energy they consume. This ranking was first introduced in 1964 by Russian astrophysicists Nikolai Kardashev…he proposed three theoretical types: A Type I civilization is planetary, consuming the sliver of sunlight that falls on their planet, or about 10^17 watts. A Type II civilization is stellar, consuming all the energy that their sun emits, or 10^27 watts. A Type III civilization is galactic, consuming the energy of billions of stars, or about 10^37 watts…Each type is separated by a factor of 10 billion: a Type III civilization consumes 10 billion times more energy than at Type II civilization…which in turn consumes 10 billion times more energy than a Type I civilization. According to the classification, our present-day civilization is Type 0. We don’t even rate on this scale, since we get our energy from dead plants, that is from oil and coal. (Carl Sagan, generalizing this classification...[estimated] that we are actually a Type .7 civilization…we can mathematically estimate that we will attain Type I status in about 100 years, given an average rate of economic growth.” Ch8“Also, if room temperature superconductors are found in this century, it means a complete overhaul of our energy requirements. Waste heat, in the form of friction, will be greatly reduced, increasing the efficiency of our machines. As we mentioned, the majority of our energy consumption, especially transportation, goes into overcoming friction…it would take almost no energy to move from California to New York if there were no friction.” Ch8 (hide spoiler)]"
203,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9619705-anna,0,I just want to see an updated version of this book explaining why most of short term predictions didn't work out.
204,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,2,"The book was extremely informative about current trends in science (and some technology). It lives up to its title in discussing physics of the future. The author is a skilled writer who is gifted at communicating highly abstract and obscure ideas.So why only two stars?I did have some issues with the overall books and how this project was carried out. Some were more troubling than others. The major issues include:1) Too much scientific triumphalism -- The clear storyline in the book is that science will render most of the troubles of life either moot or less relevant. Diseases will go away, aging will be suppressed, and immortality lies around the corner! Hovercraft will be developed, robots will be everywhere and solve our problems, and traditional issues of scarcity re health and food will go away. I suspect that this technological paradise is being oversold, just a bit. Lifespan has been extended, but arguably more by prenatal and care for newborns, coupled with public health measures such as mass inoculation coupled with the aggressive combating of traditional killers like smallpox. We still haven't figured out much regarding the flu or the common cold! Yes there has been progress, but is heaven really that near? Have we proven ourselves worthy of godlike status?2) There is very little on economics throughout the book. The author has apparently read some of Thurow's futurist work but not much else. Science and technology need to be brought to market and commercialized before they can hope to revolutionize our lives. Perhaps the government will do it all?? Well the government might fund defense research and NSF grants but last I heard it still did limited work on commercialization.3) What about politics? The twentieth century brought amazing advances in science and technology but also rule by thugs, gangsters, and murderers that applied technology to the extermination of millions. Oh Brave New World . . . . !4) The author pushes his futurist motivation -- using a near future, mid future, and far future framework, but in the end it comes down to extrapolation between two poles - heaven or catastrophe, with the chance of catastrophe severely discounted. Not much of a choice!5) The author raises the need for education in science and technology, suggesting that they have read Goldin and Katz, but only talk about it in the context of H1B visas and information intensive jobs that go wanting. What about the increasing numbers of people in the US who are almost completely left out of the new age because of their poor education and training? Kaku may be setting up the world of Wells' Time Machine without knowing it. How can we move into a scientific and technology heaven, when most people are fit to work at Wal-Mart at best? What will all the dummies do once the robots take over our jobs? . . . which negative utopia comes to mind? the Matrix??6) This could be partially excused, since no author is perfect and the book is informative. What is more troubling about the book is that it is two or three chapters too long and the extra chapters detract from the book's value. Once the author moves from the descriptive and commentary and mild extrapolation in most ot the book to a more normative tone when he discusses the evolution of a planetary civilization, he loses me completely. He takes a framework by Kardashev to identify civilizations we might encounter from space and order them by energy use (???) and applies it to how our civilization might develop. Note here, we are using a framework with absolutely no data or experience behind it, with the exception of the sci-fi movie genre, and turning it into the summary framework for a book purporting to provide an update to general readers on the state of research in physics!! Needless to say I was not convinced and was chuckling - for the wrong reasons -- as I worked through the end of the book. This appears to be a common problem in big reach synthesis boos -- Ian Morris' book on why the West rules comes to mind, although the latter is a much better book overall.5) By the end of the book, I was wondering if there were particular reasons why Kaku appeared to have ""lost it"" when he just should have stopped writing fifty pages sooner.6) Overall, I don't regret reading it. I just regret finishing it."
205,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12945730-jack-ferreira,3,"I like Michio Kaku, he seems like a pretty cool, down to earth guy. I'll get some criticism out of the way, because overall I did enjoy the book.I have seen interviews and tv shows he's been in and though I do like him sometimes his atitude bothers me for some reason. I can't quite put my finger on it, maybe it has something to do with this slightly over-pandering way of explaining things. It looks like he thinks the only way his readers will understand what he's saying is by constantly referencing Star Treck, Star Wars and other products of science fiction which really isn't needed. I understood him perfectly well when he talked about portable MRI machines and DNA chips before he felt the need to display a picture of a Star Treck ""tricorder"" (just in case we couldn't grasp the idea by ourselves). I thought these constant references were a bit odd because this isn't a hard book to comprehend. It's not necessarily insulting but at the same time it feels a little condescending. This is especialy present in the final chapter (""A Day in a Life in 2100""). It was completely unecessary and cringeworthy, he may be a great theoretical physicist but he is not a great writer (outside of non-fiction, at least). That said, I learnt a lot from this book. I will probably forget most of it, I admit, but it made me feel up to date on our current technological advancements. I liked the way he split up each chapter, making it nicely organized and easy to navigate through. It was great reading about realistic predictions for the future of computers, AI, energy, nanotechnology and space travel. The future of wealth was also discussed which took me by surprise and I sincerely apreciated it, since it really is something important to consider.As he talks about the future of humanity he introduces some very interesting concepts. It leaves me excited for things to come and curious of how it will change our way of life.Obviously, we should all take these predictions with a grain of salt. I'm sure Michio Kaku has more or less figured out the near future, but up to the year 2100 he gets quite vague. Some people see it as a bad thing, but I don't blame him. Any book we read, from an author who goes out of his areas of expertise must not be taken for granted. I have seen people comment on misuse of terminology and a lot of non consideration for alternate scenarios. This is why I love people like Richard Dawkins, who write books within their fields and whose content I absolutely trust.It's a nice book if you don't look upon it as a definitive guide to the future.I am now in the mood for some science fiction though."
206,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53461468-rasty,5,"Its amazing when you first read that book , it's not about how science developed or anything like that , but its about how science will develop and will shape our destiny or thoughts to our whole world , michio kaku one of my favorite writers about science , and that was amazing from him :)"
207,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5526063-mary-jean-harris,3,"This was quite a good book with lots of fascinating predictions for the future, as well as a survey of technologies currently being developed. I'd give it 3.5 stars (you need 1/2 stars, Goodreads!). Michio Kaku writes about the places he's visited, mostly research labs, that are working on new technologies, including bioengineering, nanotechnology, quantum computers, robotics, gene therapy, self-driving cars, space travel, and space elevators. Kaku's enthusiasm for these future changes is undying throughout the book, and it makes an enjoyable read. I can't agree with him that all this will result in positive change for the future though, especially as technology becomes more invasive and embedded into our lives, drawing us even further apart from the natural world as well as opening up the possibility for people (and governments and organizations) to control us in this system. It sounds eerily similar to the matrix, but Kaku doesn't seem overly concerned about any of these issues.Additionally, Kaku unfortunately falls into the trap of global warming hysteria: he takes it for granted that humanity is causing a climate crisis, a position that is highly contented and strewn with propaganda. As a scientist analysing a complicated issue, Kaku does not apply his own standards of rational inquiry to this issue and instead accepts the politically correct position that, even if he dug a little deep into the issue before writing the book, he would realize is not supported by many climate scientists.Also, although I liked the last chapter about ""a day in the life in 2100"" overall, it was really corny and, for some reason, the main guy we're following works at an office with only men...do no females work in the industry?. Also, this online dating stuff has become prevalent and people just do it naturally, something I find really creepy.But despite these problems with the book, it was a great read overall and definitely accessible to the general public."
208,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4617137-sangita-takhur,4,"To me the big question is: how fast will our technology progress in the coming years? I know it is very difficult to give a solid logical answer to this question. I liked the book but I do not agree with Kaku on many points. I think Kaku used almost a linear model for predicting the future. I think we need more imaginative power for predicting the future. Like Kaku I too believe that, gene technology, computers, artificial intelligence and robots will advance rapidly. The book is composed of the following nine chapters: 1. Future of the Computer: Mind over Matter, 2. Future of AI: Rise of the Machines, 3. Future of Medicine: Perfection and Beyond, 4. Nanotechnology: Everything from Nothing?, 5. Future of Energy: Energy from the Stars, 6. Future of Space Travel: To the Stars, 7. Future of Wealth, 8. Future of Humanity: Planetary Civilization, and 9. A Day in the Life in 2100. Kaku's approach is excellent, as if he is talking to a lay person, but he writes with a simple eloquence that makes these complex concepts accessible to the non-Physicist mind.Michio is too good in predicting the limitations of the technologies. One may argue that Michio's idea of robots and computers is similar to the AI from the movies in the 1990s, but we have to think year 2020 much brighter. Development on medicine, synthetic biology and nanotechnology is almost ignored. I was expecting more about quantum biology but that too is missing. But overall I liked the book. The book is good enough to stimulate our imagination."
209,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/153756-jeffrey,4,"A fascinating look at how the world might change in the future, while also giving some good basic information on various subjects - for example, Kaku breaks down how gene therapy works, and also what it could lead to. Kaku's style of writing is informative and accessible, and the only time I found myself starting to lose focus was during the fictional narrative covering a typical day in 2100. In a way, that section suffers from a lack of imagination in what people would be like, despite having well thought out possibilities for technology; it seems more like an example of what someone from today would act like if we had all of that technology today. Still, that got me thinking about things... like, one hundred years ago, someone wouldn't have even been able to conceive of the internet, but even if they could imagine it, they probably wouldn't be able to foresee the rise of things like social media, youtube, etc. and how those things are changing the way humanity deals with privacy and public appearance.Kaku's pretty optimistic about the future (he even only mentions the idea of humanity going extinct one time), so this book is at times almost like a really well researched version of the cliched utopian future. Fortunately the book's foundation is in science and balances that vision with various realistic possibilities, and in any case it's a great source of basic information related to physics for the layperson."
210,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17648164-umair-khan,4,"What is the future going to be like? Physics of the Future tries to answer this question in an engaging, thought provoking and visionary account of the possibilities that, according to the author, Michio Kaku, will be transformed into reality in the coming decades. The book will not be a disappointment to fans of Kaku and can be considered as a sequel to his previous work, Visions, but with a more expansive view.Physics outlines four fundamental forces of nature: gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force and strong nuclear force. Kaku is of the opinion that each time a force of nature is understood by scientists and harnessed by engineers it sets in motion a chain reaction of novel and unique technologies determining the course of human development. In Physics, Kaku interviews more than 300 scientists and inventors who are working day and night to push the boundaries of science and technology. Essentially, the theme of the book is similar to the works of futurists like Ray Kurzweil, however, the treatment of the topic is more vivid and easier to understand.Kaku seems to be following the footsteps of visionary futurists like Leonardo da Vinci and Jules Verne. He explores the impact of physics on the areas of computer science, artificial intelligence, medicine, nanotechnology, alternative energy and space travel. Kaku scientifically predicts what new technologies will enter in the following decades, what will be achieved by the mid-21st century, and finally what we will accomplish by the end of it.The narrative, introducing prospects of controlling computers through the human mind, resurrecting extinct animals, travelling to other planets and genetically enhancing our disease resistance, is exciting to read. The author claims that we might even be able to bring back the Neanderthal. However, he pinpoints the ethical dilemmas associated with such achievements by quoting Richard Klein, an anthropologist at Stanford: “Are you going to put the Neanderthals in a zoo or in Harvard?”In the last chapter, Kaku introduces the reader to an imaginary character living in the 22nd century. Biologically, he is in his 70s but the age of his organs is mid-30s. He rides a self-driven car. Nano-bots monitor the crucial indicators of his health while roaming in his bloodstream. What distinguishes this book from works of science fiction is that every prediction in the book is based on research and supported by prototypes being developed across the globe.Kaku also analyses the economic and social history of our civilisation and explains that new technologies are the engines of both scientific and social change. He rightly points out that the economic recessions of the 1850s, 1920s and 2008 were due to the “speculative fever” created around specific sectors: the railroad, automotive stocks and real estate, respectively.He warns that when the British Empire was shifting its focus from scientific innovation to more mundane matters of power-play, the US was emerging as a leader in research and advancement of knowledge in all fields. However, if the majority of the US talent is going into the investment sector and managing the finances of others, in which region will the most brilliant minds pursue the cause of innovation and exploring the truth?Kaku further chalks out the ranking of civilisations which was first introduced in 1964 by Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev — on the basis of the energy they consume. This ranking was mainly proposed to identify the powers of extra terrestrial intelligent civilisations and classify them into three types. Type I consumes planetary sources of energy, mainly sunlight that falls on their planet; Type II consumes all the energy produced by their sun, while Type III consumes the energy produced by all the stars of their galaxy. Our current status is perhaps that of a Type 0 since we consume the energy of dead plants (oil and coal). Kaku estimates that given the economic growth rate we will be able to achieve the status of a Type I civilisation by the end of the century.Physics of the Future not only tells us what is probable and possible in the future, it also gives researchers and inventors a timescale to measure their successes against. Moreover, it makes the reader feel excited about the times we are living in, when we can expect ‘miracles’ to happen in our lifetimes. Kaku points out that “By 2100, our destiny is to become like the gods we once worshipped and feared.”SOURCE: http://www.dawn.com/news/634292/non-f..."
211,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3352854-david-skip-everling,2,"I'm not sure about anybody's ability to predict a century into the future (especially if you give credence to the idea of accelerating returns in technology), but I was willing to give this book a shot after hearing Michio Kaku in interviews. In particular he piqued my curiosity with the claim that all the ideas in the book are grounded on currently existing prototypes or established scientific theory.Now after having read it, I think Michio is only giving a survey of some select topics, and the only ones that I think he handled well were the ones most closely linked to physics (e.g. space travel, nanotechnology & quantum behavior, global power generation). The other fields he dives into, particularly his analysis and extrapolation of consumer technologies, were disappointingly off target or lacking in proper depth.The book is occasionally so superficial in its treatment of some prototyped technologies that it reads somewhat like painfully outdated sci-fi from Michio's childhood in the 50's. The book is written to be highly accessible, but he does uninformed readers a disservice by giving equal weight to illogical and 'improbable but not impossible' possibilities. My biggest problem with his predictions are that they center on only a set of technologies that Kaku has experience with, extrapolated all the way out to 2100 without much consideration of how all the unmentioned possibilities will change his visions for the future.As an example, Michio doesn't do the best job keeping our present circumstances and his far future predictions from mixing anachronistically: e.g. the frequently repeated ""...when we carry around our own genomes on a CD-ROM"" for a ""2030-2070"" range prediction. I worry that Michio Kaku is just paraphrasing some of the ideas out there without really thinking about them any more critically, like a mediocre science journalist or sci-fi writer. Again this could be an artifact of his intentionally writing this book to be broadly accessible, but I don't think he found the right balance.The best parts of the book are in the second half, particularly his chapters on The Future of: Energy, Space Travel, Wealth, and Humanity (respectively) and I did enjoy most of this material despite a scattering of the same problems mentioned above. Sadly, I think Michio Kaku completely botched his concluding chapter, ""A Day in the Life in 2100"", and I think the preceding Future of Humanity chapter would have been a much stronger ending. The ""Day in the Life"" conclusion is silly speculative fiction and the best (worst?) example in the entire book of his anachronistic and muddled sci-fi visions. Michio Kaku is great when talking about physics and large scale trends closely linked to humanity's knowledge of physics, but judging from this book alone he doesn't put together upcoming technologies into realistic or compelling future scenarios very well at all, ending up with an incomplete picture somewhere in the uncomfortable border between imaginative thinking and unwarranted speculation."
212,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,4,"This is a fascinating survey of what's actually happening in the cutting edge of science and technology. He walks through computers and vehicles and energy and space exploration and even culture. For each area he discussed deeply what's happening now, then gives thoughtful guesses to what will develop in early 21st century, mid-century, and late-century. His understanding of science is broad AND deep. His vision of the future of science is compelling. Some highlights: Tiny computer chips will be embedded in everything--almost literally--and we'll live in a cloud of data that's ridiculous. Robots will outnumber humans--but they won't be able to do anything but the physical tasks we program them to do (including driving our cars and planes). Magnetism will finally be mastered and we'll run our world on magnetic power rather than electric power. And by the end of the century remote control robots will be building a moon base for us to continue looking into the stars. However, I docked him a star because he displays a naive understanding of culture and history. He makes sweeping mistakes like seeing being religious as the enemy of science when history actually shows that many of the greatest science cultures were so precisely because of their religious beliefs, or his easy dismissal of cultural conflicts in the new world and his idea that once food and shelter are universal then haves and have nots won't be a real issue. So read this for the tech ideas and endure his comments about becoming like the gods of old and reaching cultural utopia. "
213,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"Michio Kaku is a great science writer (as well as being a physics professor), but futurology is a difficult subject to make interesting and all too often what you get is lists of 'in the future you will have an X that will do Y,' which gets dull fairly quickly.Where Kaku's approach is good (which is to base his ideas on physics) is in the future of energy. His chapter on space exploration is good too - he is a great enthusiast for this, and that comes across strongly here. The only proviso is that the main controlling factor on space exploration is not science but politics. A man wasn't put on the moon for science, but to put the Russians in their place. We haven't done much manned exploration since for the same reason. It's too expensive for science to control things.To be honest I was even less convinced about the consumer technology ideas. If space exploration is driven by politics, consumer purchases are driven by the market. Yes, the science & technology has to be able to deliver (so you couldn't have an iPhone 10 years ago), but it doesn't decide what will and won't become popular.The book finishes with a chapter on the way the world will be a single civilization (even if nations still exist in a weakened form) by the end of the century. This seemed the least science-supported speculation. If anything we seem to be fragmenting more.All in all, a good try - but futurology remains closer to fiction than popular science."

Physics Of The Impossible was an amazing book and this one blows it out of the water. I can't determine if I am so fond of it because of how advanced our technology will be in the near future or if I am truly fond of his writing. I know one thing for sure, some of the different advancements in technology is going to change the way we live life in way too many ways. What I mean by that is the advancement Kaku covers isn't technology like a new version of an XBOX or something of that sort. Michio Kaku covers advancement in technology like the worlds biggest atom smasher in Switzerland under a mountain, circling a mile exactly. This atom smasher is one of the biggest advancements in our technology opening doors to creating so much energy that we will be able to travel through space at a speed close to the speed of light. That's only the example I remembered best but there are so many throughout this book it excites you for our future. Kind of. "

Although, for someone who may have never read ""Visions"" or ""Physics of the Impossible"" (which too I had read in 2011-12), I strongly feel that ""Physics of the Future"" can tend to become very interesting if one likes to ponder on how technological the world is going to get within the next century, and how far will it be feasible to apply and integrate it within our daily lives.A Good Book, but a vast majority was already included amongst the first two of his books on the same genre. The chapter on the Future of Wealth, was kind of new though!A 3-star because the content was not new for me; otherwise I would rate it with a 4-star."

In fact, the action of the first film is kicked off by a message recorded in 3D by Princess Leia and conveyed by the robot...""

I understand that for those who know a lot about physics and technology, it may be to easy, but for such people as I am, it was great. Well, I didn't like everything what I read (especially, the beginning) but later it got much better.

224,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27777097-thomas-jacob-jr,3,"An enjoyable, cursory overview of some of the most exciting technological achievements we may expect mankind to engage with over the next century. I came across Michio Kaku, as I am sure many others have, by watching an interview on television a few years ago, and I was struck by his loquaciousness and intelligence. Describing contemporary scientific concepts, especially quantum physics, in a way that a layman can understand is no small feat. In Physics of the Future, Kaku focuses on several industries (private space exploration, computer technology, medicine, and others) and tries to predict what respective advances we may expect by 2100. Oftentimes he uses examples from popular science fiction, specifically Star Trek, as a frame of reference. This book definitely falls into the 'pop science' category, with only brief asides into more technical and mathematical information. Any fans of popular science fiction work in film, television, or literature will be already be aware of many of the concepts here, and truthfully, any one of them could easily fill an entire book by itself (the 'recommended reading' section at the end is a goldmine for further exploration). Kaku sometimes makes sweeping generalizations without going into further detail that may seem presumptuous, but it is usually in attempt to keep the pace light. Also, since this was written in 2011, some sections appear a little dated even only six years later (an entire section on private space exploration, for example, doesn't mention either Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos, two of the forerunners in this field). Recommended for those looking for a brief overview of some of the exciting advances in technology that we can expect to look forward to over the course of our lifetime. For those looking for a deeper dive into any of the aforementioned subjects, the dozens of recommended works at the end should serve as an excellent primer. "
225,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,4,"Peering into the future of mankind and predicting what lies in store for us a few decades from now, has always been a dicey endeavour. In general, predictions pertaining to unchecked population growth, resultant famines, wars over access to resources, gloomy prospects for the future of developing nations etc have mostly proven to be unnecessary alarms rather than reality. A few major historical instances come to mind. Rev. Thomas Malthus in the late 18th century, Dr. Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University in the 1960s, and MIT's Club of Rome report in the 1970s were famous for damning our future, particularly that of India and China due to their large populations. We find that both India and China have done pretty well in the forty years since. On the other hand, predictions about the end of slavery, end of European colonialism, an era of less work and more leisure have all come true. It seems as though we tend to take both a gloomy and hopeful view of mankind and misjudge its potential for making correctives when it comes to how human beings, our societies, governments and institutions would behave in future under changing conditions.In contrast, predictions regarding scientific and technological advances in the fields of medicine, computers, biology, astronomy etc have more frequently proven to materialize successfully, at times sooner than expected. The Moore's Law comes to mind immediately. This book itself shows how accurately Jules Verne, in the mid 1800s, predicted life in Paris in the 1960s as consisting of skyscrapers, air-conditioning, TV, elevators, high-speed trains and fax machines. It seems as if we have a better grasp of machines and man's interactions with them and the development of this man-machine future. This book by theoretical Physicist Michio Kaku, crystal-gazes into this future as led by the advance of science and technology. Even if one does not accept all the projections, we end up learning a lot on what stunning possibilities are out there as we live out this century.The book is organized on what we can expect in the near term (by 2030), the mid term (2030-2070) and the long term (2070-2100). The future is explored through the domains of Computers, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Medicine, Nanotechnology, Energy and Space Travel. But it is not just speculation from a Theoretical Physicist. The author had discussed with hundreds of scientists who actually work today on these ideas and had compiled out of this interaction, what is possible in these three time periods. The presentation and language in the book is simple and accessible even to the average non-science minded reader and that, in my view, is a great positive about the book. I shall outline here some of the future products and possibilities given by Dr.Kaku which grabbed my mind:MRI machines which are just a foot long, looking like cell phones which can be passed over the human body and detect cancer (2030)Computers which scan fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) patterns in the brain and decipher a person's stream of consciousness and thereby detect what he/she is thinking (2070-2100)Computers being able to reconstruct a person's facial features given a strand of DNA from that person'e hair or bloodTissue engineering to manufacture a whole body part by extracting a few cells from the bodyResurrection of extinct life forms like the Mammoth or the NeanderthalNano-particles which enter and kill only cancer cells and leave healthy tissue untouchedchanging one shape to another at the push of a button, just like the T-1000 in 'Terminator-2'Molecular Replicators, capable of creating almost anything we want, the same way that nature can “take hamburgers and vegetables and turn them into a baby.”Fusion plants dotting the countryside by mid centuryLanding on an asteroid or on a moon of planet Mars, Space ElevatorsThe final couple of chapters deal with the future of humanity, planetary civilizations and how life would look in 2100. One can feel the child-like enthusiasm of Dr.Kaku in writing about all these possibilities and it makes the book enjoyable reading. He uses references to popular sci-fi movies from Hollywood to illustrate many of the ideas. In fact, as I read the book, I developed a greater respect for movie makers like that of the Terminator, Matrix, Star Wars, Avatar and so on.We have heard recently of anxieties being expressed about Artificial Intelligence and its destructive potential by luminaries like Bill Gates and Elon Musk. The eminent futurist, Ray Kurzweil has suggested in his work 'The Singularity is Near' that by 2045, a $1000 computer would be a billion times more intelligent than all humans combined and hence creating an uncontrolled runaway singularity. But others like Douglas Hofstadter and Mitch Kapor have dismissed these notions. This book discusses this topic substantially and believes that mankind will develop 'friendly AI' and use it to enhance itself rather than letting itself be ruled by mean-minded robots. Dr.Kaku shows six reasons why there are major roadblocks to such a singularity.On the negative side, just as in other books on the future, this one also has its tiresome speculation on the 'sick men of Asia'. Dr.Kaku quotes a report by Peter Schwartz of the Global Business Network on the dire future that is likely in the demographic nightmare of South Asia. Sea level rise due to Global warming in the latter half of this century could cause massive flooding and chaos, resulting in millions of refugees across the borders of Bangladesh into India. Governments could lose all authority and collapse, resulting in nightmarish looting and rioting. Rising tensions and chaos and inability to control may result in nations resorting to nuclear weapons!It is only scientists who tell us that Human societies, weather and climate are non-linear systems and even a very small change could have a massive effect, called the butterfly effect, making it difficult to predict the long-term futures. Then, I don't see how the author is so sure of destructive global warming in the future and also the consequent behavior of south Asians. In spite of being repeatedly wrong, futurists cannot seem to resist making dire predictions for the future of nations with large populations.The book is enjoyable reading and educative as well. I strongly recommend reading it. Even though Physics plays an important role in all the science that is discussed in the book, I am unsure of whether 'Physics of the Future' is the most meaningful title for the book. When I picked up the book initially, I thought it would be a book on String Theory."
226,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645507-jason-schneeberger,5,"I don't usually do book reviews this long anymore, but this one that I won't soon forget. If ever. Based off of the known laws of nature, author and world renowned theoretical physicist Michio Kaku met with, and interviewed, 300 of the leading scientists in the world about what our world will be like in the year 2100 through the ever increasing advancements of technology. This book lays out the most likely scenario of computers, AI, medicine, nanotechnology, energy, space travel and wealth from those interviews and how they will shape the world by the year 2100.Oh what a fantastic and thought provoking book this was! It's great to read a book about the future that isn't nihilistic, apocalyptic and negative, but rather hopeful and full of wonder! Sure, the very real threats of chaos, nuclear war, global warming etc are addressed in this book, but in ways that give rise to ways around such problems instead of weakly giving into them.I'm always wondering why every sci-fi movie based in the future has to be apocalyptic, or negative about where the world is going? It's easy to see the bad decisions we are making as humans that drive this thinking and make it seem like a sure reality to come, but where are the optimistic stories? Where are the stories that show us prospering and thriving as a world in the future? Those ideas and thoughts are in this book! Hopefully some good screenwriters and filmmakers will get inspired and make a movie based off the ideas in this book. I want to see it! Almost all of us alive now will not get to experience the world in the year 2100. Not unless of course the age reversal science described in the book becomes a reality (and it seems as though it's a very real possibility in the second half of this century), but this book brings much to the imagination of looking out a window, into the world at the dawn of the 22nd century. I can't say think of anything bad to say about this one. I absolutely loved everything about it. BUY IT!"
227,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Informed speculations engagingly presentedIt’s easy to see that Professor Kaku had a lot of fun writing this book since more than anything (at least for this reader) this book was a pleasure to read.Typically Kaku begins each chapter with some reference to the ancient gods or some other form of mythology or folklore, mainly for contrast or to highlight human yearnings that are being fulfilled today or may be fulfilled in the near future. He then mixes in some science fiction movies, stories or novels that he likes or finds instructive (or not). He adds some personal research and experiences with some of the great minds of our time as he makes his predictions, speculations and guesses on where we are going and when we are going to get there. Partly because of his celebrity and partly because of his wide-ranging knowledge and sharp intelligence (not to mention his charm) Kaku is able to talk with Nobel Prize winners and other cutting edge scientists and engineers all over the world the way most people talk to their neighbors. Areas of interest, each with its own chapter are computers, artificial intelligence, medicine, nanotechnology, energy, space travel, wealth (i.e., economics), and what life will be like in the future on a day-to-day basis. Each chapter gives Kaku’s speculations for the “Near Future (Present to 2030),” “Midcentury (2030 to 2070),” and the “Far Future (2070 to 2100).”I’m going to try to NOT second guess Kaku but I do want to focus on a few areas of personal interest and add a comment or two. “It is a law of evolution that fitter species arise to displace unfit species; and perhaps humans will be lost in the shuffle, eventually winding up in zoos where our robotic creations come to stare at us…Perhaps that is our role in history, to give birth to our evolutionary successors.” (p. 100)I think this is likely, especially if you add our genetically engineered successors. If so we can then think of ourselves as the “intelligent designers” of the demigods to come.Kaku weighs in on the possibility of our robotic creations becoming more intelligent than humans. (Seems very likely.) He speculates on robots producing “ever-smarter” robots that might “devour the resources of the planet in their insatiable quest to become ever more intelligent.” (p. 101) This can be seen as a near corollary of the idea that robots will become our masters and take over the planet. Since robots can only do what is programmed into them, these ideas depend on poor or malicious programming. (Beware the black hats of the future!)On page 116 Kaku points out that “there is no universally accepted definition of ‘smart.’” He doesn’t elaborate but I want to say that the unstated question is “smart for what”? Is the goal, e.g., happiness or world domination? A different kind of smarts might be required in each case.In talking about what jobs will still be available for humans in the midcentury future, Kaku makes the excellent point that those jobs will require “nonrepetitive work that requires pattern recognition.” (p. 305) He includes garbage collectors, police officers, construction workers, gardeners, and plumbers. However where I live as soon as they get a robot to drive the truck garbage collection will be a completely automated task. We have plastic containers set out on the street which are picked up and emptied by a mechanical arm from the truck. (Yes, the future is now.)In Chapter 8 “Future of Humanity” Kaku presents Nikolai Kardashev’s Type I, II, and III Civilizations based on energy consumption. (A Type II civilization, for example, consumes all the energy from their sun.) What I found interesting is Kaku’s statement that we “are leading to a single point: the creation of a planetary civilization.” (p. 327) I think the term “planetary civilization” is what we need to replace the currently (in some quarters) offensive term, “world government.”Kaku makes the sharp point that movies with “cross-cultural themes…packed with internationally recognized celebrities, are big money makers for Hollywood.” He sees this as “evidence of an emerging planetary culture.” (p. 334) He adds on the next page that “Local cultures will continue to survive, coexisting side by side with the larger global culture.”Some of Kaku’s dreams (perhaps) are room temperature super conductors and space elevators, to name just two that are highly speculative but would be amazing if realized.In the chapter on artificial intelligence, Kaku gives his three-pointed definition of consciousness. (Actually with becoming modesty he writes, “…if I were to venture a guess.”) In my book “The World Is Not as We Think It Is” I also give a three-pointed definition:“One: awareness of the world (including awareness of our self and our processes, that is, self-awareness).Two: self-identity. Notice that awareness of self is different from this identification with self.Three: experience or sensation, the feelings we get when we experience the world. This is sometimes called “phenomenal consciousness.” An example would be the subjective experience of the color red, or the taste of a strawberry.” (p. 82)Here is Kaku’s delineation from page 97:“1. sensing and recognizing the environment2. self-awareness3. planning for the future by setting goals and plans, that is, simulating the future and plotting strategy.”The slight differences are instructive. He leaves out self-identification, perhaps rightly so; and I leave out planning for the future. Also I presume that Kaku includes self-awareness in his first component. Personally I would include planning for the future in my first component, “awareness of the world” as well; however to emphasize “simulating the future” is a fine thing to do since humans are on another level in the animal kingdom when it comes to imagining what might happen.I should mention that in writing this book Kaku did not just tune into the zeitgeist but actually read prognosticators from the past. Two who did well were Benjamin Franklin and the Marquis de Condorcet. Since Kaku’s predictions are mostly favorable for humans, I hope his predictions do as well. --Dennis Littrell, author of “Hard Science and the Unknowable”"
228,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7227342-richard,3,"Michio Kaku's book, Physics of the Future, concludes with a comprehensive prediction of what life will like in 2100 as the subtitle indicates. The majority of the book is made up of predictions about how technology will evolve in the intervening years.The book was written in 2011, so some its contents are already dated. Interestingly, certain predictions about the near future have already come to pass. Other predictions appear to be a little delayed. To be clear, Mr. Kaku is very humble in the introduction about the ability to predict the future. One of the concrete statements he makes about the future is the idea there is a great deal to be optimistic about. He examines individuals in the past who were pessimistic about the development of technology, and he shows how wrong these individuals proved to be in time. For this reason, I think he is correct to say the future belongs to the optimists.I enjoyed the book; however, I don't think it is worth more than 3 stars. It has some important ideas, but the audience is narrow to a certain extant. It seems to offer inspiration to the future scientists who will make these breakthroughs; however, it isn't as relevant to the average reader. We will eventually see the changes predicted, but they are mostly decades away. "

I promise to raise my rating to 5 starts in 2100 if his predictions are correct. That is because according to Michio Kaku medicine will evolve greatly allowing people to live a lot longer than now. Not that I don't plan on living for 113 years as it is.The reader will find insights about the future of computers and AI, medicine and nanotechnology, space travel and energy. Kaku also takes on the nature of humanity as a whole in the next 100 years.And bear in mind these are not the predictions of Nostradamus, Michi Kaku knows first hand what he writes about."

232,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1080484-teji,4,"The author’s passion for both physics and science-fiction is evident throughout this piece of speculative non-fiction. The work explores several areas of emerging technology and applied science, not just quantum physics. As the author notes, his predictions are “reasoned estimates of when the prototype technologies of today will finally reach maturity”. His extrapolation of what he thinks is likely to occur in the near (2010-2030), mid (2030-20700, and far (2070-2100) future, are intriguing and thought provoking. The organization is very repetitive-- almost as if it were written as a series of articles that were later post-edited into a book format (although I don't think that is the case). Also, the writing is a little dry in places-- but not intolerably so. Additionally, when speaking of the future, the author tends to geek out and engage in overwrought, almost giddy, statements about the “godlike” powers technology will grant humans within the next century. These flaws aside, overall, the writing is coherent and accessible. It will be interesting to see how well his forecasts for the next couple of decades hold-up.Quotes(view spoiler)[[In his novel, Paris in the Twentieth Century, written in 1863, Jules Verne] “predicted that Paris in 1960 would have glass skyscrapers, air conditioning, TV, elevators, high-speed trains, gasoline-powered automobiles, fax machines, and even something resembling the Internet…just a few years later he made another spectacular prediction. In 1865, he wrote From the Earth to the Moon, in which he predicted the details of the mission that sent our astronauts to the moon…He accurately predicted the size of the space capsule to within a few percent, the location of the launch site in Florida…the weightlessness that the astronauts would experience, and the final splashdown in the ocean…How was Jules Verne able to predict 100 years into the future with such breathtaking accuracy? His biographers have noted that, although Verne was not a scientist himself he constantly sought out scientists…He amassed a vast archive summarizing the great scientific discoveries of his time. Verne, more than others, realized that science was the engine shaking the foundations of civilization, propelling it into a new century with unexpected marvels and miracles.” -Introduction“Another great prophet of technology was Leonardo da Vinci, painter, thinker, and visionary…Like Jules Verne, Leonardo was able to get profound insights into the future by consulting a handful of forward-thinking individuals of his time…In addition, Leonardo was always experimenting, building, and sketching models, a key attribute of anyone who wants to translate thinking into reality.” -Introduction“As William Gibson…once said, ‘The future is already here. It’s just unevenly distributed.” -Introduction“Predictions for the future, with a few exceptions, have always underestimated the pace of technological progress.” -IntroductionThere are four fundamental forces in nature that drive the entire universe: gravity (unlocking the force of gravity helped to pave the way for the Industrial Revolution and the introduction of steam power, especially the locomotive), electromagnetic force (this unleashed the electronic revolution that has created a bounty of scientific wonders), and the two nuclear forces: the weak and strong forces. “When Einstein wrote down e=mc^2 and when the atom was split in the 1930s, scientists for the first time began to understand the forces that light up the heavens…the secret behind the stars…it also held out the promise that one day we would be able to harness this power on the earth”… quantum theory “has given us the transistor, the laser, and the digital resolution that is the driving force behind modern society. -Introduction“Exponential growth is often hard to grasp, since our minds think linearly. It is so gradual that you sometimes cannot experience the change at all. But over decades, it can completely alter everything around us. According to Moore's law, every Christmas your new computer games are almost twice as powerful (in terms of the number of transistors) as those from the previous year. Furthermore, as the years pass, this incremental gain becomes monumental. For example, when you receive a birthday card in the mail, it often has a chip that sings ‘Happy Birthday’ to you. Remarkably, that chip has more computer power than all the Allied forces of 1945. Hitler, Churchill, or Roosevelt might have killed to get that chip…Today, your cell phone has more computer power than all of NASA back in 1969, when it placed two astronauts on the moon…” Ch1“Today, when we enter a room, we automatically look for the light switch since we assume that the walls are electrified. In the future, the first thing we will do on entering a room…is to assume the room is intelligent…Around 2020, the price of a chip may also drop to about a penny…then we will have millions of chips distributed everywhere in our environment, silently carrying out our orders.” -Ch1“One reason why Moore's law has relentlessly increased the power of chips is because UV light can be tuned so that its wavelength is smaller and smaller, making it possible to etch increasingly tiny transistors onto silicon wafers. Since UV light has a wavelength as small as 10 nanometers, this means that the smallest transistor that you can etch is thirty atoms across…But this process cannot go on forever…You can even calculate roughly when Moore’s law will finally collapse: when you finally hit transistors the size of individual atoms… According to the laws of physics, eventually the Age of Silicon will come to a close, as we enter the Post-Silicon Era. Transistors will be so small that quantum theory or atomic physics takes over and electrons leak out of the wires…At that point, according to the laws of physics, the quantum theory takes over. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that you cannot know both the position and the velocity of any particle…at the atomic level you simply cannot know where the electron is, so it can never be confined precisely in an ultrathin wire or layer and it necessarily leaks out, causing the circuit to short-circuit.” Ch1“However, scans of the human brain clearly show that thinking is spread out over large parts of the brain...Digital computers can calculate at nearly the speed of light. he human brain, by contrast, is incredibly slow. Nerve impulses travel at an excruciatingly slow pace of about 200 miles per hour. But the brain more than makes up for this because it is massively parallel… In a race, a superfast single processor is left in the dust by a superslow parallel processor.” Ch2“While hardware had grown [exponentially] by the ability to etch smaller and smaller transistors onto a wafer, software is totally different; it requires a human to sit down with a pencil and paper to write code. That is the bottleneck: the human. Software, like all human creative activity, progresses in fits and starts, with brilliant insights and long stretches of drudgery and stagnation.” Ch2“…genetic analysis shows that aging is concentrated in the ""engine"" of the cell, the mitochondria, or the cell’s power plant. This has allowed scientists to…look for ways to accelerate the gene repair process inside the mitochondria to reverse the effects of aging.” Ch3“Normally, we don’t see quantum forces at work in everyday life. But quantum forces are everywhere…if we are largely empty, then why can’t we walk through walls?...The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons can exit in the same quantum state. Hence, when two nearly identical electrons get too close, they repel each other. This is the reason objects appear to be solid, which is an illusion…When we sit on a chair...we are hovering above the chair, floating less than a nanometer above it, repelled by the chair’s electrical and quantum forces.” Ch4“The quantum theory has only one thing going for it: it is correct. Its accuracy has been measured to one part in ten billion, making it the most successful physical theory of all time.” Ch4“Science and technology are the engines of prosperity…” Ch7“The combination of changing social conditions and the mastery of the four forces propelled Europe to the forefront of nations. But technologies are dynamic, changing all the time. They are born, evolve, and rise and fall…technologies obey certain laws of evolution. Mass technologies usually evolve in four basic stages…In stage I, the products of technology are so precious that they are closely guarded. Paper, when it was invented in the form of papyrus by the ancient Egyptians…was so precious that one papyrus scroll was closely guarded by scores of priests…Paper entered stage II around 1450, when Gutenberg invented the movable type…one person could possess one book containing the knowledge of hundreds of scrolls. Before Gutenberg, there were only 30,000 books in all Europe. By 1500, there were 9 million books…By around 1930, paper hit stage III, when the cost fell to a penny a sheet. This made possible the personal library, where one person could possess hundreds of books. Paper became an ordinary commodity…Paper is everywhere and nowhere, invisible and ubiquitous. Now we are in stage IV, where paper is a fashion statement. We decorate our world with paper of all colors, shapes, and sizes. The largest source of urban waste is paper. So paper evolved from being a closely guarded commodity to being waste.” Running water, electricity, and computer have followed the same pattern. Ch7“But as technologies evolve, they create abrupt changes in the economy that sometimes lead to social dislocations. In any revolution, there are winners and losers…What jobs will flourish by midcentury? How will the evolution of technology change the way we work? We can partially determine the answer by asking a simple question: What are the limitations of robots? As we have seen, there are at least two basic stumbling blocks to artificial intelligence: pattern recognition and common sense. Therefore, the jobs that will survive in the future are…ones that require these two abilities.” Ch7“Developing nations may be able to take advantage of the information revolution. They can, in principle, leapfrog past the developed nations in many areas. In the developed world, telephone companies had to tediously wire up every home or farm at great cost. But a developing nation does not have to wire up its country, since cell phone technology can excel in rural areas without any roads or infrastructure. Also, developing nations have the advantage that they do not have to rebuild an aging infrastructure…” Ch7“…the Unites States has maintained its dominance in science and technology in spite of the fact that U.S. students often score dead last when it comes to essential subjects like science and math…(It should also be pointed out that this ranking corresponds roughly to the number of days that students were in school. China, which ranked number 1, averaged 251 days of instruction per year, while the United States averaged only 178 days per year.) It seems like a mystery that, despite these awful numbers, the United States continues to do well internationally in science and technology, until you realize that much of the U.S science [talent] comes from overseas. The United States has a secret weapon, the H1B visa…But the H1B visa is only a stopgap measure. The United States cannot continue to live off foreign scientists, many of whom are beginning to return to China and India as their economies improve…The United States will eventually have to overhaul its archaic, sclerotic education system. At present, poorly prepared high school students flood the job market and universities…Employers continually bemoan the fact that they have to take one year to train their new hires to bring them up to speed. And the universities are burdened by having to create new layers of remedial courses to compensate for the poor high school education system…” Ch7“When physicists try to analyze civilizations, we rank them on the basis of the energy they consume. This ranking was first introduced in 1964 by Russian astrophysicists Nikolai Kardashev…he proposed three theoretical types: A Type I civilization is planetary, consuming the sliver of sunlight that falls on their planet, or about 10^17 watts. A Type II civilization is stellar, consuming all the energy that their sun emits, or 10^27 watts. A Type III civilization is galactic, consuming the energy of billions of stars, or about 10^37 watts…Each type is separated by a factor of 10 billion: a Type III civilization consumes 10 billion times more energy than at Type II civilization…which in turn consumes 10 billion times more energy than a Type I civilization. According to the classification, our present-day civilization is Type 0. We don’t even rate on this scale, since we get our energy from dead plants, that is from oil and coal. (Carl Sagan, generalizing this classification...[estimated] that we are actually a Type .7 civilization…we can mathematically estimate that we will attain Type I status in about 100 years, given an average rate of economic growth.” Ch8“Also, if room temperature superconductors are found in this century, it means a complete overhaul of our energy requirements. Waste heat, in the form of friction, will be greatly reduced, increasing the efficiency of our machines. As we mentioned, the majority of our energy consumption, especially transportation, goes into overcoming friction…it would take almost no energy to move from California to New York if there were no friction.” Ch8 (hide spoiler)]"
233,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9619705-anna,0,I just want to see an updated version of this book explaining why most of short term predictions didn't work out.
234,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,2,"The book was extremely informative about current trends in science (and some technology). It lives up to its title in discussing physics of the future. The author is a skilled writer who is gifted at communicating highly abstract and obscure ideas.So why only two stars?I did have some issues with the overall books and how this project was carried out. Some were more troubling than others. The major issues include:1) Too much scientific triumphalism -- The clear storyline in the book is that science will render most of the troubles of life either moot or less relevant. Diseases will go away, aging will be suppressed, and immortality lies around the corner! Hovercraft will be developed, robots will be everywhere and solve our problems, and traditional issues of scarcity re health and food will go away. I suspect that this technological paradise is being oversold, just a bit. Lifespan has been extended, but arguably more by prenatal and care for newborns, coupled with public health measures such as mass inoculation coupled with the aggressive combating of traditional killers like smallpox. We still haven't figured out much regarding the flu or the common cold! Yes there has been progress, but is heaven really that near? Have we proven ourselves worthy of godlike status?2) There is very little on economics throughout the book. The author has apparently read some of Thurow's futurist work but not much else. Science and technology need to be brought to market and commercialized before they can hope to revolutionize our lives. Perhaps the government will do it all?? Well the government might fund defense research and NSF grants but last I heard it still did limited work on commercialization.3) What about politics? The twentieth century brought amazing advances in science and technology but also rule by thugs, gangsters, and murderers that applied technology to the extermination of millions. Oh Brave New World . . . . !4) The author pushes his futurist motivation -- using a near future, mid future, and far future framework, but in the end it comes down to extrapolation between two poles - heaven or catastrophe, with the chance of catastrophe severely discounted. Not much of a choice!5) The author raises the need for education in science and technology, suggesting that they have read Goldin and Katz, but only talk about it in the context of H1B visas and information intensive jobs that go wanting. What about the increasing numbers of people in the US who are almost completely left out of the new age because of their poor education and training? Kaku may be setting up the world of Wells' Time Machine without knowing it. How can we move into a scientific and technology heaven, when most people are fit to work at Wal-Mart at best? What will all the dummies do once the robots take over our jobs? . . . which negative utopia comes to mind? the Matrix??6) This could be partially excused, since no author is perfect and the book is informative. What is more troubling about the book is that it is two or three chapters too long and the extra chapters detract from the book's value. Once the author moves from the descriptive and commentary and mild extrapolation in most ot the book to a more normative tone when he discusses the evolution of a planetary civilization, he loses me completely. He takes a framework by Kardashev to identify civilizations we might encounter from space and order them by energy use (???) and applies it to how our civilization might develop. Note here, we are using a framework with absolutely no data or experience behind it, with the exception of the sci-fi movie genre, and turning it into the summary framework for a book purporting to provide an update to general readers on the state of research in physics!! Needless to say I was not convinced and was chuckling - for the wrong reasons -- as I worked through the end of the book. This appears to be a common problem in big reach synthesis boos -- Ian Morris' book on why the West rules comes to mind, although the latter is a much better book overall.5) By the end of the book, I was wondering if there were particular reasons why Kaku appeared to have ""lost it"" when he just should have stopped writing fifty pages sooner.6) Overall, I don't regret reading it. I just regret finishing it."
235,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12945730-jack-ferreira,3,"I like Michio Kaku, he seems like a pretty cool, down to earth guy. I'll get some criticism out of the way, because overall I did enjoy the book.I have seen interviews and tv shows he's been in and though I do like him sometimes his atitude bothers me for some reason. I can't quite put my finger on it, maybe it has something to do with this slightly over-pandering way of explaining things. It looks like he thinks the only way his readers will understand what he's saying is by constantly referencing Star Treck, Star Wars and other products of science fiction which really isn't needed. I understood him perfectly well when he talked about portable MRI machines and DNA chips before he felt the need to display a picture of a Star Treck ""tricorder"" (just in case we couldn't grasp the idea by ourselves). I thought these constant references were a bit odd because this isn't a hard book to comprehend. It's not necessarily insulting but at the same time it feels a little condescending. This is especialy present in the final chapter (""A Day in a Life in 2100""). It was completely unecessary and cringeworthy, he may be a great theoretical physicist but he is not a great writer (outside of non-fiction, at least). That said, I learnt a lot from this book. I will probably forget most of it, I admit, but it made me feel up to date on our current technological advancements. I liked the way he split up each chapter, making it nicely organized and easy to navigate through. It was great reading about realistic predictions for the future of computers, AI, energy, nanotechnology and space travel. The future of wealth was also discussed which took me by surprise and I sincerely apreciated it, since it really is something important to consider.As he talks about the future of humanity he introduces some very interesting concepts. It leaves me excited for things to come and curious of how it will change our way of life.Obviously, we should all take these predictions with a grain of salt. I'm sure Michio Kaku has more or less figured out the near future, but up to the year 2100 he gets quite vague. Some people see it as a bad thing, but I don't blame him. Any book we read, from an author who goes out of his areas of expertise must not be taken for granted. I have seen people comment on misuse of terminology and a lot of non consideration for alternate scenarios. This is why I love people like Richard Dawkins, who write books within their fields and whose content I absolutely trust.It's a nice book if you don't look upon it as a definitive guide to the future.I am now in the mood for some science fiction though."
236,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53461468-rasty,5,"Its amazing when you first read that book , it's not about how science developed or anything like that , but its about how science will develop and will shape our destiny or thoughts to our whole world , michio kaku one of my favorite writers about science , and that was amazing from him :)"
237,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5526063-mary-jean-harris,3,"This was quite a good book with lots of fascinating predictions for the future, as well as a survey of technologies currently being developed. I'd give it 3.5 stars (you need 1/2 stars, Goodreads!). Michio Kaku writes about the places he's visited, mostly research labs, that are working on new technologies, including bioengineering, nanotechnology, quantum computers, robotics, gene therapy, self-driving cars, space travel, and space elevators. Kaku's enthusiasm for these future changes is undying throughout the book, and it makes an enjoyable read. I can't agree with him that all this will result in positive change for the future though, especially as technology becomes more invasive and embedded into our lives, drawing us even further apart from the natural world as well as opening up the possibility for people (and governments and organizations) to control us in this system. It sounds eerily similar to the matrix, but Kaku doesn't seem overly concerned about any of these issues.Additionally, Kaku unfortunately falls into the trap of global warming hysteria: he takes it for granted that humanity is causing a climate crisis, a position that is highly contented and strewn with propaganda. As a scientist analysing a complicated issue, Kaku does not apply his own standards of rational inquiry to this issue and instead accepts the politically correct position that, even if he dug a little deep into the issue before writing the book, he would realize is not supported by many climate scientists.Also, although I liked the last chapter about ""a day in the life in 2100"" overall, it was really corny and, for some reason, the main guy we're following works at an office with only men...do no females work in the industry?. Also, this online dating stuff has become prevalent and people just do it naturally, something I find really creepy.But despite these problems with the book, it was a great read overall and definitely accessible to the general public."
238,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4617137-sangita-takhur,4,"To me the big question is: how fast will our technology progress in the coming years? I know it is very difficult to give a solid logical answer to this question. I liked the book but I do not agree with Kaku on many points. I think Kaku used almost a linear model for predicting the future. I think we need more imaginative power for predicting the future. Like Kaku I too believe that, gene technology, computers, artificial intelligence and robots will advance rapidly. The book is composed of the following nine chapters: 1. Future of the Computer: Mind over Matter, 2. Future of AI: Rise of the Machines, 3. Future of Medicine: Perfection and Beyond, 4. Nanotechnology: Everything from Nothing?, 5. Future of Energy: Energy from the Stars, 6. Future of Space Travel: To the Stars, 7. Future of Wealth, 8. Future of Humanity: Planetary Civilization, and 9. A Day in the Life in 2100. Kaku's approach is excellent, as if he is talking to a lay person, but he writes with a simple eloquence that makes these complex concepts accessible to the non-Physicist mind.Michio is too good in predicting the limitations of the technologies. One may argue that Michio's idea of robots and computers is similar to the AI from the movies in the 1990s, but we have to think year 2020 much brighter. Development on medicine, synthetic biology and nanotechnology is almost ignored. I was expecting more about quantum biology but that too is missing. But overall I liked the book. The book is good enough to stimulate our imagination."
239,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/153756-jeffrey,4,"A fascinating look at how the world might change in the future, while also giving some good basic information on various subjects - for example, Kaku breaks down how gene therapy works, and also what it could lead to. Kaku's style of writing is informative and accessible, and the only time I found myself starting to lose focus was during the fictional narrative covering a typical day in 2100. In a way, that section suffers from a lack of imagination in what people would be like, despite having well thought out possibilities for technology; it seems more like an example of what someone from today would act like if we had all of that technology today. Still, that got me thinking about things... like, one hundred years ago, someone wouldn't have even been able to conceive of the internet, but even if they could imagine it, they probably wouldn't be able to foresee the rise of things like social media, youtube, etc. and how those things are changing the way humanity deals with privacy and public appearance.Kaku's pretty optimistic about the future (he even only mentions the idea of humanity going extinct one time), so this book is at times almost like a really well researched version of the cliched utopian future. Fortunately the book's foundation is in science and balances that vision with various realistic possibilities, and in any case it's a great source of basic information related to physics for the layperson."
240,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17648164-umair-khan,4,"What is the future going to be like? Physics of the Future tries to answer this question in an engaging, thought provoking and visionary account of the possibilities that, according to the author, Michio Kaku, will be transformed into reality in the coming decades. The book will not be a disappointment to fans of Kaku and can be considered as a sequel to his previous work, Visions, but with a more expansive view.Physics outlines four fundamental forces of nature: gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force and strong nuclear force. Kaku is of the opinion that each time a force of nature is understood by scientists and harnessed by engineers it sets in motion a chain reaction of novel and unique technologies determining the course of human development. In Physics, Kaku interviews more than 300 scientists and inventors who are working day and night to push the boundaries of science and technology. Essentially, the theme of the book is similar to the works of futurists like Ray Kurzweil, however, the treatment of the topic is more vivid and easier to understand.Kaku seems to be following the footsteps of visionary futurists like Leonardo da Vinci and Jules Verne. He explores the impact of physics on the areas of computer science, artificial intelligence, medicine, nanotechnology, alternative energy and space travel. Kaku scientifically predicts what new technologies will enter in the following decades, what will be achieved by the mid-21st century, and finally what we will accomplish by the end of it.The narrative, introducing prospects of controlling computers through the human mind, resurrecting extinct animals, travelling to other planets and genetically enhancing our disease resistance, is exciting to read. The author claims that we might even be able to bring back the Neanderthal. However, he pinpoints the ethical dilemmas associated with such achievements by quoting Richard Klein, an anthropologist at Stanford: “Are you going to put the Neanderthals in a zoo or in Harvard?”In the last chapter, Kaku introduces the reader to an imaginary character living in the 22nd century. Biologically, he is in his 70s but the age of his organs is mid-30s. He rides a self-driven car. Nano-bots monitor the crucial indicators of his health while roaming in his bloodstream. What distinguishes this book from works of science fiction is that every prediction in the book is based on research and supported by prototypes being developed across the globe.Kaku also analyses the economic and social history of our civilisation and explains that new technologies are the engines of both scientific and social change. He rightly points out that the economic recessions of the 1850s, 1920s and 2008 were due to the “speculative fever” created around specific sectors: the railroad, automotive stocks and real estate, respectively.He warns that when the British Empire was shifting its focus from scientific innovation to more mundane matters of power-play, the US was emerging as a leader in research and advancement of knowledge in all fields. However, if the majority of the US talent is going into the investment sector and managing the finances of others, in which region will the most brilliant minds pursue the cause of innovation and exploring the truth?Kaku further chalks out the ranking of civilisations which was first introduced in 1964 by Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev — on the basis of the energy they consume. This ranking was mainly proposed to identify the powers of extra terrestrial intelligent civilisations and classify them into three types. Type I consumes planetary sources of energy, mainly sunlight that falls on their planet; Type II consumes all the energy produced by their sun, while Type III consumes the energy produced by all the stars of their galaxy. Our current status is perhaps that of a Type 0 since we consume the energy of dead plants (oil and coal). Kaku estimates that given the economic growth rate we will be able to achieve the status of a Type I civilisation by the end of the century.Physics of the Future not only tells us what is probable and possible in the future, it also gives researchers and inventors a timescale to measure their successes against. Moreover, it makes the reader feel excited about the times we are living in, when we can expect ‘miracles’ to happen in our lifetimes. Kaku points out that “By 2100, our destiny is to become like the gods we once worshipped and feared.”SOURCE: http://www.dawn.com/news/634292/non-f..."
241,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3352854-david-skip-everling,2,"I'm not sure about anybody's ability to predict a century into the future (especially if you give credence to the idea of accelerating returns in technology), but I was willing to give this book a shot after hearing Michio Kaku in interviews. In particular he piqued my curiosity with the claim that all the ideas in the book are grounded on currently existing prototypes or established scientific theory.Now after having read it, I think Michio is only giving a survey of some select topics, and the only ones that I think he handled well were the ones most closely linked to physics (e.g. space travel, nanotechnology & quantum behavior, global power generation). The other fields he dives into, particularly his analysis and extrapolation of consumer technologies, were disappointingly off target or lacking in proper depth.The book is occasionally so superficial in its treatment of some prototyped technologies that it reads somewhat like painfully outdated sci-fi from Michio's childhood in the 50's. The book is written to be highly accessible, but he does uninformed readers a disservice by giving equal weight to illogical and 'improbable but not impossible' possibilities. My biggest problem with his predictions are that they center on only a set of technologies that Kaku has experience with, extrapolated all the way out to 2100 without much consideration of how all the unmentioned possibilities will change his visions for the future.As an example, Michio doesn't do the best job keeping our present circumstances and his far future predictions from mixing anachronistically: e.g. the frequently repeated ""...when we carry around our own genomes on a CD-ROM"" for a ""2030-2070"" range prediction. I worry that Michio Kaku is just paraphrasing some of the ideas out there without really thinking about them any more critically, like a mediocre science journalist or sci-fi writer. Again this could be an artifact of his intentionally writing this book to be broadly accessible, but I don't think he found the right balance.The best parts of the book are in the second half, particularly his chapters on The Future of: Energy, Space Travel, Wealth, and Humanity (respectively) and I did enjoy most of this material despite a scattering of the same problems mentioned above. Sadly, I think Michio Kaku completely botched his concluding chapter, ""A Day in the Life in 2100"", and I think the preceding Future of Humanity chapter would have been a much stronger ending. The ""Day in the Life"" conclusion is silly speculative fiction and the best (worst?) example in the entire book of his anachronistic and muddled sci-fi visions. Michio Kaku is great when talking about physics and large scale trends closely linked to humanity's knowledge of physics, but judging from this book alone he doesn't put together upcoming technologies into realistic or compelling future scenarios very well at all, ending up with an incomplete picture somewhere in the uncomfortable border between imaginative thinking and unwarranted speculation."
242,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,4,"This is a fascinating survey of what's actually happening in the cutting edge of science and technology. He walks through computers and vehicles and energy and space exploration and even culture. For each area he discussed deeply what's happening now, then gives thoughtful guesses to what will develop in early 21st century, mid-century, and late-century. His understanding of science is broad AND deep. His vision of the future of science is compelling. Some highlights: Tiny computer chips will be embedded in everything--almost literally--and we'll live in a cloud of data that's ridiculous. Robots will outnumber humans--but they won't be able to do anything but the physical tasks we program them to do (including driving our cars and planes). Magnetism will finally be mastered and we'll run our world on magnetic power rather than electric power. And by the end of the century remote control robots will be building a moon base for us to continue looking into the stars. However, I docked him a star because he displays a naive understanding of culture and history. He makes sweeping mistakes like seeing being religious as the enemy of science when history actually shows that many of the greatest science cultures were so precisely because of their religious beliefs, or his easy dismissal of cultural conflicts in the new world and his idea that once food and shelter are universal then haves and have nots won't be a real issue. So read this for the tech ideas and endure his comments about becoming like the gods of old and reaching cultural utopia. "
243,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"Michio Kaku is a great science writer (as well as being a physics professor), but futurology is a difficult subject to make interesting and all too often what you get is lists of 'in the future you will have an X that will do Y,' which gets dull fairly quickly.Where Kaku's approach is good (which is to base his ideas on physics) is in the future of energy. His chapter on space exploration is good too - he is a great enthusiast for this, and that comes across strongly here. The only proviso is that the main controlling factor on space exploration is not science but politics. A man wasn't put on the moon for science, but to put the Russians in their place. We haven't done much manned exploration since for the same reason. It's too expensive for science to control things.To be honest I was even less convinced about the consumer technology ideas. If space exploration is driven by politics, consumer purchases are driven by the market. Yes, the science & technology has to be able to deliver (so you couldn't have an iPhone 10 years ago), but it doesn't decide what will and won't become popular.The book finishes with a chapter on the way the world will be a single civilization (even if nations still exist in a weakened form) by the end of the century. This seemed the least science-supported speculation. If anything we seem to be fragmenting more.All in all, a good try - but futurology remains closer to fiction than popular science."

I get that he was trying to summarize everything he'd written in the book in an interesting way, but I'm not a huge fan of 2nd person povs and it came off as annoying and unneeded. "
245,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7070282-jenny-williams,5,"After reading this selection I strongly believe Michio Kaku is one of the brightest minds in his field. Physics Of The Impossible was an amazing book and this one blows it out of the water. I can't determine if I am so fond of it because of how advanced our technology will be in the near future or if I am truly fond of his writing. I know one thing for sure, some of the different advancements in technology is going to change the way we live life in way too many ways. What I mean by that is the advancement Kaku covers isn't technology like a new version of an XBOX or something of that sort. Michio Kaku covers advancement in technology like the worlds biggest atom smasher in Switzerland under a mountain, circling a mile exactly. This atom smasher is one of the biggest advancements in our technology opening doors to creating so much energy that we will be able to travel through space at a speed close to the speed of light. That's only the example I remembered best but there are so many throughout this book it excites you for our future. Kind of. "
246,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5431286-david,3,"Since I had already read the book ""Visions"" by the same writer nearly three years ago, this one did not really generate much of an interest within me due to the much common material. Although, for someone who may have never read ""Visions"" or ""Physics of the Impossible"" (which too I had read in 2011-12), I strongly feel that ""Physics of the Future"" can tend to become very interesting if one likes to ponder on how technological the world is going to get within the next century, and how far will it be feasible to apply and integrate it within our daily lives.A Good Book, but a vast majority was already included amongst the first two of his books on the same genre. The chapter on the Future of Wealth, was kind of new though!A 3-star because the content was not new for me; otherwise I would rate it with a 4-star."

In fact, the action of the first film is kicked off by a message recorded in 3D by Princess Leia and conveyed by the robot..."" (Paraphrased.)Mr Kaku, please stop going into detail about science-fiction films!"

I understand that for those who know a lot about physics and technology, it may be to easy, but for such people as I am, it was great. Well, I didn't like everything what I read (especially, the beginning) but later it got much better. I really enjoyed topics about artificial intelligence and robotics, the future of medicine and genetics. I hope that many forecasts will come true."

254,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27777097-thomas-jacob-jr,3,"An enjoyable, cursory overview of some of the most exciting technological achievements we may expect mankind to engage with over the next century. I came across Michio Kaku, as I am sure many others have, by watching an interview on television a few years ago, and I was struck by his loquaciousness and intelligence. Describing contemporary scientific concepts, especially quantum physics, in a way that a layman can understand is no small feat. In Physics of the Future, Kaku focuses on several industries (private space exploration, computer technology, medicine, and others) and tries to predict what respective advances we may expect by 2100. Oftentimes he uses examples from popular science fiction, specifically Star Trek, as a frame of reference. This book definitely falls into the 'pop science' category, with only brief asides into more technical and mathematical information. Any fans of popular science fiction work in film, television, or literature will be already be aware of many of the concepts here, and truthfully, any one of them could easily fill an entire book by itself (the 'recommended reading' section at the end is a goldmine for further exploration). Kaku sometimes makes sweeping generalizations without going into further detail that may seem presumptuous, but it is usually in attempt to keep the pace light. Also, since this was written in 2011, some sections appear a little dated even only six years later (an entire section on private space exploration, for example, doesn't mention either Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos, two of the forerunners in this field). Recommended for those looking for a brief overview of some of the exciting advances in technology that we can expect to look forward to over the course of our lifetime. For those looking for a deeper dive into any of the aforementioned subjects, the dozens of recommended works at the end should serve as an excellent primer. "
255,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,4,"Peering into the future of mankind and predicting what lies in store for us a few decades from now, has always been a dicey endeavour. In general, predictions pertaining to unchecked population growth, resultant famines, wars over access to resources, gloomy prospects for the future of developing nations etc have mostly proven to be unnecessary alarms rather than reality. A few major historical instances come to mind. Rev. Thomas Malthus in the late 18th century, Dr. Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University in the 1960s, and MIT's Club of Rome report in the 1970s were famous for damning our future, particularly that of India and China due to their large populations. We find that both India and China have done pretty well in the forty years since. On the other hand, predictions about the end of slavery, end of European colonialism, an era of less work and more leisure have all come true. It seems as though we tend to take both a gloomy and hopeful view of mankind and misjudge its potential for making correctives when it comes to how human beings, our societies, governments and institutions would behave in future under changing conditions.In contrast, predictions regarding scientific and technological advances in the fields of medicine, computers, biology, astronomy etc have more frequently proven to materialize successfully, at times sooner than expected. The Moore's Law comes to mind immediately. This book itself shows how accurately Jules Verne, in the mid 1800s, predicted life in Paris in the 1960s as consisting of skyscrapers, air-conditioning, TV, elevators, high-speed trains and fax machines. It seems as if we have a better grasp of machines and man's interactions with them and the development of this man-machine future. This book by theoretical Physicist Michio Kaku, crystal-gazes into this future as led by the advance of science and technology. Even if one does not accept all the projections, we end up learning a lot on what stunning possibilities are out there as we live out this century.The book is organized on what we can expect in the near term (by 2030), the mid term (2030-2070) and the long term (2070-2100). The future is explored through the domains of Computers, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Medicine, Nanotechnology, Energy and Space Travel. But it is not just speculation from a Theoretical Physicist. The author had discussed with hundreds of scientists who actually work today on these ideas and had compiled out of this interaction, what is possible in these three time periods. The presentation and language in the book is simple and accessible even to the average non-science minded reader and that, in my view, is a great positive about the book. I shall outline here some of the future products and possibilities given by Dr.Kaku which grabbed my mind:MRI machines which are just a foot long, looking like cell phones which can be passed over the human body and detect cancer (2030)Computers which scan fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) patterns in the brain and decipher a person's stream of consciousness and thereby detect what he/she is thinking (2070-2100)Computers being able to reconstruct a person's facial features given a strand of DNA from that person'e hair or bloodTissue engineering to manufacture a whole body part by extracting a few cells from the bodyResurrection of extinct life forms like the Mammoth or the NeanderthalNano-particles which enter and kill only cancer cells and leave healthy tissue untouchedchanging one shape to another at the push of a button, just like the T-1000 in 'Terminator-2'Molecular Replicators, capable of creating almost anything we want, the same way that nature can “take hamburgers and vegetables and turn them into a baby.”Fusion plants dotting the countryside by mid centuryLanding on an asteroid or on a moon of planet Mars, Space ElevatorsThe final couple of chapters deal with the future of humanity, planetary civilizations and how life would look in 2100. One can feel the child-like enthusiasm of Dr.Kaku in writing about all these possibilities and it makes the book enjoyable reading. He uses references to popular sci-fi movies from Hollywood to illustrate many of the ideas. In fact, as I read the book, I developed a greater respect for movie makers like that of the Terminator, Matrix, Star Wars, Avatar and so on.We have heard recently of anxieties being expressed about Artificial Intelligence and its destructive potential by luminaries like Bill Gates and Elon Musk. The eminent futurist, Ray Kurzweil has suggested in his work 'The Singularity is Near' that by 2045, a $1000 computer would be a billion times more intelligent than all humans combined and hence creating an uncontrolled runaway singularity. But others like Douglas Hofstadter and Mitch Kapor have dismissed these notions. This book discusses this topic substantially and believes that mankind will develop 'friendly AI' and use it to enhance itself rather than letting itself be ruled by mean-minded robots. Dr.Kaku shows six reasons why there are major roadblocks to such a singularity.On the negative side, just as in other books on the future, this one also has its tiresome speculation on the 'sick men of Asia'. Dr.Kaku quotes a report by Peter Schwartz of the Global Business Network on the dire future that is likely in the demographic nightmare of South Asia. Sea level rise due to Global warming in the latter half of this century could cause massive flooding and chaos, resulting in millions of refugees across the borders of Bangladesh into India. Governments could lose all authority and collapse, resulting in nightmarish looting and rioting. Rising tensions and chaos and inability to control may result in nations resorting to nuclear weapons!It is only scientists who tell us that Human societies, weather and climate are non-linear systems and even a very small change could have a massive effect, called the butterfly effect, making it difficult to predict the long-term futures. Then, I don't see how the author is so sure of destructive global warming in the future and also the consequent behavior of south Asians. In spite of being repeatedly wrong, futurists cannot seem to resist making dire predictions for the future of nations with large populations.The book is enjoyable reading and educative as well. I strongly recommend reading it. Even though Physics plays an important role in all the science that is discussed in the book, I am unsure of whether 'Physics of the Future' is the most meaningful title for the book. When I picked up the book initially, I thought it would be a book on String Theory."
256,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645507-jason-schneeberger,5,"I don't usually do book reviews this long anymore, but this one that I won't soon forget. If ever. Based off of the known laws of nature, author and world renowned theoretical physicist Michio Kaku met with, and interviewed, 300 of the leading scientists in the world about what our world will be like in the year 2100 through the ever increasing advancements of technology. This book lays out the most likely scenario of computers, AI, medicine, nanotechnology, energy, space travel and wealth from those interviews and how they will shape the world by the year 2100.Oh what a fantastic and thought provoking book this was! It's great to read a book about the future that isn't nihilistic, apocalyptic and negative, but rather hopeful and full of wonder! Sure, the very real threats of chaos, nuclear war, global warming etc are addressed in this book, but in ways that give rise to ways around such problems instead of weakly giving into them.I'm always wondering why every sci-fi movie based in the future has to be apocalyptic, or negative about where the world is going? It's easy to see the bad decisions we are making as humans that drive this thinking and make it seem like a sure reality to come, but where are the optimistic stories? Where are the stories that show us prospering and thriving as a world in the future? Those ideas and thoughts are in this book! Hopefully some good screenwriters and filmmakers will get inspired and make a movie based off the ideas in this book. I want to see it! Almost all of us alive now will not get to experience the world in the year 2100. Not unless of course the age reversal science described in the book becomes a reality (and it seems as though it's a very real possibility in the second half of this century), but this book brings much to the imagination of looking out a window, into the world at the dawn of the 22nd century. I can't say think of anything bad to say about this one. I absolutely loved everything about it. BUY IT!"
257,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Informed speculations engagingly presentedIt’s easy to see that Professor Kaku had a lot of fun writing this book since more than anything (at least for this reader) this book was a pleasure to read.Typically Kaku begins each chapter with some reference to the ancient gods or some other form of mythology or folklore, mainly for contrast or to highlight human yearnings that are being fulfilled today or may be fulfilled in the near future. He then mixes in some science fiction movies, stories or novels that he likes or finds instructive (or not). He adds some personal research and experiences with some of the great minds of our time as he makes his predictions, speculations and guesses on where we are going and when we are going to get there. Partly because of his celebrity and partly because of his wide-ranging knowledge and sharp intelligence (not to mention his charm) Kaku is able to talk with Nobel Prize winners and other cutting edge scientists and engineers all over the world the way most people talk to their neighbors. Areas of interest, each with its own chapter are computers, artificial intelligence, medicine, nanotechnology, energy, space travel, wealth (i.e., economics), and what life will be like in the future on a day-to-day basis. Each chapter gives Kaku’s speculations for the “Near Future (Present to 2030),” “Midcentury (2030 to 2070),” and the “Far Future (2070 to 2100).”I’m going to try to NOT second guess Kaku but I do want to focus on a few areas of personal interest and add a comment or two. “It is a law of evolution that fitter species arise to displace unfit species; and perhaps humans will be lost in the shuffle, eventually winding up in zoos where our robotic creations come to stare at us…Perhaps that is our role in history, to give birth to our evolutionary successors.” (p. 100)I think this is likely, especially if you add our genetically engineered successors. If so we can then think of ourselves as the “intelligent designers” of the demigods to come.Kaku weighs in on the possibility of our robotic creations becoming more intelligent than humans. (Seems very likely.) He speculates on robots producing “ever-smarter” robots that might “devour the resources of the planet in their insatiable quest to become ever more intelligent.” (p. 101) This can be seen as a near corollary of the idea that robots will become our masters and take over the planet. Since robots can only do what is programmed into them, these ideas depend on poor or malicious programming. (Beware the black hats of the future!)On page 116 Kaku points out that “there is no universally accepted definition of ‘smart.’” He doesn’t elaborate but I want to say that the unstated question is “smart for what”? Is the goal, e.g., happiness or world domination? A different kind of smarts might be required in each case.In talking about what jobs will still be available for humans in the midcentury future, Kaku makes the excellent point that those jobs will require “nonrepetitive work that requires pattern recognition.” (p. 305) He includes garbage collectors, police officers, construction workers, gardeners, and plumbers. However where I live as soon as they get a robot to drive the truck garbage collection will be a completely automated task. We have plastic containers set out on the street which are picked up and emptied by a mechanical arm from the truck. (Yes, the future is now.)In Chapter 8 “Future of Humanity” Kaku presents Nikolai Kardashev’s Type I, II, and III Civilizations based on energy consumption. (A Type II civilization, for example, consumes all the energy from their sun.) What I found interesting is Kaku’s statement that we “are leading to a single point: the creation of a planetary civilization.” (p. 327) I think the term “planetary civilization” is what we need to replace the currently (in some quarters) offensive term, “world government.”Kaku makes the sharp point that movies with “cross-cultural themes…packed with internationally recognized celebrities, are big money makers for Hollywood.” He sees this as “evidence of an emerging planetary culture.” (p. 334) He adds on the next page that “Local cultures will continue to survive, coexisting side by side with the larger global culture.”Some of Kaku’s dreams (perhaps) are room temperature super conductors and space elevators, to name just two that are highly speculative but would be amazing if realized.In the chapter on artificial intelligence, Kaku gives his three-pointed definition of consciousness. (Actually with becoming modesty he writes, “…if I were to venture a guess.”) In my book “The World Is Not as We Think It Is” I also give a three-pointed definition:“One: awareness of the world (including awareness of our self and our processes, that is, self-awareness).Two: self-identity. Notice that awareness of self is different from this identification with self.Three: experience or sensation, the feelings we get when we experience the world. This is sometimes called “phenomenal consciousness.” An example would be the subjective experience of the color red, or the taste of a strawberry.” (p. 82)Here is Kaku’s delineation from page 97:“1. sensing and recognizing the environment2. self-awareness3. planning for the future by setting goals and plans, that is, simulating the future and plotting strategy.”The slight differences are instructive. He leaves out self-identification, perhaps rightly so; and I leave out planning for the future. Also I presume that Kaku includes self-awareness in his first component. Personally I would include planning for the future in my first component, “awareness of the world” as well; however to emphasize “simulating the future” is a fine thing to do since humans are on another level in the animal kingdom when it comes to imagining what might happen.I should mention that in writing this book Kaku did not just tune into the zeitgeist but actually read prognosticators from the past. Two who did well were Benjamin Franklin and the Marquis de Condorcet. Since Kaku’s predictions are mostly favorable for humans, I hope his predictions do as well. --Dennis Littrell, author of “Hard Science and the Unknowable”"
258,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7227342-richard,3,"Michio Kaku's book, Physics of the Future, concludes with a comprehensive prediction of what life will like in 2100 as the subtitle indicates. The majority of the book is made up of predictions about how technology will evolve in the intervening years.The book was written in 2011, so some its contents are already dated. Interestingly, certain predictions about the near future have already come to pass. Other predictions appear to be a little delayed. To be clear, Mr. Kaku is very humble in the introduction about the ability to predict the future. One of the concrete statements he makes about the future is the idea there is a great deal to be optimistic about. He examines individuals in the past who were pessimistic about the development of technology, and he shows how wrong these individuals proved to be in time. For this reason, I think he is correct to say the future belongs to the optimists.I enjoyed the book; however, I don't think it is worth more than 3 stars. It has some important ideas, but the audience is narrow to a certain extant. It seems to offer inspiration to the future scientists who will make these breakthroughs; however, it isn't as relevant to the average reader. We will eventually see the changes predicted, but they are mostly decades away. "
259,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467608-serro,4,"This is a great book by a great physicist. I only rate it 4 stars because his thoughts and predictions can only be tested in 2100. I promise to raise my rating to 5 starts in 2100 if his predictions are correct. That is because according to Michio Kaku medicine will evolve greatly allowing people to live a lot longer than now. Not that I don't plan on living for 113 years as it is.The reader will find insights about the future of computers and AI, medicine and nanotechnology, space travel and energy. Kaku also takes on the nature of humanity as a whole in the next 100 years.And bear in mind these are not the predictions of Nostradamus, Michi Kaku knows first hand what he writes about."

I'm only giving this one 3 Stars because it is pretty similar to some of his other works and he repeats these concepts.

262,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1080484-teji,4,"The author’s passion for both physics and science-fiction is evident throughout this piece of speculative non-fiction. The work explores several areas of emerging technology and applied science, not just quantum physics. As the author notes, his predictions are “reasoned estimates of when the prototype technologies of today will finally reach maturity”. His extrapolation of what he thinks is likely to occur in the near (2010-2030), mid (2030-20700, and far (2070-2100) future, are intriguing and thought provoking. The organization is very repetitive-- almost as if it were written as a series of articles that were later post-edited into a book format (although I don't think that is the case). Also, the writing is a little dry in places-- but not intolerably so. Additionally, when speaking of the future, the author tends to geek out and engage in overwrought, almost giddy, statements about the “godlike” powers technology will grant humans within the next century. These flaws aside, overall, the writing is coherent and accessible. It will be interesting to see how well his forecasts for the next couple of decades hold-up.Quotes(view spoiler)[[In his novel, Paris in the Twentieth Century, written in 1863, Jules Verne] “predicted that Paris in 1960 would have glass skyscrapers, air conditioning, TV, elevators, high-speed trains, gasoline-powered automobiles, fax machines, and even something resembling the Internet…just a few years later he made another spectacular prediction. In 1865, he wrote From the Earth to the Moon, in which he predicted the details of the mission that sent our astronauts to the moon…He accurately predicted the size of the space capsule to within a few percent, the location of the launch site in Florida…the weightlessness that the astronauts would experience, and the final splashdown in the ocean…How was Jules Verne able to predict 100 years into the future with such breathtaking accuracy? His biographers have noted that, although Verne was not a scientist himself he constantly sought out scientists…He amassed a vast archive summarizing the great scientific discoveries of his time. Verne, more than others, realized that science was the engine shaking the foundations of civilization, propelling it into a new century with unexpected marvels and miracles.” -Introduction“Another great prophet of technology was Leonardo da Vinci, painter, thinker, and visionary…Like Jules Verne, Leonardo was able to get profound insights into the future by consulting a handful of forward-thinking individuals of his time…In addition, Leonardo was always experimenting, building, and sketching models, a key attribute of anyone who wants to translate thinking into reality.” -Introduction“As William Gibson…once said, ‘The future is already here. It’s just unevenly distributed.” -Introduction“Predictions for the future, with a few exceptions, have always underestimated the pace of technological progress.” -IntroductionThere are four fundamental forces in nature that drive the entire universe: gravity (unlocking the force of gravity helped to pave the way for the Industrial Revolution and the introduction of steam power, especially the locomotive), electromagnetic force (this unleashed the electronic revolution that has created a bounty of scientific wonders), and the two nuclear forces: the weak and strong forces. “When Einstein wrote down e=mc^2 and when the atom was split in the 1930s, scientists for the first time began to understand the forces that light up the heavens…the secret behind the stars…it also held out the promise that one day we would be able to harness this power on the earth”… quantum theory “has given us the transistor, the laser, and the digital resolution that is the driving force behind modern society. -Introduction“Exponential growth is often hard to grasp, since our minds think linearly. It is so gradual that you sometimes cannot experience the change at all. But over decades, it can completely alter everything around us. According to Moore's law, every Christmas your new computer games are almost twice as powerful (in terms of the number of transistors) as those from the previous year. Furthermore, as the years pass, this incremental gain becomes monumental. For example, when you receive a birthday card in the mail, it often has a chip that sings ‘Happy Birthday’ to you. Remarkably, that chip has more computer power than all the Allied forces of 1945. Hitler, Churchill, or Roosevelt might have killed to get that chip…Today, your cell phone has more computer power than all of NASA back in 1969, when it placed two astronauts on the moon…” Ch1“Today, when we enter a room, we automatically look for the light switch since we assume that the walls are electrified. In the future, the first thing we will do on entering a room…is to assume the room is intelligent…Around 2020, the price of a chip may also drop to about a penny…then we will have millions of chips distributed everywhere in our environment, silently carrying out our orders.” -Ch1“One reason why Moore's law has relentlessly increased the power of chips is because UV light can be tuned so that its wavelength is smaller and smaller, making it possible to etch increasingly tiny transistors onto silicon wafers. Since UV light has a wavelength as small as 10 nanometers, this means that the smallest transistor that you can etch is thirty atoms across…But this process cannot go on forever…You can even calculate roughly when Moore’s law will finally collapse: when you finally hit transistors the size of individual atoms… According to the laws of physics, eventually the Age of Silicon will come to a close, as we enter the Post-Silicon Era. Transistors will be so small that quantum theory or atomic physics takes over and electrons leak out of the wires…At that point, according to the laws of physics, the quantum theory takes over. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that you cannot know both the position and the velocity of any particle…at the atomic level you simply cannot know where the electron is, so it can never be confined precisely in an ultrathin wire or layer and it necessarily leaks out, causing the circuit to short-circuit.” Ch1“However, scans of the human brain clearly show that thinking is spread out over large parts of the brain...Digital computers can calculate at nearly the speed of light. he human brain, by contrast, is incredibly slow. Nerve impulses travel at an excruciatingly slow pace of about 200 miles per hour. But the brain more than makes up for this because it is massively parallel… In a race, a superfast single processor is left in the dust by a superslow parallel processor.” Ch2“While hardware had grown [exponentially] by the ability to etch smaller and smaller transistors onto a wafer, software is totally different; it requires a human to sit down with a pencil and paper to write code. That is the bottleneck: the human. Software, like all human creative activity, progresses in fits and starts, with brilliant insights and long stretches of drudgery and stagnation.” Ch2“…genetic analysis shows that aging is concentrated in the ""engine"" of the cell, the mitochondria, or the cell’s power plant. This has allowed scientists to…look for ways to accelerate the gene repair process inside the mitochondria to reverse the effects of aging.” Ch3“Normally, we don’t see quantum forces at work in everyday life. But quantum forces are everywhere…if we are largely empty, then why can’t we walk through walls?...The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons can exit in the same quantum state. Hence, when two nearly identical electrons get too close, they repel each other. This is the reason objects appear to be solid, which is an illusion…When we sit on a chair...we are hovering above the chair, floating less than a nanometer above it, repelled by the chair’s electrical and quantum forces.” Ch4“The quantum theory has only one thing going for it: it is correct. Its accuracy has been measured to one part in ten billion, making it the most successful physical theory of all time.” Ch4“Science and technology are the engines of prosperity…” Ch7“The combination of changing social conditions and the mastery of the four forces propelled Europe to the forefront of nations. But technologies are dynamic, changing all the time. They are born, evolve, and rise and fall…technologies obey certain laws of evolution. Mass technologies usually evolve in four basic stages…In stage I, the products of technology are so precious that they are closely guarded. Paper, when it was invented in the form of papyrus by the ancient Egyptians…was so precious that one papyrus scroll was closely guarded by scores of priests…Paper entered stage II around 1450, when Gutenberg invented the movable type…one person could possess one book containing the knowledge of hundreds of scrolls. Before Gutenberg, there were only 30,000 books in all Europe. By 1500, there were 9 million books…By around 1930, paper hit stage III, when the cost fell to a penny a sheet. This made possible the personal library, where one person could possess hundreds of books. Paper became an ordinary commodity…Paper is everywhere and nowhere, invisible and ubiquitous. Now we are in stage IV, where paper is a fashion statement. We decorate our world with paper of all colors, shapes, and sizes. The largest source of urban waste is paper. So paper evolved from being a closely guarded commodity to being waste.” Running water, electricity, and computer have followed the same pattern. Ch7“But as technologies evolve, they create abrupt changes in the economy that sometimes lead to social dislocations. In any revolution, there are winners and losers…What jobs will flourish by midcentury? How will the evolution of technology change the way we work? We can partially determine the answer by asking a simple question: What are the limitations of robots? As we have seen, there are at least two basic stumbling blocks to artificial intelligence: pattern recognition and common sense. Therefore, the jobs that will survive in the future are…ones that require these two abilities.” Ch7“Developing nations may be able to take advantage of the information revolution. They can, in principle, leapfrog past the developed nations in many areas. In the developed world, telephone companies had to tediously wire up every home or farm at great cost. But a developing nation does not have to wire up its country, since cell phone technology can excel in rural areas without any roads or infrastructure. Also, developing nations have the advantage that they do not have to rebuild an aging infrastructure…” Ch7“…the Unites States has maintained its dominance in science and technology in spite of the fact that U.S. students often score dead last when it comes to essential subjects like science and math…(It should also be pointed out that this ranking corresponds roughly to the number of days that students were in school. China, which ranked number 1, averaged 251 days of instruction per year, while the United States averaged only 178 days per year.) It seems like a mystery that, despite these awful numbers, the United States continues to do well internationally in science and technology, until you realize that much of the U.S science [talent] comes from overseas. The United States has a secret weapon, the H1B visa…But the H1B visa is only a stopgap measure. The United States cannot continue to live off foreign scientists, many of whom are beginning to return to China and India as their economies improve…The United States will eventually have to overhaul its archaic, sclerotic education system. At present, poorly prepared high school students flood the job market and universities…Employers continually bemoan the fact that they have to take one year to train their new hires to bring them up to speed. And the universities are burdened by having to create new layers of remedial courses to compensate for the poor high school education system…” Ch7“When physicists try to analyze civilizations, we rank them on the basis of the energy they consume. This ranking was first introduced in 1964 by Russian astrophysicists Nikolai Kardashev…he proposed three theoretical types: A Type I civilization is planetary, consuming the sliver of sunlight that falls on their planet, or about 10^17 watts. A Type II civilization is stellar, consuming all the energy that their sun emits, or 10^27 watts. A Type III civilization is galactic, consuming the energy of billions of stars, or about 10^37 watts…Each type is separated by a factor of 10 billion: a Type III civilization consumes 10 billion times more energy than at Type II civilization…which in turn consumes 10 billion times more energy than a Type I civilization. According to the classification, our present-day civilization is Type 0. We don’t even rate on this scale, since we get our energy from dead plants, that is from oil and coal. (Carl Sagan, generalizing this classification...[estimated] that we are actually a Type .7 civilization…we can mathematically estimate that we will attain Type I status in about 100 years, given an average rate of economic growth.” Ch8“Also, if room temperature superconductors are found in this century, it means a complete overhaul of our energy requirements. Waste heat, in the form of friction, will be greatly reduced, increasing the efficiency of our machines. As we mentioned, the majority of our energy consumption, especially transportation, goes into overcoming friction…it would take almost no energy to move from California to New York if there were no friction.” Ch8 (hide spoiler)]"
263,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9619705-anna,0,I just want to see an updated version of this book explaining why most of short term predictions didn't work out.
264,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,2,"The book was extremely informative about current trends in science (and some technology). It lives up to its title in discussing physics of the future. The author is a skilled writer who is gifted at communicating highly abstract and obscure ideas.So why only two stars?I did have some issues with the overall books and how this project was carried out. Some were more troubling than others. The major issues include:1) Too much scientific triumphalism -- The clear storyline in the book is that science will render most of the troubles of life either moot or less relevant. Diseases will go away, aging will be suppressed, and immortality lies around the corner! Hovercraft will be developed, robots will be everywhere and solve our problems, and traditional issues of scarcity re health and food will go away. I suspect that this technological paradise is being oversold, just a bit. Lifespan has been extended, but arguably more by prenatal and care for newborns, coupled with public health measures such as mass inoculation coupled with the aggressive combating of traditional killers like smallpox. We still haven't figured out much regarding the flu or the common cold! Yes there has been progress, but is heaven really that near? Have we proven ourselves worthy of godlike status?2) There is very little on economics throughout the book. The author has apparently read some of Thurow's futurist work but not much else. Science and technology need to be brought to market and commercialized before they can hope to revolutionize our lives. Perhaps the government will do it all?? Well the government might fund defense research and NSF grants but last I heard it still did limited work on commercialization.3) What about politics? The twentieth century brought amazing advances in science and technology but also rule by thugs, gangsters, and murderers that applied technology to the extermination of millions. Oh Brave New World . . . . !4) The author pushes his futurist motivation -- using a near future, mid future, and far future framework, but in the end it comes down to extrapolation between two poles - heaven or catastrophe, with the chance of catastrophe severely discounted. Not much of a choice!5) The author raises the need for education in science and technology, suggesting that they have read Goldin and Katz, but only talk about it in the context of H1B visas and information intensive jobs that go wanting. What about the increasing numbers of people in the US who are almost completely left out of the new age because of their poor education and training? Kaku may be setting up the world of Wells' Time Machine without knowing it. How can we move into a scientific and technology heaven, when most people are fit to work at Wal-Mart at best? What will all the dummies do once the robots take over our jobs? . . . which negative utopia comes to mind? the Matrix??6) This could be partially excused, since no author is perfect and the book is informative. What is more troubling about the book is that it is two or three chapters too long and the extra chapters detract from the book's value. Once the author moves from the descriptive and commentary and mild extrapolation in most ot the book to a more normative tone when he discusses the evolution of a planetary civilization, he loses me completely. He takes a framework by Kardashev to identify civilizations we might encounter from space and order them by energy use (???) and applies it to how our civilization might develop. Note here, we are using a framework with absolutely no data or experience behind it, with the exception of the sci-fi movie genre, and turning it into the summary framework for a book purporting to provide an update to general readers on the state of research in physics!! Needless to say I was not convinced and was chuckling - for the wrong reasons -- as I worked through the end of the book. This appears to be a common problem in big reach synthesis boos -- Ian Morris' book on why the West rules comes to mind, although the latter is a much better book overall.5) By the end of the book, I was wondering if there were particular reasons why Kaku appeared to have ""lost it"" when he just should have stopped writing fifty pages sooner.6) Overall, I don't regret reading it. I just regret finishing it."
265,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12945730-jack-ferreira,3,"I like Michio Kaku, he seems like a pretty cool, down to earth guy. I'll get some criticism out of the way, because overall I did enjoy the book.I have seen interviews and tv shows he's been in and though I do like him sometimes his atitude bothers me for some reason. I can't quite put my finger on it, maybe it has something to do with this slightly over-pandering way of explaining things. It looks like he thinks the only way his readers will understand what he's saying is by constantly referencing Star Treck, Star Wars and other products of science fiction which really isn't needed. I understood him perfectly well when he talked about portable MRI machines and DNA chips before he felt the need to display a picture of a Star Treck ""tricorder"" (just in case we couldn't grasp the idea by ourselves). I thought these constant references were a bit odd because this isn't a hard book to comprehend. It's not necessarily insulting but at the same time it feels a little condescending. This is especialy present in the final chapter (""A Day in a Life in 2100""). It was completely unecessary and cringeworthy, he may be a great theoretical physicist but he is not a great writer (outside of non-fiction, at least). That said, I learnt a lot from this book. I will probably forget most of it, I admit, but it made me feel up to date on our current technological advancements. I liked the way he split up each chapter, making it nicely organized and easy to navigate through. It was great reading about realistic predictions for the future of computers, AI, energy, nanotechnology and space travel. The future of wealth was also discussed which took me by surprise and I sincerely apreciated it, since it really is something important to consider.As he talks about the future of humanity he introduces some very interesting concepts. It leaves me excited for things to come and curious of how it will change our way of life.Obviously, we should all take these predictions with a grain of salt. I'm sure Michio Kaku has more or less figured out the near future, but up to the year 2100 he gets quite vague. Some people see it as a bad thing, but I don't blame him. Any book we read, from an author who goes out of his areas of expertise must not be taken for granted. I have seen people comment on misuse of terminology and a lot of non consideration for alternate scenarios. This is why I love people like Richard Dawkins, who write books within their fields and whose content I absolutely trust.It's a nice book if you don't look upon it as a definitive guide to the future.I am now in the mood for some science fiction though."
266,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53461468-rasty,5,"Its amazing when you first read that book , it's not about how science developed or anything like that , but its about how science will develop and will shape our destiny or thoughts to our whole world , michio kaku one of my favorite writers about science , and that was amazing from him :)"
267,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5526063-mary-jean-harris,3,"This was quite a good book with lots of fascinating predictions for the future, as well as a survey of technologies currently being developed. I'd give it 3.5 stars (you need 1/2 stars, Goodreads!). Michio Kaku writes about the places he's visited, mostly research labs, that are working on new technologies, including bioengineering, nanotechnology, quantum computers, robotics, gene therapy, self-driving cars, space travel, and space elevators. Kaku's enthusiasm for these future changes is undying throughout the book, and it makes an enjoyable read. I can't agree with him that all this will result in positive change for the future though, especially as technology becomes more invasive and embedded into our lives, drawing us even further apart from the natural world as well as opening up the possibility for people (and governments and organizations) to control us in this system. It sounds eerily similar to the matrix, but Kaku doesn't seem overly concerned about any of these issues.Additionally, Kaku unfortunately falls into the trap of global warming hysteria: he takes it for granted that humanity is causing a climate crisis, a position that is highly contented and strewn with propaganda. As a scientist analysing a complicated issue, Kaku does not apply his own standards of rational inquiry to this issue and instead accepts the politically correct position that, even if he dug a little deep into the issue before writing the book, he would realize is not supported by many climate scientists.Also, although I liked the last chapter about ""a day in the life in 2100"" overall, it was really corny and, for some reason, the main guy we're following works at an office with only men...do no females work in the industry?. Also, this online dating stuff has become prevalent and people just do it naturally, something I find really creepy.But despite these problems with the book, it was a great read overall and definitely accessible to the general public."
268,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4617137-sangita-takhur,4,"To me the big question is: how fast will our technology progress in the coming years? I know it is very difficult to give a solid logical answer to this question. I liked the book but I do not agree with Kaku on many points. I think Kaku used almost a linear model for predicting the future. I think we need more imaginative power for predicting the future. Like Kaku I too believe that, gene technology, computers, artificial intelligence and robots will advance rapidly. The book is composed of the following nine chapters: 1. Future of the Computer: Mind over Matter, 2. Future of AI: Rise of the Machines, 3. Future of Medicine: Perfection and Beyond, 4. Nanotechnology: Everything from Nothing?, 5. Future of Energy: Energy from the Stars, 6. Future of Space Travel: To the Stars, 7. Future of Wealth, 8. Future of Humanity: Planetary Civilization, and 9. A Day in the Life in 2100. Kaku's approach is excellent, as if he is talking to a lay person, but he writes with a simple eloquence that makes these complex concepts accessible to the non-Physicist mind.Michio is too good in predicting the limitations of the technologies. One may argue that Michio's idea of robots and computers is similar to the AI from the movies in the 1990s, but we have to think year 2020 much brighter. Development on medicine, synthetic biology and nanotechnology is almost ignored. I was expecting more about quantum biology but that too is missing. But overall I liked the book. The book is good enough to stimulate our imagination."
269,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/153756-jeffrey,4,"A fascinating look at how the world might change in the future, while also giving some good basic information on various subjects - for example, Kaku breaks down how gene therapy works, and also what it could lead to. Kaku's style of writing is informative and accessible, and the only time I found myself starting to lose focus was during the fictional narrative covering a typical day in 2100. In a way, that section suffers from a lack of imagination in what people would be like, despite having well thought out possibilities for technology; it seems more like an example of what someone from today would act like if we had all of that technology today. Still, that got me thinking about things... like, one hundred years ago, someone wouldn't have even been able to conceive of the internet, but even if they could imagine it, they probably wouldn't be able to foresee the rise of things like social media, youtube, etc. and how those things are changing the way humanity deals with privacy and public appearance.Kaku's pretty optimistic about the future (he even only mentions the idea of humanity going extinct one time), so this book is at times almost like a really well researched version of the cliched utopian future. Fortunately the book's foundation is in science and balances that vision with various realistic possibilities, and in any case it's a great source of basic information related to physics for the layperson."
270,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17648164-umair-khan,4,"What is the future going to be like? Physics of the Future tries to answer this question in an engaging, thought provoking and visionary account of the possibilities that, according to the author, Michio Kaku, will be transformed into reality in the coming decades. The book will not be a disappointment to fans of Kaku and can be considered as a sequel to his previous work, Visions, but with a more expansive view.Physics outlines four fundamental forces of nature: gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force and strong nuclear force. Kaku is of the opinion that each time a force of nature is understood by scientists and harnessed by engineers it sets in motion a chain reaction of novel and unique technologies determining the course of human development. In Physics, Kaku interviews more than 300 scientists and inventors who are working day and night to push the boundaries of science and technology. Essentially, the theme of the book is similar to the works of futurists like Ray Kurzweil, however, the treatment of the topic is more vivid and easier to understand.Kaku seems to be following the footsteps of visionary futurists like Leonardo da Vinci and Jules Verne. He explores the impact of physics on the areas of computer science, artificial intelligence, medicine, nanotechnology, alternative energy and space travel. Kaku scientifically predicts what new technologies will enter in the following decades, what will be achieved by the mid-21st century, and finally what we will accomplish by the end of it.The narrative, introducing prospects of controlling computers through the human mind, resurrecting extinct animals, travelling to other planets and genetically enhancing our disease resistance, is exciting to read. The author claims that we might even be able to bring back the Neanderthal. However, he pinpoints the ethical dilemmas associated with such achievements by quoting Richard Klein, an anthropologist at Stanford: “Are you going to put the Neanderthals in a zoo or in Harvard?”In the last chapter, Kaku introduces the reader to an imaginary character living in the 22nd century. Biologically, he is in his 70s but the age of his organs is mid-30s. He rides a self-driven car. Nano-bots monitor the crucial indicators of his health while roaming in his bloodstream. What distinguishes this book from works of science fiction is that every prediction in the book is based on research and supported by prototypes being developed across the globe.Kaku also analyses the economic and social history of our civilisation and explains that new technologies are the engines of both scientific and social change. He rightly points out that the economic recessions of the 1850s, 1920s and 2008 were due to the “speculative fever” created around specific sectors: the railroad, automotive stocks and real estate, respectively.He warns that when the British Empire was shifting its focus from scientific innovation to more mundane matters of power-play, the US was emerging as a leader in research and advancement of knowledge in all fields. However, if the majority of the US talent is going into the investment sector and managing the finances of others, in which region will the most brilliant minds pursue the cause of innovation and exploring the truth?Kaku further chalks out the ranking of civilisations which was first introduced in 1964 by Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev — on the basis of the energy they consume. This ranking was mainly proposed to identify the powers of extra terrestrial intelligent civilisations and classify them into three types. Type I consumes planetary sources of energy, mainly sunlight that falls on their planet; Type II consumes all the energy produced by their sun, while Type III consumes the energy produced by all the stars of their galaxy. Our current status is perhaps that of a Type 0 since we consume the energy of dead plants (oil and coal). Kaku estimates that given the economic growth rate we will be able to achieve the status of a Type I civilisation by the end of the century.Physics of the Future not only tells us what is probable and possible in the future, it also gives researchers and inventors a timescale to measure their successes against. Moreover, it makes the reader feel excited about the times we are living in, when we can expect ‘miracles’ to happen in our lifetimes. Kaku points out that “By 2100, our destiny is to become like the gods we once worshipped and feared.”SOURCE: http://www.dawn.com/news/634292/non-f..."
271,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3352854-david-skip-everling,2,"I'm not sure about anybody's ability to predict a century into the future (especially if you give credence to the idea of accelerating returns in technology), but I was willing to give this book a shot after hearing Michio Kaku in interviews. In particular he piqued my curiosity with the claim that all the ideas in the book are grounded on currently existing prototypes or established scientific theory.Now after having read it, I think Michio is only giving a survey of some select topics, and the only ones that I think he handled well were the ones most closely linked to physics (e.g. space travel, nanotechnology & quantum behavior, global power generation). The other fields he dives into, particularly his analysis and extrapolation of consumer technologies, were disappointingly off target or lacking in proper depth.The book is occasionally so superficial in its treatment of some prototyped technologies that it reads somewhat like painfully outdated sci-fi from Michio's childhood in the 50's. The book is written to be highly accessible, but he does uninformed readers a disservice by giving equal weight to illogical and 'improbable but not impossible' possibilities. My biggest problem with his predictions are that they center on only a set of technologies that Kaku has experience with, extrapolated all the way out to 2100 without much consideration of how all the unmentioned possibilities will change his visions for the future.As an example, Michio doesn't do the best job keeping our present circumstances and his far future predictions from mixing anachronistically: e.g. the frequently repeated ""...when we carry around our own genomes on a CD-ROM"" for a ""2030-2070"" range prediction. I worry that Michio Kaku is just paraphrasing some of the ideas out there without really thinking about them any more critically, like a mediocre science journalist or sci-fi writer. Again this could be an artifact of his intentionally writing this book to be broadly accessible, but I don't think he found the right balance.The best parts of the book are in the second half, particularly his chapters on The Future of: Energy, Space Travel, Wealth, and Humanity (respectively) and I did enjoy most of this material despite a scattering of the same problems mentioned above. Sadly, I think Michio Kaku completely botched his concluding chapter, ""A Day in the Life in 2100"", and I think the preceding Future of Humanity chapter would have been a much stronger ending. The ""Day in the Life"" conclusion is silly speculative fiction and the best (worst?) example in the entire book of his anachronistic and muddled sci-fi visions. Michio Kaku is great when talking about physics and large scale trends closely linked to humanity's knowledge of physics, but judging from this book alone he doesn't put together upcoming technologies into realistic or compelling future scenarios very well at all, ending up with an incomplete picture somewhere in the uncomfortable border between imaginative thinking and unwarranted speculation."
272,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,4,"This is a fascinating survey of what's actually happening in the cutting edge of science and technology. He walks through computers and vehicles and energy and space exploration and even culture. For each area he discussed deeply what's happening now, then gives thoughtful guesses to what will develop in early 21st century, mid-century, and late-century. His understanding of science is broad AND deep. His vision of the future of science is compelling. Some highlights: Tiny computer chips will be embedded in everything--almost literally--and we'll live in a cloud of data that's ridiculous. Robots will outnumber humans--but they won't be able to do anything but the physical tasks we program them to do (including driving our cars and planes). Magnetism will finally be mastered and we'll run our world on magnetic power rather than electric power. And by the end of the century remote control robots will be building a moon base for us to continue looking into the stars. However, I docked him a star because he displays a naive understanding of culture and history. He makes sweeping mistakes like seeing being religious as the enemy of science when history actually shows that many of the greatest science cultures were so precisely because of their religious beliefs, or his easy dismissal of cultural conflicts in the new world and his idea that once food and shelter are universal then haves and have nots won't be a real issue. So read this for the tech ideas and endure his comments about becoming like the gods of old and reaching cultural utopia. "
273,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"Michio Kaku is a great science writer (as well as being a physics professor), but futurology is a difficult subject to make interesting and all too often what you get is lists of 'in the future you will have an X that will do Y,' which gets dull fairly quickly.Where Kaku's approach is good (which is to base his ideas on physics) is in the future of energy. His chapter on space exploration is good too - he is a great enthusiast for this, and that comes across strongly here. The only proviso is that the main controlling factor on space exploration is not science but politics. A man wasn't put on the moon for science, but to put the Russians in their place. We haven't done much manned exploration since for the same reason. It's too expensive for science to control things.To be honest I was even less convinced about the consumer technology ideas. If space exploration is driven by politics, consumer purchases are driven by the market. Yes, the science & technology has to be able to deliver (so you couldn't have an iPhone 10 years ago), but it doesn't decide what will and won't become popular.The book finishes with a chapter on the way the world will be a single civilization (even if nations still exist in a weakened form) by the end of the century. This seemed the least science-supported speculation. If anything we seem to be fragmenting more.All in all, a good try - but futurology remains closer to fiction than popular science."

275,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7070282-jenny-williams,5,"After reading this selection I strongly believe Michio Kaku is one of the brightest minds in his field. Physics Of The Impossible was an amazing book and this one blows it out of the water. I can't determine if I am so fond of it because of how advanced our technology will be in the near future or if I am truly fond of his writing. I know one thing for sure, some of the different advancements in technology is going to change the way we live life in way too many ways. What I mean by that is the advancement Kaku covers isn't technology like a new version of an XBOX or something of that sort. Michio Kaku covers advancement in technology like the worlds biggest atom smasher in Switzerland under a mountain, circling a mile exactly. This atom smasher is one of the biggest advancements in our technology opening doors to creating so much energy that we will be able to travel through space at a speed close to the speed of light. That's only the example I remembered best but there are so many throughout this book it excites you for our future. Kind of. "

Although, for someone who may have never read ""Visions"" or ""Physics of the Impossible"" (which too I had read in 2011-12), I strongly feel that ""Physics of the Future"" can tend to become very interesting if one likes to ponder on how technological the world is going to get within the next century, and how far will it be feasible to apply and integrate it within our daily lives.A Good Book, but a vast majority was already included amongst the first two of his books on the same genre. The chapter on the Future of Wealth, was kind of new though!A 3-star because the content was not new for me; otherwise I would rate it with a 4-star."

In fact, the action of the first film is kicked off by a message recorded in 3D by Princess Leia and conveyed by the robot...""

I came across Michio Kaku, as I am sure many others have, by watching an interview on television a few years ago, and I was struck by his loquaciousness and intelligence. Describing contemporary scientific concepts, especially quantum physics, in a way that a layman can understand is no small feat. In Physics of the Future, Kaku focuses on several industries (private space exploration, computer technology, medicine, and others) and tries to predict what respective advances we may expect by 2100. Oftentimes he uses examples from popular science fiction, specifically Star Trek, as a frame of reference. This book definitely falls into the 'pop science' category, with only brief asides into more technical and mathematical information. Any fans of popular science fiction work in film, television, or literature will be already be aware of many of the concepts here, and truthfully, any one of them could easily fill an entire book by itself (the 'recommended reading' section at the end is a goldmine for further exploration). Kaku sometimes makes sweeping generalizations without going into further detail that may seem presumptuous, but it is usually in attempt to keep the pace light. Also, since this was written in 2011, some sections appear a little dated even only six years later (an entire section on private space exploration, for example, doesn't mention either Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos, two of the forerunners in this field). Recommended for those looking for a brief overview of some of the exciting advances in technology that we can expect to look forward to over the course of our lifetime. For those looking for a deeper dive into any of the aforementioned subjects, the dozens of recommended works at the end should serve as an excellent primer. "
285,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,4,"Peering into the future of mankind and predicting what lies in store for us a few decades from now, has always been a dicey endeavour. In general, predictions pertaining to unchecked population growth, resultant famines, wars over access to resources, gloomy prospects for the future of developing nations etc have mostly proven to be unnecessary alarms rather than reality. A few major historical instances come to mind. Rev. Thomas Malthus in the late 18th century, Dr. Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University in the 1960s, and MIT's Club of Rome report in the 1970s were famous for damning our future, particularly that of India and China due to their large populations. We find that both India and China have done pretty well in the forty years since. On the other hand, predictions about the end of slavery, end of European colonialism, an era of less work and more leisure have all come true. It seems as though we tend to take both a gloomy and hopeful view of mankind and misjudge its potential for making correctives when it comes to how human beings, our societies, governments and institutions would behave in future under changing conditions.In contrast, predictions regarding scientific and technological advances in the fields of medicine, computers, biology, astronomy etc have more frequently proven to materialize successfully, at times sooner than expected. The Moore's Law comes to mind immediately. This book itself shows how accurately Jules Verne, in the mid 1800s, predicted life in Paris in the 1960s as consisting of skyscrapers, air-conditioning, TV, elevators, high-speed trains and fax machines. It seems as if we have a better grasp of machines and man's interactions with them and the development of this man-machine future. This book by theoretical Physicist Michio Kaku, crystal-gazes into this future as led by the advance of science and technology. Even if one does not accept all the projections, we end up learning a lot on what stunning possibilities are out there as we live out this century.The book is organized on what we can expect in the near term (by 2030), the mid term (2030-2070) and the long term (2070-2100). The future is explored through the domains of Computers, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Medicine, Nanotechnology, Energy and Space Travel. But it is not just speculation from a Theoretical Physicist. The author had discussed with hundreds of scientists who actually work today on these ideas and had compiled out of this interaction, what is possible in these three time periods. The presentation and language in the book is simple and accessible even to the average non-science minded reader and that, in my view, is a great positive about the book. I shall outline here some of the future products and possibilities given by Dr.Kaku which grabbed my mind:MRI machines which are just a foot long, looking like cell phones which can be passed over the human body and detect cancer (2030)Computers which scan fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) patterns in the brain and decipher a person's stream of consciousness and thereby detect what he/she is thinking (2070-2100)Computers being able to reconstruct a person's facial features given a strand of DNA from that person'e hair or bloodTissue engineering to manufacture a whole body part by extracting a few cells from the bodyResurrection of extinct life forms like the Mammoth or the NeanderthalNano-particles which enter and kill only cancer cells and leave healthy tissue untouchedchanging one shape to another at the push of a button, just like the T-1000 in 'Terminator-2'Molecular Replicators, capable of creating almost anything we want, the same way that nature can “take hamburgers and vegetables and turn them into a baby.”Fusion plants dotting the countryside by mid centuryLanding on an asteroid or on a moon of planet Mars, Space ElevatorsThe final couple of chapters deal with the future of humanity, planetary civilizations and how life would look in 2100. One can feel the child-like enthusiasm of Dr.Kaku in writing about all these possibilities and it makes the book enjoyable reading. He uses references to popular sci-fi movies from Hollywood to illustrate many of the ideas. In fact, as I read the book, I developed a greater respect for movie makers like that of the Terminator, Matrix, Star Wars, Avatar and so on.We have heard recently of anxieties being expressed about Artificial Intelligence and its destructive potential by luminaries like Bill Gates and Elon Musk. The eminent futurist, Ray Kurzweil has suggested in his work 'The Singularity is Near' that by 2045, a $1000 computer would be a billion times more intelligent than all humans combined and hence creating an uncontrolled runaway singularity. But others like Douglas Hofstadter and Mitch Kapor have dismissed these notions. This book discusses this topic substantially and believes that mankind will develop 'friendly AI' and use it to enhance itself rather than letting itself be ruled by mean-minded robots. Dr.Kaku shows six reasons why there are major roadblocks to such a singularity.On the negative side, just as in other books on the future, this one also has its tiresome speculation on the 'sick men of Asia'. Dr.Kaku quotes a report by Peter Schwartz of the Global Business Network on the dire future that is likely in the demographic nightmare of South Asia. Sea level rise due to Global warming in the latter half of this century could cause massive flooding and chaos, resulting in millions of refugees across the borders of Bangladesh into India. Governments could lose all authority and collapse, resulting in nightmarish looting and rioting. Rising tensions and chaos and inability to control may result in nations resorting to nuclear weapons!It is only scientists who tell us that Human societies, weather and climate are non-linear systems and even a very small change could have a massive effect, called the butterfly effect, making it difficult to predict the long-term futures. Then, I don't see how the author is so sure of destructive global warming in the future and also the consequent behavior of south Asians. In spite of being repeatedly wrong, futurists cannot seem to resist making dire predictions for the future of nations with large populations.The book is enjoyable reading and educative as well. I strongly recommend reading it. Even though Physics plays an important role in all the science that is discussed in the book, I am unsure of whether 'Physics of the Future' is the most meaningful title for the book. When I picked up the book initially, I thought it would be a book on String Theory."

Based off of the known laws of nature, author and world renowned theoretical physicist Michio Kaku met with, and interviewed, 300 of the leading scientists in the world about what our world will be like in the year 2100 through the ever increasing advancements of technology. This book lays out the most likely scenario of computers, AI, medicine, nanotechnology, energy, space travel and wealth from those interviews and how they will shape the world by the year 2100.Oh what a fantastic and thought provoking book this was! It's great to read a book about the future that isn't nihilistic, apocalyptic and negative, but rather hopeful and full of wonder! Sure, the very real threats of chaos, nuclear war, global warming etc are addressed in this book, but in ways that give rise to ways around such problems instead of weakly giving into them.I'm always wondering why every sci-fi movie based in the future has to be apocalyptic, or negative about where the world is going? It's easy to see the bad decisions we are making as humans that drive this thinking and make it seem like a sure reality to come, but where are the optimistic stories? Where are the stories that show us prospering and thriving as a world in the future? Those ideas and thoughts are in this book! Hopefully some good screenwriters and filmmakers will get inspired and make a movie based off the ideas in this book. I want to see it! Almost all of us alive now will not get to experience the world in the year 2100. Not unless of course the age reversal science described in the book becomes a reality (and it seems as though it's a very real possibility in the second half of this century), but this book brings much to the imagination of looking out a window, into the world at the dawn of the 22nd century. I can't say think of anything bad to say about this one. I absolutely loved everything about it. BUY IT!"
287,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Informed speculations engagingly presentedIt’s easy to see that Professor Kaku had a lot of fun writing this book since more than anything (at least for this reader) this book was a pleasure to read.Typically Kaku begins each chapter with some reference to the ancient gods or some other form of mythology or folklore, mainly for contrast or to highlight human yearnings that are being fulfilled today or may be fulfilled in the near future. He then mixes in some science fiction movies, stories or novels that he likes or finds instructive (or not). He adds some personal research and experiences with some of the great minds of our time as he makes his predictions, speculations and guesses on where we are going and when we are going to get there. Partly because of his celebrity and partly because of his wide-ranging knowledge and sharp intelligence (not to mention his charm) Kaku is able to talk with Nobel Prize winners and other cutting edge scientists and engineers all over the world the way most people talk to their neighbors. Areas of interest, each with its own chapter are computers, artificial intelligence, medicine, nanotechnology, energy, space travel, wealth (i.e., economics), and what life will be like in the future on a day-to-day basis. Each chapter gives Kaku’s speculations for the “Near Future (Present to 2030),” “Midcentury (2030 to 2070),” and the “Far Future (2070 to 2100).”I’m going to try to NOT second guess Kaku but I do want to focus on a few areas of personal interest and add a comment or two. “It is a law of evolution that fitter species arise to displace unfit species; and perhaps humans will be lost in the shuffle, eventually winding up in zoos where our robotic creations come to stare at us…Perhaps that is our role in history, to give birth to our evolutionary successors.” (p. 100)I think this is likely, especially if you add our genetically engineered successors. If so we can then think of ourselves as the “intelligent designers” of the demigods to come.Kaku weighs in on the possibility of our robotic creations becoming more intelligent than humans. (Seems very likely.) He speculates on robots producing “ever-smarter” robots that might “devour the resources of the planet in their insatiable quest to become ever more intelligent.” (p. 101) This can be seen as a near corollary of the idea that robots will become our masters and take over the planet. Since robots can only do what is programmed into them, these ideas depend on poor or malicious programming. (Beware the black hats of the future!)On page 116 Kaku points out that “there is no universally accepted definition of ‘smart.’” He doesn’t elaborate but I want to say that the unstated question is “smart for what”? Is the goal, e.g., happiness or world domination? A different kind of smarts might be required in each case.In talking about what jobs will still be available for humans in the midcentury future, Kaku makes the excellent point that those jobs will require “nonrepetitive work that requires pattern recognition.” (p. 305) He includes garbage collectors, police officers, construction workers, gardeners, and plumbers. However where I live as soon as they get a robot to drive the truck garbage collection will be a completely automated task. We have plastic containers set out on the street which are picked up and emptied by a mechanical arm from the truck. (Yes, the future is now.)In Chapter 8 “Future of Humanity” Kaku presents Nikolai Kardashev’s Type I, II, and III Civilizations based on energy consumption. (A Type II civilization, for example, consumes all the energy from their sun.) What I found interesting is Kaku’s statement that we “are leading to a single point: the creation of a planetary civilization.” (p. 327) I think the term “planetary civilization” is what we need to replace the currently (in some quarters) offensive term, “world government.”Kaku makes the sharp point that movies with “cross-cultural themes…packed with internationally recognized celebrities, are big money makers for Hollywood.” He sees this as “evidence of an emerging planetary culture.” (p. 334) He adds on the next page that “Local cultures will continue to survive, coexisting side by side with the larger global culture.”Some of Kaku’s dreams (perhaps) are room temperature super conductors and space elevators, to name just two that are highly speculative but would be amazing if realized.In the chapter on artificial intelligence, Kaku gives his three-pointed definition of consciousness. (Actually with becoming modesty he writes, “…if I were to venture a guess.”) In my book “The World Is Not as We Think It Is” I also give a three-pointed definition:“One: awareness of the world (including awareness of our self and our processes, that is, self-awareness).Two: self-identity. Notice that awareness of self is different from this identification with self.Three: experience or sensation, the feelings we get when we experience the world. This is sometimes called “phenomenal consciousness.” An example would be the subjective experience of the color red, or the taste of a strawberry.” (p. 82)Here is Kaku’s delineation from page 97:“1. sensing and recognizing the environment2. self-awareness3. planning for the future by setting goals and plans, that is, simulating the future and plotting strategy.”The slight differences are instructive. He leaves out self-identification, perhaps rightly so; and I leave out planning for the future. Also I presume that Kaku includes self-awareness in his first component. Personally I would include planning for the future in my first component, “awareness of the world” as well; however to emphasize “simulating the future” is a fine thing to do since humans are on another level in the animal kingdom when it comes to imagining what might happen.I should mention that in writing this book Kaku did not just tune into the zeitgeist but actually read prognosticators from the past. Two who did well were Benjamin Franklin and the Marquis de Condorcet. Since Kaku’s predictions are mostly favorable for humans, I hope his predictions do as well. --Dennis Littrell, author of “Hard Science and the Unknowable”"
288,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7227342-richard,3,"Michio Kaku's book, Physics of the Future, concludes with a comprehensive prediction of what life will like in 2100 as the subtitle indicates. The majority of the book is made up of predictions about how technology will evolve in the intervening years.The book was written in 2011, so some its contents are already dated. Interestingly, certain predictions about the near future have already come to pass. Other predictions appear to be a little delayed. To be clear, Mr. Kaku is very humble in the introduction about the ability to predict the future. One of the concrete statements he makes about the future is the idea there is a great deal to be optimistic about. He examines individuals in the past who were pessimistic about the development of technology, and he shows how wrong these individuals proved to be in time. For this reason, I think he is correct to say the future belongs to the optimists.I enjoyed the book; however, I don't think it is worth more than 3 stars. It has some important ideas, but the audience is narrow to a certain extant. It seems to offer inspiration to the future scientists who will make these breakthroughs; however, it isn't as relevant to the average reader. We will eventually see the changes predicted, but they are mostly decades away. "
289,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467608-serro,4,"This is a great book by a great physicist. I only rate it 4 stars because his thoughts and predictions can only be tested in 2100. I promise to raise my rating to 5 starts in 2100 if his predictions are correct. That is because according to Michio Kaku medicine will evolve greatly allowing people to live a lot longer than now. Not that I don't plan on living for 113 years as it is.The reader will find insights about the future of computers and AI, medicine and nanotechnology, space travel and energy. Kaku also takes on the nature of humanity as a whole in the next 100 years.And bear in mind these are not the predictions of Nostradamus, Michi Kaku knows first hand what he writes about."
290,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55246199-erin,3,"I love Michio Kaku! I'm only giving this one 3 Stars because it is pretty similar to some of his other works and he repeats these concepts. This is only noticable since I have read his other books, but if you haven't and are interested in theoretical physics, give this a try!"
291,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20481392-james-biser,4,"This scientist has an interesting view of what will happen at the end of the current century. Because he studies what is happening with our culture, he can anticipate what advancements will be made and when we can expect them. This is a good read:"
292,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1080484-teji,4,"The author’s passion for both physics and science-fiction is evident throughout this piece of speculative non-fiction. The work explores several areas of emerging technology and applied science, not just quantum physics. As the author notes, his predictions are “reasoned estimates of when the prototype technologies of today will finally reach maturity”. His extrapolation of what he thinks is likely to occur in the near (2010-2030), mid (2030-20700, and far (2070-2100) future, are intriguing and thought provoking. The organization is very repetitive-- almost as if it were written as a series of articles that were later post-edited into a book format (although I don't think that is the case). Also, the writing is a little dry in places-- but not intolerably so. Additionally, when speaking of the future, the author tends to geek out and engage in overwrought, almost giddy, statements about the “godlike” powers technology will grant humans within the next century. These flaws aside, overall, the writing is coherent and accessible. It will be interesting to see how well his forecasts for the next couple of decades hold-up.Quotes(view spoiler)[[In his novel, Paris in the Twentieth Century, written in 1863, Jules Verne] “predicted that Paris in 1960 would have glass skyscrapers, air conditioning, TV, elevators, high-speed trains, gasoline-powered automobiles, fax machines, and even something resembling the Internet…just a few years later he made another spectacular prediction. In 1865, he wrote From the Earth to the Moon, in which he predicted the details of the mission that sent our astronauts to the moon…He accurately predicted the size of the space capsule to within a few percent, the location of the launch site in Florida…the weightlessness that the astronauts would experience, and the final splashdown in the ocean…How was Jules Verne able to predict 100 years into the future with such breathtaking accuracy? His biographers have noted that, although Verne was not a scientist himself he constantly sought out scientists…He amassed a vast archive summarizing the great scientific discoveries of his time. Verne, more than others, realized that science was the engine shaking the foundations of civilization, propelling it into a new century with unexpected marvels and miracles.” -Introduction“Another great prophet of technology was Leonardo da Vinci, painter, thinker, and visionary…Like Jules Verne, Leonardo was able to get profound insights into the future by consulting a handful of forward-thinking individuals of his time…In addition, Leonardo was always experimenting, building, and sketching models, a key attribute of anyone who wants to translate thinking into reality.” -Introduction“As William Gibson…once said, ‘The future is already here. It’s just unevenly distributed.” -Introduction“Predictions for the future, with a few exceptions, have always underestimated the pace of technological progress.” -IntroductionThere are four fundamental forces in nature that drive the entire universe: gravity (unlocking the force of gravity helped to pave the way for the Industrial Revolution and the introduction of steam power, especially the locomotive), electromagnetic force (this unleashed the electronic revolution that has created a bounty of scientific wonders), and the two nuclear forces: the weak and strong forces. “When Einstein wrote down e=mc^2 and when the atom was split in the 1930s, scientists for the first time began to understand the forces that light up the heavens…the secret behind the stars…it also held out the promise that one day we would be able to harness this power on the earth”… quantum theory “has given us the transistor, the laser, and the digital resolution that is the driving force behind modern society. -Introduction“Exponential growth is often hard to grasp, since our minds think linearly. It is so gradual that you sometimes cannot experience the change at all. But over decades, it can completely alter everything around us. According to Moore's law, every Christmas your new computer games are almost twice as powerful (in terms of the number of transistors) as those from the previous year. Furthermore, as the years pass, this incremental gain becomes monumental. For example, when you receive a birthday card in the mail, it often has a chip that sings ‘Happy Birthday’ to you. Remarkably, that chip has more computer power than all the Allied forces of 1945. Hitler, Churchill, or Roosevelt might have killed to get that chip…Today, your cell phone has more computer power than all of NASA back in 1969, when it placed two astronauts on the moon…” Ch1“Today, when we enter a room, we automatically look for the light switch since we assume that the walls are electrified. In the future, the first thing we will do on entering a room…is to assume the room is intelligent…Around 2020, the price of a chip may also drop to about a penny…then we will have millions of chips distributed everywhere in our environment, silently carrying out our orders.” -Ch1“One reason why Moore's law has relentlessly increased the power of chips is because UV light can be tuned so that its wavelength is smaller and smaller, making it possible to etch increasingly tiny transistors onto silicon wafers. Since UV light has a wavelength as small as 10 nanometers, this means that the smallest transistor that you can etch is thirty atoms across…But this process cannot go on forever…You can even calculate roughly when Moore’s law will finally collapse: when you finally hit transistors the size of individual atoms… According to the laws of physics, eventually the Age of Silicon will come to a close, as we enter the Post-Silicon Era. Transistors will be so small that quantum theory or atomic physics takes over and electrons leak out of the wires…At that point, according to the laws of physics, the quantum theory takes over. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that you cannot know both the position and the velocity of any particle…at the atomic level you simply cannot know where the electron is, so it can never be confined precisely in an ultrathin wire or layer and it necessarily leaks out, causing the circuit to short-circuit.” Ch1“However, scans of the human brain clearly show that thinking is spread out over large parts of the brain...Digital computers can calculate at nearly the speed of light. he human brain, by contrast, is incredibly slow. Nerve impulses travel at an excruciatingly slow pace of about 200 miles per hour. But the brain more than makes up for this because it is massively parallel… In a race, a superfast single processor is left in the dust by a superslow parallel processor.” Ch2“While hardware had grown [exponentially] by the ability to etch smaller and smaller transistors onto a wafer, software is totally different; it requires a human to sit down with a pencil and paper to write code. That is the bottleneck: the human. Software, like all human creative activity, progresses in fits and starts, with brilliant insights and long stretches of drudgery and stagnation.” Ch2“…genetic analysis shows that aging is concentrated in the ""engine"" of the cell, the mitochondria, or the cell’s power plant. This has allowed scientists to…look for ways to accelerate the gene repair process inside the mitochondria to reverse the effects of aging.” Ch3“Normally, we don’t see quantum forces at work in everyday life. But quantum forces are everywhere…if we are largely empty, then why can’t we walk through walls?...The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons can exit in the same quantum state. Hence, when two nearly identical electrons get too close, they repel each other. This is the reason objects appear to be solid, which is an illusion…When we sit on a chair...we are hovering above the chair, floating less than a nanometer above it, repelled by the chair’s electrical and quantum forces.” Ch4“The quantum theory has only one thing going for it: it is correct. Its accuracy has been measured to one part in ten billion, making it the most successful physical theory of all time.” Ch4“Science and technology are the engines of prosperity…” Ch7“The combination of changing social conditions and the mastery of the four forces propelled Europe to the forefront of nations. But technologies are dynamic, changing all the time. They are born, evolve, and rise and fall…technologies obey certain laws of evolution. Mass technologies usually evolve in four basic stages…In stage I, the products of technology are so precious that they are closely guarded. Paper, when it was invented in the form of papyrus by the ancient Egyptians…was so precious that one papyrus scroll was closely guarded by scores of priests…Paper entered stage II around 1450, when Gutenberg invented the movable type…one person could possess one book containing the knowledge of hundreds of scrolls. Before Gutenberg, there were only 30,000 books in all Europe. By 1500, there were 9 million books…By around 1930, paper hit stage III, when the cost fell to a penny a sheet. This made possible the personal library, where one person could possess hundreds of books. Paper became an ordinary commodity…Paper is everywhere and nowhere, invisible and ubiquitous. Now we are in stage IV, where paper is a fashion statement. We decorate our world with paper of all colors, shapes, and sizes. The largest source of urban waste is paper. So paper evolved from being a closely guarded commodity to being waste.” Running water, electricity, and computer have followed the same pattern. Ch7“But as technologies evolve, they create abrupt changes in the economy that sometimes lead to social dislocations. In any revolution, there are winners and losers…What jobs will flourish by midcentury? How will the evolution of technology change the way we work? We can partially determine the answer by asking a simple question: What are the limitations of robots? As we have seen, there are at least two basic stumbling blocks to artificial intelligence: pattern recognition and common sense. Therefore, the jobs that will survive in the future are…ones that require these two abilities.” Ch7“Developing nations may be able to take advantage of the information revolution. They can, in principle, leapfrog past the developed nations in many areas. In the developed world, telephone companies had to tediously wire up every home or farm at great cost. But a developing nation does not have to wire up its country, since cell phone technology can excel in rural areas without any roads or infrastructure. Also, developing nations have the advantage that they do not have to rebuild an aging infrastructure…” Ch7“…the Unites States has maintained its dominance in science and technology in spite of the fact that U.S. students often score dead last when it comes to essential subjects like science and math…(It should also be pointed out that this ranking corresponds roughly to the number of days that students were in school. China, which ranked number 1, averaged 251 days of instruction per year, while the United States averaged only 178 days per year.) It seems like a mystery that, despite these awful numbers, the United States continues to do well internationally in science and technology, until you realize that much of the U.S science [talent] comes from overseas. The United States has a secret weapon, the H1B visa…But the H1B visa is only a stopgap measure. The United States cannot continue to live off foreign scientists, many of whom are beginning to return to China and India as their economies improve…The United States will eventually have to overhaul its archaic, sclerotic education system. At present, poorly prepared high school students flood the job market and universities…Employers continually bemoan the fact that they have to take one year to train their new hires to bring them up to speed. And the universities are burdened by having to create new layers of remedial courses to compensate for the poor high school education system…” Ch7“When physicists try to analyze civilizations, we rank them on the basis of the energy they consume. This ranking was first introduced in 1964 by Russian astrophysicists Nikolai Kardashev…he proposed three theoretical types: A Type I civilization is planetary, consuming the sliver of sunlight that falls on their planet, or about 10^17 watts. A Type II civilization is stellar, consuming all the energy that their sun emits, or 10^27 watts. A Type III civilization is galactic, consuming the energy of billions of stars, or about 10^37 watts…Each type is separated by a factor of 10 billion: a Type III civilization consumes 10 billion times more energy than at Type II civilization…which in turn consumes 10 billion times more energy than a Type I civilization. According to the classification, our present-day civilization is Type 0. We don’t even rate on this scale, since we get our energy from dead plants, that is from oil and coal. (Carl Sagan, generalizing this classification...[estimated] that we are actually a Type .7 civilization…we can mathematically estimate that we will attain Type I status in about 100 years, given an average rate of economic growth.” Ch8“Also, if room temperature superconductors are found in this century, it means a complete overhaul of our energy requirements. Waste heat, in the form of friction, will be greatly reduced, increasing the efficiency of our machines. As we mentioned, the majority of our energy consumption, especially transportation, goes into overcoming friction…it would take almost no energy to move from California to New York if there were no friction.” Ch8 (hide spoiler)]"
293,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9619705-anna,0,I just want to see an updated version of this book explaining why most of short term predictions didn't work out.
294,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,2,"The book was extremely informative about current trends in science (and some technology). It lives up to its title in discussing physics of the future. The author is a skilled writer who is gifted at communicating highly abstract and obscure ideas.So why only two stars?I did have some issues with the overall books and how this project was carried out. Some were more troubling than others. The major issues include:1) Too much scientific triumphalism -- The clear storyline in the book is that science will render most of the troubles of life either moot or less relevant. Diseases will go away, aging will be suppressed, and immortality lies around the corner! Hovercraft will be developed, robots will be everywhere and solve our problems, and traditional issues of scarcity re health and food will go away. I suspect that this technological paradise is being oversold, just a bit. Lifespan has been extended, but arguably more by prenatal and care for newborns, coupled with public health measures such as mass inoculation coupled with the aggressive combating of traditional killers like smallpox. We still haven't figured out much regarding the flu or the common cold! Yes there has been progress, but is heaven really that near? Have we proven ourselves worthy of godlike status?2) There is very little on economics throughout the book. The author has apparently read some of Thurow's futurist work but not much else. Science and technology need to be brought to market and commercialized before they can hope to revolutionize our lives. Perhaps the government will do it all?? Well the government might fund defense research and NSF grants but last I heard it still did limited work on commercialization.3) What about politics? The twentieth century brought amazing advances in science and technology but also rule by thugs, gangsters, and murderers that applied technology to the extermination of millions. Oh Brave New World . . . . !4) The author pushes his futurist motivation -- using a near future, mid future, and far future framework, but in the end it comes down to extrapolation between two poles - heaven or catastrophe, with the chance of catastrophe severely discounted. Not much of a choice!5) The author raises the need for education in science and technology, suggesting that they have read Goldin and Katz, but only talk about it in the context of H1B visas and information intensive jobs that go wanting. What about the increasing numbers of people in the US who are almost completely left out of the new age because of their poor education and training? Kaku may be setting up the world of Wells' Time Machine without knowing it. How can we move into a scientific and technology heaven, when most people are fit to work at Wal-Mart at best? What will all the dummies do once the robots take over our jobs? . . . which negative utopia comes to mind? the Matrix??6) This could be partially excused, since no author is perfect and the book is informative. What is more troubling about the book is that it is two or three chapters too long and the extra chapters detract from the book's value. Once the author moves from the descriptive and commentary and mild extrapolation in most ot the book to a more normative tone when he discusses the evolution of a planetary civilization, he loses me completely. He takes a framework by Kardashev to identify civilizations we might encounter from space and order them by energy use (???) and applies it to how our civilization might develop. Note here, we are using a framework with absolutely no data or experience behind it, with the exception of the sci-fi movie genre, and turning it into the summary framework for a book purporting to provide an update to general readers on the state of research in physics!! Needless to say I was not convinced and was chuckling - for the wrong reasons -- as I worked through the end of the book. This appears to be a common problem in big reach synthesis boos -- Ian Morris' book on why the West rules comes to mind, although the latter is a much better book overall.5) By the end of the book, I was wondering if there were particular reasons why Kaku appeared to have ""lost it"" when he just should have stopped writing fifty pages sooner.6) Overall, I don't regret reading it. I just regret finishing it."

I'll get some criticism out of the way, because overall I did enjoy the book.I have seen interviews and tv shows he's been in and though I do like him sometimes his atitude bothers me for some reason. I can't quite put my finger on it, maybe it has something to do with this slightly over-pandering way of explaining things. It looks like he thinks the only way his readers will understand what he's saying is by constantly referencing Star Treck, Star Wars and other products of science fiction which really isn't needed. I understood him perfectly well when he talked about portable MRI machines and DNA chips before he felt the need to display a picture of a Star Treck ""tricorder"" (just in case we couldn't grasp the idea by ourselves). I thought these constant references were a bit odd because this isn't a hard book to comprehend. It's not necessarily insulting but at the same time it feels a little condescending. This is especialy present in the final chapter (""A Day in a Life in 2100""). It was completely unecessary and cringeworthy, he may be a great theoretical physicist but he is not a great writer (outside of non-fiction, at least). That said, I learnt a lot from this book. I will probably forget most of it, I admit, but it made me feel up to date on our current technological advancements. I liked the way he split up each chapter, making it nicely organized and easy to navigate through. It was great reading about realistic predictions for the future of computers, AI, energy, nanotechnology and space travel. The future of wealth was also discussed which took me by surprise and I sincerely apreciated it, since it really is something important to consider.As he talks about the future of humanity he introduces some very interesting concepts. It leaves me excited for things to come and curious of how it will change our way of life.Obviously, we should all take these predictions with a grain of salt. I'm sure Michio Kaku has more or less figured out the near future, but up to the year 2100 he gets quite vague. Some people see it as a bad thing, but I don't blame him. Any book we read, from an author who goes out of his areas of expertise must not be taken for granted. I have seen people comment on misuse of terminology and a lot of non consideration for alternate scenarios. This is why I love people like Richard Dawkins, who write books within their fields and whose content I absolutely trust.It's a nice book if you don't look upon it as a definitive guide to the future.I am now in the mood for some science fiction though."

297,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5526063-mary-jean-harris,3,"This was quite a good book with lots of fascinating predictions for the future, as well as a survey of technologies currently being developed. I'd give it 3.5 stars (you need 1/2 stars, Goodreads!). Michio Kaku writes about the places he's visited, mostly research labs, that are working on new technologies, including bioengineering, nanotechnology, quantum computers, robotics, gene therapy, self-driving cars, space travel, and space elevators. Kaku's enthusiasm for these future changes is undying throughout the book, and it makes an enjoyable read. I can't agree with him that all this will result in positive change for the future though, especially as technology becomes more invasive and embedded into our lives, drawing us even further apart from the natural world as well as opening up the possibility for people (and governments and organizations) to control us in this system. It sounds eerily similar to the matrix, but Kaku doesn't seem overly concerned about any of these issues.Additionally, Kaku unfortunately falls into the trap of global warming hysteria: he takes it for granted that humanity is causing a climate crisis, a position that is highly contented and strewn with propaganda. As a scientist analysing a complicated issue, Kaku does not apply his own standards of rational inquiry to this issue and instead accepts the politically correct position that, even if he dug a little deep into the issue before writing the book, he would realize is not supported by many climate scientists.Also, although I liked the last chapter about ""a day in the life in 2100"" overall, it was really corny and, for some reason, the main guy we're following works at an office with only men...do no females work in the industry?. Also, this online dating stuff has become prevalent and people just do it naturally, something I find really creepy.But despite these problems with the book, it was a great read overall and definitely accessible to the general public."

I know it is very difficult to give a solid logical answer to this question. I liked the book but I do not agree with Kaku on many points. I think Kaku used almost a linear model for predicting the future. I think we need more imaginative power for predicting the future. Like Kaku I too believe that, gene technology, computers, artificial intelligence and robots will advance rapidly. The book is composed of the following nine chapters: 1. Future of the Computer: Mind over Matter, 2. Future of AI: Rise of the Machines, 3. Future of Medicine: Perfection and Beyond, 4. Nanotechnology: Everything from Nothing?, 5. Future of Energy: Energy from the Stars, 6. Future of Space Travel: To the Stars, 7. Future of Wealth, 8. Future of Humanity: Planetary Civilization, and 9. A Day in the Life in 2100. Kaku's approach is excellent, as if he is talking to a lay person, but he writes with a simple eloquence that makes these complex concepts accessible to the non-Physicist mind.Michio is too good in predicting the limitations of the technologies. One may argue that Michio's idea of robots and computers is similar to the AI from the movies in the 1990s, but we have to think year 2020 much brighter. Development on medicine, synthetic biology and nanotechnology is almost ignored. I was expecting more about quantum biology but that too is missing. But overall I liked the book. The book is good enough to stimulate our imagination."

Kaku's style of writing is informative and accessible, and the only time I found myself starting to lose focus was during the fictional narrative covering a typical day in 2100. In a way, that section suffers from a lack of imagination in what people would be like, despite having well thought out possibilities for technology; it seems more like an example of what someone from today would act like if we had all of that technology today. Still, that got me thinking about things... like, one hundred years ago, someone wouldn't have even been able to conceive of the internet, but even if they could imagine it, they probably wouldn't be able to foresee the rise of things like social media, youtube, etc. and how those things are changing the way humanity deals with privacy and public appearance.Kaku's pretty optimistic about the future (he even only mentions the idea of humanity going extinct one time), so this book is at times almost like a really well researched version of the cliched utopian future. Fortunately the book's foundation is in science and balances that vision with various realistic possibilities, and in any case it's a great source of basic information related to physics for the layperson."
