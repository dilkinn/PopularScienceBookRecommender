0,0393064980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/173077-robyn,5,"Okay, so I had to skip at least one chapter because there was simply no way I was going to understand the terminology. Otherwise, this is a great collection, especially for someone like me who'd never read Gould before. His essays are eclectic and just amazing in the breadth of topics they cover. I learned a great deal about biology, evolution, paleontology, and the history of science. What an amazing perspective and fascination this man had with how science is done and how it has evolved. I didn't finish all the essays, but plan on going back to it, as well as reading more, because it's just a great example of a scientist making his work accessible and intersting."
1,0393064980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/407441-wens-tan,5,"""The Richness of Life"", a selection of Stephen Jay Gould's prolific essays, is an excellent introduction to Gould's major works and thinking. Those new to natural history would find this collection a useful anchor to navigate Gould's other works, for his careful attention to detail, even in his popular science books, can be daunting to beginners. In Gould's works, he often begins by asking a very specific question, then in elucidating the mystery, illustrates a general concept. ""I have come to understand the power of treating generalities by particulars. It is no use writing a book on ""the meaning of life"" (though we all long to know the answers to such great questions, while rightly suspecting that true solutions no not exist!). But an essay on ""the meaning of 0.400 hitting in baseball"" can reach a genuine conclusion with surprisingly extensive relevance to such broad topics as the nature of trends, the meaning of excellence, and even (believe it or not) the constitution of natural reality. You have to sneak up on generalities, not assault them head-on. One of my favorite lines, from G.K. Chesterton, proclaims: ""Art is limitation; the essence of every picture is the frame."" --- Introduction to the Revised and Expanded Edition, The Mismeasure of Man. He takes pleasure in finding the historical origins of ideas and theories, quoting frequently from original sources (""I pride myself on always quoting from original sources [...:] I am no Latin scholar, but I can read and translate most works in this universal scientific language of Beringer's time."" --- The lying stones of Marrakech). Where he doesn't quote, he describes elegantly in rich detail, such that one feels participant to the study. At the same time, he gives sufficient modern information and analysis to help the reader understand the significance of the actions. This is well-illustrated in his essay ""Worm for a century, and for all seasons"" on Charles Darwin's last book, ""The Formation of Vegetable Mould, Through the Action of Worms, With Observations on Their Habits"":""Thus, we have three principles [for carrying out historical science:]. [...:] One may discuss these principles directly or recognize the 'little problems' that Darwin used to exemplify them: orchids, coral reefs, and worms.""""[In his treatise, Darwin:] uses two major types of arguments to convince us that worms form the vegetable mold. He first proves that worms are sufficiently numerous and widely spread in space and depth to do the job. He demonstrates 'what a vast number of worms live unseen by us beneath our feet' - some 53,767 per acre (or 356 pounds of worm) in good British soil. He then gathers evidence from informants throughout the world to argue that worms are far more widely distributed, and in greater range of apparently unfavorable environments, than we usually imagine. He digs to see how deeply they extend into the soil, and cuts one in two at fifty-five inches, although others report worms at eight feet down or more.""This approach means that there always is something new and interesting to look forward to in Gould's essays, even when you could predict his conclusion. And his general truths (like most general truths, are not particularly novel) do not seem trite, but are rather, rational extensions of his investigations. __________________""The Richness of Life"" is divided into eight major section:- Autobiography- Biography (of other scientists)- Evolutionary Theory- Size, Form and Shape- Stages and Sequences (of the notion of progress) - Sociobiology and Evolutionary Psychology- Racism, Scientific and Otherwise- ReligionEach section begins with a helpful introductory passages by Steven Rose to understand the social circumstances of some of these debates. "
2,0393064980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11490174-peter,0,"A beautiful summary of a brilliant career, but make sure you have a few weeks available. It's engrossing, but unless you're a paleontologist, you'll struggle a bit. "
3,0393064980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/553055-trane,5,"I've always been a fan of Stephen Jay Gould, so The Richness of Life was an immediate must-read for me, even though it collects a lot of material that I've already read in one form or another. But mutation, hybridization, and transformation are all parts of the evolutionary process, right? So why wouldn't I want to see the essays and chapters that I'd read before genetically recombined in this newly collected body of work? (And besides, any writing that's only worth reading once wasn't really worth reading in the first place.)Paul McGarr and Steven Rose had a pretty daunting task in front of them — culling an intelligible collection of 'hits' from around 22 books and essay collections is no easy task — but they've managed to put together a selection that works well on a thematic level and that covers the major themes of Gould's intellectual and scientific pursuits about as thoroughly as possible within the confines of a 600 page book. The eight thematic sections that the book is divided into are 1) Autobiography, 2) Biographies, 3) Evolutionary Theory, 4) Size, Form, and Shape, 5) Stages and Sequences, 6) Sociobiology and Evolutionary Psychology, 7) Racism, Scientific and Otherwise, and 8) Religion. The only thing I thought might make this an even better collection would be an added appendix that included a layperson's dictionary of the central scientific terms at work across Gould's essays.Gould does a fantastic job of recreating scientific points of view that have been historically superseded so that we can see what's interesting about the thinking behind them even though it may have been a fundamentally incorrect mode of thinking. He also investigates the biographies of scientific thinkers and makes interesting connections between history, biography, and the various forms that scientific thinking has taken. He has a brilliant essay on Cuvier's belief in the fixity of species and on geological catastrophism (i.e. Noah's flood) and how despite these beliefs Cuvier was a masterful empiricist who essentially invented paleontology as we know it today. An equally brilliant essay discusses the importance of Darwin's fascination with worms and the way in which observing worms helped him to understand the extent of radical change that could take place over long periods of time via processes that were almost too slow to observe at the immediate level of human temporal perception. In addition to his more important work of debunking the bad science of early race theorists and eugenicists, Gould also does a great job of investigating things like home run records and the ""evolution of the chocolate bar"" using statistical analysis .Where I think Gould is at his best, however, is at presenting an account of evolution that allows us to see it at work in all of its non-teleological glory. One of the problems about thinking about evolution is that its so hard for the mind to get beyond ""just-so"" stories that posit 'the ability to eat the leaves off of tall trees' as the 'reason' for the giraffe's long neck. Even though we may know that the neck derives ultimately from a process of random mutation and natural selection and that the neck survives as a trait because it was accidentally successful, we still have a tendency to reverse cause and effect. Gould is excellent at writing in such a way that the mind begins to get away from the 'just-so' habit, instead seeing evolution for the incredible process that it really is. Gould presents an image for us of what I might call ""the miracle of the non-teleogical world""; i.e. Gould insists that a proper understanding of evolutionary theory does not make the world a less miraculous place, but rather it makes it even more miraculous since the chain of events that is necessary to produce any individual life form is staggering. Likewise, the statistical probability of any particular life form coming into being is so vast that the fact that we're sitting in the middle of such a huge variety of randomly generated life forms is in itself a cause for momentous wonder.I thought about that this morning as I sliced a breakfast kiwi open. I've always thought that the shape of the round kiwi seed ring that you seen when you cut the kiwi open across the short axis of its body is one of the most beautiful things available to the eye. The tone of green and yellow and the specs of black that seem to float like a firework in mid-explosion have always struck me as gorgeous. And yet the reasons for the form that the evolution of the kiwi has taken have absolutely nothing to do with me. This aesthetic thrill that I have every time I eat a kiwi is nothing but pure accident. Not only does the kiwi's seed distribution have nothing to do with me, but the way my eye has evolved to find certain geometric patterns and forms inherently pleasing has almost nothing to do with those seeds in the kiwi. And yet all of this accident comes together in a breakfast moment that is always pleasing and aesthetically full for me. What luck that such a chance pairing could be formed, out of all the probabilities that have lurked in the depths of time."
4,0393064980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21974004-marc-incitti,4,"Gould speaks expertly of statistics and uses classic literature examples as a framing device to convey his message: Enjoy Yourself, It's Later than You Think! [props to Louis Prima.]"
5,0393064980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8767419-bradley-roth,4,I only give four stars because I've already read most of these articles in Gould's previous book. A first-time reader of Stephen Jay Gould would probably give it a five.
6,0393064980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2578079-roger-bailey,4,"I really liked this book. I would not have given it four stars if I didn't. Stephen J. Gould was a great promoter and contributor to the science of evolutionary biology. As a writer of popular science he was also a great promoter of philosophical materialism. For all that I congratulate him, admire him and respect him.However, there is something about him that exasperates me and a lot of room in this book was turned over to that. He bends over backwards to make excuses for religion. He claims that religion and science inhabit nonoverlapping majesteria and deal with entirely different matters and that there is no contradiction between them. That denies the historical record. It ignores the incompatible philosophical basis for both religion and science. The contradictory philosophical bases are idealism and materialism. He shows no awareness of that dichotomy. He does show an awareness of the historical record of censorship of science and persecution of scientists by religious forces by actually referring to some of the most well known examples, but then he goes right ahead and keeps proclaiming his nonoverlapping majesteria position as if he had not just cited its contradiction. He declares himself to be a Jewish agnostic, but then chooses to speak on behalf of religion itself. That is exemplified in his story of a student who came to him and was upset that evolution seemed to be contradicting his religion. Gould just told him that there was no contradiction despite the fact that so many religionists proclaim the contradiction themselves.The main basis that he uses to make this claim is the word of two popes. One declared that it was okay for Catholics to believe in evolution if it turned out to be true while obviously hoping that it was not true and the other finally said that the evidence had become too overwhelming and that it was true, but that Catholics had to still believe in superstitious concepts like the infusion of the soul into humans at some time in their evolutionary history. Okay, the popes are supposed to dictate what Catholics believe, but this ignores the fact that a lot of Catholics disagree with the pope on various issues. And even if the Catholics accept evolution it is only one religion. Gould dismisses creationists as just a small group of fundamentalists and still ignores that a lot of major religions such as the Muslims have never accepted evolution. Just because the head of one religion has been forced by the facts into accepting something that he has a distaste for does not mean that all the contradictions between religion and science have just evaporated.Read the book. Enjoy the parts that really tell you about science. Please, though, try to be critical about the parts on religion."
7,0393064980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12662225-darius,4,"""The Richness of Life: The Essential Stephen Jay Gould"" is a collection of Gould's essays, mostly about evolution.This is not a breezy book; even skipping, it took me months. Nevertheless, it is a rewarding book to anyone who is already past the basic misconceptions about evolution and wants to understand it in a little more detail.If you still have doubts about evolution vs. creationism/""intelligent design"", this may not be the book for you. If you think evolution is a process where individual organisms adapt to their changing environments, or if you think things like ""since modern society rewards intelligence, humans will continue evolve into more intelligent beings"", you will need a more basic book than this one.Here are examples of a few misconceptions this book does tackle, and which resonated with my personal level of ignorance:1. If a feature exists and has lasted for centuries, it must have some evolutionary advantage. (Perhaps a biologist would think this is a laughable misconception, but I've always thought it was plausible.)2. Features have to develop very incrementally. So, it is not good enough to explain the advantage of some feature. In order to show that it was produced by evolution, one must also explain the evolutionary advantage of hypothetical features that must have existed and grown into the final feature.3. Slow changes explain the bulk of evolution, and major cataclysms, warmings, coolings, asteroids, and so on only explain a small part of historical changes.4. Natural variation is entirely random. Of course this could be true depending on the usage of ""random"". However, take Gould's example of a few islands where one could classify snails on the islands by two distinct patterns: A and B. One might think that the ""A"" types on the different islands all had a common ancestor, as did all the ""B"". However, in fact, they do not. The similar distinguishing factor evolved independently in the different populations. In a similar example, three types of Zebra, evolved their striping independently. [And, on an unrelated note, Zebras are white with black stripes, not black with white stripes.]5. Evolution favors intelligence, and it is somewhat inevitable that humans would finally rise to become the dominant species."
8,0393064980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27549056-jan-peregrine,4,"Gould was a celebrated evolutionary biologist and paleontologist who the U.S. Congress in 2000 declared a living legend. He only lived a couple more years, having lived with mesothelioma since 1982. I'm very interested in what he was so passionate about, but this is the first time i read him and the tome was all my public library offered. It gave me lots of his 300 essays from his twenty books, including one that won a National Book Award, and some book excerpts.Gould described himself an agnostic who deeply respects religion and understands that science and religion do not overlap, but can be separate ways of understanding the world. He's certainly knowledgeable about evolution and paleontology, teaching me a few good things that'll stick with me, but the last section about religion impresses me as both respectful and skeptical.I'm not a baseball fan, but he definitely is and uses baseball metaphors in his essays. I did skip around this 635-page book and skim some too. You'll enjoy reading a lot of the book that pays homage to a great scientist and writer. I didn't usually feel he was too intellectual to understand, either. He's a Charles Darwin fan and yet he could criticize the founder of evolution in a way that made sense and was engaging. It's not that he found Darwin wrong, but that he didn't go far enough because of the limits set by his Victorian society and research. I don't know why he didn't call himself an atheist since he doesn't even believe there's a soul, but I think his great optimism not only kept him living with cancer so long, but made him want to reach out to religious people with compassion. interesting guy!"
9,0393064980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18858180-francisco-c-mara-ferreira,4,"I have taken a long time to read this very good compilation of what the authors considered to be the most representative work of the famous prolific science-writer (and brilliant evolutionary biologist) Stephen Jay Gould. I have to admit that as far as science-writing goes i still think no-one beats Carl Sagan..However I did learn much about geology, paleontology and especially evolutionary biology from reading this thick (and at times difficult to follow due to my ignorance) book. Can't help thinking that if books that attempt to describe real science from following universal scientific reasoning methodology such as this (and any of Sagan's) were made mandatory reading for (at least) science undergraduates perhaps the we would be educating better scientists and humans in general...Given the shockingly sad result of the very recent referendum that took place in the UK I think I should end this short review by citing a few lines of what is perhaps one of the most insightful chapters of this book (Just in the middle; pg 569). We have indeed a ""...vulgar (human) tendency to take complex issues, with solutions at neither extreme of the continuum of possibilities and break them into dichotomies assigning one group to one pole and the other to the opposite end, with no acknowledgment of subtleties of intermediate positions(...)"". We are a flawed species with potential to do good and evil and only education can reduce the probability of making perhaps irreversible mistakes. "
10,0393064980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/158571-andrew,3,"This is a great book to skim for some of Gould's best and most interesting writing. And it's certainly good to have a one-volume selection that represents the sprawling yard sale that was Gould's career. I say 'skim' the book because so much of what he wrote was tied more to his own obsessions and idiosyncracies than to anything the vast majority of people would consider interesting. Sometimes forgotten 19th century contemporaries of Darwin are forgotten for a reason, a fact that seems to have been lost on Gould. Also, his writings on baseball are pretty mediocre. That said, his refutations of strict adaptationism are fascinating and the sections in here about punctuated equilibrium are a great introduction to the theory."
11,0393064980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069092-brad,4,"A fantastic ""greatest hits"" from the brilliant evolutionary biologist. This great compilation visits many of SJG's most enduring themes: the beauty of natural selection, the structure of evolutionary theory, the failings of evolutionary psychology and the wrong-headed approach of the justification of social Darwinism. Finally, in a way that benefits immensely from SJG's eloquence, his thoughts on religion and science: from the beauty and practicality of Non-Overlapping Magisteria to the dangers and failures of creationism. Now that he is no longer around to write, it is always worth revisiting the treasures he left behind..."
12,0393064980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18343671-holly-bik,3,"I found Stephen Jay Gould's essays to be hit or miss - some quite poignant, others far too long and rambling and a bit outdated. Gould is most certainly a prolific writer and renowned scientist, so I felt obligated to read his work at some point in career (since his evolutionary theories relate directly to my own research). This edited anthology was put together well, and I thought represented a good overview of his varied writings (from essay on personal to political topics). I'm glad I read this book, and I did learn some things about the history of science, but I wouldn't raise it above the level of 3 stars. Mostly, I just didn't feel like I could connect with the majority of his essays."

Some of his essays are quite singular, but others are rather boring historical pieces. I respect him for his willingness to contradict the neo-Darwinian synthesis orthodoxy, and, while recognizing the validity of adaptive design, (rightfully, I think), challenging the black box of ascribing an adaptive purpose to virtually every characteristic living organisms have. It's also fun to read somebody so well read in so many different areas. A true renaissance man like him comes by very rarely. "
14,0393064980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2059153-noah,3,"I wouldn't say I read this book so much as I plodded through it.
