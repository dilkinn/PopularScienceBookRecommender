(I am always attracted to bookshelves.) My Dad didn’t have much to say about the book except that I could take it. He told me that it was a selection of the Mira Costa College book group that met monthly to discuss their selections and vote upon others.The book sat on my shelf for a couple years while I attempted to start reading it four or five times. Finally I worked up enough momentum in the book that I started to make progress and then suddenly I was hooked. I studied it very carefully and started to really enjoy it. By the time I finished this book I knew I had to know more about this guy.Ken Wilber is another one of those rare human beings that have had a significant impact in shaping the way I think. Although he seems new agey at first, seems narcissistic at times, and sometimes dresses funny, I still enjoy all his quirky oddness without feeling the need to emulate him in every way or become taken in by his “fan club-cum-cult.” He appears a bit eccentric but, hey, the guy is truly one of life’s originals and he is full of substantive ideas.I highly recommend one of his books: A Brief History of Everything, and his audio set: Kosmic Consciousness which covers the same material in an interview format. The combination of book and CDs is most effective as each medium has its inherent strengths and weaknesses; together they best introduce Wilber’s worldview. Beyond these two recommended works of Ken Wilber I make no further recommendations though there are still many wonderful intellectual nuggets to find. I have purchased most of Wilber’s books but that is more a reflection of my way of sizing him up. I do the same thing with musical artists as well. I like to know the full catalogue even when I only like part of it. I like to understand the artist as well as his message.One reason why I have formed an intellectual bond with Ken Wilber is because he was the one that I was reading when I had a few more of those “aha” moments. Wilber taught me a few new things that I really found enlightening. Granted, I could have had such moments while reading somebody else because most ideas are not exclusively original to any one human being, but the fact is I was taught by Wilber. He was the one who communicated many ideas in such a way that I was able to receive them, and they came at I time in life when I was mature enough to pay attention.The first topic that impacted my thinking was emergence--everything is simultaneously a “whole” as well as a “part” of something bigger (holons). Subatomic particles are wholes, but also parts of Atoms. Atoms are discrete wholes yet they are parts of molecules. Molecules are wholes that form parts of proteins which become parts of tissues, then organs, then organisms, then the biosphere, then the noosphere (see Pierre Teilhard de Chardin). The “aha” was the realization that I am part of something bigger than myself. I was finally ready to trade up to this broader perspective by giving up my more egocentric worldview and it was not a frightening thought but, surprisingly, it was very comfortable. I kept repeating in my mind, “Love thy neighbor as thyself.” This seemed very logical. I started to think of other people as extensions of myself, or, even, myself. This may sound loony but I honestly started to sense a keener kinship to the world than I ever had before.I was very impressed that Wilber seemed to have genuine affection and acceptance of people and institutions at all levels of development instead of a vitriolic disdain for other points of view that I had been somehow conditioned to expect from intellectual types. This attitude came from Hinduism through Wilber to me. And after a while I found that I was experiencing a real change in myself, I quite naturally developed a greater ability to detach myself from emotional issues and try to understand them more objectively while all the time believing that in the long run the “truth will out.”Perhaps the most important idea that I got from Wilber is that I do not have to repudiate things that I transcend; I can transcend AND include.Ken Wilber is another kindred soul because I see part of myself in him. He is a tireless quester of truth and is not afraid to read all of the world’s best books without waiting for them to be assigned. And although he is ahead of me and different in many ways, we are both questers. "

3,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2540795-nadeem,3,"This book is hard to review, really the rating is the mean between a 5 and a 1. Wilber is basically a self-taught philosopher who tries to articulate a theory of everything. By working outside the limits of academia, he doesn't have to specialize as much as other intellectuals. In this sense, his broad focus is refreshing and intriguing. Writing about consciousness, I appreciated the case he made for being able to look both at an individual's interior experience as well as looking at an individual from an objective, more empirical perspective. However, what is lost by working outside academia, is the fact that the work hasn't been peer-reviewed. It wasn't written to scholarly standards (he says this 600 page book is basically the cliff-notes from a larger book), nor critiqued by a veteran in the field. So, there are times when it doesn't appear he has mastery over subject matter that he writes about in an authoritative tone. Bottom line, it's an interesting book and worth a read, but only with a healthy dose of skepticism. "
4,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1142491-richard,5,"I'm not kidding - this may be the best book I've ever read. It is the first book (of many, I hope) of Wilber's that I've read. It was recommended by someone I respect implicitly, and it did not disappoint. I wasn't predisposed to love it, mind you - his stance on Jung, his focus on Western Philosophers, his nearly constant criticism of ecophilosophers and ecofeminists to name a few things were all things that I don't particularly agree with, but I think his criticisms are valid and have place. This book fit all my interests and all the things that I find importnat together in a way that I'd been looking for, but had been previously unable to do. One word to describe it is this: essential. It is, in my opinion, THE essential book for understanding so many of the problems and crises that are facing us as humans and for understanding, quite literally, life, the universe and everything. I recommend it to all of my transcendentalist friends. Thank you, sir. You have won a student."

This book is sometimes hard to read, especially when he tries to reference everything under the sun. For those of us who don't know everything, the references become too much - looking every person and theory referenced would be like dissertation research. However, this relatively early (in Wilber's bio, that is) attempt at an umbrella theory of various aspects of life (psychology, spirituality, scientific discovery, etc.) is actually quite compelling. Narcissism notwithstanding, Wilber has clearly done his research and offers a challenging and unique read."

10,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,3,"It was weird. This month I read Dawkins' The Blind Watchmaker and it referenced Arthur Koestler's writings on evolution, so I decided it was high time to read Darkness at Noon, then I find out that Koestler is the one who coined the term Holon, so I dug out Wilber. I read a little Wilber in college, but never finished the book. So, I read it today and liked it in parts. My main complaint with Wilber is he tries to square the corners of the Kosmos too neatly. I find him simultaneously empty and shiny; trite and compelling. Do I regret reading this book? No, but I'm not sure I'm prepared to re-orient my worldview or integrate much of Wilber into my own spirituality. "

12,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2834378-ted-child,2,"More then anything else about this book, I appreciate what Wilber is attempting to do with his integration of Eastern and Western philosophies. I am doubtful of little and disagree with even less in this book. Most of my criticism of this book are stylistic. Foremost, is Wilber’s tone tends towards the pedantic, didactic, and patronising, which can be grating. Once I got past this I found this book more interesting and useful, specifically the second half (the first half deals more with developmental psychology and psychology I find quickly boring). Wilber, like many philosophers, also tends to over-simplify and get repetitive. I fear he over-simplified his criticism of neo-Goddess movements to fit his paradigm. Graves, a major modern proponent of the Goddess, at least, never ignored the human sacrifices of horticultural/Goddess worshipping societies (Graves felt it was a small price to pay to sacrifice the King once every ten years to avoid all the other meaningless deaths that come from patriarchal society). However, Wilber’s other criticism of regressive primitive movements I do agree with. I think Wilber also made the same mistake as Jung of overestimating psychological well-being and development in solving the worlds problems. Psychological development will not stop a fascistic politico-economic elite from continuing to destroy our planet in their own interests. Wilber’s ability to integrate various schools of thought and synthesize them usefully is his strength."
13,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5945058-solveig-c-b,4,"In addressing cosmic, biological, human and divine evolution, Ken Wilber impressively populates 500 pages worth of synthesis of Western and Non-Western spiritual tradition creating a thinking framework for everything in life. Wilber comprehensively dissects and re-assembles the parts and wholes of the ontology, epistemology and methodology for what he has coined as“integral theory”.It feels like an impossible task to synthesize this reading into a meaningful review and make “A Brief History of Everything” even briefer. Wilber’s work addresses the evolution of consciousness from its basic building blocks to the complexity of concepts such as worldviews. Topics covered include gender, self, society, eco issues, liberation movements, psychological development and pathologies and a wide array of approaches to spirituality and evolution are all covered through the perspective of his theories. An extract from his discourse on worldviews provides an example of how topics are discussed within his framework:“Different worldviews create different worlds, enact different worlds, they aren’t just the same world seen differently [....] As the higher stages of consciousness emerge and develop, they themselves include the basic components of the earlier worldview, then add their own new and more differentiated perceptions. They transcend and include. Because they are more inclusive they are more adequate. So it’s not that the earlier worldview was totally wrong and the new worldview is totally right. The earlier one was adequate, the new one is more adequate. If it’s not more adequate, then it won’t be selected by evolution [....] The solution of an old problem is the creation of a new one - they come into being together, although the new problems usually surface only as the worldview approaches its demise [...] And we are at the point where the mental, industrial world view are running into grave problems inherent in its own organization. We have run up against our own limitations”At times the text can be lengthy and repetitive, though it becomes progressively more clear through the work that the re-iteration of ideas and examples assist the reader’s hermeneutic process of developing understanding between parts and wholes. Wilber is sensitive to what is required from the reader to be able to keep up with high-concept content; he tries to make it as accessible as possible. Both the repetition of concepts and “question-and-answer” (Socratic dialogue) format of the text facilitate the readers consciousness of the content as it gradually evolves from detailed concepts to a big picture perspective.Personally, I found parts of the text still had a strong sense of New Age tone to it, but the satisfaction I found in building a framework of contextual meaning from this read by far outweighed the intonation issues I felt. I also would add that I admire how Wilber’s research of Western and Eastern philosophies is an excellent precedent for a hermeneutic research approach. He has created a theoretical “Bricolage” to use Levi-Strauss’ metaphor, which I have found very useful to use as a backdrop for my own research and theoretical development.Big IdeaAt the core of Wilber’s work and the ontological base for the integral theory is the four quadrant composition of interrelating domains of manifested reality. The four quadrants represent the interior and exterior of the individual and the collective. Within each of these quadrants are levels of development and transcendence. Taking into account “all quadrants” and “all levels” is key in integral theory as a way to continue developing and transcending. His examples illustrate how integral thinking can be applied to bridge gaps and allow pattern recognition in life.Useful learning outcomes and applications for designersThe work by Wilber is especially relevant from a design education perspective as it provides a way of figuring out “how can we learn what we need?” This is a question that not only applies to what we do as designers, but also addresses questions of how we define our own discipline in the 21st Century .Design deals with humans on the interior and exterior of both the individual and collective. It requires a deep and wide understanding of contextual framework in order to develop products, systems and human interfaces that take into account matter (cosmos), life (biosphere) and mind (noosphere). The book can help bridge gaps, show interconnections and relate the scientific to the inner world. As a discipline, design germinated in an industrial era worldview and has suffered directly as this era is revealing its limitations and inadequacies. The design discipline is in a phase of development and transcendence and Wilber’s work can inform, motivate and facilitate the struggles of this required evolution of our practice. What people are saying ""In the ambitiously titled A Brief History of Everything, Wilber continues his search for the primary patterns that manifest in all realms of existence. Like Hegel in the West and Aurobindo in the East, Wilber is a thinker in the grand systematic tradition, an intellectual adventurer concerned with nothing less than the whole course of evolution, life's ultimate trajectory—in a word, everything. . . . Combining spiritual sensitivity with enormous intellectual understanding and a style of elegance and clarity, A Brief History of Everything is a clarion call for seeing the world as a whole, much at odds with the depressing reductionism of trendy Foucault-derivative academic philosophy.""—San Francisco ChronicleRecommended reading extensions that compliment this bookBook: “Blessed Unrest” by Paul Hawken - “Emerson’s Savants”Documentary: “The World Peace Game and other fourth grade achievements”/ John HunterBook: “Alone Together” by Sherry TurkleDocumentary: “Manufactured Landscapes” by Edward BurtinskyRudolph Steiner’s lecturesShort Story: “How I spent my summer vacation: History, Story and the Kant of Authenticity” by Thomas King"

16,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875291-tim,5,"This is the most important book I've read this year. A part of me wishes I'd picked it up as suggested years ago - I have a friend who first introduced me to the term integral theory back in the 90s. But then I wouldn't have had the experience I just did - which is to see nearly everything I've studied in the past decade summarized here and placed in an overall framework. The thing is, Wilber is only sending us both out and in to everything we've always had available. Yes, all is a manifestation of God or Spirit or Emptiness (words are only language for deeper meaning) but that doesn't mean we can opt out of living. All the more reason we must engage in the world of form to realize the ultimate in all things. We don't escape into spirituality or work or anything that neglects a part of reality. We embrace it all. And that's not an easy route. That's facing reality at its most fundamental in all parts of your life. The areas you're (and WE as humanity) are trying to avoid the most are exactly the ones you/we need to deal with and engage. But there's obviously great hope too, his vision of the universe is of ultimate goodness (much as Islam or any great wisdom tradition teaches - love is the driving force of manifestation or creation) - that through this engagement we come to the ultimate transformation, wisdom and happiness. He's not saying anything here that the mystics or the esoteric strain of any great tradition haven't already taught, nor does he contradict them. He follows that mystical strain to its logical conclusion by showing just how the pattern of unfolding or unveiling (that Ibn Al-Arabi for example has articulated so well) is consistent in everything up to and through the present day. It doesn't matter the area we choose, the laws or rules of unfolding, immanence and transcendence are the same. And his spirituality is practiced, realized, verifiable internally if we're willing to try it. His four quadrants cover the ground of our lived experience as a human being - both internal and external and it simply opens up a further lifetime of study and most importantly practice that only partakes in the best of all knowledge. That's the value I see in this - he's only encouraging you to embrace everything you've already been applying to your life - in any field and then add to it from the parts you're neglecting - that includes both the parts that bring joy and the darkest regions that we need to heal and transform. Integral. Holistic. Truly all embracing. That's the only way to transcend and transform. Because all is a manifestation of Spirit and all comes from ultimate wisdom. "

I believe there was some sort of portal that quietly opened up in the collective unconscious in the 90s and books like this were written. Some of us were ready for a kind of pragmatic spirituality and I believe more of us are every day, if on a much more unconscious level. This book is as cerebral as it is mystical...that last word is a bit of a dirty one for most of us, myself included, but if we are totally honest with ourselves, much of what we dismiss as ""mystical nonsense"" is absolutely valid and absolutely connected with what we accept as ""reality"". This book is largely about the failure of the modern and post-modern paradigms and the need for a trans-rational or post-rational model. We've rationalized ourselves into a corner, peoples...when all else fails, you must look at the truth."

19,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/502680-david,3,"Well, the title is correct. In this book, Wilber seems to give a history of everything! From the beginning on through to today, he builds a story of the universe. But it’s not a “history” as much as a philosophy/spirituality book. Overall, I found it a mix of good and bad.The best was Wilber’s quadrant that truly does explain so much. On the upper left you have the interior individual, the usual “spiritual” stuff. Upper right is the exterior things like biology. Lower left are all the cultural forces that shape you. Finally, lower right is the exterior systems. Wilber excels in showing how you need all four. When you only have the exterior, as in much modern mindsets, you reduce everything to mere physical. Wilber’s critique of the idea that science is everything is worth the price of the book. But if you only have the interior, then you discount the physical world and live only in your head.There’s other good in here. But I found Wilber’s creation of words and concepts tedious. Maybe it’s my Christian faith, but his invented words just seemed empty. Give me a deeper religion, whether Christianity or anything. It seems in trying to create a theory of everything, he waters down what people actually do. There’s not really practice here. Would a practicing Muslim or Buddhist or Christian see much here? I guess that’s not a fault, Wilber’s offering a theory of ”everything”. To do that means generalizing. Such generalizing ends up being a bit esoteric and academic, which isn’t a fault in itself. It’s just...if we’re talking about spirituality, when do we discuss what real people actually do and believe? Wilber does offer a sort of stages of faith, with nine steps, echoing Fowler and Erickson. I found much of what he said here helpful too. I guess I can’t put my finger on it...this book never really hit me deeply. It was interesting but not inspiring. To be fair, maybe he wasn’t going for inspiring.I also hate the dialogue format! Why am I reading so many books in dialogue format!!!If you’re into religion and philosophy and psychology and spirituality, this book is worth your time. There’s stuff her to chew on. But after a while it’s tedious."

His thoughts on all that are super insightful and it really does crystallize how interdependent everything—beliefs, structures, individuals, collectives—is. Once it gets into the more speculative side of things, it started to go a little woo woo on me. I wouldn't call this a New Age book by any stretch, but it started looking like he was taking for givens things that, bare minimum, we should be skeptical about because all we have to prove them are anecdotal evidence and the guidance of spiritual traditions. Still, I did genuinely enjoy the whole thing. It's a head trip I'd recommend to anyone."

He argues, convincingly, that most philosophies and disciplines get caught in one of these quadrants and fail to integrate them, preventing them from arriving at a holistic perspective. There is a lot worth heeding in these chapters, particularly for those interested the merging of western psychology with eastern mysticism, and in terms of informational /theoretical content I give this book five stars. The way it is written (an incredibly irritating question and answer format) detracts from the content, however, and in the latter half Wilber rambles and repeats himself and seems to enjoy the sound of his own voice far far far too much. A shame, really, because the content is solid."
24,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79661-phil,4,"Phew. No way to give this book a fair shake by virtue of a summary.Wilber throws a hell of a lot at you, and I'd be lying if I tried to pretend a lot of it hasn't altered significant portions of my mental landscape. There are drawbacks, the most significant being that Wilber's tone can tend toward the flippant and patronizing, particularly when discussing feminism and multiculturalism--subjects that, as a white male, he is perhaps obliged to be a bit more careful about in order to draw in the greatest possible readership. Concision is, regrettably, also not Wilber's greatest virtue.However, anyone who allows those drawbacks to invalidate the great strides Wilber has otherwise made is cheating only himself. Among other things, this guy may have convinced me of the value of investigating spiritual consciousness, which, for those who know me, is quite the task.Recommended, but you'll need to make a bit of a commitment to get through it. I'll be interested to check out his other works..."
25,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12521978-romann-weber,2,"A mélange of genuinely interesting ideas and utter nonsense, Wilber's ""Brief History"" should at least do you the favor of telling you whether it's worth diving into the magnum opus it ostensibly summarizes, namely ""Sex, Ecology, Spirituality: The Spirit of Evolution.""Wilber is famous (or infamous) for his wide-ranging, syncretic treatment of ""integral philosophy,"" and his frequent name dropping of all the work he's reviewed will either impress you, intimidate you, or make you wonder how carefully he could have possibly read it. For a book that summarizes a thesis with ""evolution"" in the title, Wilber's work shows a disturbing and fundamental misunderstanding of evolutionary theory while also implying that he is accurately representing current thought in the field. On evolution, Wilber simply does not know what he is talking about, which makes wading through the rest of this often pedantic (but occasionally entertaining) book much more work than it was worth to me, since I simply didn't trust his scholarship."

I made the decision to live my life with more clarity, intention, wisdom and decisiveness. Ken Wilber's work has contributed significantly to that process. Ken Wilber has created a map of the external and internal dimensions of life as we know it. Through this book, he introduces the map to us and makes us aware of its basic features. He shows us how we can use this map and why it is super relevant today. Even though the book was published in 1996, in my understanding it has only gained in relevance since then. I also believe that it will continue to be relevant for decades to come.Using the map and understanding the historical context of its development have proven to be of exceptional value to me and I can say with some conviction that this book can help anyone looking to understand themselves and the world around them a tad bit better.

It might well be the most important thing I have ever read! though it didn't seem that way at first; I found the maieutic format so contrived and annoying I almost didn't make it to section 2. And like almost every non-fiction book I initially wished it was boiled down to an essay. But, gradually, I realized what first struck me as repetition was more like an intentional ""tap tap tap"" from slightly different angles while adding new context, which I really did need for the patterns to completely click into place. It turns out this 544 page treatise is the condensed version of larger works. I'm not going to try summarizing Integral Theory, but I will state: it is a sturdy and elegant model framework in which to recognize individual and social development and behavior, then scrutinize them with compassion. It ties together my own observations about people and systems that I knew were related, yet frustratingly unaligned to a universal model. Don't skip the afterword/interview with Lana Wachowski; actually, read it first to verify that Ken Wilber is human, then read it again at the end. Then read the whole book again. That's what I'm going to do."
28,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66408638-lee-frankl,2,"This book is essentially unreadable, although there may be some good ideas buried in the author's convoluted language, pretentious style (he is interviewing himself!), and preening self-regard. The stuff about 'holons' and the 'Kosmos', etc. is just so silly. There are ancient mystical traditions that can be studied on their own terms. Read the source materials and identify the universal aspects within each tradition on your own. This is too great a task to outsource. If you never accomplish the total synthesis--the elusive realization of an over-arching principle--well, neither has this author. Nor have I. Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, the gendered anthropological analyses seem half-baked--like the author is opining on a subject in which he is not well-studied. Also, mansplain much? Oy.If you bought this book seeking a synthesis of science and mysticism, do yourself a favor and pick up 'God & The Big Bang' by Daniel Matt. If you have some familiarity with eastern and western metaphysics, then Matt's simple style and his holistic approach will bring it home for you."
29,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1741591-m,2,"I almost quit reading after the first 25 pages. Although this has nothing to do with the core of the book, the author includes a ridiculous segment claiming that we haven't had a patriarchy that has dominated women for thousands of years. He basically claims that women have been okay with exclusion from government because the men were plowing the field. What? No. Just no. And then there's the part where he implies that wings and eyeballs somehow just evolved as a single creative burst of evolution. Um, no, that's not how it works. However, the main part of the book includes some interesting thought experiments, starting with the evolution of consciousness. We know that things have evolved with greater complexiy, and that includes the depth of consciousness, so it seems fair to say that greater degrees of complexity in consciousness are awaiting us. He points out how even among human culture, our collective consciousness has changed a lot, from interpreting the world as a mythic place, to an increasing state of global awareness. His point about the huge culture gap caused by these different states rings incredibly true, as is evident by political views in the US and the current election cycle. Finally, the author's call for a more holistic worldview that includes consciousness along with observable science seems sensible. I personally am not into the New Age-y parts about Spirit and Kosmos with a K (so cheesy). I also didn't really like the Q&A style of the book, nor the author's pretentiousness. But overall, if you're interested in a modern day philosophy combined with spirituality, this book might appeal."

Author might not be absolutely right in every detail he goes into (and he goes into LOTS of details), but I believe these are difficulties of interpretation from language of precise science into layman's dialect.'A Brief History..' contains dozens of thrilling stories and puts a human face on dry science trivia. There are lots of anecdotes, facts that you most probably don't know, even thoughts on life and the Universe origin. We are ever changing as a species, we develop infrastructure and make amazing things, so it's good to step back and take a look, and think, where did it all begin? How come we know so much? But also, how come we destroy so much? How probable is that we survive for a million years? Or for just a century? It mingles into beautiful thought-provoking text which I highly recommend to anyone reading this review."
31,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5873780-michael,4,"Wilber is a leading philosopher of our times and this book is a whirlwind tour of his ""Integral theory"" and it's implications for our times.I'm giving it four stars because I wasn't particularly taken by it's question and answer style... which gives the feeling of reading an interview. That being said, the ideas contained within are incredibly powerful. Wilber has synthesized vast amounts of information into his theory merging physics, biology, sociology, psychology and spirituality into a model of development that is seamless from the quantum through the psychological, social and spiritual. It is truly a ""theory of everything"" that brings with it the potential for great wisdom and social healing.I will continue to read more from Wilber... stay tuned."

Everybody steals ideas from everybody, creates a bad environment for those that are different, jealousy, envy, cuckolds...

44,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/746616-buffy,3,"I have to admit I read a little over half of this book before my brain started to break, as it tried to bend over and around the ever increasingly complex and sharp diagrams, followed by precise descriptions of each diagram's component parts, ultimately, and supposedly, describing in detail a broad philosophical view of... well... everything. I couldn't go much further without losing my mind, and feeling sure that I was victim to one of the many pathologies caused by the ripples of mishaps in the psycho-spiritual-developmental ""holarchies"" Wilbur describes. I would imagine that from his perspective all humans are in some way prey to one or many of these pitfalls.So, gratefully, I skipped to the Afterword, an interview with Wilbur by Lana Wachowski, one of the writers/directors of the movie ""The Matrix."" This was brilliant, and captured what I wanted to retain from the book, which is an extremely detailed (although he seems to indicate it should be even more complex) look at human development from the perspective of the vast network of the interrelatedness of life. It's something many can ""understand,"" but have we experienced it? And if we've experienced it, do we have the psycho/spiritual maturity to retain it and put it to use in a globally inclusive and ethical approach? And if not, perhaps we are no better than a Hitler or other such authoritarian figure with, perhaps, great knowledge, but too dangerously immature to hold and wield the power of that knowledge.I might try again to complete the bulk of the book, but I have doubts that a tome as difficult to fully grasp (as important as the content is) will have much impact in this day and age, which is unfortunate, as we need more wider and non-polarized perspectives to approach modern problems. Wilbur decries reductionism in general, and yet, he seems to reduce ""everything"" to a series of diagrams, however complex and comprehensive they are in their totality. This is certainly one way of making sense of the world, but how does it fit in with his approach to the problems of all-inclusiveness versus philosophical/spiritual exclusivity? On the other hand, for many therapists and psychologists, this approach might be a milestone in navigating the numerous potential pathologies that confront most of us through the journeys of our lives.But seriously, if your reading gag reflex kicks in, as mine did, read the Afterword with Lana Wachowski. It neatly summarizes what could have been said in such fewer words with more impact to a wider readership."
45,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61754793-marco-pontual,5,"Have you ever developed a theory based solely on your life experiences only to find out someone else had systematized a nearly identical idea much sooner? Well, I just did.First, my theorySince I’ve taken up to reading a lot more than I previously had, I started to notice how physically isolating a thing reading is. If you then, say, not only read a lot but also meditate, watch movies, work on your computer or browse the web, then you might literally spend your entire day by yourself and nearly immobile. Such considerations didn’t come to me by deduction, but induction: after a few days of heavy reading I’d feel miserable and wonder why. Then I’d go out with a friend for some açaí and marvel at how loquacious I’d be. Clearly, I was thirsting not only for that great Brazilian berry of ours but even more so for meaningful human interactions.Another thing started bothering me: my back. Being ever so responsive to my bodily cues it didn’t take me long to realize I had to alternate reading with movement. So I’d run/hit the gym and the pain would leave me alone. These realizations became organically systematized in quadrants: 1a) things I do alone and still, 1b) things I do alone and moving, 2a) things I do with people and still, 2b) things I do with people and moving. And so I’d try to make sure I didn’t overdo any quadrant (quadrant 1a being the only one I was actually in danger of overdoing).Fast forward to last week and I realize this Kim Wilber guy made a career by applying an astonishingly similar principle to, well, everything. The difference being that instead of movement/stillness, Ken named it subjective and objective. And, sure, he had a ton of other theories. Still, I was glad. I was, like, “way to go Marco, you’ve got what it takes to have partial world-class insights”.I think from now on I’ll be more outspoken about my theories (I have other two or three).Truth be told, besides the whole quadrants thing, Ken's got more to say. He thinks the millennia-old back-and-forth debate between what he called the ascenders, that is, people who claim the spiritual world is the only reality and disdain material existence and the descenders, that is, people who claim the opposite has been raging throughout history for lack of a possibility we now have to integrate everything. So this is Ken’s thing, which he hints at with the name of his book. He tries to ever so pedagogically categorize and systematize everything. Religion, economics, spirituality, psychology, politics, biology… He is very well read (the world genius comes up sometimes when people refer to him) and as of today I am very much enthused by his work. It's important to know (or is it?) that the guy has been around for some decades now, which seems to have been plenty of time for him to live quite a life: from opening his own institute, to becoming something of a cult leader, falling from favor and even getting deadly ill for decade and, recently, making a come back. I’m enjoying catching up. If you haven’t checked him out, I very much recommend you do."
46,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7177602-kb,4,"There are problems with the book which I think stem from the other trying to write it in a 'user friendly' Q & A format. First, there are no sources or footnotes which is annoying in a book of such scope. Do I really have to figure out for myself where Plato said that? This is either laziness or arrogance and I don't care which, its an academic convention with a purpose and would enable the reader to check the context in which source material is used - and verify whether you agree with the characterization (for a start). Second, there is sometimes something flip or dismissive about the way he answers some of the questions (that he is also posing) or summarizes some complex ideas. It isn't even that I disagree with him, and sometimes I even laugh, but I wonder what the point it of that tone is in a user friendly volume. It picks fights in the wrong way and I wonder if he isn't just properly angry and lonely looking out at the world from where he is sitting. It would make sense. The chapter on 'Flatland' near the end seemed particularly ranty. Third, though a sincere attempt was made to make this text for an entry level reader without exposure to some of the history, philosophy, or religion I'm not sure this would have made any sense to me if I hadn't sought it out after quite a lot of grounding in eastern philosophy and human development theory. Despite all of this (really), this is a grand book. Or more accurately, Wilber is a grand thinker with a compelling and unique way of essentially explaining the world across and through history. I found his understanding and his purpose for sharing it quite moving - moving enough to get over my annoyance with the format, the language, and his ignoring academic convention that would actually make the book a greater resource. "
47,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8759235-juha,5,"This was the first book I read by Ken Wilber, and it was definitely worth it! Wilber’s frameworks beautifully capture facets of science, systems theory, personal development, and spirituality and meditative practices to a cohesive whole where everything seems to fit in place. The book is also expertly written and a joy to read, and has immediately found its place among my all-time favourite books.For a person considering reading the book, it’s worth noting a couple of possible caveats. One is that the book is completely written in a dialogue format, and thus does not have an easily browsable structure. The contents may at times feel repetitive and meandering, the “dialogue” may get stuck on topics that are not of immediate interest to the reader, and it’s quite hard to skip ahead with this format. The other caveat is that the book has a rather strong spiritual perspective, with many chapters ending in Wilber’s freeform awakening-like descriptions of experiencing the Kosmos. Personally, I found the spiritual aspects extremely interesting and loved how they are integrated with the rest of the theory, but for a reader that has a strong distrust of the spiritual, they may prove distracting.I’m looking forward to reading the same themes through in a more structured format in Wilber’s Sex, Ecology, Spirituality, but for now – I can’t but give the full stars to a book that has given a lot to my personal thought and development, while at the same time being accessible enough that I could easily read it in a sweaty, sluggish airport check-in line for hours at a time!"
48,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38787877-magnus-lidbom,1,"DNF: As soon as Wilber starts to describe his theory the promise of a book that integrates science and spirituality is shown to be false. He goes on a rant against evolution parrotting creationist propaganda that has been debunked again and again - such as half a wing being useless - and follows up by this simply absurd assertion: ""The standard neo-Darwinian explanation of chance mutation and natural selection - very few theorists believe this anymore"". Now that he, through pure denial of reality, has dispensed with the bothersome actual science of evolution he is free to start drafting his own teleological version.This is where I give up on this book. Maybe Wilber has interesting ideas, but I was interested in someone integrating science and spirituality, not denying the very basics of the science of evolution and replacing it with a teleological fantasy. I see no reason to keep reading when the author so obviously simply asserts what he wants to believe even when there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

In one sense, it does cover the history of ""everything,"" but it's more like a unified theory of everything. It's a philosophy book, and the author's heavy use of name dropping will constantly remind you of that. It often comes off as a bit pedantic.The author describes a master integral theory. His base for the theory relies on metaphysical concepts like non-dualism and holism. There are some very profound ideas presented in the book - at least one of them had a huge impact on how I view the world- but the book is incredibly too long and convoluted for what it is. It could have easily been a fourth of the length without losing any of it's impact. It's written in a Q&A/stream of consciousness format, which allows for freedom for the author but disorganization and often frustration for the reader. I would recommend this book highly for any academic philosophers out there. I would probably not recommend this at all for anyone else. Well, perhaps I would recommend certain chapters or excerpts."

I would pay money to watch Ken Wilber navigate actual life challenges and objective mental tasks.I expect 40 years ago he would have been a strict creationist using the ""half an eye"" argument to try to refute the facts of evolution, but now he is content to say that mutation and natural selection are certainties but can't account for the innovations of life, because ""what use is half a wing?"". There are thorough biomechanical answers he hasn't heard or pretends not to have heard, but even if there weren't yet, he appears fully invested in the argument from ignorance, that either unknown = unknowable, or unknown = proof of my fairy tale."

For those of us who think that evolution is ongoing but that the future of evolution is less in integrating digital technology into ourselves and more in developing the humanity within to higher and higher levels of consciousness Wilber's theories make a lot of sense and they do not require letting go of any of my history - in fact they reassure me that my history is important to my future development - and to the future development of humanity. This book is probably the most clear exposition of Wilber's ideas so I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in their personal development, especially if that development includes a person's spirituality.

First, from purely technical point of view, I was a bit annoyed by the dialogue form, this book was written (or recorded - I was listening to audio version). The second, and more important is, that I was to dumb to read this book in the first place :) I came across it as a mention in Frederic's Lalux's ""Reinventing Organisations"", and I thought it would be nice to look deeper into evolution on cosciousness. Unfortunately without a deeper background from phylosophy, mysticism and probably some other accompanying fields, there is almost no point in reaching for this book. I've managed to learn some of the most interesting parts of author's point of view, and some indeed resonated with my beliefs. In the end though, I think I only scrathed the surface of what author intended to say here. "

55,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7781288-edmundo,2," The premise of the book is that there is a cruciform scale of the development of human consciousness and societal organization that somehow ties into the evolution of the cosmos and cellular life. The basis feels as valid as any of the the pop-psych/ motivational speaker look-alike axis systems for personality. The book, on the whole, turns out to be another odious rehash of The Perennial Philosophy. It's tediously interwoven with absurd cosmological thought, current views on new-age philosophy, and sexual politics. It all ends up being overburdened, full of dense, pointless jargon and acronym-slinging. If your diet incorporates a broad range of philosophical readings there are books representing a broad range of scholarship and, ultimately, credibility. This one is a load of hooey. "
56,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4075100-ed-wojniak,4,"Wilbur, in this book, describes reality in terms of four quadrants. These quadrants express the individual and the collective as well as the material and the immaterial. He makes the case that since the Enlightenment, reality has been defined primarily by the material. A significant part of the malaise that modern humanity currently experiences is attributable to the failure to integrate consciousness, culture (the immaterial) and nature (the material) thus making room for art, morals, and science – for personal values, collective wisdom, and technical know-how. Living a balanced, whole life means integrating these aspects."

He sees the scientific method as reductionism, and has a quarrel with the concept that logic (or philosophy) can explain everything. At the same time, he makes extensive use of logic and science where it fits his argument.His ""Theory of Everything"" boils down to a somewhat unique blend of mysticism, or spirituality, and reasoning. Through it he attempts to convey his holistic and all-encompassing view of God, Creation, and how Man fits in that picture. He rejects the Christian belief of a one-and-only God, consisting of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Instead, he is happy to include all of the above, as well as Buddha, Dharma & Shranga, and who else you want to add as part of the same holistic view, culminating in the eastern belief that Man is part of the Kosmos, which is part of God. (Emptiness = Creation & One = All.)In particular he finds fault with the ""flatland"" view of the new science (Systems Theory) - which is based on the recent discoveries regarding chaos and complexity, and how interrelated systems behave in an unpredictable environment. In his mind, these ""web-of-life theories"" differs from his interpretation, in that it does not account for the concepts of absolute meaning, beauty, virtue and value. But, perhaps because they could be perceived as rather closely related to his holistic view, they draw considerable criticism from him (page 129).In total, he expects (a-la Lobsang Rampa, ""The Third Eye"") the reader to throw out his preconceived ideas about the relevance of science and religion, without absolute proof, and without supernatural revelation, in exchange for another mother-of-all theory.The well trained scientist will classify Wilber's ideas in kind with perpetual motion. The sincere Christian will consider him dangerous, in his ability to distort the truth. The average individual might have a harder time to separate fact from fiction.On a positive note - Wilber does attempt to address some serious deficiencies in our view of reality. In some of his attempts he can even be described as brilliant, though his ability to synthesize meaning from cutting edge issues.The problem is - its just another theory. By diverting his considerable talent into the realms of mysticism, and without the tools of science and logic, he forgoes the opportunity to use his talents in furthering real understanding. He might have done better if he had finished his studies at university."

89,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/172215-sylvia,4,"The idea proposed by Ken Wilber is that the kosmos, and so are the entities which form it, consist of four quadrants: the upper left which deals with the subjectivity of an entity (I), the lower left which deals with culture, a collective subjectivity (WE), the upper right which deals with an entity which can be located easily so it is called objective (IT), and the lower right which deals with social structure, easily located, too (also called IT). To make it simpler, the four quadrants are also named the big three: I, WE and IT. Wilber calls each entity holon, meaning everything in this kosmos is a part of something but also consists of other parts, e.g., sub atom is a part of atom is a part of molecule is a part of cell and so on. A higher holon includes and transcends the lower ones. In order to get to a higher level, all holon must take into account all the big three.Unfortunately, since the enlightment or the modernity took reign, IT, the easily located or mapped things are the only things considered real. The upper and the left quadrant deals with interpretation, hence subjective, hence it's not real, hence you need not be too serious about it, hence sciences viewing things from the IT perspective blooms easily, sciences which believe that the world is objectively mappable, a social construction, ignoring the fact that the map maker can insert her subjectivity in the map she makes. Then born postmodernism or post enlightment or the like which see this tendency as a pathology, then postmodernists try to make everybody see how subjective this world is, how it is socially constructed, despite the fact that each race were born with equal rights. Glad as he is with the postmodernism movement, which shows that the postmodernists has reach a level higher than those who still judge others by their colours, religion, gender, etc AKA etnocentrists or chauvinists, Wilber emphasizes that the higher the holon, the greater the pathology is. And he proposes that only by combining the four quadrants, the big three, we could come to terms with the many world's problem we face today and find the solution. "

Wilber gets achingly repetitive in places, and the Q&A format is annoying as hell, so that takes away from the book and made it a pain to get through. However, his brilliance shines through in summarizing so much information (particularly re: philosophical & spiritual movements) and synthesizing it. I can't say his detractors don't have ammo, he can be incredibly narcissistic, pedantic, and condescending, but I think the world is beyond ready for a thinker of his type, on this inclusive scale. I look forward to reading more of his work. Would love to know if he's got more of a ""how to"" out there which gives tools rather than just food for thought (any fans know of a book more in this vein? feel free to recommend)In that same spirit, where his website is concerned, it comes across as a ""special club"" for fans and the elite. Seems to me that if he truly wants to ""transcend and include"" others in his vision of evolution, perhaps he shouldn't be charging so much for ""Integral Training"" ($249 for the first course? Even if I were in the rare 5-10% of people who are supposedly ready for this level of enlightenment, what makes Wilber think folks have that kind of money???). To join his web-club at $14.95 a month, even, for full access to all media, well.... I realize hosting a website and posting content costs money, but you'd think by now that this great thinker would have come up with some way to provide ""necessary"" content for free to those who can demonstrate financial need. Otherwise, he's just proclaiming enlightenment like so many others but restricting membership and wisdom to those who can afford to pay for it, which is disgustingly elitist.So, I'm of two minds about this guy. I think he's a genius, and though not a ""great"" writer, certainly an important. But I also think he's a tremendous narcissist, and geez, doesn't he have enough money already? (That said, can anyone write a bunch of books without Ego? I think not, though some Egos get in the way more than others....)"

With that in mind, this read was challenging, helpful, frustrating, enlightening, disappointing.I feel like I know a lot more about the postmodern dilemmas for having read this. The beginning of the book gave me a great overview of historical developments of thought. Very helpful.Toward the end of the book, it became very clear that we were moving into a view of life I can't support. Too ""otherworldly"" for me. The final nondual approach seems to me to take us to ""we're all gods, really"" and that doesn't fit.My biggest frustration was the repeated attack on ""flatland."" Not that I disagree--I think Wilber is correct in that regard. But he returned again and again to that critique and it was overkill.Right at the end (last 20 pages or so) two things surfaced for me. Wilber reminded me of the Biblical Pharisees. He had the answers and anyone who didn't agree with him simply was not among the enlightened. And, far more seriously, was his statement that if you had to choose between a number of animals and a human--kill the human, because to kill the animals was to kill off more breadth than was acceptable. At that point, he lost me. Man doesn't have worth because we are ""more advanced"" than animals. We have worth because we are made in God's image and eternal in nature (my theism clearly coming through).I'm glad I read the book. Wouldn't recommend it to others."

More accurately I removed myself from the path (yes, impossible, I know) and began seeking in pages for answers. What a diabolic task, especially when aided by the institutions of ""higher"" ""learning"". Ironically, a person close to me that in some ways catalyzed my demise, and had never even read Wilber, introduced me to his writings. As soon as I began to ingest Wilber's words it was a breathe of fresh air. Given my mental impetus at play during this time it was probably the only writings that could and would lead me back to my intuition. That said the first time read it I went only half way for I knew I wasn't ready for the answers it beheld. To fully appreciate and understand his writing (or any writing for that matter) is a contemplative and devotional endeavor (heavy on the contemplation for Wilber most would say). And I dare say that integral theory will revolutionize or integralize everything (including, naturally, the reader). For if you muster up the gusto to grasp ""A Brief History of Everything"" your consciousness will be forever altered.Recommended for seekers, healers, those in of healing, anyone at the cutting edge, and of course everyone."

Its contents are served in an interview format for easy, casual reading. Utilizing various philosophical and spiritual theories, Ken Wilber attempts to construct an understanding of the world using his AQAL map, which is very easy to understand, but leaves open a lot of unanswered questions.My concerns with this book is that it is excessively long, with a lot of repetition and rhetoric - this can perhaps be blamed on the very loose interview format; and secondly, it does sound a bit condescending and elitist in adopting an almost consumer approach to spirituality. With the dawn of New Age movements, I cannot help but shake my head with the overselling and overuse of spirituality in labeling everything without closer examination of what spirituality actually means.With my peeves set aside, the book is definitely worthwhile for those that wish to be entertained with an integrative approach to understanding the world."

Having read some of his other books I found this one to be repetitive of other things and not as fully developed at his Integral Spirituality. He makes a clear case for an evolutionary view of human history, but he does not adequately account for the presence of evil. He recognizes that there are many barriers to human development but doesn't acknowledge a counter-force to evolutionary progress. This is the one weakness I see in his view.Overall, however he provides a holistic view of human development both thru history and as individuals both psychologically and spiritually. The challenge is to know what to do with the insights he provides. Unfortunately, the folks into integral theory can get so wrapped up in their own take on the world that the pragmatic questions don't get addressed. That's for the reader to do on his/her own.I continue to find Wilber's work intriguing, challenging, and informative; I am just not sure where to go with it quite yet."

I want to read and think more about the culture gap as I have been thinking a lot about this over the past few years, however, not in the depth he presents here. My surprise: I was not expecting the book to enkindle my environmental consciousness. The All Too Human chapter and the An Integral Vision chapter brought home to me the fact that modern science can directly show us how and why our actions are corroding the biosphere. We have ways and means now to overcome this or we have ways and means to make this ignorance genocidal.

Ken Wilber, the author, attempts to tie all the concepts of evolution, history, mental epochs, and the way the Kosmos work all together in this philosophy-based book. This book was written in a Question-and-Answer-type format, which made it both interesting to read and easier to comprehend. I really liked this book because I believe that the more I know about how everything works together, the more I'll know about how I fit in to the equation. I think the best quote in this book is, ""In our own lives, to whom do we turn to for answers,"" (Wilber, xxvii) which defines the main question of the whole book. I would reccommend this book to anyone who believes that the main goal in life is to learn everything, to someone who doesn't get enough with the answer that 2+2=4, but rather wants to know why. "

The origin of Wilbur's brilliance is that he is a long-term disciplined meditation practitioner. He usually spends hours in the wee hours of every morning in meditation. Some have donned Wilbur a prophet of the New Age and there is some validity to this labeling. He does make sweeping observations about world religions, often comparing and contrasting.

Shortly after coming to a personal realization, and trying out some meditation techniques learned online, I got my first copy at age 15 and it inspired me to visit Zen Mountain Monastery and start formal meditation training under the auspices of Zen monks.

To this day, I still track my own Spiral development and the integral model assists in my process of continual worldview development.

Are subjects and objects (the KOSMOS) imbued with ""Spirit"" or a meaningless void governed only by chance and probabilities? Who really knows. "
149,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3721523-culley,3,"Slightly repetitive, especially part 3. Part 1 (first 120 pages) details the four quadrants, part 2 the 9 fulcrums, and part 3 is a summary and details Wilber's environmental ethics. His lens is rich and important-- part 1 of this book is the essential nugget of his theory, in my opinion."
150,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51505757-mark-valentine,4,"Wilber has incredible range and scope of his material. It really is about everything, and thus, as a reader or survey, it is very valuable. He is widely read and he has the capacity to retain much of it and use it collaboratively. Stock it in your library, underline it, and definitely read it."
