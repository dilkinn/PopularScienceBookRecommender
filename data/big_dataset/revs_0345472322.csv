I was about to give this book a one-star rating because I was so irritated with Dr. Dweck trying to shoehorn her idea into every single success story in the history of humanity and basically saying that her theory was the best explanation of that success. Conversely, every failure could have been averted but for a change in mindset. It was the Fixed mindset that caused the Chicago Cubs to never win a World Series. If only they had the Growth mindset, like the Yankees, they would win more World Series.Dweck may be too in love with her own ideas to realize that she oversells the usefulness of her theory to the extent that the portion that is actually workable seems underwhelming after cutting away from her salesman-like puffery. However, Mindset still serves as a useful supplement to a change manager's library. Its principles are serviceable to the manager, the parent, the spouse, the student, and the teacher. Just don't mistake it for a panacea."
1,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8599907-kirsten,1,"Let me preface this review by saying that my boss made me read this book, because, apparently, reading assignments are something that I should have as a 5th year PhD candidate. Not only that, but I'm pretty sure no one should require me to read a shitty waste-of time self help book.Let me save you the money and the aggrivation: The point of this book is (admittedly) not terrible, but it could be summed up real fast. Here you go, you're welcome.Often, people see their abilities as 'fixed' and this attitude stops them from working to better themselves, turns out that if you work hard and keep the right can-do attitude, that you can accomplish more than if you think you're doomed to be a particular skill level forever. There are examples of this all around you.Boom. Done. But no. What you get with this book is an endless diatribe. Hey, you remember that thing that happened in history? Where X person did Y thing that turned out to be good/bad? Well, if it was bad, it was TOTALLY because they had a fixed mindset. If it was good, it was 100% because of their growth mindset. This is true of literally any example in history ever no matter how poorly researched it might be. Is there any scientific basis for these historical claims? Absolutely not. Michael Jordan? SURE THING. That guy from that one business that went bad? WHAT A FIX MINDED DUMBASS. Bethoven? Duh. Seriously, I don't think I have ever read something so repetitive and belabored in my life. Sure, lady, you make a good point: People shouldn't limit themselves. Maybe give it a break after about 15 pages and I think it would probably be plenty.Also, if you tell me that I wouldn't be depressed if I just had a better attitude about it, I'm going to be upset and lose faith in your credibility. Seriously, kids, don't waste your time on this. And if your boss tells you to read it, don't bother, just read this helpful review again."
2,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/579294-cerealflakes,2,"I keep hearing educators praising this author and, specifically, this book. Maybe she's better in person. I found this book trite. It was very repetitive and full of cherry picked stories pulled out just to prove her obvious conclusion. Are there really people who think that if you go into something with a negative attitude it won't affect the outcome? She goes to the extreme with the positive attitude stuff, though. I just don't buy that anyone can do anything if they just try hard enough. Not trying guarantees you won't do it, but trying really hard doesn't mean you will. Lots of people try hard for years to get into the Olympics and they don't. It doesn't mean that they didn't work as hard as someone who did. The author also inserted herself pretty aggressively into this book. Her story about tears streaming down her face at the wonderfulness of Italians was too much. This book is dated enough that her stories of the greatness of Tiger Woods is pretty funny. I found Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers to be a much better book about a similar topic."
3,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49415231-amir-tesla,4,"For practical insights refer to:  Growth Mindset vs Fixed MindsetHave ever noticed those geeks, geniuses, and world-class achievers while thinking to yourself, gosh, if only I had such talents, or if only I had such high IQ? Disappointing, I know, I have been there. Perhaps, such way of thinking and having such beliefs about IQ and talent is the biggest hurdle in the way of great success and achievement. Thinking that we are born with a pre-determined IQ and talent, is called fixed-mindset according to Carol Dweck, a professor at Stanford University. The bad news is that people with fixed-mindset live a mediocre life and barely achieve anything extraordinary. The good news, however, is that you can readily change your fixed-mindset and adopt a growth-mindset which is the default mode thinking of world-class achievers.In this book review, I will provide a summary of the key points in the book “Mindset: The psychology of success”. In addition, I will provide you with practical insights on how you can apply the concepts in the book and alter this self-limiting belief. So, let’s learn how to think like pros.The two mindsets and how they determine your futureDweck, as a young researcher, has always been obsessed with understanding how people cope with failure. So, at schools, she brings children into a room and gives them a series of puzzles to solve. Puzzles start from fairly easy and continue to get harder and harder. As the students grunt, perspire and toil, she watches their strategies. This is where she gets shocked by the two starkly different approaches children adopted when facing difficult challenges.Confronted with harder puzzles, one ten-year-old pulls up his chair, rubs his hands together, smacks his lips, and cries out, “I love a challenge! Another, seating away on the puzzles, looks up with a pleased expression and says with authority, “You know, I was hoping this would be informative!” As Dweck puts it: What’s wrong with them? I wondered. I always thought you coped with failure or you didn’t cope with failure. I never thought anyone loved failure. Were these alien children or were they on to something? These children turned out to be thinking with a growth-mindset. A person with a growth mindset believes that human qualities, such as intellectual skills, can be cultivated through effort. Having this belief, not only they do not get discouraged by failure, they don’t even think they are failing. Rather, they think that they are learning, and consequently, they get smarter!The superpower of people with growth-mindset is that they have the confidence and courage to start and accomplish anything; and they do accomplish because, in the face of many inevitable failures, they are not discouraged. They do not say to themselves I am a failure, rather, they say I failed. Hence, they persevere, and they will triumph at the task.People with a fixed-mindset, on the other hand, think that human qualities are carved in stone. You are smart or you are not, and failure means you are not. The sad story for people with fixed-mindset is that the try to avoid failure at all costs, so they can stay (feel) smart. Struggles, mistakes, perseverance are just not part of their philosophy.Why do people differThe question that arises here, is why some people are endowed with a growth-mindset, while the others are doomed with the fixed-mindset. The answer is in their childhood upbringing and it is really simple.Imagine you are given a puzzle and you solve it. Now your parent sees your accomplishment. This is where the seeds to glory or mediocrity get implanted. If your parent praised you in the lines of: Look, what a smart boy/girl …You are so intelligent, excellent … Sorry to tell, but you are doomed if you have heard similar praises during your childhood. Such complements may come from your parents, teachers, caretakers, the source doesn’t really matter. But wait for a second, aren't such praises suppose to uplift your spirit and raise your confidence? Well, let's see what happens behind the curtain (in your subconscious mind) when you are complimented on a trait, over which you have not direct control (in this case, IQ and intelligence).Imagine you have solved a puzzle and received a juicy complement hinting on you high IQ or intelligence. Now, you are given a harder puzzle, you strive to solve it, but, you notice it is taking much more time. This is where the self-limiting seeds start to grow. In your subconscious you will start a self-dialog along these lines: hmm, wasn’t I a smart boy/girl, why am I not able to solve this puzzle then??? Hmm, maybe this is just how smart I am. My intelligence is limited to those tasks only … From then on, you will be very conservative of the activities you will get yourself into for the sake of preserving your self-esteem. Too bad! Don’t freak out though if you are in this category, I will share with you how you can easily change this self-limiting mindset as we proceed. Now, let’s see how children are endowed with the growth mindset.Imagine, again, the very same scenario, you solve a problem and now it is time for some praises … Your parent, instructor, while marveling at your accomplishments, says: Hmm, good job, this might have been an easy puzzle, let’s do something more challenging…orHmm, good job, you seem to have worked so hard, let’s move on to a harder puzzle. Take note that in the second scenario, there is no emphasis on an innate trait, rather, the praise is on something which is you have control over, that is, your efforts and how hard you work.Now let’s examine your self-dialog as you face the new harder challenge. When you try to solve the puzzle and it takes time more than the usual, if you could play your subconscious mind’s voice a little louder, you would hear:Hmm, I have not yet solved it, I have not tried enough, I must work harder on it, it is exciting.You see the difference? How do I know if I have fixed-mindset or growth-mindsetThe cornerstone of change is to first acknowledge that a shortcoming exist. So, to uncover if you have the fixed or growth-mindset, read the sentences below:Our intelligence is something very basic about you that you can’t change very much.You can learn new things, but you can’t really change how intelligent you are.No matter how much intelligence you have, you can always change it quite a bit.You can always substantially change how intelligent you are.If you agree more with the sentences 1, and 2, you are mostly behaving and operating with a fixed-mindset, and if you identify yourself with sentences 3, and 4, you operating with a growth-mindset.When asked people, ranging from children to young adults: When Do You Feel Smart: When you are flawless or when you are learning? Here are how differently people with a fixed-mindset replied:It’s when I don’t make any mistakes.When I finish something fast and it’s perfect.When Something is easy for me but other people can’t do it.And this is how people with growth-mindset replied: When it’s really hard, and I try really hard, and I can do something I couldn’t do before.When I work on something for a long time and I start to figure it out.See the difference? Which set of answers resonates most with you?There was a saying in 1960 which read: “Becoming is better than being”. The fixed-mindset robs people from the luxury of becoming. They have to already be. Mindset in relationshipsMindsets manifest themselves in every domain, whether you are a leader, teacher, parent, or a husband/wife. I chose relationship since I guess there are lots of myths around this topic (we all once craved to find our one true soulmate I guess), and also you must beware that even people with growth-mindset, might approach a domain like relationships with fixed-mindset.People with fixed-mindset think that if their relationship is the right one, and if they are compatible with one another, well, this means most things will fall into its place. In the face of problems, they tremble and threads of doubts and fears start to sneak in.People with fixed-mindset say if this is the right relationship and if we are compatible, there must be no need for hustle and hard work to get it to work. Remember the delusions sparked by the fixed-mindset? “If you have the ability, then you shouldn’t work hard for it”.Aaron Beck, noted marriage authority, says that one of the most destructive beliefs for a relationship is “If we need to work at it, there’s something seriously wrong with our relationship.” Says John Gottman, a foremost relationship researcher:Every marriage demands an effort to keep it on the right track; there is a constant tension . . . between the forces that hold you together and those that can tear you apart.As with personal achievement, this belief—that success should not need effort—robs people of the very thing they need to make their relationship thrive. It’s probably why so many relationships go stale—because people believe that being in love means never having to do anything taxing.How do I go from fixed-mindset to growth-mindsetIn this section, I share with you how you can adopt a growth mindset. Congrats, we have already taken the first step by shedding the light on these two modes of thinking. Regardless of these further steps, the sheer awareness of these two mindsets takes you a long way, but, it may not be enough.One way which is a profoundly effective way to instill the growth-mindset is studying the lives of great performers, and world-known figures like Michael Jordan, Mozart, Michelangelo, etc. Why, you might ask. The reason is that when you study the lives of such achievers, you will notice a common theme in their life story and that it, “hard work”, and not talent or IQ. While people marveled at the Pietà masterpiece, this is how the wizard, Michelangelo responded:If people knew how hard I worked to get my mastery, it wouldn't seem so wonderful at all...For practical insights refer to:  Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset"
4,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5564496-jamie-doerschuck,1,"I think a lot of people who rated this book highly must have had a ""fixed mindset"".I think this book was a waste of money, personally. The tone of the book is very repetitive and annoying. Essentially people with a growth mindset are better than people without it in every possible way. If you have a fixed mindset you'll have lower grades in school, be unhappier, die earlier, be fatter, (be more likely to) never get married, make a bundle less money, you name it! It reads more like fear mongering than actual research, rattling off a list of everyone's most basic fears ""But if you listen to me, Carol Dweck, all of your dreams and more will come true!"".I also don't recall Dweck listing many references to any of her research, you're just supposed to take her stories at face value ""Because I'm a researcher!"". Mindset offers a lot of words with little substance. I will admit that I haven't finished the book, and I don't plan to. Dweck's tone really just grated on my nerves, and I don't feel I gained anything useful from reading what parts of the book I read. I can't imagine anything more useful coming to light at the end."
5,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1112254-michael,5,"Excellent book. This one sounds like a typical self-help book, but it's a real find. The author is a pyschology researcher at Columbia, and her book is filled with insights and illustrations regarding the differences that a fixed mindset vs. a growth mindset can have when applied to business, parenting, school, and relationships. Her research has been highlighted in many venues, including an excellent book on parenting titled Nurture Shock. I give it 5 stars because I can see so much of myself in the book's description of the fixed mindset. The book's message spoke to me and the mindset I've adopted in some areas of my life. I'm particularly prone to the ""Effort Gone Awry"" scenario where I would work hard, but not with a growth mindset (i.e., one associated with the love of learning). Rather, I'd be working hard to prove myself to others. I worked hard to have achievements that would validate my self worth and adopted identity. The downside is that you end up being unwilling to take risks or face tough challenges (if you fail, your self worth goes down). Also, you end up running yourself ragged and being stressed out because you're afraid of losing the approval of others if you don't succeed.I find the growth mindset fits very well within a Christian perspective as our life in God needs to be always one of continual growth -- ""higher up and deeper in"" as C.S. Lewis would say. The fixed vs. growth mindset isn't the whole story, but it's an important part of the puzzle in helping us better understand how our minds work. I like the diagram on p.245 that I believe sums up the message of the book.Fixed Mindset:-E.g., Intelligence is staticLeads to a desire to look smart and therefore a tendency to...Challenges: avoid challengesObstacles: get defensive or give up easilyEffort: see effort as fruitless or worseCriticism: ignore useful negative feedbackSuccess of others: feel threatened by the success of others=> As a result, they may plateau early and achieve less than their full potentialGrowth Mindset:-E.g., Intelligence can be developedLeads to a desire to learn and therefore a tendency to...Challenges: embrace challengesObstacles: persist in the face of setbacksEffort: see effort as the path to masteryCriticism: learn from criticismSuccess of others: find lessons and inspiration in the success of others=> As a result, they reach ever-higher levels of achievementThese basic questions are also helpful in developing a growth mindset.I need to continually ask myself:-What are the opportunities for learning and growth today? For myself? For the people around me?As I think of opportunities and form a plan, I need to ask:When, where, and how will I embark on my plan?As I encounter difficulties, I need to ask:When, where, and how will I act on my new plan?And when you succeed, ask yourself:What do I have to do to maintain and continue the growth?"
6,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5048121-becca,1,"It's pretty bad when after 15 pages, I want to fling a book away in disgust. But I kept reading. (Okay, it turned into skimming pretty quickly). And it DIDN'T GET BETTER. I've read several thoughtful and interesting pieces of journalism lately referencing the general thesis of this book that were really thought provoking. But the book itself is just empty tripe and cliches, without adding any content of interest to bolster the general idea that it's more important to foster a growth mindset over a static mindset in people, so that they can better cope with and adapt to situations in which they are not just naturally talented. I'm actually very sympathetic to this general idea, but the book was just terribly written, and in fact made me wonder if I should rethink my agreement with her. Here is just a small sampling of ridiculousness that is within the pages of this book:- A section is literally begun with the words ""Since the dawn of time."" Your average ninth grader should be aware that this is a terrible idea.- An extensive summary of the movie ""Groundhog's Day"" is given as support for a theory of psychology.- Half the book is filled with ""interesting trivia"" that suggest that people who begin stupid can work hard and be AMAZING!!! For example, did you know people thought Einstein was slow as a child?! - Yes, everybody knows that piece of faux-trivia. And it's not even true - real evolutionary psychologists believe that Einstein's brain was larger than average in areas that encourage spatial reasoning and an intuitive grasp of numbers. (Steven Pinker told me that in _The Blank Slate_. After about three pages of this book, it was not hard to decide which author I find more credible.)- So many ridiculous cliches (introduced as ARGUMENTS and EVIDENCE) that it would be impossible to catalogue them all. This book is practically an encyclopedia of phrases like ""nothing ventured, nothing gained!"" and ""if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.""- The explanations of the research projects that created these ""findings"" make it obvious that you cannot trust these results. For instance, they presented kindergarteners with a test that they said was ""very important."" Before administering the test, they asked followup questions of the five year olds: ""Do you think this test will measure how smart you are?"" and ""Do you think this test will measure how smart you will be as a grown-up?"" Almost all of them said yes, except for one five year old I am certain is fictional, who responded ""No way! Ain't no test that can measure that!"" If you ask a FIVE YEAR OLD an extremely leading question who has been given no information, you are almost guaranteed to get a shower of ""yes!"" answers. The fact that they didn't immediately display suspiciousness toward researchers and critically deconstruct their questions is evidence of nothing. At best, it's evidence that children respond to leading questions and/or don't listen and think very deeply or carefully when asked leading questions.- There is one section that is full of reports about ""genius children"" to suggest that some of them turned out well (the ones who still applied hard work) and some who didn't (because they just rested on their natural proclivities). All of these stories feel impossible to believe the way they are presented. The author read a book once that told a story about a four month old baby who asked his parents ""Mom and Dad, what are we eating for dinner tonight?"" This is third-hand, not cited, and completely un-credible. (Even if a baby was genius enough to speak in full sentences at four months old, he cannot eat solid food yet, so why on earth does he care what they are making for dinner?).In short, this might be the worst book I've ever read. Before reading it, I was very persuaded by its premise. After reading it and discovering that at least this explanation of the thesis is the opposite of convincing, I will approach all writers who accept this theory with a huge degree of distrust and suspicion. "
7,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1472086-stark,4,"This is probably all i really need to hear out of this book, but i will read the whole thing anyway. there are two mindsets. fixed and growth.Believing that your qualities are carved in stone -- the fixed mindset -- creates an urgency to prove yourself over and over. If you have only a certain amount of intelligence, a certain personality, and a certain moral character -- well, then you'd better prove you have a healthy dose of them. It simply wouldn't do to look or feel deficient in these most basic characteristics. ...I've seen so many people with this one consuming goal of proving themselves -- in the classroom, in their careers, and in their relationships. Every situation calls for a confirmation of their intelligence, personality, or character. Every situation is evaluated: Will I succeed or fail? Will I look smart or dumb? Will I be accepted or rejected? Will I feel like a winner or a loser?...There's another mindset in which these traits are not simply a hand you're dealt and have to live with, always trying to convince yourself and others that you have a royal flush when you are secretly worried it's a pair of tens. In this mindset, the hand you're dealt is just the starting point for development. This growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts. ...Do people with this mindset believe that anyone can be anything, that anyone with proper motivation or education can become Einstein or Beethoven? No, but they believe that a person's true potential is unknown (and unknowable); that's its impossible to forsee what can be accomplished with years of passion, toil, and training.""a person's true potential is unknown (and unknowable)"" i feel like those words contain so much freedom for both those who have been made crazy by high expectations in their upbringing, and put down with low ones. it is not a knowable thing, what your potential is, anyone who told you they knew, it was a lie, and you have nothing to prove and nothing to hide? what a relief"
8,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,4,"Recommended in Stanford Magazine and by Guy Kawasaki.A very useful book about the growth mindset. Essentially, the book makes a case that those people who look at everything they do in life as a learning opportunity are much more successful. I think where this comes into play most often is when we face a setback, or a failure. Whether thats getting rejected from something (a job, a team, etc), messing up at work, having your boss yell at you, losing at something, getting laid off, making a bad bet, etc - most of us have many setbacks in our lives. How we deal with those is incredibly important. If we let the setback define us, we might think we aren't talented after all, and lose confidence. If on the other hand, we look at it as something we can learn from, we improve as a person.I came at the book as it was recommended to me as being good for parents. My daughter is only 1.6 years, but already she is learning fast. The book recommends praising our children's efforts, instead of their results. Telling them they are ""amazing"", and ""smart"" is so easy to do, but if you do that their whole lives they won't succeed when they get to the real world. What you want is to encourage a learning attitude. This quote sums it up: ""So what should we say when children complete a task—say, math problems—quickly and perfectly? Should we deny them the praise they have earned? Yes. When this happens, I say, “Whoops. I guess that was too easy. I apologize for wasting your time. Let’s do something you can really learn from!""Looking at life as a constant challenge is fun. And you can't fail at a personal challenge! Here is a great mental imagery technique the book mentioned when you are doing something you are bad at:""Picture your brain forming new connections as you meet the challenge and learn. Keep on going.""Another interesting bit was how people at the top of their game can get caught up in a fixed mindset. You see this in sports all the team - the champion team from last year thinks they can cruise through this year, doesn't work hard, and suddenly they are losing a lot. It's so hard to maintain the edge. John Wooden puts it best:""I believe ability can get you to the top,” says coach John Wooden, “but it takes character to keep you there.… It’s so easy to … begin thinking you can just ‘turn it on’ automatically, without proper preparation. It takes real character to keep working as hard or even harder once you’re there. When you read about an athlete or team that wins over and over and over, remind yourself, ‘More than ability, they have character.'"""
9,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826429-sj-loria,2,"Watered down and scientifically not that accurate (grit is a part of conscientiousness - see studies below), welcome to education's favorite book!Here is my two sentence summary of this book (best spoken in kindergartner teacher voice): There are two kinds of people in the world, people who believe things are fixed, others who believe they can change through hard work and effort, so believe in the ladder and success will open in front of you! Hooray you are a special snowflake that can grow!Heavy on the inspirational stories and antidotes, light on the data to support some of the arguments and essentially void of the how to. I agree that the right attitude, one that embraces struggle and hard work in order to increase your talents (which are not fixed, but fluid), helps you succeed in life. But it's about putting ideas into action. This book offers very little practical advice or steps one can take in order to do so. I think most people, after reading this, get that warm fuzzy feeling that wow, this makes sense! But then that fades, and life resumes, and it's just a book on the shelf. Maybe even a companion book to put this idea into action to train the elephant in you (thanks Happiness Hypothesis).Ultimately, success requires the right attitude but also the sweat to make it happen. And this doesn't really offer practical steps on how to make it happen. There ain't no short cut.Studies that debunk this book:http://communityconnectors.ohio.gov/P... (read the abstract page one)"
10,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,3,"Great overarching concept, lackluster execution. In Mindset, Professor of Psychology Carol S. Dweck discusses the difference between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset. The fixed mindset focuses on immovable measures of achievement and ability, such as the idea that everyone is born with a certain amount of unchangeable intelligence. The growth mindset advocates that everyone can improve themselves in any area of life through hard work. Dweck argues that we should adapt the growth mindset because it aids in parenting, academics, relationships, and more.As a Psychology major I learned about growth and fixed mindsets in my classes, and it was cool to see Dweck apply the concepts to several different areas, such as sports, marriage, and politics. However, I wish she had done more with her main argument: instead of delving deeper into the psychology behind the mindsets, it felt like she stayed at the surface level of her ideas and applied them to a wide range of interesting yet repetitive anecdotes. She could have connected growth and fixed mindsets to mental health, stereotype threat, feminism, or an assortment of other topics that would have strengthened the thesis of her book.After 276 pages, I did not feel like I learned anything new. It's not like anything Dweck wrote was wrong or bad, but I could capture her main argument and share it with people just by having them read an article or two, as opposed to this entire book."
11,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5868753-alex,2,"Another book that attempts to build upon the research of Anders Ericsson.The way I read it, I would break the book into 3 parts:Part 1: How people fail because they don't have the right mindsetPart 2: How people success because they have the right mindsetPart 3: You could also call this part 2a - it basically deals with children and success in school, home, etc.The first part of the book was the worst. Its case after case of ""this person tried to succeed and failed because he didn't have the right mindset"". Great. So what was the right mindset? She doesn't tell you. How do you obtain it, or get into that mindset? She doesn't tell you. She tells you whats wrong without explaining WHY it is wrong, etc. She sorta reserves that for the next part of the book. Also, there is no form. Its kind of a rambling, unorganized mess. You read it and are wondering ""Ok, this person failed, that person failed. They didn't have the right mindset. Do you mind explaining to me what the right mindset ACTUALLY IS? How a bout how do *I* get the right mindset so I can avoid all this?"" Some of those questions never get answered.The second part of the book has all these success stories, and she tells you that they were successful because they had the right mindset. She delves slightly into what the right mindset is, but there really aren't a new revelations here. And she never tells you how to get into that mindset. IOW, there is nothing in the book about motivation (intrinsic or extrinsic). There is nothing about background and upbringing or lessons learn earlier in life. There is no compare and contrast with the first part of the book to bring things into a proper context.IOW, shes not teaching you about mindset, shes just telling you. Thanks. Its like describing to someone how the piano is played vs actually giving someone lessons.If you are interested in this type of material, check out Geoffry Colvin's ""Talent Is Overrated"" and Matthew Sayid's ""Bounce"" - preferably in that order. Read it and you will see all that this book is missing. And though Colvin's book can get dry at time, it still has forward movement, and ideas build upon previous ones, and things are explained very well. All things that this one is lacking."
12,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"I bought this book last year, but didn't get around to it. While reading something else recently, it referred to this one and I decided to give it a go. The basic premise is that ""the view you adopt for yourself profoundly affects the way you lead your life.""""Believing that your qualities are carved in stone - the fixed mindset - creates and urgency to prove yourself over and over. If you have only a certain amount of intelligence, a certain personality, and a certain moral character - well, then you'd better prove that you have a healthy dose of them. It simply wouldn't do to look or feel deficient in these most basic characterstics.""""The growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts. Although many people may differ in every which way - in their initial talents and aptitudes, interests or temperaments - everyone can change and grow through application and experience.""I've done some soul searching on myself, because I can certainly be angst-ridden and defensive. However, no matter how terribly I've failed, I have always tried again. I am a firm believer that there is no such thing as talent, only practice. It wasn't just Malcolm Gladwell who convinced me of this. I went to an elite highschool. We were all told we were smart, but that that would not put us through - only effort would. The growth mindset cultivated in my class led to many remarkable achievements. I had already cultivated good study habits, and these saw me through. I was more interested in learning than in being the best - the latter would have been futile in the group I was in anyway.The psychology classes of those highschool years taught me about IQ tests and the difficulty of measuring such a thing because of biases. It also taught me that most of the things measured could be learned. The IQ tests I have taken prove as much. I excel at langauge, anagrams, visual patterns and numbers - these are things I have practiced. I suck at logic. I never really attempted to learn it in the theory of knowledge classes either, but I could have and could still.When I was appointed my first management position, I read. When I got more responsibility and felt overwhelmed, I went back to part-time school and took a semester of work and organization psychology. This also involved some very specific things around Norwegian employment law, in addition to learning more about how people react to different situations. These classes were incredibly helpful. If I had had a fixed mindset, I would probably not have put so much effort into learning how to be a better boss having believed my traits and talents fixed. But I'm not done, and I never will be - there are always more things to learn.Lately I've become better at recognizing destructive thought patterns and tweaking my reactions. This is cognitive psychology, something this author doesn't seem to hold high in regard. However, the cognitive psychology I have been reading focuses much on behavior. If you want to live a more healthy lifestyle, start behaving like you are. Get your ass out of the sofa. And so forth. I find that the cognitive approach and the growth mindset go hand in hand.When things go to hell, don't take it personally but do accept personal responsibility for it. Learn what you can, move on and do better next time. Take it from me, the biggest screw up contain the biggest potential lessons.There is no talent. There is only effort and practice."

Dweck(original review, 2006)Following the footsteps of someone who is great in order to be great is moronic. Only talentless fools would look to do the same as others to be successful. The only way to succeed is by doing what you love and get obsessed by it. You will be working over 100 hours a week, and you will be thinking about it every second awake, and you will be a success because nobody loves it as much as you do. It is like when you get with a girl that you love and it doesn't matter how pretty people say other’s girls are in comparison to yours; it is yours the most beautiful in your eyes."
14,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59094974-ladan,3,"It is easy to follow the first 150 pages of the book in which the writer who is an accentuated Stanford professor presents the outcome of her research accompanied by tangible instances in various fields. I enjoy her honest confession of her flawed grammar through the very first pages. It makes her like one of those problem-solver types who yield to anyone who is obsessed with correcting others.While talking about her big experience with examining kids’ reactions to failure, it reminded me of my 2-year-old niece who strives for her independence and doing anything on her own. I assume that kids are one of the best sources to learn and approach anything in a novel way.Dweck categorizes people into having two kinds of mindsets, albeit it is feasible that one would have a mixture of both mindsets.1. The growth mindset, which promises one to learn and improve in any desired field.2. The fixed mindset, which leads to frustration and anxiety.The growth mindset insists that humans are capable of improving their intelligence and abilities. People having this mindset have high self-esteem and believe in themselves since they know that if they try hard enough and spend ample time they will improve. The striving and improvement are what matter the most to people bearing this mindset, thus they enjoy the journey of challenge and progress not the moment of achievement. On the other hand, people holding a fixed mindset define themselves with what they achieve and if they do not succeed, it demeans them to nothing. Their self-esteem is highly tied to the result of their actions. However, growth mindset people value their effort, creativity and strategies rather than the outcome. They make opportunities out of their failures and challenge themselves each day to carve a better version of themselves. Unfortunately, fixed mindset people who are mostly perfectionists would go for doing repetitive tasks just in case to escape facing the risk of failure. Challenges and trying new things for them equals the probability of failure and being judged. They presume that if you are born with a gift there is no need for putting effort into work!It is possible for the growth mindset people to get frustrated after failure or even feel depressed, though they would still be functional. Therefore, talent is by no means something to be proud of, instead, the effort and courage to take risks are of high value. Yet they are realistic enough to be aware of that trying hard does not guarantee success, the novel strategies that you use creatively to improve matter the most. They know that there are many other factors, which may influence achieving a goal or not achieving it, i.e financial status, network, education level, and different available resources, which significantly affect how much effort one should put into work.Regardless of what mindset one has been holding up to now, it is recommended to consciously take the road to a growth mindset. This mindset makes it easy to enjoy spending time on what one loves and one may accordingly prosper in something never planned for.Fixed mindset types owe their success to their talent and innate abilities, no matter how hard they try, it is always a matter of innate gift, you have it or not, you were born with it or not. There are numerous examples provided through the book in almost every field, introducing world-class gurus, describing their mindset and their approaches in order to clarify how the growth and fixed mindset work. The upshot of studies investigating three types of corporates and their mindsets is very informative:1. The average corporates upgraded to high-level ones, which sustain their status2. The average corporates improved to a high-level but degraded to their previous status3. The corporates, which had no improvement at all through the time of probingBear in mind that the resources available to these corporates were almost similar and the only distinguishing difference between them was their mindset. I found the examples provided in chapter 5 so tangible and applicable, especially for managers and leaders. They are constructive and illuminate the role of a leader, who is supposed to guide the system and simultaneously learn and educate him/herself with the staff and produce a feeling of belonging among the staff. This so reminded me of Jordan Belford in wolf of wall street movie and how strongly his staff felt belonged. In hard times, this feeling won’t let them even think about quitting, instead it motivates them to improve the circumstances and be more committed and feel more responsible to solve the problems. The feeling of belonging leads to a feeling of being supported regardless of the result. Systems holding a growth mindset act more humanely because they don’t consider one to act like a machine and do exactly what he is told to achieve the desired goal. However, in a fixed mind system chances are that people act unethically to prove themselves (since they are only measured by the outcome) and remain safe and secure from being judged. In these systems, one may easily be belittled, insulted or even omitted due to failure, however in a system holding a growth mindset people are allowed to take risks and creatively take new approaches to handle the situation. This may still turn into failure but they value the improvement and effort.Discussing the relationships in chapter 6, Dweck puts the emphasis on the art of communication and suggests that one should cease the expectancy of others to be mind readers. She believes lack of actual communication skills is the origin of misunderstandings and advises that one should put time and effort into a relationship to make it work. In order to figure out our mindset, it is better to check the features of each mindset in our behaviours and approaches. If we are defensive, inflexible to change and always looking for excuses and someone to blame and consider ourselves as victims of the circumstances, we hold a fixed mindset which can only provide us with the abovementioned alibies to escape the responsibility and imprison us in our comfort zone. On the other hand, if we strive for improvement and learning and are embrace new challenges just for the sake of growth we have a growth mindset. The last chapter which seems to be added recently claims to provide one with approaches to alter the fixed mindset. After all, I found the book somehow too long and repetitive yet informative! "

Should be required reading for parents and educators, but everyone can benefit--even if you aren't really on the prowl for 'success'. What I love most is that the concept will improve yourself, but even if you struggle to change your mindset from 'fixed' to 'growth' you can instill benefits on others by praising work rather than talent.If you've ever praised someone for being 'smart' or destined to be the 'next Mozart' or a 'natural' you'll realize that you've inadvertently wrecked havoc on their psyche. As victims of this type of praise, you'll learn how to change your mindset after being damaged. Of course the book is much more than that, but those segments were the most life-changing for me. The 'growth' and 'fixed' mindset concepts extend to every aspect of life and, unlike many self-help books, it's not necessarily something that's common sense. This IS revolutionary. Check it out!!!"

I am only on page 43 but I already have dismissed the ideas and the author as superficial. Written in a casual style (the author states in the introduction: ""A little note about grammar. I know it and I love it, but I haven't always followed it in this book. I start sentences with ands and buts. I end sentences with prepositions. I use the plural they in contexts that require the singular he or she. I've done this for imformality and immediacy, and I hope that the sticklers will forgive me.""Well, I have a hard time forgiving that when this had to pass through professional copy editors (it's published by Ballentine). But even worse is the informality of the anecdotes and conclusions.Her thesis is that there are two types of people in the world, those with a ""fixed mindset"" and those with a ""growth mindset."" The former believe that their intelligence and ability are ""fixed"" and there is no opportunity to become smarter or more able. So why try. Do what you are already good at and avoid situations where you might possibly fail or do worse than expected. Growth-minded people believe that failure is an opportunity to grow.That's it. There's the book. Fluffed up with superficial renderings of true life stories and supposed quotes from the author's research subjects.While the author has 239 footnotes at the back of the book, backing up her statements, her stories come off as simplistic to the extreme. The most disturbing example so far is that of the late chef, Bernard Loiseau. The author claims he committed suicide because he had a fixed mindset and could not accept that his restaurant lost a ""star"" in the leading restaurant guide in Europe. ""...the director of the GaultMillau (the restaurant guide) said it was unimaginable that their rating could have taken his life. But in the fixed mindset, it is imaginable. The lower rating gave him a new definition of himself: Failure. Has-been.""It's striking what counts as failure in the fixed mindset. So, on a lighter note...""Here the author has taken a complex situation and reduced it to ""guy killed himself because he was one of my two types of people in the world."" And then blythely moves on to ""a lighter note.""A quick look at Wikipedia shows that there was more to the story than that. There were known factors such as debt. And any thinking person would tell you there are other underlying factors that could have been involved such as clinical depression, bi-polar disorder, possibly drug or alcohol abuse, childhood abuse or neglect issues, the list goes on. The point is, the author chose to simplify in a way that simply makes her point.I'm still reading this book because it makes me actually angry and I feel I need to review it for my administrators to let them know my thoughts."

18,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4664225-neil-lynch,4,"Walt Disney once said the best way to get something done is to stop talking about it and do it. Such a simple sentiment ought to be a no-brainer; and yet, how often have we let opportunities slip through our grasp because of the way we think, what we believe, or what we uphold as valuable?In MINDSET, Carol Dweck shares her research on that particular part of the brain and how it affects the way we live our lives and approach our goals. Using powerful examples, Dweck shows how too much praise of a child's intelligence or making too much of an employee's innovation can be just as bad as saying too little or nothing at all. She goes on to show how just a simple change in the way we think about the brain - in the way we THINK! - can make us lovers of learning and more resilient in the way we approach our lives, our work, our education - even our relationships!I worked at GE during the Jack Welch years, so it's not at all surprising to see him extolled here as a mindset model. Welch was a tough boss, but he was always hardest on himself. He was a straight shooter who owned up to his mistakes, actively sought to improve the way he did his job, and always - perhaps because he had come up through the ranks himself - went back to the employees, whom he considered to be the experts, for input and advice on how to make the company a better place.MINDSET is nothing new to me. Dweck's down-to-earth presentation of it here, though, is a welcome refresher and an inspiring read. Suffering from mindset? This book's for you!"
19,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575806-kressel-housman,5,"The flap copy on this book promised it would be ""a great book that will change your life."" That certainly raised my expectations, and I'm happy to report that I wasn't disappointed.The premise of the book is the basis of cognitive psychology: what you believe affects your whole life, so if you can change your beliefs, ie, your mindset, you can change your life. This book characterizes two mindsets, the fixed and the growth-oriented. The fixed is the more common one because that's what society tends to drill into us. Natural talent necessarily brings success. If you're talented, you shouldn't have to work hard, and if you fail, then you just weren't as talented as you thought you were. The growth mindset is the opposite. Hard work is more important to success than talent, and when you fail, you just have to plan a better strategy for success. The book goes on to show applications of both mindsets in sports, business, relationships, education, and parenting. And the stories cited paint human portraits. My favorites were the contrast between fixed mindset John McEnroe vs. growth mindset Tiger Woods. And I'm not even into sports! It didn't matter; the point is the psychology.The author acknowledges that it's not easy to rid yourself of the fixed mindset. But since reading this book, I'm vigilant on myself. And most of all I try and remember its most important lesson: if at first you don't succeed, try, try again. "
20,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7198893-jonathan-karmel,2,"I read the first few chapters but then ended up skimming the rest. I absolutely agree with the author that it's better to have a growth mindset than a fixed mindset. It just seemed like the author made the point and then kept repeating it over and over again. I did think it was valuable to apply this principle to relationships (chapter 6); it's nice to have someone confirm that good relationships are a lot of hard work and that if a relationship requires a great deal effort that does not mean that you failed to find your true love.While having a growth mindset is a prerequisite to success, I don't personally think changing your mindset is the greatest impediment to success. I think a lot of people believe they could succeed, but they feel like they lack the motivation and energy to make the effort to do things that are really difficult. They feel like they should do things but then feel guilty about not doing them. By the way, I'd be interested to know how the author squares her theory with the section of the The Feeling Good Handbook by David Burns that explains why you should stop “must”-erbating. It seems like a person who tried to take Dweck's advice to heart would spend a lot of time feeling like they ""should"" be doing things to grow, and might also feel awful that they are not actually doing all of the things that they feel that they should be doing.Also, many, many people are constantly making a tremendous effort to grow but still feel as if they are failing. They are in fact expending effort ineffectively and are extremely frustrated. Is the problem for most people really that they do not have a growth mindset, or rather that they just can't figure out exactly what they need to do to grow?"

So what is the difference? I really enjoyed this book which addresses this question head on. Carol S. Dweck is a Stanford University psychologist who has spent decades of research on achievement and success. In the end the differing factor for her came down to the concept of mindset. Do you have a fixed mindset or a growth mindset? This book was recommended to me by the headmaster of my son's school. She recommended it to all of the parents for their children to foster their academic success. I found the author's findings to be helpful and revelatory, though I wasn't crazy about the writing. At time I felt it was choppy and abrupt, and almost too simplistic, but I think this book is worth reading regardless as her research is important to help people breakthrough their own barriers to achieve their full potential."

The author teaches you how to find a good mindset which works for you.2.

24,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81985901-jagadish,5,"But everyone knows the growth mindset vs fixed mindset but the book explain more than that.What really matters we never know about false growth mindset that is theCommon Misunderstanding of Growth mindset1. Many people take what they like about themselves and call it a “growth mindset.” If they’re open-minded or flexible, they say they have a growth mindset. I often hear people calling it an “open mindset.” But there’s a difference between being flexible or open-minded and being dedicated to growing talent.2. Many people believe that a growth mindset is only about effort, especially praising effort. The first important thing to remember here is that the process includes more than just effort. Certainly, we want children to appreciate the fruits of hard work. We don’t want them to just try harder with the same ineffective strategy.And we want them to ask for help or input from others when it’s needed. This is the process we want them to appreciate: hard work, trying new strategies, and seeking input from others.3. A growth mindset equals telling kids they can do anything.But it doesn’t happen by simply telling them, “You can do anything.” It happens by helping them gain the skills and find the resources to make progress toward their goals. Otherwise, it’s an empty reassurance. It puts the onus entirely on the children and may make them feel like a failure if they don’t reach their goals.One final word about putting the onus on the studentSome educators and coaches were blaming kids for having a fixed mindset scolding or criticizing them for not displaying growth-mindset qualities.“I can’t teach this child. He has a fixed mindset.” Let’s be totally clear here. Teachers and educators must take seriously our responsibility to create growth-mindset-friendly environments where kids feel safe from judgment, where they understand that we believe in their potential to grow, and where they know that we are totally dedicated to collaborating with them on their learning. We are in the business of helping kids thrive, not finding reasons why they can’t.Some people think they always had fixed mindset Although for simplicity Author talked as though some people have a growth mindset and some people have a fixed mindset, in truth we’re all a mixture of the two. There’s no point denying it. Sometimes we’re in one mindset and sometimes we’re in the other. Our task then becomes to understand what triggers our fixed mindset. What are the events or situations that take us to a place where we feel our (or other people’s) abilities are fixed? What are the events or situations that take us to a place of judgment rather than to a place of development?Other concepts :Naming fixed persona mindset example create your own Maurice Easy to blame someone always? But it’s not good for a relationship to pin everything on your partner. When you fail at other tasks, it’s hard to keep blaming someone else. But when something goes wrong in a relationship, it’s easy to blame someone else. In fact, in the fixed mindset you have a limited set of choices. One is to blame your own permanent qualities. And one is to blame your partner’s. You can see how tempting it is to foist the blame onto the other guy.Create your own Maurice and blame him instead. Better yet, work toward curing yourself of the need to blame. Move beyond thinking about fault and blame all the time."

This rereading also confirmed that this is one of the books that will accompany my growth throughout different phases of my life. I believe it will accompany for the rest of my life, actually. It has pressed me to recognize the areas in which I had a fixed mindset and those in which I had a growth mindset and it has helped me change my view in the areas I had that fixed mindset.I was already able to see the difference in my behavior from the first reading to the second. In some instances (before that first reading) I reacted with a fixed mindset but now in my second reading I noted that in some of those instances I have already made some changes and I can manage to react with a growth mindset. This second reading was useful to see what has already changed in me, what still needs to be changed but most importantly, how to maintain those changes throughout my life. That's why I believe this book will be a life-long companion of mine, because it'll always help me with my personal development. I will definitely reread many more times. An essential reading. First reading: 11 October 2015 - 26 October 2015 This book is a game changer, I loved everything about it. It is one of those books which I will have to revisit over and over again and still learn something with it."
26,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3745545-roslyn,2,"1) The author begins by going on and on about how important she is and how important her ideas are. Which made her sound insecure, and let me know right off the bat that she does not trust me to read her ideas and determine for myself whether they are good ideas or not. 2) In the beginning she also announces her ideas as one more panacea. One thing that is the cause of all problems. This made it hard to take her book seriously at all.3) Her idea of fixed and growth ""mindsets"" is NOT a new psychology, it is the concept of self-esteem by a new name. Or rather one character trait of people with high self-esteem and low self-esteem. She wouldn't know this though, since her only knowledge of the self-esteem movement comes from pop culture dumb-downs and are inaccurate. She makes some statements about ""the self-esteem movement"" that she means as insults but for someone who has actually read quite a bit about it, just confirms that she has never actually read a single thing by Nathaniel Branden and has no idea what he meant by self-esteem. 4) Her idea of fixed and growth ""mindsets"" is also similar to the concept of securely attached and insecurely attached individuals. (I would say that attachment style is another aspect of self-esteem.) Again, since she is the classic psychologist that apparently does not read what her fellow psychologists are writing, she has no idea. She thinks she has discovered something new and different.5) That being said, thinking in terms of growth is great! And I think her book would be a help to many people.6) BUT keep in mind that this is a dumb-down. She doesn't really examine the issues at hand and develop a full theory, she just comes up with some fun words and takes an entire book to explain something she could have written a 1 page paper on.7) ""Growth mindsets"" are fascinating to me. Why some people feel ""right"" in life and others feel not-good-enough no matter what they do fascinates me. This issue is tied, not just to our psychology, but to the WAY we think, it's tied to how our brains form concepts and abstractions, it's tied to our repression of our own fear of death--our attempts to control life, it's tied to religion and our ideas of ""good"" and ""bad."" It's tied to our culture and the messages we get in school and in the media, regardless of how we were parented. It's tied to our ideas about ""the pursuit of happiness"" and altruism. It's possibly tied to IQ. It's definitely tied to drugs--everybody has something they use to repress their strong feelings. This is a subject I have read hundreds of books on and I have found no real answer but plenty of panaceas! I too have noted that some people seem to take life lightly and others carry the weight of the world on their shoulders. Many psychologists (I think) are the latter and spend their lives trying to figure out how to be more like the former. They write these books trying to understand the light people and come up with all kinds of theories. And they're all a little helpful or at the very least interesting. That's this book: a little helpful.If this is a subject that interests you, skip this book and read: Happiness, a history by McMahon or Jordan Peterson’s 12 Rules."

I mean, am I the only one who doesn't view that as anything groundbreaking?

28,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1187470-mike,4,"Carol Dweck’s Mindset: The New Psychology of Success is based on a deceptively simple—yet powerful—premise. The central distinction she draws here is directly relevant to any of us interested in teaching leadership. According to Dr. Dweck (a Stanford psychology professor), each of us adopts one of two mindsets about life: the fixed or growth mindset. People with fixed mindsets tend to see human potential as static and finite; people with growth mindsets see human potential as more dynamic and elastic. Obviously, those who believe that leaders are “born, not made” subscribe to the fixed mindset. Those of us sharing the gcLi’s core philosophy—i.e. that leadership can be taught—fall into the growth mindset camp.	When Dr. Deak compares neurological pathways to rubber bands, she invokes the growth mindset. Similarly, when a leadership scholar like Professor Ron Heifetz of Harvard distinguishes adaptive from technical leadership, his distinction implicitly entails growth vs. fixed mindsets too. Over the long haul, the more successful athletes, teachers, spouses, coaches, professionals and entrepreneurs naturally tend to manifest beliefs and behaviors characteristic of the growth mindset. Few of us are bound to enjoying playing or working for coaches or bosses with fixed mindsets. Dweck’s book is full of cautionary examples of those sorts of leaders (from the likes of the Enron executives to coaches like the mercurial—perhaps infamous—Bobby Knight).	These memorable, illustrative anecdotes are one of the signal strengths of Mindset. Many readers of this sort of literature are already well familiar with the process-oriented, growth-minded approaches of perennial champions like Michael Jordan or long-tenured UCLA basketball coach John Wooden. Both these remarkable competitors managed to achieve outstanding success in the win-loss column over long careers. But both considered winning merely an inevitable byproduct of their zealous pursuit of athletic excellence and their willingness to outwork their opponents. Seeking constant growth and improvement in their own teams’ abilities were Wooden’s and Jordan’s primary focus. By manifesting their growth mindsets this way, they were also able to accomplish unparalleled productivity and victorious results—but almost as an afterthought or matter of course.	Dweck and other similarly minded leadership scholars believe that leaders emerge naturally in organizations that prize learning and manifest pervasive growth mindsets. Her dichotomy also recalls James MacGregor Burns’s seminal distinction between “transactional” and “transforming” leadership. Transactional leaders—according to Burns—simply “exchange valued things” with their followers. They have a sort of quid pro quo arrangement, in which everyone’s needs and wishes get served despite possibly finite resources. Operating out of a growth instead of fixed mindset, by contrast, transforming leaders seek to enlarge the size of the relevant pie. Burns’s transforming leaders use mutual engagement between them and and their followers to enhance their collective potential, thus raising the possibilities for all.	Dweck closes her analysis by pointing out that we each can choose which mindset we embody from moment to moment. Her final chapter, for instance, offers a sort of self-guided workshop or tutorial one might follow to work on changing one’s primary (default) mindset. By showing how many contexts in which mindsets profoundly affect one’s experiences, prospects for success, satisfaction in life, or the quality of one’s relationships, Dr. Dweck offers her readers a simple, broadly significant insight."

Michael Jordan had to practice really really hard before he became a great basketball player. OK. But if he were 5 feet tall, it would not matter how hard he practiced; he would never have been an NBA MVP superstar. Yet the author writes ""Can anyone do anything? I don't really know."" Seriously!? That is literally farcical.http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-liv...This book has glowing reviews from reputable sources and positions the author as ""one of the world's leading researchers"" in psychology. So I'm holding it to a high standard. The author mentions Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and claims that ""Mindsets go further."" CBT is supported by numerous clinical trials. Where is there similarly rigorous evidence for a benefit from Mindsets? I could not find it in the book. I think there are better books covering the same area.

32,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78108898-exitgirl05,4,"Even if you think you know everything there is to know regarding mind, learning and developing, read this book. It's not the theory itself. Dr Carol Dweck offers examples of everyday situations in which every human finds himself. How we cope with professional challenges, parenting, relationships... It will make you think and it will surely give you a whole new perspective on learning process. It will help you become not smarter, but hungrier for knowledge. "
33,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"The big idea of the book is that we can divide people into 2 groups: 1st group has a fixed mindset believing that the qualities they posses are carved in stone. Characteristics such as intelligence, personality, and creativity are fixed traits, rather than something that can be developed. 2nd group has a growth mindset coming from a belief that our basic qualities are things we can cultivate through effort. Group 2 understands that people differ greatly – in aptitude, talents, interests, temperaments etc... but everyone can change and grow through application and experience. The book also goes deep into implications of each belief and points out some basic mistakes that teachers, managers and parents make in their every day life which forces those they influence into a fixed mindset. I love reading about success and this book instantly turned into one of my favorites on the topic, the mindset concept is absolutely critical to understand and I would highly recommend you to read this book!"
34,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5079848-amina,2,"2.5☆First, the concept was good, the first chapters were great but then the I found the book to be very repetitive, it could have been written in about 150 pages, and a little bit judgmental, sometimes even a bit hard on the people with the fixed mindset."
35,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9846570-leah,5,"Marking as one of my favourite self help/personal development books!!!I got so much from this book and it's permanently impacted my life. It was slightly repetitive but it was just really zoning in on the points.This is definitely a re-read so that I can take notes and study it more.Just off the top of my head here are some of my take aways:- Be growth-minded not fixed-minded. Fixed minded is when you believe people were born with innate talents and skills and they can't develop/learn/grow. While the growth mind set is about becoming anything or anyone you want and learning and growing into the person you want to be.- Every human is born into a set of genetic code from their parents and has experiences which can or need not define them. You can change how you act and the decisions you make if you want to, it will just take some effort and work- Lots of great information on how to raise your children in this book. How certain praises actuakly do harm instead of your intended good praise. Like saying ""Oh wow Billy you got 100% on your test? That means you made no mistakes that's great! You're so smart."" This instill fear into Billy's mind that he should try his best not to make mistakes in the future or else he will not be ""smart."" And children feed off of the praise their parents give them so this is so crucial. It's better to talk about their effort instead of judging them. Instead say "" Oh wow Billy you got 100% on your test? You must have worked really hard and studied, I'm so proud of your efforts.""- Shyness was also an interesting aspect of this book because if you are a shy person that basically means that you are more so fixed-minded because you find judgement of other people important to you. If you were growth minded then you would focus n working on your shyness and uncomfortableness to improve yourself instead of just defining yourself as shy and that's the end of it.- When you are raised by judgemental family it can influence you to become fixed-minded.Carol S. Dweck is a smart cookie, I look forward to her future publications ;)""the courage to be open—to welcome change and new ideas regardless of their source. Real self-confidence is not reflected in a title, an expensive suit, a fancy car, or a series of acquisitions. It is reflected in your mindset: your readiness to grow."""""
36,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10400867,2,"The idea of having a growth mindset isn’t revolutionary, however, just like any good self-help book, it focuses on a specific trait, repositions its importance, and expands its application.The idea of “growth mindset” is insightful and impactful. Once integrated within the mindset of an individual, relationship or organization, the applications become limitless. The main idea of the book:""Every one of us should believe that our basic qualities are things we can cultivate through effort. Yes, people differ greatly but everyone can change and grow through application and experience""As a result, we should change the way we look at any past set back, current challenge, or future perceived distasteful experience. We should think about and approach them as learning opportunities. Thinking of them in such away: a) increases our willingness to be exposed to challenging situations, and b) increases the learning, and thus, our development as individuals. All this will result, in continuous incremental learnings as time passes by.The idea isn’t just about changing the way you think, but it’s about making this way of thinking a habit. This habit, will “convert” any belief about oneself limits to a narrative about “learning opportunities”The author then spends a good 70% of the book showing how this is applied in different situations (teachers, spouses, workplace, and sports).The verdict:•	The book delivers a short, simple, self-evident yet important truth that can be delivered in an article or 4 pages max. The additional 270 pages was pure waste. Too repetitive. •	The author is ‘too’ in love with her theory, she tries to attribute all human achievements to it. She oversells it in my opinion.•	The examples she gives are too polarized, too ideal. She portrays people with fixed mindset in a stereotypical shallow way showing them as morons. I really did not like that about the book"
37,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239658-karen-chung,4,"This book has one relatively simple message that is repeated over and over again in many different forms throughout the narrative: that we need to approach everything in life not with a fixed mindset - i.e. that people are either born artists, athletes, good students, or whatever, or they are not - but with a ""growth"" mindset, i.e. that we are highly malleable, and achieve through effort, not just by happening to be talented. Due to its repetitiveness, which sets in very early in the book, I originally planned to give it only three stars. But the message is an extremely important one, and the illustrative anecdotes are interesting and worth reading, thus the fourth star. "
38,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8460201-karen,3,"The idea of a ""growth mindset"" is a simple one, but quite profound for many people who have grown up believing that talents and abilities are ""fixed"". A growth mindset is possessed by those who believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.Not sure where you sit? You can take a questionnaire here: https://mindsetonline.com/testyourmin...Because it is such a simple concept, I found the book a bit repetitive and I think it could have benefited from more around how to develop and change your fixed mindset, rather than continually trying to prove why having a growth mindset is better.I recommend this book to anyone interested in self development, who is a teacher/trainer, or has children!"
39,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38829282-nicholas-shaw,1,"How in the name of hell is this book rated so highly!? The central message is clearly that you should adopt the growth mindset if you wish to grow and improve at basically anything in life. If you have the fixed mindset you seem to believe you're stuck with what you've got, much frustration and general failure ensues.I can't imagine anyone arguing against hard work and effort to get anywhere in life but how is this book several hundred pages? Save yourself the effort and watch the TED talk at most if this summary isn't enough for you."
40,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11410080-rebecca,4,"Any book that helps you develop a new way to process failure, and a new way to learn and grow, is a book worth reading. I've already been telling everyone about the growth mindset, and I only just finished reading this. I wish everyone knew how to access and nourish their growth mindset, and I'm glad to start the journey towards my potential. Get outta here fixed mindset! This is the first ""self-help"" book I've ever read, and now I'm sad I didn't read it sooner. I highly recommend this."

I delayed my reading a lot and wish that I could have read the book with the same enthusiasm from beginning to end.

43,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23841736-sarah,5,This book was recommended to me by one of my jiujitsu instructors. I resisted because I'm not a fan of the self-help genre but I ended up really loving it. It's also helping me to understand a frustrating situation at work.This was excellent and very helpful.
44,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1128267-jason,0,"My dad had been talking about this book, so when we went to visit him and I saw it on his desk I started reading it. It made sense right away and was easy to get into. Your mindset (either a growth mindset or a fixed mindset) determines how you relate to your abilities and experiences in school, business, relationships, and sports (those are the areas she covers). I could see myself in both of the mindsets she described, and I think they're a useful tool for making sense of places where I struggle. They offer a way to organize a response. I have a sense of the freedom in the growth mindset: nothing sticks to you because you don't identify with the results; you're here to learn and grow, so fear and anger and results don't have such a grip on you. I picture someone loose in a stream of events, like a slippery fish. But it's a learning stream. It's funny, though. I feel like I need a break from these kinds of books: idea books to help you make something work, to get better at something. Maybe the Joker's monologues in The Dark Knight had an effect on me. (I saw it by myself late at night, which is the best time to come out of a movie.) I kind of liked them. I thought they were the best of their kind. Something like, ""They're all schemers . . ."" and he wants to disrupt it, subvert it, hold it up for its ridiculousness. This isn't exactly a schemer book, but it's definitely an aiming at success book (""success"" is in the sub-title). Ways to succeed rely on a simplification of what's going on. It's the only way to create a model to use to work with life, but I get tired of it eventually. I've read a lot of good ones this summer, though. I guess I'm ready to put my new tools to use. I don't need anymore new tools right now, thank you. I feel like I'm ready for Handke again. And maybe Philip Dick. I want to read Ubik. "
45,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13852634-alan-bevan,2,"I struggled to rate this book. It offers a single gem of a concept - perhaps not particularly original but nevertheless really important. And that gem is that how we think about ourselves can make all the difference. Do we see ourselves to have a fixed capacity or do we have a growth mindset? It reminded me of my Dad who consistently frustrated me by never trying anything new on the grounds that he was not the sort of person who did X. He genuinely seemed to believe he was not free to choose. He didn't see life as an opportunity to learn. This book offers a language to describe the alternative that he never saw, the 'growth mindset'.But that was it really for the book. That single concept is padded with countless (and to me tedious) anecdotes but it offered nothing more other than superficially considering the role of parents and teachers in relation to the development of mindsets.So yes, it contains a really important concept and I would have liked my father to read it but I reckon it would have more impact if condensed to a pithy 1000 word essay. But then there wouldn't be book to sell which would obviously be contrary to Dweck's mindset.And lastly, I am stunned that the publishers can get away with the sub heading, 'The new Psychology of Success'. New? Really?"
46,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5977628-kat,2,"I found this book a little frustrating. It's overall message is good, it explores the differences between having a fixed and growth mindset. A fixed mindset believes your intelligence, skills, talent, and life are all basically set in stone and can't be improved. A growth mindset believes that you can always become smarter or more skilled with effort, and views criticism as motivation to improve instead of a crushing blow. It's definitely an important lesson that everyone should learn. My frustration is mostly in how the lesson is delivered, and that is mostly though stories about grade school student, athletes, and CEOs. There is a lot of hand wringing about the folly of complementing your kids. The author tells a story of how she accidentally told her husband he was brilliant and gasped in horror at her mistake. There is praise of sleazy CEOs who've ""made it"" (while screwing their employees and the environment) and Harvey Weinstein of all people (though this was published in 2009). It just feels a little silly and like every other self help book that leans on stories about football players and men who realized their business might do better if their weren't such giant a**holes. There are better self improvement books out there."
47,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14858185-steven,2,"Disappointing and repetitive pop-psychology book based on 1 idea that seems dubious from anecdotal experience. The author talks about the ""fixed mindset"" those who believe that traits like intelligence, personality, sports ability etc. are largely determined genetically and those who believe in the ""growth mindset"" that all traits can be fundamentally changed with enough effort, with the growth mindset being the path to success.This is a false dichotomy. It's not an either/or (growth vs fixed mindset) but a continuum. We are part genetically determined, part environmentally determined. The assertion that only those with the growth mindset achieve their potential seems false and I'd like to see Dweck's data. Those who believe they're innately gifted in a specific trait, usually work and practice long and hard to perfect their skills in their particular talents, while ignoring the areas they are weak in. Dweck's handful of examples of people succeeding in an area they were initially believed to have little talent in hardly proves her thesis that one can do anything if one has the right mindset. "
48,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16612969-andrea,5,"In the book Mindset, by Carol Dweck, the author explains the fixed mindset and offers tips to help you move toward a more growth oriented mindset. A person with a fixed mindset believes that their intelligence, skills, and abilities are static and there is nothing they can do change that. Someone with a growth mindset believes that learning is a lifelong process. In the book, Dr Dweck used athlete John McEnroe as an example of someone with a fixed mindset. McEnroe believed that he was the best tennis player and if he lost a match, it was always due to some outside force that was beyond his control. He even rooted for his friends and family to lose their matches, so he could be the best in his circle. He never practiced, because he believed that someone with natural talent shouldn't require practice. On the opposite side of the spectrum, you have Michael Jordan. He was arguably one the greatest basketball players of all time, but he was cut from his high school team. With a lot of effort, time, and practice, he went on to the NBA. If you embrace a growth mindset, skills can be developed over time."
49,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34391111-solomon-mark,5,"Mindset is Excellent book. Carol Dweck explains about two types of Mindsets fixed and growth mindset. According to the author every person is having either Fixed or Growth mindset. Fixed mindset individuals perceives that Intelligent is unchangeable and static. Growth mindset individuals perceives that Intelligent can be changed and improved. Fixed mindset people avoid challenges, give-up when they encounters obstacles, they won’t take effort to make things better, they will avoid useful negative feedback from others and they won’t learn from their mistakes.Growth mindset people will be having desire to learn, never avoid challenges, learn from mistakes, they will take every effort to make things better, they will take valuable information from criticism and negative feedback.We have to learn from our mistakes and change ourself to improving our Intelligent and potential. In this book author gives many interesting examples on both fixed and growth mindsets. Every parent and individual should read this book. "

It not only talk about the definition on mindset, but also gives many applications on business, relationship, leadership, parenting, teaching, and coaching. I guess you will as surprised as me because we feel like we have walked to right pathway: to be proud of your almamater, to determine our skills instead of promoting ourselves to new things you have could learn from.I can't get over it. In the middle of reading, I listened to her podcasts, watched her TEDx Talks & interviews. Reading this book reminds me to others aligned book such as Sir Ken Robinson's Creative School, Tom Kelley's Creative Confidence, Susan Cain's Quite, and surprisingly Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In. It also makes me want to read Steven Levitt's Freakonomics and Arianna Huffington's Thrive. The conclusion is you have to start reading this book."
51,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/990216-elizabeth,3,"This has some interesting points about having a fixed mindset and a more flexible mindset, but there isn't enough depth to the anecdotes. I do recommend reading the chapter for teachers and parents as there are useful tips about motivating kids to learn and to change their own mindset.

52,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32415499-elizabeth-keatley,4,"This has been such an eye opening read. It will change not only how I conduct my daily personal life, but also how I praise and challenge my students."
53,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,4,"This book changed my perspective on abilities and potential. Dweck shows how to move from the fixed mindset (the belief that human qualities and abilities are set and essentially unalterable) to the growth mindset (the belief that those qualities and abilities can be cultivated through effort). Dweck, a psychologist, based the book on solid scientific research, not the pseudoscientific mystical nonsense often found in ""success psychology"" books. Dweck applies the mindsets to sports, business leadership, relationships, parenting, and teaching. The book has far too many anecdotes for my taste; it’s full of specific examples of famous CEOs and athletes, as well as ordinary people.My favorite parts were those that advised how to talk to children about their successes and failures. Intellectually, I agree with Dweck’s advice that you should praise effort, not ability, and that when a child does something quickly, you should challenge rather than praise them, but that can be emotionally difficult for a parent to do. I also found the section on bullying interesting, because I was bullied for most of my school years. I skimmed the many examples from sports, because I’m generally disinterested in sports.I read this because it was referred to in several books, articles, and podcasts about business and/or web design.The MindsetsFixed Mindset• Your qualities and intelligence are very basic to you and can’t change very much. If you have the ability, you’ll do well. If you don’t, you won’t.• Characteristics: passing up chances to learn, feeling labeled by a failure, getting discouraged when something requires effort.• Framework: judge and be judged; ""You have permanent traits and I'm judging them.""Growth Mindset• No matter your qualities and intelligence, you can always change substantially. Abilities can be cultivated and improved.• Characteristics: taking challenges, learning from failure, continuing effort.• Framework: learn and help learn; ""You are a developing person and I am interested in your development.""The Truth About Ability and Accomplishment• In the growth mindset, abilities can be cultivated, but that doesn’t mean that everything can or should be changed.• Benjamin Bloom, after 40 years of research on school learning, said, “What any person in the world can learn, almost all persons can learn, if provided with the appropriate prior and current conditions of learning.”• “Just because some people can do something with little or no training, it doesn’t mean that others can’t do it (and sometimes do it even better) with training.”• People (especially children) do better when praised for effort than ability.Relationships: Mindsets in Love (Or Not)• The fixed mindset believes that successful relationships don’t require effort. The growth mindset believes that they do.Bullying• To reduce bullying, change the school mindset.• Fight the atmosphere of judgement and create one of collaboration and self-improvement.• Empower bystanders to help victims.• Enforce discipline, but don’t judge the bully as a person. Make them feel liked and welcomed at school.• Praise the bully’s steps in the right direction (staying out of fighting, getting along with others). Praise efforts, not the person.• Teachers can point a bully away from judgment and towards compassion by not implying they’re a bad person, showing respect, and asking for the bully’s advice for helping bullied students.Parents, Teachers, and Coaches: Where Do Mindsets Come From?• Give children the growth-mindset message, “You are a developing person and I am interested in your development,” not the fixed-mindset message, “You have permanent traits and I’m judging them.”• Praising children’s intelligence harms motivation and performance. It gives a temporary boost, but if they run into difficulty, they’ll think failure means they’re dumb. Instead, praise for the growth-oriented process: what they accomplish through practice, study, persistence, strategy.• Don’t talk about others in terms of fixed judgments in front of children, or they’ll think you use the same fixed judgments on them.• When children do something quickly and perfectly, don’t praise their speed and perfection. Instead, say it was too easy and give them a challenge.• When a child fails, tell them you understand their disappointment, but they’ll need to work harder.• Use misbehavior as an occasion for teaching, not judgment.• When teachers judge, students will sabotage the teacher by not trying. When teachers care for students and show them school is a way to grow their minds, they try.Changing Mindsets: A WorkshopAs a family, talk about your efforts, strategies, setbacks, and learning every day."
54,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35853271-sonja,3,3.5 out of 5 stars.:: buddy read with my eldest brother[short review to come]
55,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4177031-troy-blackford,4,"Original '3-star' Review (3/11/14) [see update below]:This was a book of good ideas that felt rather stretched out. This is probably because it is based on the author's original newspaper article, which became unexpectedly successful. There is a definite vibe of 'let's cash in on this article's success by stretching it out into a book-length work' that plagues the first third of Mindset. But, if you can stick out the abysmal first part, which seeks to assure readers the ideas contained in the book are helpful with a brutal series of 'A woman in Topeka e-mailed me that she tried the ideas in this book, and SHE LOVED IT!' type statements (along with the inverse: 'A man in Fort Wayne failed to use these ideas, and HE'S MISERABLE!'), the book which follows does indeed have some great points. This is well worth thinking about.I chalk it up to the state of the modern publishing industry that Carol Dweck was unable to print a book a third or maybe half the length of this, as 'that's not what customers want to buy,' because I'm sure I would have preferred a leaner, meaner, more toned version of this book. But if you can sit out the filler, this book is full of great points that employees/employers, teachers, parents, and people learning any skill will do well to ponder.UPDATE (10/5/15): This is over a year after I've read this book, and I've seen Dr. Dweck's research mentioned countless times since. I didn't greatly appreciate, at the time of my prior review, that Dr. Dweck is a researcher, and wrote this book sharing her findings for popular consumption. I can certainly see how pressure to stretch her findings into a book-length work led to the deficiencies I noted earlier, but I very much appreciate the value of the work she did and feel my earlier rating of 'three stars' is simply not fair. Now that I have a better understanding of what this work is meant to be and who Dr. Carol Dweck is, I am adding a star."
56,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2202561-becky,4,"The premise of this book sounds pretty ""duh."" I ran across its title in several different contexts before I decided that if such dissimilar people swear by it, it can't be as obvious as it sounds. And its implications are wide-ranging and interesting. It made me see the world in a new way. It's entertaining and an easy read, and would be especially valuable to teachers, parents, and coaches, but really applies to pretty much everybody. Instead of subtitling it ""The New Psychology of Success"" (eyeroll, please) it could have been called ""What Great Teachers Know."" I didn't read quite all the way to the end, but something I felt was missing from this book is that few people have an overall ""fixed mindset"" or an overall ""growth mindset."" As I think about people I know, most have different mindsets for each realm of their life. Some people have an academic or career growth mindset but a fixed relationship or athletics mindset, for example. Since most people have a growth mindset in at least one area, learning to expand those attitudes into other areas seems like a useful path toward developing an advantageous mindset where it's lacking. And in fact, I think that's often what happens. A kid does badly in school and his parents put him in martial arts classes; not only does he love it, but he starts getting better grades and getting along with his friends better too. As he learns how to achieve in one area of his life, he begins to apply those same achievement skills to other areas as well. Like any other summary of this book, this sounds tediously obvious, but the implications are deeper than a summary can convey. "
57,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6317928-asra-syed,3,"I do agree with Carol Dweck's idea of mindsets as fixed or growth and how these mindsets can be limiting or beneficial. I've struggled with explaining to students how ""smart"" isn't something you are, and that instead you can work toward getting smarter and more capable, so Dweck's concepts will help with that. But I probably could have read an article about this or watched a video instead of reading this entire book. It gets incredibly redundant and she seems to take the ideas a little too far, attributing the mindsets to all sorts of famous accomplished people, which gets to be a stretch. Plus, she really seems to oversimplify or misunderstand the concept of depression (not that I can claim to really understand the mental illness myself, but I do know that it's a medical/chemical/emotional condition that can't just be fixed by changing one's mindset). I kept reading hoping that the book would provide concrete ways to work on changing mindsets instead of just redundancy proving that her ideas of these two mindsets it correct, but I guess you have to go pay for her Brainology material for that. Of course you do. "
58,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9522471-brian,1,"Very simplistic. Binary oppositions always are. Her use of athletes is very problematic. Was it Jordan's growth mindset or his fierce desire to win at all costs that has kind-of made him a pretty miserable human being that made him succeed? Looking back, she should be embarrassed about claiming Roger Clemens' mindset was what it took for him to succeed. At least she didn't include Lance Armstrong. And her take on the corporate world is strange. The way CEOs were rewarded during the time period she writes about had to do with increasing share holder value immediately. Mindset has nothing to do with it. In hindsight, her praise of Circuit City and GE's Jack Welch doesn't look so good today. This totally buys into the myth of ""you can be whatever you want to be if you try hard enough.""  "
59,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26683448-mohammed-h,5,"One of the most important books I have read. I watched my entire life and how I reacted to school, sports, arts, relationships and finally my business. I was shocked to know that I had a fixed mind set in my relationships, school and had a growth mind set to sports. Now I constantly ask myself and probe my brain for reactions. This book will change you and change people around you. Its infectious. Its important for your life, work and kids. I could not recommend a more important book to read."
60,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,1,"It's one thing to tell people their brains are like muscles. But the author pumps up that analogy until it explodes. Michael Jordan had to practice really really hard before he became a great basketball player. OK. But if he were 5 feet tall, it would not matter how hard he practiced; he would never have been an NBA MVP superstar. Yet the author writes ""Can anyone do anything? I don't really know."" Seriously!? That is literally farcical.http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-liv...This book has glowing reviews from reputable sources and positions the author as ""one of the world's leading researchers"" in psychology. So I'm holding it to a high standard. The author mentions Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and claims that ""Mindsets go further."" CBT is supported by numerous clinical trials. Where is there similarly rigorous evidence for a benefit from Mindsets? I could not find it in the book. I think there are better books covering the same area.

62,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78108898-exitgirl05,4,"Even if you think you know everything there is to know regarding mind, learning and developing, read this book. It's not the theory itself. Dr Carol Dweck offers examples of everyday situations in which every human finds himself. How we cope with professional challenges, parenting, relationships... It will make you think and it will surely give you a whole new perspective on learning process. It will help you become not smarter, but hungrier for knowledge. "
63,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"The big idea of the book is that we can divide people into 2 groups: 1st group has a fixed mindset believing that the qualities they posses are carved in stone. Characteristics such as intelligence, personality, and creativity are fixed traits, rather than something that can be developed. 2nd group has a growth mindset coming from a belief that our basic qualities are things we can cultivate through effort. Group 2 understands that people differ greatly – in aptitude, talents, interests, temperaments etc... but everyone can change and grow through application and experience. The book also goes deep into implications of each belief and points out some basic mistakes that teachers, managers and parents make in their every day life which forces those they influence into a fixed mindset. I love reading about success and this book instantly turned into one of my favorites on the topic, the mindset concept is absolutely critical to understand and I would highly recommend you to read this book!"
64,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5079848-amina,2,"2.5☆First, the concept was good, the first chapters were great but then the I found the book to be very repetitive, it could have been written in about 150 pages, and a little bit judgmental, sometimes even a bit hard on the people with the fixed mindset."
65,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9846570-leah,5,"Marking as one of my favourite self help/personal development books!!!I got so much from this book and it's permanently impacted my life. It was slightly repetitive but it was just really zoning in on the points.This is definitely a re-read so that I can take notes and study it more.Just off the top of my head here are some of my take aways:- Be growth-minded not fixed-minded. Fixed minded is when you believe people were born with innate talents and skills and they can't develop/learn/grow. While the growth mind set is about becoming anything or anyone you want and learning and growing into the person you want to be.- Every human is born into a set of genetic code from their parents and has experiences which can or need not define them. You can change how you act and the decisions you make if you want to, it will just take some effort and work- Lots of great information on how to raise your children in this book. How certain praises actuakly do harm instead of your intended good praise. Like saying ""Oh wow Billy you got 100% on your test? That means you made no mistakes that's great! You're so smart."" This instill fear into Billy's mind that he should try his best not to make mistakes in the future or else he will not be ""smart."" And children feed off of the praise their parents give them so this is so crucial. It's better to talk about their effort instead of judging them. Instead say "" Oh wow Billy you got 100% on your test? You must have worked really hard and studied, I'm so proud of your efforts.""- Shyness was also an interesting aspect of this book because if you are a shy person that basically means that you are more so fixed-minded because you find judgement of other people important to you. If you were growth minded then you would focus n working on your shyness and uncomfortableness to improve yourself instead of just defining yourself as shy and that's the end of it.- When you are raised by judgemental family it can influence you to become fixed-minded.Carol S. Dweck is a smart cookie, I look forward to her future publications ;)""the courage to be open—to welcome change and new ideas regardless of their source. Real self-confidence is not reflected in a title, an expensive suit, a fancy car, or a series of acquisitions. It is reflected in your mindset: your readiness to grow."""""
66,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10400867,2,"The idea of having a growth mindset isn’t revolutionary, however, just like any good self-help book, it focuses on a specific trait, repositions its importance, and expands its application.The idea of “growth mindset” is insightful and impactful. Once integrated within the mindset of an individual, relationship or organization, the applications become limitless. The main idea of the book:""Every one of us should believe that our basic qualities are things we can cultivate through effort. Yes, people differ greatly but everyone can change and grow through application and experience""As a result, we should change the way we look at any past set back, current challenge, or future perceived distasteful experience. We should think about and approach them as learning opportunities. Thinking of them in such away: a) increases our willingness to be exposed to challenging situations, and b) increases the learning, and thus, our development as individuals. All this will result, in continuous incremental learnings as time passes by.The idea isn’t just about changing the way you think, but it’s about making this way of thinking a habit. This habit, will “convert” any belief about oneself limits to a narrative about “learning opportunities”The author then spends a good 70% of the book showing how this is applied in different situations (teachers, spouses, workplace, and sports).The verdict:•	The book delivers a short, simple, self-evident yet important truth that can be delivered in an article or 4 pages max. The additional 270 pages was pure waste. Too repetitive. •	The author is ‘too’ in love with her theory, she tries to attribute all human achievements to it. She oversells it in my opinion.•	The examples she gives are too polarized, too ideal. She portrays people with fixed mindset in a stereotypical shallow way showing them as morons. I really did not like that about the book"
67,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239658-karen-chung,4,"This book has one relatively simple message that is repeated over and over again in many different forms throughout the narrative: that we need to approach everything in life not with a fixed mindset - i.e. that people are either born artists, athletes, good students, or whatever, or they are not - but with a ""growth"" mindset, i.e. that we are highly malleable, and achieve through effort, not just by happening to be talented. Due to its repetitiveness, which sets in very early in the book, I originally planned to give it only three stars. But the message is an extremely important one, and the illustrative anecdotes are interesting and worth reading, thus the fourth star. "
68,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8460201-karen,3,"The idea of a ""growth mindset"" is a simple one, but quite profound for many people who have grown up believing that talents and abilities are ""fixed"". A growth mindset is possessed by those who believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.Not sure where you sit? You can take a questionnaire here: https://mindsetonline.com/testyourmin...Because it is such a simple concept, I found the book a bit repetitive and I think it could have benefited from more around how to develop and change your fixed mindset, rather than continually trying to prove why having a growth mindset is better.I recommend this book to anyone interested in self development, who is a teacher/trainer, or has children!"
69,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38829282-nicholas-shaw,1,"How in the name of hell is this book rated so highly!? The central message is clearly that you should adopt the growth mindset if you wish to grow and improve at basically anything in life. If you have the fixed mindset you seem to believe you're stuck with what you've got, much frustration and general failure ensues.I can't imagine anyone arguing against hard work and effort to get anywhere in life but how is this book several hundred pages? Save yourself the effort and watch the TED talk at most if this summary isn't enough for you."
70,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11410080-rebecca,4,"Any book that helps you develop a new way to process failure, and a new way to learn and grow, is a book worth reading. I've already been telling everyone about the growth mindset, and I only just finished reading this. I wish everyone knew how to access and nourish their growth mindset, and I'm glad to start the journey towards my potential. Get outta here fixed mindset! This is the first ""self-help"" book I've ever read, and now I'm sad I didn't read it sooner. I highly recommend this."
71,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8164155-diana,5,I really enjoyed reading this awesome book. I delayed my reading a lot and wish that I could have read the book with the same enthusiasm from beginning to end. It was a little too much information for me but it was worth reading the whole book. I loved it! Will definitely go back to it in a few months to learn more from it. ;)

73,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23841736-sarah,5,This book was recommended to me by one of my jiujitsu instructors. I resisted because I'm not a fan of the self-help genre but I ended up really loving it. It's also helping me to understand a frustrating situation at work.This was excellent and very helpful.
74,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1128267-jason,0,"My dad had been talking about this book, so when we went to visit him and I saw it on his desk I started reading it. It made sense right away and was easy to get into. Your mindset (either a growth mindset or a fixed mindset) determines how you relate to your abilities and experiences in school, business, relationships, and sports (those are the areas she covers). I could see myself in both of the mindsets she described, and I think they're a useful tool for making sense of places where I struggle. They offer a way to organize a response. I have a sense of the freedom in the growth mindset: nothing sticks to you because you don't identify with the results; you're here to learn and grow, so fear and anger and results don't have such a grip on you. I picture someone loose in a stream of events, like a slippery fish. But it's a learning stream. It's funny, though. I feel like I need a break from these kinds of books: idea books to help you make something work, to get better at something. Maybe the Joker's monologues in The Dark Knight had an effect on me. (I saw it by myself late at night, which is the best time to come out of a movie.) I kind of liked them. I thought they were the best of their kind. Something like, ""They're all schemers . . ."" and he wants to disrupt it, subvert it, hold it up for its ridiculousness. This isn't exactly a schemer book, but it's definitely an aiming at success book (""success"" is in the sub-title). Ways to succeed rely on a simplification of what's going on. It's the only way to create a model to use to work with life, but I get tired of it eventually. I've read a lot of good ones this summer, though. I guess I'm ready to put my new tools to use. I don't need anymore new tools right now, thank you. I feel like I'm ready for Handke again. And maybe Philip Dick. I want to read Ubik. "
75,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13852634-alan-bevan,2,"I struggled to rate this book. It offers a single gem of a concept - perhaps not particularly original but nevertheless really important. And that gem is that how we think about ourselves can make all the difference. Do we see ourselves to have a fixed capacity or do we have a growth mindset? It reminded me of my Dad who consistently frustrated me by never trying anything new on the grounds that he was not the sort of person who did X. He genuinely seemed to believe he was not free to choose. He didn't see life as an opportunity to learn. This book offers a language to describe the alternative that he never saw, the 'growth mindset'.But that was it really for the book. That single concept is padded with countless (and to me tedious) anecdotes but it offered nothing more other than superficially considering the role of parents and teachers in relation to the development of mindsets.So yes, it contains a really important concept and I would have liked my father to read it but I reckon it would have more impact if condensed to a pithy 1000 word essay. But then there wouldn't be book to sell which would obviously be contrary to Dweck's mindset.And lastly, I am stunned that the publishers can get away with the sub heading, 'The new Psychology of Success'. New? Really?"
76,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5977628-kat,2,"I found this book a little frustrating. It's overall message is good, it explores the differences between having a fixed and growth mindset. A fixed mindset believes your intelligence, skills, talent, and life are all basically set in stone and can't be improved. A growth mindset believes that you can always become smarter or more skilled with effort, and views criticism as motivation to improve instead of a crushing blow. It's definitely an important lesson that everyone should learn. My frustration is mostly in how the lesson is delivered, and that is mostly though stories about grade school student, athletes, and CEOs. There is a lot of hand wringing about the folly of complementing your kids. The author tells a story of how she accidentally told her husband he was brilliant and gasped in horror at her mistake. There is praise of sleazy CEOs who've ""made it"" (while screwing their employees and the environment) and Harvey Weinstein of all people (though this was published in 2009). It just feels a little silly and like every other self help book that leans on stories about football players and men who realized their business might do better if their weren't such giant a**holes. There are better self improvement books out there."
77,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14858185-steven,2,"Disappointing and repetitive pop-psychology book based on 1 idea that seems dubious from anecdotal experience. The author talks about the ""fixed mindset"" those who believe that traits like intelligence, personality, sports ability etc. are largely determined genetically and those who believe in the ""growth mindset"" that all traits can be fundamentally changed with enough effort, with the growth mindset being the path to success.This is a false dichotomy. It's not an either/or (growth vs fixed mindset) but a continuum. We are part genetically determined, part environmentally determined. The assertion that only those with the growth mindset achieve their potential seems false and I'd like to see Dweck's data. Those who believe they're innately gifted in a specific trait, usually work and practice long and hard to perfect their skills in their particular talents, while ignoring the areas they are weak in. Dweck's handful of examples of people succeeding in an area they were initially believed to have little talent in hardly proves her thesis that one can do anything if one has the right mindset. "
78,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16612969-andrea,5,"In the book Mindset, by Carol Dweck, the author explains the fixed mindset and offers tips to help you move toward a more growth oriented mindset. A person with a fixed mindset believes that their intelligence, skills, and abilities are static and there is nothing they can do change that. Someone with a growth mindset believes that learning is a lifelong process. In the book, Dr Dweck used athlete John McEnroe as an example of someone with a fixed mindset. McEnroe believed that he was the best tennis player and if he lost a match, it was always due to some outside force that was beyond his control. He even rooted for his friends and family to lose their matches, so he could be the best in his circle. He never practiced, because he believed that someone with natural talent shouldn't require practice. On the opposite side of the spectrum, you have Michael Jordan. He was arguably one the greatest basketball players of all time, but he was cut from his high school team. With a lot of effort, time, and practice, he went on to the NBA. If you embrace a growth mindset, skills can be developed over time."
79,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34391111-solomon-mark,5,"Mindset is Excellent book. Carol Dweck explains about two types of Mindsets fixed and growth mindset. According to the author every person is having either Fixed or Growth mindset. Fixed mindset individuals perceives that Intelligent is unchangeable and static. Growth mindset individuals perceives that Intelligent can be changed and improved. Fixed mindset people avoid challenges, give-up when they encounters obstacles, they won’t take effort to make things better, they will avoid useful negative feedback from others and they won’t learn from their mistakes.Growth mindset people will be having desire to learn, never avoid challenges, learn from mistakes, they will take every effort to make things better, they will take valuable information from criticism and negative feedback.We have to learn from our mistakes and change ourself to improving our Intelligent and potential. In this book author gives many interesting examples on both fixed and growth mindsets. Every parent and individual should read this book. "
80,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15605093-hestia-istiviani,5,"THIS BOOK IS TOO AWESOME!I learn so many things about how powerful our mindset is. It not only talk about the definition on mindset, but also gives many applications on business, relationship, leadership, parenting, teaching, and coaching. I guess you will as surprised as me because we feel like we have walked to right pathway: to be proud of your almamater, to determine our skills instead of promoting ourselves to new things you have could learn from.I can't get over it. In the middle of reading, I listened to her podcasts, watched her TEDx Talks & interviews. Reading this book reminds me to others aligned book such as Sir Ken Robinson's Creative School, Tom Kelley's Creative Confidence, Susan Cain's Quite, and surprisingly Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In. It also makes me want to read Steven Levitt's Freakonomics and Arianna Huffington's Thrive. The conclusion is you have to start reading this book."
81,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/990216-elizabeth,3,"This has some interesting points about having a fixed mindset and a more flexible mindset, but there isn't enough depth to the anecdotes. I do recommend reading the chapter for teachers and parents as there are useful tips about motivating kids to learn and to change their own mindset. All in all, I would refer to the chart in the back as a shortcut for the information. "
82,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32415499-elizabeth-keatley,4,"This has been such an eye opening read. It will change not only how I conduct my daily personal life, but also how I praise and challenge my students."
83,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,4,"This book changed my perspective on abilities and potential. Dweck shows how to move from the fixed mindset (the belief that human qualities and abilities are set and essentially unalterable) to the growth mindset (the belief that those qualities and abilities can be cultivated through effort). Dweck, a psychologist, based the book on solid scientific research, not the pseudoscientific mystical nonsense often found in ""success psychology"" books. Dweck applies the mindsets to sports, business leadership, relationships, parenting, and teaching. The book has far too many anecdotes for my taste; it’s full of specific examples of famous CEOs and athletes, as well as ordinary people.My favorite parts were those that advised how to talk to children about their successes and failures. Intellectually, I agree with Dweck’s advice that you should praise effort, not ability, and that when a child does something quickly, you should challenge rather than praise them, but that can be emotionally difficult for a parent to do. I also found the section on bullying interesting, because I was bullied for most of my school years. I skimmed the many examples from sports, because I’m generally disinterested in sports.I read this because it was referred to in several books, articles, and podcasts about business and/or web design.The MindsetsFixed Mindset• Your qualities and intelligence are very basic to you and can’t change very much. If you have the ability, you’ll do well. If you don’t, you won’t.• Characteristics: passing up chances to learn, feeling labeled by a failure, getting discouraged when something requires effort.• Framework: judge and be judged; ""You have permanent traits and I'm judging them.""Growth Mindset• No matter your qualities and intelligence, you can always change substantially. Abilities can be cultivated and improved.• Characteristics: taking challenges, learning from failure, continuing effort.• Framework: learn and help learn; ""You are a developing person and I am interested in your development.""The Truth About Ability and Accomplishment• In the growth mindset, abilities can be cultivated, but that doesn’t mean that everything can or should be changed.• Benjamin Bloom, after 40 years of research on school learning, said, “What any person in the world can learn, almost all persons can learn, if provided with the appropriate prior and current conditions of learning.”• “Just because some people can do something with little or no training, it doesn’t mean that others can’t do it (and sometimes do it even better) with training.”• People (especially children) do better when praised for effort than ability.Relationships: Mindsets in Love (Or Not)• The fixed mindset believes that successful relationships don’t require effort. The growth mindset believes that they do.Bullying• To reduce bullying, change the school mindset.• Fight the atmosphere of judgement and create one of collaboration and self-improvement.• Empower bystanders to help victims.• Enforce discipline, but don’t judge the bully as a person. Make them feel liked and welcomed at school.• Praise the bully’s steps in the right direction (staying out of fighting, getting along with others). Praise efforts, not the person.• Teachers can point a bully away from judgment and towards compassion by not implying they’re a bad person, showing respect, and asking for the bully’s advice for helping bullied students.Parents, Teachers, and Coaches: Where Do Mindsets Come From?• Give children the growth-mindset message, “You are a developing person and I am interested in your development,” not the fixed-mindset message, “You have permanent traits and I’m judging them.”• Praising children’s intelligence harms motivation and performance. It gives a temporary boost, but if they run into difficulty, they’ll think failure means they’re dumb. Instead, praise for the growth-oriented process: what they accomplish through practice, study, persistence, strategy.• Don’t talk about others in terms of fixed judgments in front of children, or they’ll think you use the same fixed judgments on them.• When children do something quickly and perfectly, don’t praise their speed and perfection. Instead, say it was too easy and give them a challenge.• When a child fails, tell them you understand their disappointment, but they’ll need to work harder.• Use misbehavior as an occasion for teaching, not judgment.• When teachers judge, students will sabotage the teacher by not trying. When teachers care for students and show them school is a way to grow their minds, they try.Changing Mindsets: A WorkshopAs a family, talk about your efforts, strategies, setbacks, and learning every day."
84,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35853271-sonja,3,3.5 out of 5 stars.:: buddy read with my eldest brother[short review to come]
85,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4177031-troy-blackford,4,"Original '3-star' Review (3/11/14) [see update below]:This was a book of good ideas that felt rather stretched out. This is probably because it is based on the author's original newspaper article, which became unexpectedly successful. There is a definite vibe of 'let's cash in on this article's success by stretching it out into a book-length work' that plagues the first third of Mindset. But, if you can stick out the abysmal first part, which seeks to assure readers the ideas contained in the book are helpful with a brutal series of 'A woman in Topeka e-mailed me that she tried the ideas in this book, and SHE LOVED IT!' type statements (along with the inverse: 'A man in Fort Wayne failed to use these ideas, and HE'S MISERABLE!'), the book which follows does indeed have some great points. This is well worth thinking about.I chalk it up to the state of the modern publishing industry that Carol Dweck was unable to print a book a third or maybe half the length of this, as 'that's not what customers want to buy,' because I'm sure I would have preferred a leaner, meaner, more toned version of this book. But if you can sit out the filler, this book is full of great points that employees/employers, teachers, parents, and people learning any skill will do well to ponder.UPDATE (10/5/15): This is over a year after I've read this book, and I've seen Dr. Dweck's research mentioned countless times since. I didn't greatly appreciate, at the time of my prior review, that Dr. Dweck is a researcher, and wrote this book sharing her findings for popular consumption. I can certainly see how pressure to stretch her findings into a book-length work led to the deficiencies I noted earlier, but I very much appreciate the value of the work she did and feel my earlier rating of 'three stars' is simply not fair. Now that I have a better understanding of what this work is meant to be and who Dr. Carol Dweck is, I am adding a star."
86,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2202561-becky,4,"The premise of this book sounds pretty ""duh."" I ran across its title in several different contexts before I decided that if such dissimilar people swear by it, it can't be as obvious as it sounds. And its implications are wide-ranging and interesting. It made me see the world in a new way. It's entertaining and an easy read, and would be especially valuable to teachers, parents, and coaches, but really applies to pretty much everybody. Instead of subtitling it ""The New Psychology of Success"" (eyeroll, please) it could have been called ""What Great Teachers Know."" I didn't read quite all the way to the end, but something I felt was missing from this book is that few people have an overall ""fixed mindset"" or an overall ""growth mindset."" As I think about people I know, most have different mindsets for each realm of their life. Some people have an academic or career growth mindset but a fixed relationship or athletics mindset, for example. Since most people have a growth mindset in at least one area, learning to expand those attitudes into other areas seems like a useful path toward developing an advantageous mindset where it's lacking. And in fact, I think that's often what happens. A kid does badly in school and his parents put him in martial arts classes; not only does he love it, but he starts getting better grades and getting along with his friends better too. As he learns how to achieve in one area of his life, he begins to apply those same achievement skills to other areas as well. Like any other summary of this book, this sounds tediously obvious, but the implications are deeper than a summary can convey. "
87,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6317928-asra-syed,3,"I do agree with Carol Dweck's idea of mindsets as fixed or growth and how these mindsets can be limiting or beneficial. I've struggled with explaining to students how ""smart"" isn't something you are, and that instead you can work toward getting smarter and more capable, so Dweck's concepts will help with that. But I probably could have read an article about this or watched a video instead of reading this entire book. It gets incredibly redundant and she seems to take the ideas a little too far, attributing the mindsets to all sorts of famous accomplished people, which gets to be a stretch. Plus, she really seems to oversimplify or misunderstand the concept of depression (not that I can claim to really understand the mental illness myself, but I do know that it's a medical/chemical/emotional condition that can't just be fixed by changing one's mindset). I kept reading hoping that the book would provide concrete ways to work on changing mindsets instead of just redundancy proving that her ideas of these two mindsets it correct, but I guess you have to go pay for her Brainology material for that. Of course you do. "
88,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9522471-brian,1,"Very simplistic. Binary oppositions always are. Her use of athletes is very problematic. Was it Jordan's growth mindset or his fierce desire to win at all costs that has kind-of made him a pretty miserable human being that made him succeed? Looking back, she should be embarrassed about claiming Roger Clemens' mindset was what it took for him to succeed. At least she didn't include Lance Armstrong. And her take on the corporate world is strange. The way CEOs were rewarded during the time period she writes about had to do with increasing share holder value immediately. Mindset has nothing to do with it. In hindsight, her praise of Circuit City and GE's Jack Welch doesn't look so good today. This totally buys into the myth of ""you can be whatever you want to be if you try hard enough.""  "
89,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26683448-mohammed-h,5,"One of the most important books I have read. I watched my entire life and how I reacted to school, sports, arts, relationships and finally my business. I was shocked to know that I had a fixed mind set in my relationships, school and had a growth mind set to sports. Now I constantly ask myself and probe my brain for reactions. This book will change you and change people around you. Its infectious. Its important for your life, work and kids. I could not recommend a more important book to read."
90,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,1,"It's one thing to tell people their brains are like muscles. But the author pumps up that analogy until it explodes. Michael Jordan had to practice really really hard before he became a great basketball player. OK. But if he were 5 feet tall, it would not matter how hard he practiced; he would never have been an NBA MVP superstar. Yet the author writes ""Can anyone do anything? I don't really know."" Seriously!? That is literally farcical.http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-liv...This book has glowing reviews from reputable sources and positions the author as ""one of the world's leading researchers"" in psychology. So I'm holding it to a high standard. The author mentions Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and claims that ""Mindsets go further."" CBT is supported by numerous clinical trials. Where is there similarly rigorous evidence for a benefit from Mindsets? I could not find it in the book. I think there are better books covering the same area.

92,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78108898-exitgirl05,4,"Even if you think you know everything there is to know regarding mind, learning and developing, read this book. It's not the theory itself. Dr Carol Dweck offers examples of everyday situations in which every human finds himself. How we cope with professional challenges, parenting, relationships... It will make you think and it will surely give you a whole new perspective on learning process. It will help you become not smarter, but hungrier for knowledge. "
93,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"The big idea of the book is that we can divide people into 2 groups: 1st group has a fixed mindset believing that the qualities they posses are carved in stone. Characteristics such as intelligence, personality, and creativity are fixed traits, rather than something that can be developed. 2nd group has a growth mindset coming from a belief that our basic qualities are things we can cultivate through effort. Group 2 understands that people differ greatly – in aptitude, talents, interests, temperaments etc... but everyone can change and grow through application and experience. The book also goes deep into implications of each belief and points out some basic mistakes that teachers, managers and parents make in their every day life which forces those they influence into a fixed mindset. I love reading about success and this book instantly turned into one of my favorites on the topic, the mindset concept is absolutely critical to understand and I would highly recommend you to read this book!"
94,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5079848-amina,2,"2.5☆First, the concept was good, the first chapters were great but then the I found the book to be very repetitive, it could have been written in about 150 pages, and a little bit judgmental, sometimes even a bit hard on the people with the fixed mindset."
95,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9846570-leah,5,"Marking as one of my favourite self help/personal development books!!!I got so much from this book and it's permanently impacted my life. It was slightly repetitive but it was just really zoning in on the points.This is definitely a re-read so that I can take notes and study it more.Just off the top of my head here are some of my take aways:- Be growth-minded not fixed-minded. Fixed minded is when you believe people were born with innate talents and skills and they can't develop/learn/grow. While the growth mind set is about becoming anything or anyone you want and learning and growing into the person you want to be.- Every human is born into a set of genetic code from their parents and has experiences which can or need not define them. You can change how you act and the decisions you make if you want to, it will just take some effort and work- Lots of great information on how to raise your children in this book. How certain praises actuakly do harm instead of your intended good praise. Like saying ""Oh wow Billy you got 100% on your test? That means you made no mistakes that's great! You're so smart."" This instill fear into Billy's mind that he should try his best not to make mistakes in the future or else he will not be ""smart."" And children feed off of the praise their parents give them so this is so crucial. It's better to talk about their effort instead of judging them. Instead say "" Oh wow Billy you got 100% on your test? You must have worked really hard and studied, I'm so proud of your efforts.""- Shyness was also an interesting aspect of this book because if you are a shy person that basically means that you are more so fixed-minded because you find judgement of other people important to you. If you were growth minded then you would focus n working on your shyness and uncomfortableness to improve yourself instead of just defining yourself as shy and that's the end of it.- When you are raised by judgemental family it can influence you to become fixed-minded.Carol S. Dweck is a smart cookie, I look forward to her future publications ;)""the courage to be open—to welcome change and new ideas regardless of their source. Real self-confidence is not reflected in a title, an expensive suit, a fancy car, or a series of acquisitions. It is reflected in your mindset: your readiness to grow."""""
96,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10400867,2,"The idea of having a growth mindset isn’t revolutionary, however, just like any good self-help book, it focuses on a specific trait, repositions its importance, and expands its application.The idea of “growth mindset” is insightful and impactful. Once integrated within the mindset of an individual, relationship or organization, the applications become limitless. The main idea of the book:""Every one of us should believe that our basic qualities are things we can cultivate through effort. Yes, people differ greatly but everyone can change and grow through application and experience""As a result, we should change the way we look at any past set back, current challenge, or future perceived distasteful experience. We should think about and approach them as learning opportunities. Thinking of them in such away: a) increases our willingness to be exposed to challenging situations, and b) increases the learning, and thus, our development as individuals. All this will result, in continuous incremental learnings as time passes by.The idea isn’t just about changing the way you think, but it’s about making this way of thinking a habit. This habit, will “convert” any belief about oneself limits to a narrative about “learning opportunities”The author then spends a good 70% of the book showing how this is applied in different situations (teachers, spouses, workplace, and sports).The verdict:•	The book delivers a short, simple, self-evident yet important truth that can be delivered in an article or 4 pages max. The additional 270 pages was pure waste. Too repetitive. •	The author is ‘too’ in love with her theory, she tries to attribute all human achievements to it. She oversells it in my opinion.•	The examples she gives are too polarized, too ideal. She portrays people with fixed mindset in a stereotypical shallow way showing them as morons. I really did not like that about the book"
97,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239658-karen-chung,4,"This book has one relatively simple message that is repeated over and over again in many different forms throughout the narrative: that we need to approach everything in life not with a fixed mindset - i.e. that people are either born artists, athletes, good students, or whatever, or they are not - but with a ""growth"" mindset, i.e. that we are highly malleable, and achieve through effort, not just by happening to be talented. Due to its repetitiveness, which sets in very early in the book, I originally planned to give it only three stars. But the message is an extremely important one, and the illustrative anecdotes are interesting and worth reading, thus the fourth star. "
98,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8460201-karen,3,"The idea of a ""growth mindset"" is a simple one, but quite profound for many people who have grown up believing that talents and abilities are ""fixed"". A growth mindset is possessed by those who believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.Not sure where you sit? You can take a questionnaire here: https://mindsetonline.com/testyourmin...Because it is such a simple concept, I found the book a bit repetitive and I think it could have benefited from more around how to develop and change your fixed mindset, rather than continually trying to prove why having a growth mindset is better.I recommend this book to anyone interested in self development, who is a teacher/trainer, or has children!"
99,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38829282-nicholas-shaw,1,"How in the name of hell is this book rated so highly!? The central message is clearly that you should adopt the growth mindset if you wish to grow and improve at basically anything in life. If you have the fixed mindset you seem to believe you're stuck with what you've got, much frustration and general failure ensues.I can't imagine anyone arguing against hard work and effort to get anywhere in life but how is this book several hundred pages? Save yourself the effort and watch the TED talk at most if this summary isn't enough for you."
100,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11410080-rebecca,4,"Any book that helps you develop a new way to process failure, and a new way to learn and grow, is a book worth reading. I've already been telling everyone about the growth mindset, and I only just finished reading this. I wish everyone knew how to access and nourish their growth mindset, and I'm glad to start the journey towards my potential. Get outta here fixed mindset! This is the first ""self-help"" book I've ever read, and now I'm sad I didn't read it sooner. I highly recommend this."
101,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8164155-diana,5,I really enjoyed reading this awesome book. I delayed my reading a lot and wish that I could have read the book with the same enthusiasm from beginning to end. It was a little too much information for me but it was worth reading the whole book. I loved it! Will definitely go back to it in a few months to learn more from it. ;)

103,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23841736-sarah,5,This book was recommended to me by one of my jiujitsu instructors. I resisted because I'm not a fan of the self-help genre but I ended up really loving it. It's also helping me to understand a frustrating situation at work.This was excellent and very helpful.
104,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1128267-jason,0,"My dad had been talking about this book, so when we went to visit him and I saw it on his desk I started reading it. It made sense right away and was easy to get into. Your mindset (either a growth mindset or a fixed mindset) determines how you relate to your abilities and experiences in school, business, relationships, and sports (those are the areas she covers). I could see myself in both of the mindsets she described, and I think they're a useful tool for making sense of places where I struggle. They offer a way to organize a response. I have a sense of the freedom in the growth mindset: nothing sticks to you because you don't identify with the results; you're here to learn and grow, so fear and anger and results don't have such a grip on you. I picture someone loose in a stream of events, like a slippery fish. But it's a learning stream. It's funny, though. I feel like I need a break from these kinds of books: idea books to help you make something work, to get better at something. Maybe the Joker's monologues in The Dark Knight had an effect on me. (I saw it by myself late at night, which is the best time to come out of a movie.) I kind of liked them. I thought they were the best of their kind. Something like, ""They're all schemers . . ."" and he wants to disrupt it, subvert it, hold it up for its ridiculousness. This isn't exactly a schemer book, but it's definitely an aiming at success book (""success"" is in the sub-title). Ways to succeed rely on a simplification of what's going on. It's the only way to create a model to use to work with life, but I get tired of it eventually. I've read a lot of good ones this summer, though. I guess I'm ready to put my new tools to use. I don't need anymore new tools right now, thank you. I feel like I'm ready for Handke again. And maybe Philip Dick. I want to read Ubik. "
105,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13852634-alan-bevan,2,"I struggled to rate this book. It offers a single gem of a concept - perhaps not particularly original but nevertheless really important. And that gem is that how we think about ourselves can make all the difference. Do we see ourselves to have a fixed capacity or do we have a growth mindset? It reminded me of my Dad who consistently frustrated me by never trying anything new on the grounds that he was not the sort of person who did X. He genuinely seemed to believe he was not free to choose. He didn't see life as an opportunity to learn. This book offers a language to describe the alternative that he never saw, the 'growth mindset'.But that was it really for the book. That single concept is padded with countless (and to me tedious) anecdotes but it offered nothing more other than superficially considering the role of parents and teachers in relation to the development of mindsets.So yes, it contains a really important concept and I would have liked my father to read it but I reckon it would have more impact if condensed to a pithy 1000 word essay. But then there wouldn't be book to sell which would obviously be contrary to Dweck's mindset.And lastly, I am stunned that the publishers can get away with the sub heading, 'The new Psychology of Success'. New? Really?"
106,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5977628-kat,2,"I found this book a little frustrating. It's overall message is good, it explores the differences between having a fixed and growth mindset. A fixed mindset believes your intelligence, skills, talent, and life are all basically set in stone and can't be improved. A growth mindset believes that you can always become smarter or more skilled with effort, and views criticism as motivation to improve instead of a crushing blow. It's definitely an important lesson that everyone should learn. My frustration is mostly in how the lesson is delivered, and that is mostly though stories about grade school student, athletes, and CEOs. There is a lot of hand wringing about the folly of complementing your kids. The author tells a story of how she accidentally told her husband he was brilliant and gasped in horror at her mistake. There is praise of sleazy CEOs who've ""made it"" (while screwing their employees and the environment) and Harvey Weinstein of all people (though this was published in 2009). It just feels a little silly and like every other self help book that leans on stories about football players and men who realized their business might do better if their weren't such giant a**holes. There are better self improvement books out there."
107,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14858185-steven,2,"Disappointing and repetitive pop-psychology book based on 1 idea that seems dubious from anecdotal experience. The author talks about the ""fixed mindset"" those who believe that traits like intelligence, personality, sports ability etc. are largely determined genetically and those who believe in the ""growth mindset"" that all traits can be fundamentally changed with enough effort, with the growth mindset being the path to success.This is a false dichotomy. It's not an either/or (growth vs fixed mindset) but a continuum. We are part genetically determined, part environmentally determined. The assertion that only those with the growth mindset achieve their potential seems false and I'd like to see Dweck's data. Those who believe they're innately gifted in a specific trait, usually work and practice long and hard to perfect their skills in their particular talents, while ignoring the areas they are weak in. Dweck's handful of examples of people succeeding in an area they were initially believed to have little talent in hardly proves her thesis that one can do anything if one has the right mindset. "
108,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16612969-andrea,5,"In the book Mindset, by Carol Dweck, the author explains the fixed mindset and offers tips to help you move toward a more growth oriented mindset. A person with a fixed mindset believes that their intelligence, skills, and abilities are static and there is nothing they can do change that. Someone with a growth mindset believes that learning is a lifelong process. In the book, Dr Dweck used athlete John McEnroe as an example of someone with a fixed mindset. McEnroe believed that he was the best tennis player and if he lost a match, it was always due to some outside force that was beyond his control. He even rooted for his friends and family to lose their matches, so he could be the best in his circle. He never practiced, because he believed that someone with natural talent shouldn't require practice. On the opposite side of the spectrum, you have Michael Jordan. He was arguably one the greatest basketball players of all time, but he was cut from his high school team. With a lot of effort, time, and practice, he went on to the NBA. If you embrace a growth mindset, skills can be developed over time."
109,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34391111-solomon-mark,5,"Mindset is Excellent book. Carol Dweck explains about two types of Mindsets fixed and growth mindset. According to the author every person is having either Fixed or Growth mindset. Fixed mindset individuals perceives that Intelligent is unchangeable and static. Growth mindset individuals perceives that Intelligent can be changed and improved. Fixed mindset people avoid challenges, give-up when they encounters obstacles, they won’t take effort to make things better, they will avoid useful negative feedback from others and they won’t learn from their mistakes.Growth mindset people will be having desire to learn, never avoid challenges, learn from mistakes, they will take every effort to make things better, they will take valuable information from criticism and negative feedback.We have to learn from our mistakes and change ourself to improving our Intelligent and potential. In this book author gives many interesting examples on both fixed and growth mindsets. Every parent and individual should read this book. "
110,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15605093-hestia-istiviani,5,"THIS BOOK IS TOO AWESOME!I learn so many things about how powerful our mindset is. It not only talk about the definition on mindset, but also gives many applications on business, relationship, leadership, parenting, teaching, and coaching. I guess you will as surprised as me because we feel like we have walked to right pathway: to be proud of your almamater, to determine our skills instead of promoting ourselves to new things you have could learn from.I can't get over it. In the middle of reading, I listened to her podcasts, watched her TEDx Talks & interviews. Reading this book reminds me to others aligned book such as Sir Ken Robinson's Creative School, Tom Kelley's Creative Confidence, Susan Cain's Quite, and surprisingly Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In. It also makes me want to read Steven Levitt's Freakonomics and Arianna Huffington's Thrive. The conclusion is you have to start reading this book."
111,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/990216-elizabeth,3,"This has some interesting points about having a fixed mindset and a more flexible mindset, but there isn't enough depth to the anecdotes. I do recommend reading the chapter for teachers and parents as there are useful tips about motivating kids to learn and to change their own mindset. All in all, I would refer to the chart in the back as a shortcut for the information. "
112,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32415499-elizabeth-keatley,4,"This has been such an eye opening read. It will change not only how I conduct my daily personal life, but also how I praise and challenge my students."
113,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,4,"This book changed my perspective on abilities and potential. Dweck shows how to move from the fixed mindset (the belief that human qualities and abilities are set and essentially unalterable) to the growth mindset (the belief that those qualities and abilities can be cultivated through effort). Dweck, a psychologist, based the book on solid scientific research, not the pseudoscientific mystical nonsense often found in ""success psychology"" books. Dweck applies the mindsets to sports, business leadership, relationships, parenting, and teaching. The book has far too many anecdotes for my taste; it’s full of specific examples of famous CEOs and athletes, as well as ordinary people.My favorite parts were those that advised how to talk to children about their successes and failures. Intellectually, I agree with Dweck’s advice that you should praise effort, not ability, and that when a child does something quickly, you should challenge rather than praise them, but that can be emotionally difficult for a parent to do. I also found the section on bullying interesting, because I was bullied for most of my school years. I skimmed the many examples from sports, because I’m generally disinterested in sports.I read this because it was referred to in several books, articles, and podcasts about business and/or web design.The MindsetsFixed Mindset• Your qualities and intelligence are very basic to you and can’t change very much. If you have the ability, you’ll do well. If you don’t, you won’t.• Characteristics: passing up chances to learn, feeling labeled by a failure, getting discouraged when something requires effort.• Framework: judge and be judged; ""You have permanent traits and I'm judging them.""Growth Mindset• No matter your qualities and intelligence, you can always change substantially. Abilities can be cultivated and improved.• Characteristics: taking challenges, learning from failure, continuing effort.• Framework: learn and help learn; ""You are a developing person and I am interested in your development.""The Truth About Ability and Accomplishment• In the growth mindset, abilities can be cultivated, but that doesn’t mean that everything can or should be changed.• Benjamin Bloom, after 40 years of research on school learning, said, “What any person in the world can learn, almost all persons can learn, if provided with the appropriate prior and current conditions of learning.”• “Just because some people can do something with little or no training, it doesn’t mean that others can’t do it (and sometimes do it even better) with training.”• People (especially children) do better when praised for effort than ability.Relationships: Mindsets in Love (Or Not)• The fixed mindset believes that successful relationships don’t require effort. The growth mindset believes that they do.Bullying• To reduce bullying, change the school mindset.• Fight the atmosphere of judgement and create one of collaboration and self-improvement.• Empower bystanders to help victims.• Enforce discipline, but don’t judge the bully as a person. Make them feel liked and welcomed at school.• Praise the bully’s steps in the right direction (staying out of fighting, getting along with others). Praise efforts, not the person.• Teachers can point a bully away from judgment and towards compassion by not implying they’re a bad person, showing respect, and asking for the bully’s advice for helping bullied students.Parents, Teachers, and Coaches: Where Do Mindsets Come From?• Give children the growth-mindset message, “You are a developing person and I am interested in your development,” not the fixed-mindset message, “You have permanent traits and I’m judging them.”• Praising children’s intelligence harms motivation and performance. It gives a temporary boost, but if they run into difficulty, they’ll think failure means they’re dumb. Instead, praise for the growth-oriented process: what they accomplish through practice, study, persistence, strategy.• Don’t talk about others in terms of fixed judgments in front of children, or they’ll think you use the same fixed judgments on them.• When children do something quickly and perfectly, don’t praise their speed and perfection. Instead, say it was too easy and give them a challenge.• When a child fails, tell them you understand their disappointment, but they’ll need to work harder.• Use misbehavior as an occasion for teaching, not judgment.• When teachers judge, students will sabotage the teacher by not trying. When teachers care for students and show them school is a way to grow their minds, they try.Changing Mindsets: A WorkshopAs a family, talk about your efforts, strategies, setbacks, and learning every day."
114,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35853271-sonja,3,3.5 out of 5 stars.:: buddy read with my eldest brother[short review to come]
115,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4177031-troy-blackford,4,"Original '3-star' Review (3/11/14) [see update below]:This was a book of good ideas that felt rather stretched out. This is probably because it is based on the author's original newspaper article, which became unexpectedly successful. There is a definite vibe of 'let's cash in on this article's success by stretching it out into a book-length work' that plagues the first third of Mindset. But, if you can stick out the abysmal first part, which seeks to assure readers the ideas contained in the book are helpful with a brutal series of 'A woman in Topeka e-mailed me that she tried the ideas in this book, and SHE LOVED IT!' type statements (along with the inverse: 'A man in Fort Wayne failed to use these ideas, and HE'S MISERABLE!'), the book which follows does indeed have some great points. This is well worth thinking about.I chalk it up to the state of the modern publishing industry that Carol Dweck was unable to print a book a third or maybe half the length of this, as 'that's not what customers want to buy,' because I'm sure I would have preferred a leaner, meaner, more toned version of this book. But if you can sit out the filler, this book is full of great points that employees/employers, teachers, parents, and people learning any skill will do well to ponder.UPDATE (10/5/15): This is over a year after I've read this book, and I've seen Dr. Dweck's research mentioned countless times since. I didn't greatly appreciate, at the time of my prior review, that Dr. Dweck is a researcher, and wrote this book sharing her findings for popular consumption. I can certainly see how pressure to stretch her findings into a book-length work led to the deficiencies I noted earlier, but I very much appreciate the value of the work she did and feel my earlier rating of 'three stars' is simply not fair. Now that I have a better understanding of what this work is meant to be and who Dr. Carol Dweck is, I am adding a star."
116,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2202561-becky,4,"The premise of this book sounds pretty ""duh."" I ran across its title in several different contexts before I decided that if such dissimilar people swear by it, it can't be as obvious as it sounds. And its implications are wide-ranging and interesting. It made me see the world in a new way. It's entertaining and an easy read, and would be especially valuable to teachers, parents, and coaches, but really applies to pretty much everybody. Instead of subtitling it ""The New Psychology of Success"" (eyeroll, please) it could have been called ""What Great Teachers Know."" I didn't read quite all the way to the end, but something I felt was missing from this book is that few people have an overall ""fixed mindset"" or an overall ""growth mindset."" As I think about people I know, most have different mindsets for each realm of their life. Some people have an academic or career growth mindset but a fixed relationship or athletics mindset, for example. Since most people have a growth mindset in at least one area, learning to expand those attitudes into other areas seems like a useful path toward developing an advantageous mindset where it's lacking. And in fact, I think that's often what happens. A kid does badly in school and his parents put him in martial arts classes; not only does he love it, but he starts getting better grades and getting along with his friends better too. As he learns how to achieve in one area of his life, he begins to apply those same achievement skills to other areas as well. Like any other summary of this book, this sounds tediously obvious, but the implications are deeper than a summary can convey. "
117,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6317928-asra-syed,3,"I do agree with Carol Dweck's idea of mindsets as fixed or growth and how these mindsets can be limiting or beneficial. I've struggled with explaining to students how ""smart"" isn't something you are, and that instead you can work toward getting smarter and more capable, so Dweck's concepts will help with that. But I probably could have read an article about this or watched a video instead of reading this entire book. It gets incredibly redundant and she seems to take the ideas a little too far, attributing the mindsets to all sorts of famous accomplished people, which gets to be a stretch. Plus, she really seems to oversimplify or misunderstand the concept of depression (not that I can claim to really understand the mental illness myself, but I do know that it's a medical/chemical/emotional condition that can't just be fixed by changing one's mindset). I kept reading hoping that the book would provide concrete ways to work on changing mindsets instead of just redundancy proving that her ideas of these two mindsets it correct, but I guess you have to go pay for her Brainology material for that. Of course you do. "
118,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9522471-brian,1,"Very simplistic. Binary oppositions always are. Her use of athletes is very problematic. Was it Jordan's growth mindset or his fierce desire to win at all costs that has kind-of made him a pretty miserable human being that made him succeed? Looking back, she should be embarrassed about claiming Roger Clemens' mindset was what it took for him to succeed. At least she didn't include Lance Armstrong. And her take on the corporate world is strange. The way CEOs were rewarded during the time period she writes about had to do with increasing share holder value immediately. Mindset has nothing to do with it. In hindsight, her praise of Circuit City and GE's Jack Welch doesn't look so good today. This totally buys into the myth of ""you can be whatever you want to be if you try hard enough.""  "
119,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26683448-mohammed-h,5,"One of the most important books I have read. I watched my entire life and how I reacted to school, sports, arts, relationships and finally my business. I was shocked to know that I had a fixed mind set in my relationships, school and had a growth mind set to sports. Now I constantly ask myself and probe my brain for reactions. This book will change you and change people around you. Its infectious. Its important for your life, work and kids. I could not recommend a more important book to read."
120,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,1,"It's one thing to tell people their brains are like muscles. But the author pumps up that analogy until it explodes. Michael Jordan had to practice really really hard before he became a great basketball player. OK. But if he were 5 feet tall, it would not matter how hard he practiced; he would never have been an NBA MVP superstar. Yet the author writes ""Can anyone do anything? I don't really know."" Seriously!? That is literally farcical.http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-liv...This book has glowing reviews from reputable sources and positions the author as ""one of the world's leading researchers"" in psychology. So I'm holding it to a high standard. The author mentions Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and claims that ""Mindsets go further."" CBT is supported by numerous clinical trials. Where is there similarly rigorous evidence for a benefit from Mindsets? I could not find it in the book. I think there are better books covering the same area.

122,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78108898-exitgirl05,4,"Even if you think you know everything there is to know regarding mind, learning and developing, read this book. It's not the theory itself. Dr Carol Dweck offers examples of everyday situations in which every human finds himself. How we cope with professional challenges, parenting, relationships... It will make you think and it will surely give you a whole new perspective on learning process. It will help you become not smarter, but hungrier for knowledge. "
123,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"The big idea of the book is that we can divide people into 2 groups: 1st group has a fixed mindset believing that the qualities they posses are carved in stone. Characteristics such as intelligence, personality, and creativity are fixed traits, rather than something that can be developed. 2nd group has a growth mindset coming from a belief that our basic qualities are things we can cultivate through effort. Group 2 understands that people differ greatly – in aptitude, talents, interests, temperaments etc... but everyone can change and grow through application and experience. The book also goes deep into implications of each belief and points out some basic mistakes that teachers, managers and parents make in their every day life which forces those they influence into a fixed mindset. I love reading about success and this book instantly turned into one of my favorites on the topic, the mindset concept is absolutely critical to understand and I would highly recommend you to read this book!"
124,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5079848-amina,2,"2.5☆First, the concept was good, the first chapters were great but then the I found the book to be very repetitive, it could have been written in about 150 pages, and a little bit judgmental, sometimes even a bit hard on the people with the fixed mindset."
125,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9846570-leah,5,"Marking as one of my favourite self help/personal development books!!!I got so much from this book and it's permanently impacted my life. It was slightly repetitive but it was just really zoning in on the points.This is definitely a re-read so that I can take notes and study it more.Just off the top of my head here are some of my take aways:- Be growth-minded not fixed-minded. Fixed minded is when you believe people were born with innate talents and skills and they can't develop/learn/grow. While the growth mind set is about becoming anything or anyone you want and learning and growing into the person you want to be.- Every human is born into a set of genetic code from their parents and has experiences which can or need not define them. You can change how you act and the decisions you make if you want to, it will just take some effort and work- Lots of great information on how to raise your children in this book. How certain praises actuakly do harm instead of your intended good praise. Like saying ""Oh wow Billy you got 100% on your test? That means you made no mistakes that's great! You're so smart."" This instill fear into Billy's mind that he should try his best not to make mistakes in the future or else he will not be ""smart."" And children feed off of the praise their parents give them so this is so crucial. It's better to talk about their effort instead of judging them. Instead say "" Oh wow Billy you got 100% on your test? You must have worked really hard and studied, I'm so proud of your efforts.""- Shyness was also an interesting aspect of this book because if you are a shy person that basically means that you are more so fixed-minded because you find judgement of other people important to you. If you were growth minded then you would focus n working on your shyness and uncomfortableness to improve yourself instead of just defining yourself as shy and that's the end of it.- When you are raised by judgemental family it can influence you to become fixed-minded.Carol S. Dweck is a smart cookie, I look forward to her future publications ;)""the courage to be open—to welcome change and new ideas regardless of their source. Real self-confidence is not reflected in a title, an expensive suit, a fancy car, or a series of acquisitions. It is reflected in your mindset: your readiness to grow."""""
126,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10400867,2,"The idea of having a growth mindset isn’t revolutionary, however, just like any good self-help book, it focuses on a specific trait, repositions its importance, and expands its application.The idea of “growth mindset” is insightful and impactful. Once integrated within the mindset of an individual, relationship or organization, the applications become limitless. The main idea of the book:""Every one of us should believe that our basic qualities are things we can cultivate through effort. Yes, people differ greatly but everyone can change and grow through application and experience""As a result, we should change the way we look at any past set back, current challenge, or future perceived distasteful experience. We should think about and approach them as learning opportunities. Thinking of them in such away: a) increases our willingness to be exposed to challenging situations, and b) increases the learning, and thus, our development as individuals. All this will result, in continuous incremental learnings as time passes by.The idea isn’t just about changing the way you think, but it’s about making this way of thinking a habit. This habit, will “convert” any belief about oneself limits to a narrative about “learning opportunities”The author then spends a good 70% of the book showing how this is applied in different situations (teachers, spouses, workplace, and sports).The verdict:•	The book delivers a short, simple, self-evident yet important truth that can be delivered in an article or 4 pages max. The additional 270 pages was pure waste. Too repetitive. •	The author is ‘too’ in love with her theory, she tries to attribute all human achievements to it. She oversells it in my opinion.•	The examples she gives are too polarized, too ideal. She portrays people with fixed mindset in a stereotypical shallow way showing them as morons. I really did not like that about the book"
127,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239658-karen-chung,4,"This book has one relatively simple message that is repeated over and over again in many different forms throughout the narrative: that we need to approach everything in life not with a fixed mindset - i.e. that people are either born artists, athletes, good students, or whatever, or they are not - but with a ""growth"" mindset, i.e. that we are highly malleable, and achieve through effort, not just by happening to be talented. Due to its repetitiveness, which sets in very early in the book, I originally planned to give it only three stars. But the message is an extremely important one, and the illustrative anecdotes are interesting and worth reading, thus the fourth star. "
128,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8460201-karen,3,"The idea of a ""growth mindset"" is a simple one, but quite profound for many people who have grown up believing that talents and abilities are ""fixed"". A growth mindset is possessed by those who believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.Not sure where you sit? You can take a questionnaire here: https://mindsetonline.com/testyourmin...Because it is such a simple concept, I found the book a bit repetitive and I think it could have benefited from more around how to develop and change your fixed mindset, rather than continually trying to prove why having a growth mindset is better.I recommend this book to anyone interested in self development, who is a teacher/trainer, or has children!"
129,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38829282-nicholas-shaw,1,"How in the name of hell is this book rated so highly!? The central message is clearly that you should adopt the growth mindset if you wish to grow and improve at basically anything in life. If you have the fixed mindset you seem to believe you're stuck with what you've got, much frustration and general failure ensues.I can't imagine anyone arguing against hard work and effort to get anywhere in life but how is this book several hundred pages? Save yourself the effort and watch the TED talk at most if this summary isn't enough for you."
130,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11410080-rebecca,4,"Any book that helps you develop a new way to process failure, and a new way to learn and grow, is a book worth reading. I've already been telling everyone about the growth mindset, and I only just finished reading this. I wish everyone knew how to access and nourish their growth mindset, and I'm glad to start the journey towards my potential. Get outta here fixed mindset! This is the first ""self-help"" book I've ever read, and now I'm sad I didn't read it sooner. I highly recommend this."
131,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8164155-diana,5,I really enjoyed reading this awesome book. I delayed my reading a lot and wish that I could have read the book with the same enthusiasm from beginning to end. It was a little too much information for me but it was worth reading the whole book. I loved it! Will definitely go back to it in a few months to learn more from it. ;)

133,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23841736-sarah,5,This book was recommended to me by one of my jiujitsu instructors. I resisted because I'm not a fan of the self-help genre but I ended up really loving it. It's also helping me to understand a frustrating situation at work.This was excellent and very helpful.
134,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1128267-jason,0,"My dad had been talking about this book, so when we went to visit him and I saw it on his desk I started reading it. It made sense right away and was easy to get into. Your mindset (either a growth mindset or a fixed mindset) determines how you relate to your abilities and experiences in school, business, relationships, and sports (those are the areas she covers). I could see myself in both of the mindsets she described, and I think they're a useful tool for making sense of places where I struggle. They offer a way to organize a response. I have a sense of the freedom in the growth mindset: nothing sticks to you because you don't identify with the results; you're here to learn and grow, so fear and anger and results don't have such a grip on you. I picture someone loose in a stream of events, like a slippery fish. But it's a learning stream. It's funny, though. I feel like I need a break from these kinds of books: idea books to help you make something work, to get better at something. Maybe the Joker's monologues in The Dark Knight had an effect on me. (I saw it by myself late at night, which is the best time to come out of a movie.) I kind of liked them. I thought they were the best of their kind. Something like, ""They're all schemers . . ."" and he wants to disrupt it, subvert it, hold it up for its ridiculousness. This isn't exactly a schemer book, but it's definitely an aiming at success book (""success"" is in the sub-title). Ways to succeed rely on a simplification of what's going on. It's the only way to create a model to use to work with life, but I get tired of it eventually. I've read a lot of good ones this summer, though. I guess I'm ready to put my new tools to use. I don't need anymore new tools right now, thank you. I feel like I'm ready for Handke again. And maybe Philip Dick. I want to read Ubik. "
135,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13852634-alan-bevan,2,"I struggled to rate this book. It offers a single gem of a concept - perhaps not particularly original but nevertheless really important. And that gem is that how we think about ourselves can make all the difference. Do we see ourselves to have a fixed capacity or do we have a growth mindset? It reminded me of my Dad who consistently frustrated me by never trying anything new on the grounds that he was not the sort of person who did X. He genuinely seemed to believe he was not free to choose. He didn't see life as an opportunity to learn. This book offers a language to describe the alternative that he never saw, the 'growth mindset'.But that was it really for the book. That single concept is padded with countless (and to me tedious) anecdotes but it offered nothing more other than superficially considering the role of parents and teachers in relation to the development of mindsets.So yes, it contains a really important concept and I would have liked my father to read it but I reckon it would have more impact if condensed to a pithy 1000 word essay. But then there wouldn't be book to sell which would obviously be contrary to Dweck's mindset.And lastly, I am stunned that the publishers can get away with the sub heading, 'The new Psychology of Success'. New? Really?"
136,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5977628-kat,2,"I found this book a little frustrating. It's overall message is good, it explores the differences between having a fixed and growth mindset. A fixed mindset believes your intelligence, skills, talent, and life are all basically set in stone and can't be improved. A growth mindset believes that you can always become smarter or more skilled with effort, and views criticism as motivation to improve instead of a crushing blow. It's definitely an important lesson that everyone should learn. My frustration is mostly in how the lesson is delivered, and that is mostly though stories about grade school student, athletes, and CEOs. There is a lot of hand wringing about the folly of complementing your kids. The author tells a story of how she accidentally told her husband he was brilliant and gasped in horror at her mistake. There is praise of sleazy CEOs who've ""made it"" (while screwing their employees and the environment) and Harvey Weinstein of all people (though this was published in 2009). It just feels a little silly and like every other self help book that leans on stories about football players and men who realized their business might do better if their weren't such giant a**holes. There are better self improvement books out there."
137,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14858185-steven,2,"Disappointing and repetitive pop-psychology book based on 1 idea that seems dubious from anecdotal experience. The author talks about the ""fixed mindset"" those who believe that traits like intelligence, personality, sports ability etc. are largely determined genetically and those who believe in the ""growth mindset"" that all traits can be fundamentally changed with enough effort, with the growth mindset being the path to success.This is a false dichotomy. It's not an either/or (growth vs fixed mindset) but a continuum. We are part genetically determined, part environmentally determined. The assertion that only those with the growth mindset achieve their potential seems false and I'd like to see Dweck's data. Those who believe they're innately gifted in a specific trait, usually work and practice long and hard to perfect their skills in their particular talents, while ignoring the areas they are weak in. Dweck's handful of examples of people succeeding in an area they were initially believed to have little talent in hardly proves her thesis that one can do anything if one has the right mindset. "
138,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16612969-andrea,5,"In the book Mindset, by Carol Dweck, the author explains the fixed mindset and offers tips to help you move toward a more growth oriented mindset. A person with a fixed mindset believes that their intelligence, skills, and abilities are static and there is nothing they can do change that. Someone with a growth mindset believes that learning is a lifelong process. In the book, Dr Dweck used athlete John McEnroe as an example of someone with a fixed mindset. McEnroe believed that he was the best tennis player and if he lost a match, it was always due to some outside force that was beyond his control. He even rooted for his friends and family to lose their matches, so he could be the best in his circle. He never practiced, because he believed that someone with natural talent shouldn't require practice. On the opposite side of the spectrum, you have Michael Jordan. He was arguably one the greatest basketball players of all time, but he was cut from his high school team. With a lot of effort, time, and practice, he went on to the NBA. If you embrace a growth mindset, skills can be developed over time."
139,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34391111-solomon-mark,5,"Mindset is Excellent book. Carol Dweck explains about two types of Mindsets fixed and growth mindset. According to the author every person is having either Fixed or Growth mindset. Fixed mindset individuals perceives that Intelligent is unchangeable and static. Growth mindset individuals perceives that Intelligent can be changed and improved. Fixed mindset people avoid challenges, give-up when they encounters obstacles, they won’t take effort to make things better, they will avoid useful negative feedback from others and they won’t learn from their mistakes.Growth mindset people will be having desire to learn, never avoid challenges, learn from mistakes, they will take every effort to make things better, they will take valuable information from criticism and negative feedback.We have to learn from our mistakes and change ourself to improving our Intelligent and potential. In this book author gives many interesting examples on both fixed and growth mindsets. Every parent and individual should read this book. "
140,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15605093-hestia-istiviani,5,"THIS BOOK IS TOO AWESOME!I learn so many things about how powerful our mindset is. It not only talk about the definition on mindset, but also gives many applications on business, relationship, leadership, parenting, teaching, and coaching. I guess you will as surprised as me because we feel like we have walked to right pathway: to be proud of your almamater, to determine our skills instead of promoting ourselves to new things you have could learn from.I can't get over it. In the middle of reading, I listened to her podcasts, watched her TEDx Talks & interviews. Reading this book reminds me to others aligned book such as Sir Ken Robinson's Creative School, Tom Kelley's Creative Confidence, Susan Cain's Quite, and surprisingly Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In. It also makes me want to read Steven Levitt's Freakonomics and Arianna Huffington's Thrive. The conclusion is you have to start reading this book."
141,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/990216-elizabeth,3,"This has some interesting points about having a fixed mindset and a more flexible mindset, but there isn't enough depth to the anecdotes. I do recommend reading the chapter for teachers and parents as there are useful tips about motivating kids to learn and to change their own mindset. All in all, I would refer to the chart in the back as a shortcut for the information. "
142,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32415499-elizabeth-keatley,4,"This has been such an eye opening read. It will change not only how I conduct my daily personal life, but also how I praise and challenge my students."
143,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,4,"This book changed my perspective on abilities and potential. Dweck shows how to move from the fixed mindset (the belief that human qualities and abilities are set and essentially unalterable) to the growth mindset (the belief that those qualities and abilities can be cultivated through effort). Dweck, a psychologist, based the book on solid scientific research, not the pseudoscientific mystical nonsense often found in ""success psychology"" books. Dweck applies the mindsets to sports, business leadership, relationships, parenting, and teaching. The book has far too many anecdotes for my taste; it’s full of specific examples of famous CEOs and athletes, as well as ordinary people.My favorite parts were those that advised how to talk to children about their successes and failures. Intellectually, I agree with Dweck’s advice that you should praise effort, not ability, and that when a child does something quickly, you should challenge rather than praise them, but that can be emotionally difficult for a parent to do. I also found the section on bullying interesting, because I was bullied for most of my school years. I skimmed the many examples from sports, because I’m generally disinterested in sports.I read this because it was referred to in several books, articles, and podcasts about business and/or web design.The MindsetsFixed Mindset• Your qualities and intelligence are very basic to you and can’t change very much. If you have the ability, you’ll do well. If you don’t, you won’t.• Characteristics: passing up chances to learn, feeling labeled by a failure, getting discouraged when something requires effort.• Framework: judge and be judged; ""You have permanent traits and I'm judging them.""Growth Mindset• No matter your qualities and intelligence, you can always change substantially. Abilities can be cultivated and improved.• Characteristics: taking challenges, learning from failure, continuing effort.• Framework: learn and help learn; ""You are a developing person and I am interested in your development.""The Truth About Ability and Accomplishment• In the growth mindset, abilities can be cultivated, but that doesn’t mean that everything can or should be changed.• Benjamin Bloom, after 40 years of research on school learning, said, “What any person in the world can learn, almost all persons can learn, if provided with the appropriate prior and current conditions of learning.”• “Just because some people can do something with little or no training, it doesn’t mean that others can’t do it (and sometimes do it even better) with training.”• People (especially children) do better when praised for effort than ability.Relationships: Mindsets in Love (Or Not)• The fixed mindset believes that successful relationships don’t require effort. The growth mindset believes that they do.Bullying• To reduce bullying, change the school mindset.• Fight the atmosphere of judgement and create one of collaboration and self-improvement.• Empower bystanders to help victims.• Enforce discipline, but don’t judge the bully as a person. Make them feel liked and welcomed at school.• Praise the bully’s steps in the right direction (staying out of fighting, getting along with others). Praise efforts, not the person.• Teachers can point a bully away from judgment and towards compassion by not implying they’re a bad person, showing respect, and asking for the bully’s advice for helping bullied students.Parents, Teachers, and Coaches: Where Do Mindsets Come From?• Give children the growth-mindset message, “You are a developing person and I am interested in your development,” not the fixed-mindset message, “You have permanent traits and I’m judging them.”• Praising children’s intelligence harms motivation and performance. It gives a temporary boost, but if they run into difficulty, they’ll think failure means they’re dumb. Instead, praise for the growth-oriented process: what they accomplish through practice, study, persistence, strategy.• Don’t talk about others in terms of fixed judgments in front of children, or they’ll think you use the same fixed judgments on them.• When children do something quickly and perfectly, don’t praise their speed and perfection. Instead, say it was too easy and give them a challenge.• When a child fails, tell them you understand their disappointment, but they’ll need to work harder.• Use misbehavior as an occasion for teaching, not judgment.• When teachers judge, students will sabotage the teacher by not trying. When teachers care for students and show them school is a way to grow their minds, they try.Changing Mindsets: A WorkshopAs a family, talk about your efforts, strategies, setbacks, and learning every day."
144,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35853271-sonja,3,3.5 out of 5 stars.:: buddy read with my eldest brother[short review to come]
145,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4177031-troy-blackford,4,"Original '3-star' Review (3/11/14) [see update below]:This was a book of good ideas that felt rather stretched out. This is probably because it is based on the author's original newspaper article, which became unexpectedly successful. There is a definite vibe of 'let's cash in on this article's success by stretching it out into a book-length work' that plagues the first third of Mindset. But, if you can stick out the abysmal first part, which seeks to assure readers the ideas contained in the book are helpful with a brutal series of 'A woman in Topeka e-mailed me that she tried the ideas in this book, and SHE LOVED IT!' type statements (along with the inverse: 'A man in Fort Wayne failed to use these ideas, and HE'S MISERABLE!'), the book which follows does indeed have some great points. This is well worth thinking about.I chalk it up to the state of the modern publishing industry that Carol Dweck was unable to print a book a third or maybe half the length of this, as 'that's not what customers want to buy,' because I'm sure I would have preferred a leaner, meaner, more toned version of this book. But if you can sit out the filler, this book is full of great points that employees/employers, teachers, parents, and people learning any skill will do well to ponder.UPDATE (10/5/15): This is over a year after I've read this book, and I've seen Dr. Dweck's research mentioned countless times since. I didn't greatly appreciate, at the time of my prior review, that Dr. Dweck is a researcher, and wrote this book sharing her findings for popular consumption. I can certainly see how pressure to stretch her findings into a book-length work led to the deficiencies I noted earlier, but I very much appreciate the value of the work she did and feel my earlier rating of 'three stars' is simply not fair. Now that I have a better understanding of what this work is meant to be and who Dr. Carol Dweck is, I am adding a star."
146,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2202561-becky,4,"The premise of this book sounds pretty ""duh."" I ran across its title in several different contexts before I decided that if such dissimilar people swear by it, it can't be as obvious as it sounds. And its implications are wide-ranging and interesting. It made me see the world in a new way. It's entertaining and an easy read, and would be especially valuable to teachers, parents, and coaches, but really applies to pretty much everybody. Instead of subtitling it ""The New Psychology of Success"" (eyeroll, please) it could have been called ""What Great Teachers Know."" I didn't read quite all the way to the end, but something I felt was missing from this book is that few people have an overall ""fixed mindset"" or an overall ""growth mindset."" As I think about people I know, most have different mindsets for each realm of their life. Some people have an academic or career growth mindset but a fixed relationship or athletics mindset, for example. Since most people have a growth mindset in at least one area, learning to expand those attitudes into other areas seems like a useful path toward developing an advantageous mindset where it's lacking. And in fact, I think that's often what happens. A kid does badly in school and his parents put him in martial arts classes; not only does he love it, but he starts getting better grades and getting along with his friends better too. As he learns how to achieve in one area of his life, he begins to apply those same achievement skills to other areas as well. Like any other summary of this book, this sounds tediously obvious, but the implications are deeper than a summary can convey. "
147,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6317928-asra-syed,3,"I do agree with Carol Dweck's idea of mindsets as fixed or growth and how these mindsets can be limiting or beneficial. I've struggled with explaining to students how ""smart"" isn't something you are, and that instead you can work toward getting smarter and more capable, so Dweck's concepts will help with that. But I probably could have read an article about this or watched a video instead of reading this entire book. It gets incredibly redundant and she seems to take the ideas a little too far, attributing the mindsets to all sorts of famous accomplished people, which gets to be a stretch. Plus, she really seems to oversimplify or misunderstand the concept of depression (not that I can claim to really understand the mental illness myself, but I do know that it's a medical/chemical/emotional condition that can't just be fixed by changing one's mindset). I kept reading hoping that the book would provide concrete ways to work on changing mindsets instead of just redundancy proving that her ideas of these two mindsets it correct, but I guess you have to go pay for her Brainology material for that. Of course you do. "
148,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9522471-brian,1,"Very simplistic. Binary oppositions always are. Her use of athletes is very problematic. Was it Jordan's growth mindset or his fierce desire to win at all costs that has kind-of made him a pretty miserable human being that made him succeed? Looking back, she should be embarrassed about claiming Roger Clemens' mindset was what it took for him to succeed. At least she didn't include Lance Armstrong. And her take on the corporate world is strange. The way CEOs were rewarded during the time period she writes about had to do with increasing share holder value immediately. Mindset has nothing to do with it. In hindsight, her praise of Circuit City and GE's Jack Welch doesn't look so good today. This totally buys into the myth of ""you can be whatever you want to be if you try hard enough.""  "
149,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26683448-mohammed-h,5,"One of the most important books I have read. I watched my entire life and how I reacted to school, sports, arts, relationships and finally my business. I was shocked to know that I had a fixed mind set in my relationships, school and had a growth mind set to sports. Now I constantly ask myself and probe my brain for reactions. This book will change you and change people around you. Its infectious. Its important for your life, work and kids. I could not recommend a more important book to read."
150,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,1,"It's one thing to tell people their brains are like muscles. But the author pumps up that analogy until it explodes. Michael Jordan had to practice really really hard before he became a great basketball player. OK. But if he were 5 feet tall, it would not matter how hard he practiced; he would never have been an NBA MVP superstar. Yet the author writes ""Can anyone do anything? I don't really know."" Seriously!? That is literally farcical.http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-liv...This book has glowing reviews from reputable sources and positions the author as ""one of the world's leading researchers"" in psychology. So I'm holding it to a high standard. The author mentions Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and claims that ""Mindsets go further."" CBT is supported by numerous clinical trials. Where is there similarly rigorous evidence for a benefit from Mindsets? I could not find it in the book. I think there are better books covering the same area.

152,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78108898-exitgirl05,4,"Even if you think you know everything there is to know regarding mind, learning and developing, read this book. It's not the theory itself. Dr Carol Dweck offers examples of everyday situations in which every human finds himself. How we cope with professional challenges, parenting, relationships... It will make you think and it will surely give you a whole new perspective on learning process. It will help you become not smarter, but hungrier for knowledge. "
153,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"The big idea of the book is that we can divide people into 2 groups: 1st group has a fixed mindset believing that the qualities they posses are carved in stone. Characteristics such as intelligence, personality, and creativity are fixed traits, rather than something that can be developed. 2nd group has a growth mindset coming from a belief that our basic qualities are things we can cultivate through effort. Group 2 understands that people differ greatly – in aptitude, talents, interests, temperaments etc... but everyone can change and grow through application and experience. The book also goes deep into implications of each belief and points out some basic mistakes that teachers, managers and parents make in their every day life which forces those they influence into a fixed mindset. I love reading about success and this book instantly turned into one of my favorites on the topic, the mindset concept is absolutely critical to understand and I would highly recommend you to read this book!"
154,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5079848-amina,2,"2.5☆First, the concept was good, the first chapters were great but then the I found the book to be very repetitive, it could have been written in about 150 pages, and a little bit judgmental, sometimes even a bit hard on the people with the fixed mindset."
155,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9846570-leah,5,"Marking as one of my favourite self help/personal development books!!!I got so much from this book and it's permanently impacted my life. It was slightly repetitive but it was just really zoning in on the points.This is definitely a re-read so that I can take notes and study it more.Just off the top of my head here are some of my take aways:- Be growth-minded not fixed-minded. Fixed minded is when you believe people were born with innate talents and skills and they can't develop/learn/grow. While the growth mind set is about becoming anything or anyone you want and learning and growing into the person you want to be.- Every human is born into a set of genetic code from their parents and has experiences which can or need not define them. You can change how you act and the decisions you make if you want to, it will just take some effort and work- Lots of great information on how to raise your children in this book. How certain praises actuakly do harm instead of your intended good praise. Like saying ""Oh wow Billy you got 100% on your test? That means you made no mistakes that's great! You're so smart."" This instill fear into Billy's mind that he should try his best not to make mistakes in the future or else he will not be ""smart."" And children feed off of the praise their parents give them so this is so crucial. It's better to talk about their effort instead of judging them. Instead say "" Oh wow Billy you got 100% on your test? You must have worked really hard and studied, I'm so proud of your efforts.""- Shyness was also an interesting aspect of this book because if you are a shy person that basically means that you are more so fixed-minded because you find judgement of other people important to you. If you were growth minded then you would focus n working on your shyness and uncomfortableness to improve yourself instead of just defining yourself as shy and that's the end of it.- When you are raised by judgemental family it can influence you to become fixed-minded.Carol S. Dweck is a smart cookie, I look forward to her future publications ;)""the courage to be open—to welcome change and new ideas regardless of their source. Real self-confidence is not reflected in a title, an expensive suit, a fancy car, or a series of acquisitions. It is reflected in your mindset: your readiness to grow."""""
156,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10400867,2,"The idea of having a growth mindset isn’t revolutionary, however, just like any good self-help book, it focuses on a specific trait, repositions its importance, and expands its application.The idea of “growth mindset” is insightful and impactful. Once integrated within the mindset of an individual, relationship or organization, the applications become limitless. The main idea of the book:""Every one of us should believe that our basic qualities are things we can cultivate through effort. Yes, people differ greatly but everyone can change and grow through application and experience""As a result, we should change the way we look at any past set back, current challenge, or future perceived distasteful experience. We should think about and approach them as learning opportunities. Thinking of them in such away: a) increases our willingness to be exposed to challenging situations, and b) increases the learning, and thus, our development as individuals. All this will result, in continuous incremental learnings as time passes by.The idea isn’t just about changing the way you think, but it’s about making this way of thinking a habit. This habit, will “convert” any belief about oneself limits to a narrative about “learning opportunities”The author then spends a good 70% of the book showing how this is applied in different situations (teachers, spouses, workplace, and sports).The verdict:•	The book delivers a short, simple, self-evident yet important truth that can be delivered in an article or 4 pages max. The additional 270 pages was pure waste. Too repetitive. •	The author is ‘too’ in love with her theory, she tries to attribute all human achievements to it. She oversells it in my opinion.•	The examples she gives are too polarized, too ideal. She portrays people with fixed mindset in a stereotypical shallow way showing them as morons. I really did not like that about the book"
157,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239658-karen-chung,4,"This book has one relatively simple message that is repeated over and over again in many different forms throughout the narrative: that we need to approach everything in life not with a fixed mindset - i.e. that people are either born artists, athletes, good students, or whatever, or they are not - but with a ""growth"" mindset, i.e. that we are highly malleable, and achieve through effort, not just by happening to be talented. Due to its repetitiveness, which sets in very early in the book, I originally planned to give it only three stars. But the message is an extremely important one, and the illustrative anecdotes are interesting and worth reading, thus the fourth star. "
158,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8460201-karen,3,"The idea of a ""growth mindset"" is a simple one, but quite profound for many people who have grown up believing that talents and abilities are ""fixed"". A growth mindset is possessed by those who believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.Not sure where you sit? You can take a questionnaire here: https://mindsetonline.com/testyourmin...Because it is such a simple concept, I found the book a bit repetitive and I think it could have benefited from more around how to develop and change your fixed mindset, rather than continually trying to prove why having a growth mindset is better.I recommend this book to anyone interested in self development, who is a teacher/trainer, or has children!"
159,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38829282-nicholas-shaw,1,"How in the name of hell is this book rated so highly!? The central message is clearly that you should adopt the growth mindset if you wish to grow and improve at basically anything in life. If you have the fixed mindset you seem to believe you're stuck with what you've got, much frustration and general failure ensues.I can't imagine anyone arguing against hard work and effort to get anywhere in life but how is this book several hundred pages? Save yourself the effort and watch the TED talk at most if this summary isn't enough for you."
160,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11410080-rebecca,4,"Any book that helps you develop a new way to process failure, and a new way to learn and grow, is a book worth reading. I've already been telling everyone about the growth mindset, and I only just finished reading this. I wish everyone knew how to access and nourish their growth mindset, and I'm glad to start the journey towards my potential. Get outta here fixed mindset! This is the first ""self-help"" book I've ever read, and now I'm sad I didn't read it sooner. I highly recommend this."
161,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8164155-diana,5,I really enjoyed reading this awesome book. I delayed my reading a lot and wish that I could have read the book with the same enthusiasm from beginning to end. It was a little too much information for me but it was worth reading the whole book. I loved it! Will definitely go back to it in a few months to learn more from it. ;)

163,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23841736-sarah,5,This book was recommended to me by one of my jiujitsu instructors. I resisted because I'm not a fan of the self-help genre but I ended up really loving it. It's also helping me to understand a frustrating situation at work.This was excellent and very helpful.
164,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1128267-jason,0,"My dad had been talking about this book, so when we went to visit him and I saw it on his desk I started reading it. It made sense right away and was easy to get into. Your mindset (either a growth mindset or a fixed mindset) determines how you relate to your abilities and experiences in school, business, relationships, and sports (those are the areas she covers). I could see myself in both of the mindsets she described, and I think they're a useful tool for making sense of places where I struggle. They offer a way to organize a response. I have a sense of the freedom in the growth mindset: nothing sticks to you because you don't identify with the results; you're here to learn and grow, so fear and anger and results don't have such a grip on you. I picture someone loose in a stream of events, like a slippery fish. But it's a learning stream. It's funny, though. I feel like I need a break from these kinds of books: idea books to help you make something work, to get better at something. Maybe the Joker's monologues in The Dark Knight had an effect on me. (I saw it by myself late at night, which is the best time to come out of a movie.) I kind of liked them. I thought they were the best of their kind. Something like, ""They're all schemers . . ."" and he wants to disrupt it, subvert it, hold it up for its ridiculousness. This isn't exactly a schemer book, but it's definitely an aiming at success book (""success"" is in the sub-title). Ways to succeed rely on a simplification of what's going on. It's the only way to create a model to use to work with life, but I get tired of it eventually. I've read a lot of good ones this summer, though. I guess I'm ready to put my new tools to use. I don't need anymore new tools right now, thank you. I feel like I'm ready for Handke again. And maybe Philip Dick. I want to read Ubik. "
165,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13852634-alan-bevan,2,"I struggled to rate this book. It offers a single gem of a concept - perhaps not particularly original but nevertheless really important. And that gem is that how we think about ourselves can make all the difference. Do we see ourselves to have a fixed capacity or do we have a growth mindset? It reminded me of my Dad who consistently frustrated me by never trying anything new on the grounds that he was not the sort of person who did X. He genuinely seemed to believe he was not free to choose. He didn't see life as an opportunity to learn. This book offers a language to describe the alternative that he never saw, the 'growth mindset'.But that was it really for the book. That single concept is padded with countless (and to me tedious) anecdotes but it offered nothing more other than superficially considering the role of parents and teachers in relation to the development of mindsets.So yes, it contains a really important concept and I would have liked my father to read it but I reckon it would have more impact if condensed to a pithy 1000 word essay. But then there wouldn't be book to sell which would obviously be contrary to Dweck's mindset.And lastly, I am stunned that the publishers can get away with the sub heading, 'The new Psychology of Success'. New? Really?"
166,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5977628-kat,2,"I found this book a little frustrating. It's overall message is good, it explores the differences between having a fixed and growth mindset. A fixed mindset believes your intelligence, skills, talent, and life are all basically set in stone and can't be improved. A growth mindset believes that you can always become smarter or more skilled with effort, and views criticism as motivation to improve instead of a crushing blow. It's definitely an important lesson that everyone should learn. My frustration is mostly in how the lesson is delivered, and that is mostly though stories about grade school student, athletes, and CEOs. There is a lot of hand wringing about the folly of complementing your kids. The author tells a story of how she accidentally told her husband he was brilliant and gasped in horror at her mistake. There is praise of sleazy CEOs who've ""made it"" (while screwing their employees and the environment) and Harvey Weinstein of all people (though this was published in 2009). It just feels a little silly and like every other self help book that leans on stories about football players and men who realized their business might do better if their weren't such giant a**holes. There are better self improvement books out there."
167,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14858185-steven,2,"Disappointing and repetitive pop-psychology book based on 1 idea that seems dubious from anecdotal experience. The author talks about the ""fixed mindset"" those who believe that traits like intelligence, personality, sports ability etc. are largely determined genetically and those who believe in the ""growth mindset"" that all traits can be fundamentally changed with enough effort, with the growth mindset being the path to success.This is a false dichotomy. It's not an either/or (growth vs fixed mindset) but a continuum. We are part genetically determined, part environmentally determined. The assertion that only those with the growth mindset achieve their potential seems false and I'd like to see Dweck's data. Those who believe they're innately gifted in a specific trait, usually work and practice long and hard to perfect their skills in their particular talents, while ignoring the areas they are weak in. Dweck's handful of examples of people succeeding in an area they were initially believed to have little talent in hardly proves her thesis that one can do anything if one has the right mindset. "
168,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16612969-andrea,5,"In the book Mindset, by Carol Dweck, the author explains the fixed mindset and offers tips to help you move toward a more growth oriented mindset. A person with a fixed mindset believes that their intelligence, skills, and abilities are static and there is nothing they can do change that. Someone with a growth mindset believes that learning is a lifelong process. In the book, Dr Dweck used athlete John McEnroe as an example of someone with a fixed mindset. McEnroe believed that he was the best tennis player and if he lost a match, it was always due to some outside force that was beyond his control. He even rooted for his friends and family to lose their matches, so he could be the best in his circle. He never practiced, because he believed that someone with natural talent shouldn't require practice. On the opposite side of the spectrum, you have Michael Jordan. He was arguably one the greatest basketball players of all time, but he was cut from his high school team. With a lot of effort, time, and practice, he went on to the NBA. If you embrace a growth mindset, skills can be developed over time."
169,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34391111-solomon-mark,5,"Mindset is Excellent book. Carol Dweck explains about two types of Mindsets fixed and growth mindset. According to the author every person is having either Fixed or Growth mindset. Fixed mindset individuals perceives that Intelligent is unchangeable and static. Growth mindset individuals perceives that Intelligent can be changed and improved. Fixed mindset people avoid challenges, give-up when they encounters obstacles, they won’t take effort to make things better, they will avoid useful negative feedback from others and they won’t learn from their mistakes.Growth mindset people will be having desire to learn, never avoid challenges, learn from mistakes, they will take every effort to make things better, they will take valuable information from criticism and negative feedback.We have to learn from our mistakes and change ourself to improving our Intelligent and potential. In this book author gives many interesting examples on both fixed and growth mindsets. Every parent and individual should read this book. "
170,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15605093-hestia-istiviani,5,"THIS BOOK IS TOO AWESOME!I learn so many things about how powerful our mindset is. It not only talk about the definition on mindset, but also gives many applications on business, relationship, leadership, parenting, teaching, and coaching. I guess you will as surprised as me because we feel like we have walked to right pathway: to be proud of your almamater, to determine our skills instead of promoting ourselves to new things you have could learn from.I can't get over it. In the middle of reading, I listened to her podcasts, watched her TEDx Talks & interviews. Reading this book reminds me to others aligned book such as Sir Ken Robinson's Creative School, Tom Kelley's Creative Confidence, Susan Cain's Quite, and surprisingly Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In. It also makes me want to read Steven Levitt's Freakonomics and Arianna Huffington's Thrive. The conclusion is you have to start reading this book."

I do recommend reading the chapter for teachers and parents as there are useful tips about motivating kids to learn and to change their own mindset. All in all, I would refer to the chart in the back as a shortcut for the information. "
172,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32415499-elizabeth-keatley,4,"This has been such an eye opening read. It will change not only how I conduct my daily personal life, but also how I praise and challenge my students."
173,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,4,"This book changed my perspective on abilities and potential. Dweck shows how to move from the fixed mindset (the belief that human qualities and abilities are set and essentially unalterable) to the growth mindset (the belief that those qualities and abilities can be cultivated through effort). Dweck, a psychologist, based the book on solid scientific research, not the pseudoscientific mystical nonsense often found in ""success psychology"" books. Dweck applies the mindsets to sports, business leadership, relationships, parenting, and teaching. The book has far too many anecdotes for my taste; it’s full of specific examples of famous CEOs and athletes, as well as ordinary people.My favorite parts were those that advised how to talk to children about their successes and failures. Intellectually, I agree with Dweck’s advice that you should praise effort, not ability, and that when a child does something quickly, you should challenge rather than praise them, but that can be emotionally difficult for a parent to do. I also found the section on bullying interesting, because I was bullied for most of my school years. I skimmed the many examples from sports, because I’m generally disinterested in sports.I read this because it was referred to in several books, articles, and podcasts about business and/or web design.The MindsetsFixed Mindset• Your qualities and intelligence are very basic to you and can’t change very much. If you have the ability, you’ll do well. If you don’t, you won’t.• Characteristics: passing up chances to learn, feeling labeled by a failure, getting discouraged when something requires effort.• Framework: judge and be judged; ""You have permanent traits and I'm judging them.""Growth Mindset• No matter your qualities and intelligence, you can always change substantially. Abilities can be cultivated and improved.• Characteristics: taking challenges, learning from failure, continuing effort.• Framework: learn and help learn; ""You are a developing person and I am interested in your development.""The Truth About Ability and Accomplishment• In the growth mindset, abilities can be cultivated, but that doesn’t mean that everything can or should be changed.• Benjamin Bloom, after 40 years of research on school learning, said, “What any person in the world can learn, almost all persons can learn, if provided with the appropriate prior and current conditions of learning.”• “Just because some people can do something with little or no training, it doesn’t mean that others can’t do it (and sometimes do it even better) with training.”• People (especially children) do better when praised for effort than ability.Relationships: Mindsets in Love (Or Not)• The fixed mindset believes that successful relationships don’t require effort. The growth mindset believes that they do.Bullying• To reduce bullying, change the school mindset.• Fight the atmosphere of judgement and create one of collaboration and self-improvement.• Empower bystanders to help victims.• Enforce discipline, but don’t judge the bully as a person. Make them feel liked and welcomed at school.• Praise the bully’s steps in the right direction (staying out of fighting, getting along with others). Praise efforts, not the person.• Teachers can point a bully away from judgment and towards compassion by not implying they’re a bad person, showing respect, and asking for the bully’s advice for helping bullied students.Parents, Teachers, and Coaches: Where Do Mindsets Come From?• Give children the growth-mindset message, “You are a developing person and I am interested in your development,” not the fixed-mindset message, “You have permanent traits and I’m judging them.”• Praising children’s intelligence harms motivation and performance. It gives a temporary boost, but if they run into difficulty, they’ll think failure means they’re dumb. Instead, praise for the growth-oriented process: what they accomplish through practice, study, persistence, strategy.• Don’t talk about others in terms of fixed judgments in front of children, or they’ll think you use the same fixed judgments on them.• When children do something quickly and perfectly, don’t praise their speed and perfection. Instead, say it was too easy and give them a challenge.• When a child fails, tell them you understand their disappointment, but they’ll need to work harder.• Use misbehavior as an occasion for teaching, not judgment.• When teachers judge, students will sabotage the teacher by not trying. When teachers care for students and show them school is a way to grow their minds, they try.Changing Mindsets: A WorkshopAs a family, talk about your efforts, strategies, setbacks, and learning every day."
174,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35853271-sonja,3,3.5 out of 5 stars.:: buddy read with my eldest brother[short review to come]
175,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4177031-troy-blackford,4,"Original '3-star' Review (3/11/14) [see update below]:This was a book of good ideas that felt rather stretched out. This is probably because it is based on the author's original newspaper article, which became unexpectedly successful. There is a definite vibe of 'let's cash in on this article's success by stretching it out into a book-length work' that plagues the first third of Mindset. But, if you can stick out the abysmal first part, which seeks to assure readers the ideas contained in the book are helpful with a brutal series of 'A woman in Topeka e-mailed me that she tried the ideas in this book, and SHE LOVED IT!' type statements (along with the inverse: 'A man in Fort Wayne failed to use these ideas, and HE'S MISERABLE!'), the book which follows does indeed have some great points. This is well worth thinking about.I chalk it up to the state of the modern publishing industry that Carol Dweck was unable to print a book a third or maybe half the length of this, as 'that's not what customers want to buy,' because I'm sure I would have preferred a leaner, meaner, more toned version of this book. But if you can sit out the filler, this book is full of great points that employees/employers, teachers, parents, and people learning any skill will do well to ponder.UPDATE (10/5/15): This is over a year after I've read this book, and I've seen Dr. Dweck's research mentioned countless times since. I didn't greatly appreciate, at the time of my prior review, that Dr. Dweck is a researcher, and wrote this book sharing her findings for popular consumption. I can certainly see how pressure to stretch her findings into a book-length work led to the deficiencies I noted earlier, but I very much appreciate the value of the work she did and feel my earlier rating of 'three stars' is simply not fair. Now that I have a better understanding of what this work is meant to be and who Dr. Carol Dweck is, I am adding a star."
176,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2202561-becky,4,"The premise of this book sounds pretty ""duh."" I ran across its title in several different contexts before I decided that if such dissimilar people swear by it, it can't be as obvious as it sounds. And its implications are wide-ranging and interesting. It made me see the world in a new way. It's entertaining and an easy read, and would be especially valuable to teachers, parents, and coaches, but really applies to pretty much everybody. Instead of subtitling it ""The New Psychology of Success"" (eyeroll, please) it could have been called ""What Great Teachers Know."" I didn't read quite all the way to the end, but something I felt was missing from this book is that few people have an overall ""fixed mindset"" or an overall ""growth mindset."" As I think about people I know, most have different mindsets for each realm of their life. Some people have an academic or career growth mindset but a fixed relationship or athletics mindset, for example. Since most people have a growth mindset in at least one area, learning to expand those attitudes into other areas seems like a useful path toward developing an advantageous mindset where it's lacking. And in fact, I think that's often what happens. A kid does badly in school and his parents put him in martial arts classes; not only does he love it, but he starts getting better grades and getting along with his friends better too. As he learns how to achieve in one area of his life, he begins to apply those same achievement skills to other areas as well. Like any other summary of this book, this sounds tediously obvious, but the implications are deeper than a summary can convey. "
177,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6317928-asra-syed,3,"I do agree with Carol Dweck's idea of mindsets as fixed or growth and how these mindsets can be limiting or beneficial. I've struggled with explaining to students how ""smart"" isn't something you are, and that instead you can work toward getting smarter and more capable, so Dweck's concepts will help with that. But I probably could have read an article about this or watched a video instead of reading this entire book. It gets incredibly redundant and she seems to take the ideas a little too far, attributing the mindsets to all sorts of famous accomplished people, which gets to be a stretch. Plus, she really seems to oversimplify or misunderstand the concept of depression (not that I can claim to really understand the mental illness myself, but I do know that it's a medical/chemical/emotional condition that can't just be fixed by changing one's mindset). I kept reading hoping that the book would provide concrete ways to work on changing mindsets instead of just redundancy proving that her ideas of these two mindsets it correct, but I guess you have to go pay for her Brainology material for that. Of course you do. "
178,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9522471-brian,1,"Very simplistic. Binary oppositions always are. Her use of athletes is very problematic. Was it Jordan's growth mindset or his fierce desire to win at all costs that has kind-of made him a pretty miserable human being that made him succeed? Looking back, she should be embarrassed about claiming Roger Clemens' mindset was what it took for him to succeed. At least she didn't include Lance Armstrong. And her take on the corporate world is strange. The way CEOs were rewarded during the time period she writes about had to do with increasing share holder value immediately. Mindset has nothing to do with it. In hindsight, her praise of Circuit City and GE's Jack Welch doesn't look so good today. This totally buys into the myth of ""you can be whatever you want to be if you try hard enough.""  "
179,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26683448-mohammed-h,5,"One of the most important books I have read. I watched my entire life and how I reacted to school, sports, arts, relationships and finally my business. I was shocked to know that I had a fixed mind set in my relationships, school and had a growth mind set to sports. Now I constantly ask myself and probe my brain for reactions. This book will change you and change people around you. Its infectious. Its important for your life, work and kids. I could not recommend a more important book to read."
180,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,1,"It's one thing to tell people their brains are like muscles. But the author pumps up that analogy until it explodes. Michael Jordan had to practice really really hard before he became a great basketball player. OK. But if he were 5 feet tall, it would not matter how hard he practiced; he would never have been an NBA MVP superstar. Yet the author writes ""Can anyone do anything? I don't really know."" Seriously!? That is literally farcical.http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-liv...This book has glowing reviews from reputable sources and positions the author as ""one of the world's leading researchers"" in psychology. So I'm holding it to a high standard. The author mentions Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and claims that ""Mindsets go further."" CBT is supported by numerous clinical trials. Where is there similarly rigorous evidence for a benefit from Mindsets? I could not find it in the book. I think there are better books covering the same area.

182,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78108898-exitgirl05,4,"Even if you think you know everything there is to know regarding mind, learning and developing, read this book. It's not the theory itself. Dr Carol Dweck offers examples of everyday situations in which every human finds himself. How we cope with professional challenges, parenting, relationships... It will make you think and it will surely give you a whole new perspective on learning process. It will help you become not smarter, but hungrier for knowledge. "
183,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"The big idea of the book is that we can divide people into 2 groups: 1st group has a fixed mindset believing that the qualities they posses are carved in stone. Characteristics such as intelligence, personality, and creativity are fixed traits, rather than something that can be developed. 2nd group has a growth mindset coming from a belief that our basic qualities are things we can cultivate through effort. Group 2 understands that people differ greatly – in aptitude, talents, interests, temperaments etc... but everyone can change and grow through application and experience. The book also goes deep into implications of each belief and points out some basic mistakes that teachers, managers and parents make in their every day life which forces those they influence into a fixed mindset. I love reading about success and this book instantly turned into one of my favorites on the topic, the mindset concept is absolutely critical to understand and I would highly recommend you to read this book!"
184,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5079848-amina,2,"2.5☆First, the concept was good, the first chapters were great but then the I found the book to be very repetitive, it could have been written in about 150 pages, and a little bit judgmental, sometimes even a bit hard on the people with the fixed mindset."
185,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9846570-leah,5,"Marking as one of my favourite self help/personal development books!!!I got so much from this book and it's permanently impacted my life. It was slightly repetitive but it was just really zoning in on the points.This is definitely a re-read so that I can take notes and study it more.Just off the top of my head here are some of my take aways:- Be growth-minded not fixed-minded. Fixed minded is when you believe people were born with innate talents and skills and they can't develop/learn/grow. While the growth mind set is about becoming anything or anyone you want and learning and growing into the person you want to be.- Every human is born into a set of genetic code from their parents and has experiences which can or need not define them. You can change how you act and the decisions you make if you want to, it will just take some effort and work- Lots of great information on how to raise your children in this book. How certain praises actuakly do harm instead of your intended good praise. Like saying ""Oh wow Billy you got 100% on your test? That means you made no mistakes that's great! You're so smart."" This instill fear into Billy's mind that he should try his best not to make mistakes in the future or else he will not be ""smart."" And children feed off of the praise their parents give them so this is so crucial. It's better to talk about their effort instead of judging them. Instead say "" Oh wow Billy you got 100% on your test? You must have worked really hard and studied, I'm so proud of your efforts.""- Shyness was also an interesting aspect of this book because if you are a shy person that basically means that you are more so fixed-minded because you find judgement of other people important to you. If you were growth minded then you would focus n working on your shyness and uncomfortableness to improve yourself instead of just defining yourself as shy and that's the end of it.- When you are raised by judgemental family it can influence you to become fixed-minded.Carol S. Dweck is a smart cookie, I look forward to her future publications ;)""the courage to be open—to welcome change and new ideas regardless of their source. Real self-confidence is not reflected in a title, an expensive suit, a fancy car, or a series of acquisitions. It is reflected in your mindset: your readiness to grow."""""
186,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10400867,2,"The idea of having a growth mindset isn’t revolutionary, however, just like any good self-help book, it focuses on a specific trait, repositions its importance, and expands its application.The idea of “growth mindset” is insightful and impactful. Once integrated within the mindset of an individual, relationship or organization, the applications become limitless. The main idea of the book:""Every one of us should believe that our basic qualities are things we can cultivate through effort. Yes, people differ greatly but everyone can change and grow through application and experience""As a result, we should change the way we look at any past set back, current challenge, or future perceived distasteful experience. We should think about and approach them as learning opportunities. Thinking of them in such away: a) increases our willingness to be exposed to challenging situations, and b) increases the learning, and thus, our development as individuals. All this will result, in continuous incremental learnings as time passes by.The idea isn’t just about changing the way you think, but it’s about making this way of thinking a habit. This habit, will “convert” any belief about oneself limits to a narrative about “learning opportunities”The author then spends a good 70% of the book showing how this is applied in different situations (teachers, spouses, workplace, and sports).The verdict:•	The book delivers a short, simple, self-evident yet important truth that can be delivered in an article or 4 pages max. The additional 270 pages was pure waste. Too repetitive. •	The author is ‘too’ in love with her theory, she tries to attribute all human achievements to it. She oversells it in my opinion.•	The examples she gives are too polarized, too ideal. She portrays people with fixed mindset in a stereotypical shallow way showing them as morons. I really did not like that about the book"
187,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239658-karen-chung,4,"This book has one relatively simple message that is repeated over and over again in many different forms throughout the narrative: that we need to approach everything in life not with a fixed mindset - i.e. that people are either born artists, athletes, good students, or whatever, or they are not - but with a ""growth"" mindset, i.e. that we are highly malleable, and achieve through effort, not just by happening to be talented. Due to its repetitiveness, which sets in very early in the book, I originally planned to give it only three stars. But the message is an extremely important one, and the illustrative anecdotes are interesting and worth reading, thus the fourth star. "
188,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8460201-karen,3,"The idea of a ""growth mindset"" is a simple one, but quite profound for many people who have grown up believing that talents and abilities are ""fixed"". A growth mindset is possessed by those who believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.Not sure where you sit? You can take a questionnaire here: https://mindsetonline.com/testyourmin...Because it is such a simple concept, I found the book a bit repetitive and I think it could have benefited from more around how to develop and change your fixed mindset, rather than continually trying to prove why having a growth mindset is better.I recommend this book to anyone interested in self development, who is a teacher/trainer, or has children!"
189,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38829282-nicholas-shaw,1,"How in the name of hell is this book rated so highly!? The central message is clearly that you should adopt the growth mindset if you wish to grow and improve at basically anything in life. If you have the fixed mindset you seem to believe you're stuck with what you've got, much frustration and general failure ensues.I can't imagine anyone arguing against hard work and effort to get anywhere in life but how is this book several hundred pages? Save yourself the effort and watch the TED talk at most if this summary isn't enough for you."
190,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11410080-rebecca,4,"Any book that helps you develop a new way to process failure, and a new way to learn and grow, is a book worth reading. I've already been telling everyone about the growth mindset, and I only just finished reading this. I wish everyone knew how to access and nourish their growth mindset, and I'm glad to start the journey towards my potential. Get outta here fixed mindset! This is the first ""self-help"" book I've ever read, and now I'm sad I didn't read it sooner. I highly recommend this."
191,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8164155-diana,5,I really enjoyed reading this awesome book. I delayed my reading a lot and wish that I could have read the book with the same enthusiasm from beginning to end. It was a little too much information for me but it was worth reading the whole book. I loved it! Will definitely go back to it in a few months to learn more from it. ;)

193,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23841736-sarah,5,This book was recommended to me by one of my jiujitsu instructors. I resisted because I'm not a fan of the self-help genre but I ended up really loving it. It's also helping me to understand a frustrating situation at work.This was excellent and very helpful.
194,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1128267-jason,0,"My dad had been talking about this book, so when we went to visit him and I saw it on his desk I started reading it. It made sense right away and was easy to get into. Your mindset (either a growth mindset or a fixed mindset) determines how you relate to your abilities and experiences in school, business, relationships, and sports (those are the areas she covers). I could see myself in both of the mindsets she described, and I think they're a useful tool for making sense of places where I struggle. They offer a way to organize a response. I have a sense of the freedom in the growth mindset: nothing sticks to you because you don't identify with the results; you're here to learn and grow, so fear and anger and results don't have such a grip on you. I picture someone loose in a stream of events, like a slippery fish. But it's a learning stream. It's funny, though. I feel like I need a break from these kinds of books: idea books to help you make something work, to get better at something. Maybe the Joker's monologues in The Dark Knight had an effect on me. (I saw it by myself late at night, which is the best time to come out of a movie.) I kind of liked them. I thought they were the best of their kind. Something like, ""They're all schemers . . ."" and he wants to disrupt it, subvert it, hold it up for its ridiculousness. This isn't exactly a schemer book, but it's definitely an aiming at success book (""success"" is in the sub-title). Ways to succeed rely on a simplification of what's going on. It's the only way to create a model to use to work with life, but I get tired of it eventually. I've read a lot of good ones this summer, though. I guess I'm ready to put my new tools to use. I don't need anymore new tools right now, thank you. I feel like I'm ready for Handke again. And maybe Philip Dick. I want to read Ubik. "
195,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13852634-alan-bevan,2,"I struggled to rate this book. It offers a single gem of a concept - perhaps not particularly original but nevertheless really important. And that gem is that how we think about ourselves can make all the difference. Do we see ourselves to have a fixed capacity or do we have a growth mindset? It reminded me of my Dad who consistently frustrated me by never trying anything new on the grounds that he was not the sort of person who did X. He genuinely seemed to believe he was not free to choose. He didn't see life as an opportunity to learn. This book offers a language to describe the alternative that he never saw, the 'growth mindset'.But that was it really for the book. That single concept is padded with countless (and to me tedious) anecdotes but it offered nothing more other than superficially considering the role of parents and teachers in relation to the development of mindsets.So yes, it contains a really important concept and I would have liked my father to read it but I reckon it would have more impact if condensed to a pithy 1000 word essay. But then there wouldn't be book to sell which would obviously be contrary to Dweck's mindset.And lastly, I am stunned that the publishers can get away with the sub heading, 'The new Psychology of Success'. New? Really?"
196,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5977628-kat,2,"I found this book a little frustrating. It's overall message is good, it explores the differences between having a fixed and growth mindset. A fixed mindset believes your intelligence, skills, talent, and life are all basically set in stone and can't be improved. A growth mindset believes that you can always become smarter or more skilled with effort, and views criticism as motivation to improve instead of a crushing blow. It's definitely an important lesson that everyone should learn. My frustration is mostly in how the lesson is delivered, and that is mostly though stories about grade school student, athletes, and CEOs. There is a lot of hand wringing about the folly of complementing your kids. The author tells a story of how she accidentally told her husband he was brilliant and gasped in horror at her mistake. There is praise of sleazy CEOs who've ""made it"" (while screwing their employees and the environment) and Harvey Weinstein of all people (though this was published in 2009). It just feels a little silly and like every other self help book that leans on stories about football players and men who realized their business might do better if their weren't such giant a**holes. There are better self improvement books out there."
197,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14858185-steven,2,"Disappointing and repetitive pop-psychology book based on 1 idea that seems dubious from anecdotal experience. The author talks about the ""fixed mindset"" those who believe that traits like intelligence, personality, sports ability etc. are largely determined genetically and those who believe in the ""growth mindset"" that all traits can be fundamentally changed with enough effort, with the growth mindset being the path to success.This is a false dichotomy. It's not an either/or (growth vs fixed mindset) but a continuum. We are part genetically determined, part environmentally determined. The assertion that only those with the growth mindset achieve their potential seems false and I'd like to see Dweck's data. Those who believe they're innately gifted in a specific trait, usually work and practice long and hard to perfect their skills in their particular talents, while ignoring the areas they are weak in. Dweck's handful of examples of people succeeding in an area they were initially believed to have little talent in hardly proves her thesis that one can do anything if one has the right mindset. "
198,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16612969-andrea,5,"In the book Mindset, by Carol Dweck, the author explains the fixed mindset and offers tips to help you move toward a more growth oriented mindset. A person with a fixed mindset believes that their intelligence, skills, and abilities are static and there is nothing they can do change that. Someone with a growth mindset believes that learning is a lifelong process. In the book, Dr Dweck used athlete John McEnroe as an example of someone with a fixed mindset. McEnroe believed that he was the best tennis player and if he lost a match, it was always due to some outside force that was beyond his control. He even rooted for his friends and family to lose their matches, so he could be the best in his circle. He never practiced, because he believed that someone with natural talent shouldn't require practice. On the opposite side of the spectrum, you have Michael Jordan. He was arguably one the greatest basketball players of all time, but he was cut from his high school team. With a lot of effort, time, and practice, he went on to the NBA. If you embrace a growth mindset, skills can be developed over time."
199,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34391111-solomon-mark,5,"Mindset is Excellent book. Carol Dweck explains about two types of Mindsets fixed and growth mindset. According to the author every person is having either Fixed or Growth mindset. Fixed mindset individuals perceives that Intelligent is unchangeable and static. Growth mindset individuals perceives that Intelligent can be changed and improved. Fixed mindset people avoid challenges, give-up when they encounters obstacles, they won’t take effort to make things better, they will avoid useful negative feedback from others and they won’t learn from their mistakes.Growth mindset people will be having desire to learn, never avoid challenges, learn from mistakes, they will take every effort to make things better, they will take valuable information from criticism and negative feedback.We have to learn from our mistakes and change ourself to improving our Intelligent and potential. In this book author gives many interesting examples on both fixed and growth mindsets. Every parent and individual should read this book. "
200,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15605093-hestia-istiviani,5,"THIS BOOK IS TOO AWESOME!I learn so many things about how powerful our mindset is. It not only talk about the definition on mindset, but also gives many applications on business, relationship, leadership, parenting, teaching, and coaching. I guess you will as surprised as me because we feel like we have walked to right pathway: to be proud of your almamater, to determine our skills instead of promoting ourselves to new things you have could learn from.I can't get over it. In the middle of reading, I listened to her podcasts, watched her TEDx Talks & interviews. Reading this book reminds me to others aligned book such as Sir Ken Robinson's Creative School, Tom Kelley's Creative Confidence, Susan Cain's Quite, and surprisingly Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In. It also makes me want to read Steven Levitt's Freakonomics and Arianna Huffington's Thrive. The conclusion is you have to start reading this book."
201,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/990216-elizabeth,3,"This has some interesting points about having a fixed mindset and a more flexible mindset, but there isn't enough depth to the anecdotes. I do recommend reading the chapter for teachers and parents as there are useful tips about motivating kids to learn and to change their own mindset. All in all, I would refer to the chart in the back as a shortcut for the information. "
202,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32415499-elizabeth-keatley,4,"This has been such an eye opening read. It will change not only how I conduct my daily personal life, but also how I praise and challenge my students."
203,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,4,"This book changed my perspective on abilities and potential. Dweck shows how to move from the fixed mindset (the belief that human qualities and abilities are set and essentially unalterable) to the growth mindset (the belief that those qualities and abilities can be cultivated through effort). Dweck, a psychologist, based the book on solid scientific research, not the pseudoscientific mystical nonsense often found in ""success psychology"" books. Dweck applies the mindsets to sports, business leadership, relationships, parenting, and teaching. The book has far too many anecdotes for my taste; it’s full of specific examples of famous CEOs and athletes, as well as ordinary people.My favorite parts were those that advised how to talk to children about their successes and failures. Intellectually, I agree with Dweck’s advice that you should praise effort, not ability, and that when a child does something quickly, you should challenge rather than praise them, but that can be emotionally difficult for a parent to do. I also found the section on bullying interesting, because I was bullied for most of my school years. I skimmed the many examples from sports, because I’m generally disinterested in sports.I read this because it was referred to in several books, articles, and podcasts about business and/or web design.The MindsetsFixed Mindset• Your qualities and intelligence are very basic to you and can’t change very much. If you have the ability, you’ll do well. If you don’t, you won’t.• Characteristics: passing up chances to learn, feeling labeled by a failure, getting discouraged when something requires effort.• Framework: judge and be judged; ""You have permanent traits and I'm judging them.""Growth Mindset• No matter your qualities and intelligence, you can always change substantially. Abilities can be cultivated and improved.• Characteristics: taking challenges, learning from failure, continuing effort.• Framework: learn and help learn; ""You are a developing person and I am interested in your development.""The Truth About Ability and Accomplishment• In the growth mindset, abilities can be cultivated, but that doesn’t mean that everything can or should be changed.• Benjamin Bloom, after 40 years of research on school learning, said, “What any person in the world can learn, almost all persons can learn, if provided with the appropriate prior and current conditions of learning.”• “Just because some people can do something with little or no training, it doesn’t mean that others can’t do it (and sometimes do it even better) with training.”• People (especially children) do better when praised for effort than ability.Relationships: Mindsets in Love (Or Not)• The fixed mindset believes that successful relationships don’t require effort. The growth mindset believes that they do.Bullying• To reduce bullying, change the school mindset.• Fight the atmosphere of judgement and create one of collaboration and self-improvement.• Empower bystanders to help victims.• Enforce discipline, but don’t judge the bully as a person. Make them feel liked and welcomed at school.• Praise the bully’s steps in the right direction (staying out of fighting, getting along with others). Praise efforts, not the person.• Teachers can point a bully away from judgment and towards compassion by not implying they’re a bad person, showing respect, and asking for the bully’s advice for helping bullied students.Parents, Teachers, and Coaches: Where Do Mindsets Come From?• Give children the growth-mindset message, “You are a developing person and I am interested in your development,” not the fixed-mindset message, “You have permanent traits and I’m judging them.”• Praising children’s intelligence harms motivation and performance. It gives a temporary boost, but if they run into difficulty, they’ll think failure means they’re dumb. Instead, praise for the growth-oriented process: what they accomplish through practice, study, persistence, strategy.• Don’t talk about others in terms of fixed judgments in front of children, or they’ll think you use the same fixed judgments on them.• When children do something quickly and perfectly, don’t praise their speed and perfection. Instead, say it was too easy and give them a challenge.• When a child fails, tell them you understand their disappointment, but they’ll need to work harder.• Use misbehavior as an occasion for teaching, not judgment.• When teachers judge, students will sabotage the teacher by not trying. When teachers care for students and show them school is a way to grow their minds, they try.Changing Mindsets: A WorkshopAs a family, talk about your efforts, strategies, setbacks, and learning every day."
204,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35853271-sonja,3,3.5 out of 5 stars.:: buddy read with my eldest brother[short review to come]
205,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4177031-troy-blackford,4,"Original '3-star' Review (3/11/14) [see update below]:This was a book of good ideas that felt rather stretched out. This is probably because it is based on the author's original newspaper article, which became unexpectedly successful. There is a definite vibe of 'let's cash in on this article's success by stretching it out into a book-length work' that plagues the first third of Mindset. But, if you can stick out the abysmal first part, which seeks to assure readers the ideas contained in the book are helpful with a brutal series of 'A woman in Topeka e-mailed me that she tried the ideas in this book, and SHE LOVED IT!' type statements (along with the inverse: 'A man in Fort Wayne failed to use these ideas, and HE'S MISERABLE!'), the book which follows does indeed have some great points. This is well worth thinking about.I chalk it up to the state of the modern publishing industry that Carol Dweck was unable to print a book a third or maybe half the length of this, as 'that's not what customers want to buy,' because I'm sure I would have preferred a leaner, meaner, more toned version of this book. But if you can sit out the filler, this book is full of great points that employees/employers, teachers, parents, and people learning any skill will do well to ponder.UPDATE (10/5/15): This is over a year after I've read this book, and I've seen Dr. Dweck's research mentioned countless times since. I didn't greatly appreciate, at the time of my prior review, that Dr. Dweck is a researcher, and wrote this book sharing her findings for popular consumption. I can certainly see how pressure to stretch her findings into a book-length work led to the deficiencies I noted earlier, but I very much appreciate the value of the work she did and feel my earlier rating of 'three stars' is simply not fair. Now that I have a better understanding of what this work is meant to be and who Dr. Carol Dweck is, I am adding a star."
206,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2202561-becky,4,"The premise of this book sounds pretty ""duh."" I ran across its title in several different contexts before I decided that if such dissimilar people swear by it, it can't be as obvious as it sounds. And its implications are wide-ranging and interesting. It made me see the world in a new way. It's entertaining and an easy read, and would be especially valuable to teachers, parents, and coaches, but really applies to pretty much everybody. Instead of subtitling it ""The New Psychology of Success"" (eyeroll, please) it could have been called ""What Great Teachers Know."" I didn't read quite all the way to the end, but something I felt was missing from this book is that few people have an overall ""fixed mindset"" or an overall ""growth mindset."" As I think about people I know, most have different mindsets for each realm of their life. Some people have an academic or career growth mindset but a fixed relationship or athletics mindset, for example. Since most people have a growth mindset in at least one area, learning to expand those attitudes into other areas seems like a useful path toward developing an advantageous mindset where it's lacking. And in fact, I think that's often what happens. A kid does badly in school and his parents put him in martial arts classes; not only does he love it, but he starts getting better grades and getting along with his friends better too. As he learns how to achieve in one area of his life, he begins to apply those same achievement skills to other areas as well. Like any other summary of this book, this sounds tediously obvious, but the implications are deeper than a summary can convey. "
207,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6317928-asra-syed,3,"I do agree with Carol Dweck's idea of mindsets as fixed or growth and how these mindsets can be limiting or beneficial. I've struggled with explaining to students how ""smart"" isn't something you are, and that instead you can work toward getting smarter and more capable, so Dweck's concepts will help with that. But I probably could have read an article about this or watched a video instead of reading this entire book. It gets incredibly redundant and she seems to take the ideas a little too far, attributing the mindsets to all sorts of famous accomplished people, which gets to be a stretch. Plus, she really seems to oversimplify or misunderstand the concept of depression (not that I can claim to really understand the mental illness myself, but I do know that it's a medical/chemical/emotional condition that can't just be fixed by changing one's mindset). I kept reading hoping that the book would provide concrete ways to work on changing mindsets instead of just redundancy proving that her ideas of these two mindsets it correct, but I guess you have to go pay for her Brainology material for that. Of course you do. "
208,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9522471-brian,1,"Very simplistic. Binary oppositions always are. Her use of athletes is very problematic. Was it Jordan's growth mindset or his fierce desire to win at all costs that has kind-of made him a pretty miserable human being that made him succeed? Looking back, she should be embarrassed about claiming Roger Clemens' mindset was what it took for him to succeed. At least she didn't include Lance Armstrong. And her take on the corporate world is strange. The way CEOs were rewarded during the time period she writes about had to do with increasing share holder value immediately. Mindset has nothing to do with it. In hindsight, her praise of Circuit City and GE's Jack Welch doesn't look so good today. This totally buys into the myth of ""you can be whatever you want to be if you try hard enough.""  "
209,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26683448-mohammed-h,5,"One of the most important books I have read. I watched my entire life and how I reacted to school, sports, arts, relationships and finally my business. I was shocked to know that I had a fixed mind set in my relationships, school and had a growth mind set to sports. Now I constantly ask myself and probe my brain for reactions. This book will change you and change people around you. Its infectious. Its important for your life, work and kids. I could not recommend a more important book to read."
210,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,1,"It's one thing to tell people their brains are like muscles. But the author pumps up that analogy until it explodes. Michael Jordan had to practice really really hard before he became a great basketball player. OK. But if he were 5 feet tall, it would not matter how hard he practiced; he would never have been an NBA MVP superstar. Yet the author writes ""Can anyone do anything? I don't really know."" Seriously!? That is literally farcical.http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-liv...This book has glowing reviews from reputable sources and positions the author as ""one of the world's leading researchers"" in psychology. So I'm holding it to a high standard. The author mentions Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and claims that ""Mindsets go further."" CBT is supported by numerous clinical trials. Where is there similarly rigorous evidence for a benefit from Mindsets? I could not find it in the book. I think there are better books covering the same area.

212,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78108898-exitgirl05,4,"Even if you think you know everything there is to know regarding mind, learning and developing, read this book. It's not the theory itself. Dr Carol Dweck offers examples of everyday situations in which every human finds himself. How we cope with professional challenges, parenting, relationships... It will make you think and it will surely give you a whole new perspective on learning process. It will help you become not smarter, but hungrier for knowledge. "
213,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"The big idea of the book is that we can divide people into 2 groups: 1st group has a fixed mindset believing that the qualities they posses are carved in stone. Characteristics such as intelligence, personality, and creativity are fixed traits, rather than something that can be developed. 2nd group has a growth mindset coming from a belief that our basic qualities are things we can cultivate through effort. Group 2 understands that people differ greatly – in aptitude, talents, interests, temperaments etc... but everyone can change and grow through application and experience. The book also goes deep into implications of each belief and points out some basic mistakes that teachers, managers and parents make in their every day life which forces those they influence into a fixed mindset. I love reading about success and this book instantly turned into one of my favorites on the topic, the mindset concept is absolutely critical to understand and I would highly recommend you to read this book!"
214,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5079848-amina,2,"2.5☆First, the concept was good, the first chapters were great but then the I found the book to be very repetitive, it could have been written in about 150 pages, and a little bit judgmental, sometimes even a bit hard on the people with the fixed mindset."
215,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9846570-leah,5,"Marking as one of my favourite self help/personal development books!!!I got so much from this book and it's permanently impacted my life. It was slightly repetitive but it was just really zoning in on the points.This is definitely a re-read so that I can take notes and study it more.Just off the top of my head here are some of my take aways:- Be growth-minded not fixed-minded. Fixed minded is when you believe people were born with innate talents and skills and they can't develop/learn/grow. While the growth mind set is about becoming anything or anyone you want and learning and growing into the person you want to be.- Every human is born into a set of genetic code from their parents and has experiences which can or need not define them. You can change how you act and the decisions you make if you want to, it will just take some effort and work- Lots of great information on how to raise your children in this book. How certain praises actuakly do harm instead of your intended good praise. Like saying ""Oh wow Billy you got 100% on your test? That means you made no mistakes that's great! You're so smart."" This instill fear into Billy's mind that he should try his best not to make mistakes in the future or else he will not be ""smart."" And children feed off of the praise their parents give them so this is so crucial. It's better to talk about their effort instead of judging them. Instead say "" Oh wow Billy you got 100% on your test? You must have worked really hard and studied, I'm so proud of your efforts.""- Shyness was also an interesting aspect of this book because if you are a shy person that basically means that you are more so fixed-minded because you find judgement of other people important to you. If you were growth minded then you would focus n working on your shyness and uncomfortableness to improve yourself instead of just defining yourself as shy and that's the end of it.- When you are raised by judgemental family it can influence you to become fixed-minded.Carol S. Dweck is a smart cookie, I look forward to her future publications ;)""the courage to be open—to welcome change and new ideas regardless of their source. Real self-confidence is not reflected in a title, an expensive suit, a fancy car, or a series of acquisitions. It is reflected in your mindset: your readiness to grow."""""
216,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10400867,2,"The idea of having a growth mindset isn’t revolutionary, however, just like any good self-help book, it focuses on a specific trait, repositions its importance, and expands its application.The idea of “growth mindset” is insightful and impactful. Once integrated within the mindset of an individual, relationship or organization, the applications become limitless. The main idea of the book:""Every one of us should believe that our basic qualities are things we can cultivate through effort. Yes, people differ greatly but everyone can change and grow through application and experience""As a result, we should change the way we look at any past set back, current challenge, or future perceived distasteful experience. We should think about and approach them as learning opportunities. Thinking of them in such away: a) increases our willingness to be exposed to challenging situations, and b) increases the learning, and thus, our development as individuals. All this will result, in continuous incremental learnings as time passes by.The idea isn’t just about changing the way you think, but it’s about making this way of thinking a habit. This habit, will “convert” any belief about oneself limits to a narrative about “learning opportunities”The author then spends a good 70% of the book showing how this is applied in different situations (teachers, spouses, workplace, and sports).The verdict:•	The book delivers a short, simple, self-evident yet important truth that can be delivered in an article or 4 pages max. The additional 270 pages was pure waste. Too repetitive. •	The author is ‘too’ in love with her theory, she tries to attribute all human achievements to it. She oversells it in my opinion.•	The examples she gives are too polarized, too ideal. She portrays people with fixed mindset in a stereotypical shallow way showing them as morons. I really did not like that about the book"
217,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239658-karen-chung,4,"This book has one relatively simple message that is repeated over and over again in many different forms throughout the narrative: that we need to approach everything in life not with a fixed mindset - i.e. that people are either born artists, athletes, good students, or whatever, or they are not - but with a ""growth"" mindset, i.e. that we are highly malleable, and achieve through effort, not just by happening to be talented. Due to its repetitiveness, which sets in very early in the book, I originally planned to give it only three stars. But the message is an extremely important one, and the illustrative anecdotes are interesting and worth reading, thus the fourth star. "
218,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8460201-karen,3,"The idea of a ""growth mindset"" is a simple one, but quite profound for many people who have grown up believing that talents and abilities are ""fixed"". A growth mindset is possessed by those who believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.Not sure where you sit? You can take a questionnaire here: https://mindsetonline.com/testyourmin...Because it is such a simple concept, I found the book a bit repetitive and I think it could have benefited from more around how to develop and change your fixed mindset, rather than continually trying to prove why having a growth mindset is better.I recommend this book to anyone interested in self development, who is a teacher/trainer, or has children!"
219,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38829282-nicholas-shaw,1,"How in the name of hell is this book rated so highly!? The central message is clearly that you should adopt the growth mindset if you wish to grow and improve at basically anything in life. If you have the fixed mindset you seem to believe you're stuck with what you've got, much frustration and general failure ensues.I can't imagine anyone arguing against hard work and effort to get anywhere in life but how is this book several hundred pages? Save yourself the effort and watch the TED talk at most if this summary isn't enough for you."
220,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11410080-rebecca,4,"Any book that helps you develop a new way to process failure, and a new way to learn and grow, is a book worth reading. I've already been telling everyone about the growth mindset, and I only just finished reading this. I wish everyone knew how to access and nourish their growth mindset, and I'm glad to start the journey towards my potential. Get outta here fixed mindset! This is the first ""self-help"" book I've ever read, and now I'm sad I didn't read it sooner. I highly recommend this."
221,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8164155-diana,5,I really enjoyed reading this awesome book. I delayed my reading a lot and wish that I could have read the book with the same enthusiasm from beginning to end. It was a little too much information for me but it was worth reading the whole book. I loved it! Will definitely go back to it in a few months to learn more from it. ;)

223,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23841736-sarah,5,This book was recommended to me by one of my jiujitsu instructors. I resisted because I'm not a fan of the self-help genre but I ended up really loving it. It's also helping me to understand a frustrating situation at work.This was excellent and very helpful.
224,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1128267-jason,0,"My dad had been talking about this book, so when we went to visit him and I saw it on his desk I started reading it. It made sense right away and was easy to get into. Your mindset (either a growth mindset or a fixed mindset) determines how you relate to your abilities and experiences in school, business, relationships, and sports (those are the areas she covers). I could see myself in both of the mindsets she described, and I think they're a useful tool for making sense of places where I struggle. They offer a way to organize a response. I have a sense of the freedom in the growth mindset: nothing sticks to you because you don't identify with the results; you're here to learn and grow, so fear and anger and results don't have such a grip on you. I picture someone loose in a stream of events, like a slippery fish. But it's a learning stream. It's funny, though. I feel like I need a break from these kinds of books: idea books to help you make something work, to get better at something. Maybe the Joker's monologues in The Dark Knight had an effect on me. (I saw it by myself late at night, which is the best time to come out of a movie.) I kind of liked them. I thought they were the best of their kind. Something like, ""They're all schemers . . ."" and he wants to disrupt it, subvert it, hold it up for its ridiculousness. This isn't exactly a schemer book, but it's definitely an aiming at success book (""success"" is in the sub-title). Ways to succeed rely on a simplification of what's going on. It's the only way to create a model to use to work with life, but I get tired of it eventually. I've read a lot of good ones this summer, though. I guess I'm ready to put my new tools to use. I don't need anymore new tools right now, thank you. I feel like I'm ready for Handke again. And maybe Philip Dick. I want to read Ubik. "
225,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13852634-alan-bevan,2,"I struggled to rate this book. It offers a single gem of a concept - perhaps not particularly original but nevertheless really important. And that gem is that how we think about ourselves can make all the difference. Do we see ourselves to have a fixed capacity or do we have a growth mindset? It reminded me of my Dad who consistently frustrated me by never trying anything new on the grounds that he was not the sort of person who did X. He genuinely seemed to believe he was not free to choose. He didn't see life as an opportunity to learn. This book offers a language to describe the alternative that he never saw, the 'growth mindset'.But that was it really for the book. That single concept is padded with countless (and to me tedious) anecdotes but it offered nothing more other than superficially considering the role of parents and teachers in relation to the development of mindsets.So yes, it contains a really important concept and I would have liked my father to read it but I reckon it would have more impact if condensed to a pithy 1000 word essay. But then there wouldn't be book to sell which would obviously be contrary to Dweck's mindset.And lastly, I am stunned that the publishers can get away with the sub heading, 'The new Psychology of Success'. New? Really?"
226,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5977628-kat,2,"I found this book a little frustrating. It's overall message is good, it explores the differences between having a fixed and growth mindset. A fixed mindset believes your intelligence, skills, talent, and life are all basically set in stone and can't be improved. A growth mindset believes that you can always become smarter or more skilled with effort, and views criticism as motivation to improve instead of a crushing blow. It's definitely an important lesson that everyone should learn. My frustration is mostly in how the lesson is delivered, and that is mostly though stories about grade school student, athletes, and CEOs. There is a lot of hand wringing about the folly of complementing your kids. The author tells a story of how she accidentally told her husband he was brilliant and gasped in horror at her mistake. There is praise of sleazy CEOs who've ""made it"" (while screwing their employees and the environment) and Harvey Weinstein of all people (though this was published in 2009). It just feels a little silly and like every other self help book that leans on stories about football players and men who realized their business might do better if their weren't such giant a**holes. There are better self improvement books out there."
227,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14858185-steven,2,"Disappointing and repetitive pop-psychology book based on 1 idea that seems dubious from anecdotal experience. The author talks about the ""fixed mindset"" those who believe that traits like intelligence, personality, sports ability etc. are largely determined genetically and those who believe in the ""growth mindset"" that all traits can be fundamentally changed with enough effort, with the growth mindset being the path to success.This is a false dichotomy. It's not an either/or (growth vs fixed mindset) but a continuum. We are part genetically determined, part environmentally determined. The assertion that only those with the growth mindset achieve their potential seems false and I'd like to see Dweck's data. Those who believe they're innately gifted in a specific trait, usually work and practice long and hard to perfect their skills in their particular talents, while ignoring the areas they are weak in. Dweck's handful of examples of people succeeding in an area they were initially believed to have little talent in hardly proves her thesis that one can do anything if one has the right mindset. "
228,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16612969-andrea,5,"In the book Mindset, by Carol Dweck, the author explains the fixed mindset and offers tips to help you move toward a more growth oriented mindset. A person with a fixed mindset believes that their intelligence, skills, and abilities are static and there is nothing they can do change that. Someone with a growth mindset believes that learning is a lifelong process. In the book, Dr Dweck used athlete John McEnroe as an example of someone with a fixed mindset. McEnroe believed that he was the best tennis player and if he lost a match, it was always due to some outside force that was beyond his control. He even rooted for his friends and family to lose their matches, so he could be the best in his circle. He never practiced, because he believed that someone with natural talent shouldn't require practice. On the opposite side of the spectrum, you have Michael Jordan. He was arguably one the greatest basketball players of all time, but he was cut from his high school team. With a lot of effort, time, and practice, he went on to the NBA. If you embrace a growth mindset, skills can be developed over time."
229,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34391111-solomon-mark,5,"Mindset is Excellent book. Carol Dweck explains about two types of Mindsets fixed and growth mindset. According to the author every person is having either Fixed or Growth mindset. Fixed mindset individuals perceives that Intelligent is unchangeable and static. Growth mindset individuals perceives that Intelligent can be changed and improved. Fixed mindset people avoid challenges, give-up when they encounters obstacles, they won’t take effort to make things better, they will avoid useful negative feedback from others and they won’t learn from their mistakes.Growth mindset people will be having desire to learn, never avoid challenges, learn from mistakes, they will take every effort to make things better, they will take valuable information from criticism and negative feedback.We have to learn from our mistakes and change ourself to improving our Intelligent and potential. In this book author gives many interesting examples on both fixed and growth mindsets. Every parent and individual should read this book. "
230,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15605093-hestia-istiviani,5,"THIS BOOK IS TOO AWESOME!I learn so many things about how powerful our mindset is. It not only talk about the definition on mindset, but also gives many applications on business, relationship, leadership, parenting, teaching, and coaching. I guess you will as surprised as me because we feel like we have walked to right pathway: to be proud of your almamater, to determine our skills instead of promoting ourselves to new things you have could learn from.I can't get over it. In the middle of reading, I listened to her podcasts, watched her TEDx Talks & interviews. Reading this book reminds me to others aligned book such as Sir Ken Robinson's Creative School, Tom Kelley's Creative Confidence, Susan Cain's Quite, and surprisingly Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In. It also makes me want to read Steven Levitt's Freakonomics and Arianna Huffington's Thrive. The conclusion is you have to start reading this book."
231,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/990216-elizabeth,3,"This has some interesting points about having a fixed mindset and a more flexible mindset, but there isn't enough depth to the anecdotes. I do recommend reading the chapter for teachers and parents as there are useful tips about motivating kids to learn and to change their own mindset. All in all, I would refer to the chart in the back as a shortcut for the information. "
232,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32415499-elizabeth-keatley,4,"This has been such an eye opening read. It will change not only how I conduct my daily personal life, but also how I praise and challenge my students."
233,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,4,"This book changed my perspective on abilities and potential. Dweck shows how to move from the fixed mindset (the belief that human qualities and abilities are set and essentially unalterable) to the growth mindset (the belief that those qualities and abilities can be cultivated through effort). Dweck, a psychologist, based the book on solid scientific research, not the pseudoscientific mystical nonsense often found in ""success psychology"" books. Dweck applies the mindsets to sports, business leadership, relationships, parenting, and teaching. The book has far too many anecdotes for my taste; it’s full of specific examples of famous CEOs and athletes, as well as ordinary people.My favorite parts were those that advised how to talk to children about their successes and failures. Intellectually, I agree with Dweck’s advice that you should praise effort, not ability, and that when a child does something quickly, you should challenge rather than praise them, but that can be emotionally difficult for a parent to do. I also found the section on bullying interesting, because I was bullied for most of my school years. I skimmed the many examples from sports, because I’m generally disinterested in sports.I read this because it was referred to in several books, articles, and podcasts about business and/or web design.The MindsetsFixed Mindset• Your qualities and intelligence are very basic to you and can’t change very much. If you have the ability, you’ll do well. If you don’t, you won’t.• Characteristics: passing up chances to learn, feeling labeled by a failure, getting discouraged when something requires effort.• Framework: judge and be judged; ""You have permanent traits and I'm judging them.""Growth Mindset• No matter your qualities and intelligence, you can always change substantially. Abilities can be cultivated and improved.• Characteristics: taking challenges, learning from failure, continuing effort.• Framework: learn and help learn; ""You are a developing person and I am interested in your development.""The Truth About Ability and Accomplishment• In the growth mindset, abilities can be cultivated, but that doesn’t mean that everything can or should be changed.• Benjamin Bloom, after 40 years of research on school learning, said, “What any person in the world can learn, almost all persons can learn, if provided with the appropriate prior and current conditions of learning.”• “Just because some people can do something with little or no training, it doesn’t mean that others can’t do it (and sometimes do it even better) with training.”• People (especially children) do better when praised for effort than ability.Relationships: Mindsets in Love (Or Not)• The fixed mindset believes that successful relationships don’t require effort. The growth mindset believes that they do.Bullying• To reduce bullying, change the school mindset.• Fight the atmosphere of judgement and create one of collaboration and self-improvement.• Empower bystanders to help victims.• Enforce discipline, but don’t judge the bully as a person. Make them feel liked and welcomed at school.• Praise the bully’s steps in the right direction (staying out of fighting, getting along with others). Praise efforts, not the person.• Teachers can point a bully away from judgment and towards compassion by not implying they’re a bad person, showing respect, and asking for the bully’s advice for helping bullied students.Parents, Teachers, and Coaches: Where Do Mindsets Come From?• Give children the growth-mindset message, “You are a developing person and I am interested in your development,” not the fixed-mindset message, “You have permanent traits and I’m judging them.”• Praising children’s intelligence harms motivation and performance. It gives a temporary boost, but if they run into difficulty, they’ll think failure means they’re dumb. Instead, praise for the growth-oriented process: what they accomplish through practice, study, persistence, strategy.• Don’t talk about others in terms of fixed judgments in front of children, or they’ll think you use the same fixed judgments on them.• When children do something quickly and perfectly, don’t praise their speed and perfection. Instead, say it was too easy and give them a challenge.• When a child fails, tell them you understand their disappointment, but they’ll need to work harder.• Use misbehavior as an occasion for teaching, not judgment.• When teachers judge, students will sabotage the teacher by not trying. When teachers care for students and show them school is a way to grow their minds, they try.Changing Mindsets: A WorkshopAs a family, talk about your efforts, strategies, setbacks, and learning every day."
234,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35853271-sonja,3,3.5 out of 5 stars.:: buddy read with my eldest brother[short review to come]
235,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4177031-troy-blackford,4,"Original '3-star' Review (3/11/14) [see update below]:This was a book of good ideas that felt rather stretched out. This is probably because it is based on the author's original newspaper article, which became unexpectedly successful. There is a definite vibe of 'let's cash in on this article's success by stretching it out into a book-length work' that plagues the first third of Mindset. But, if you can stick out the abysmal first part, which seeks to assure readers the ideas contained in the book are helpful with a brutal series of 'A woman in Topeka e-mailed me that she tried the ideas in this book, and SHE LOVED IT!' type statements (along with the inverse: 'A man in Fort Wayne failed to use these ideas, and HE'S MISERABLE!'), the book which follows does indeed have some great points. This is well worth thinking about.I chalk it up to the state of the modern publishing industry that Carol Dweck was unable to print a book a third or maybe half the length of this, as 'that's not what customers want to buy,' because I'm sure I would have preferred a leaner, meaner, more toned version of this book. But if you can sit out the filler, this book is full of great points that employees/employers, teachers, parents, and people learning any skill will do well to ponder.UPDATE (10/5/15): This is over a year after I've read this book, and I've seen Dr. Dweck's research mentioned countless times since. I didn't greatly appreciate, at the time of my prior review, that Dr. Dweck is a researcher, and wrote this book sharing her findings for popular consumption. I can certainly see how pressure to stretch her findings into a book-length work led to the deficiencies I noted earlier, but I very much appreciate the value of the work she did and feel my earlier rating of 'three stars' is simply not fair. Now that I have a better understanding of what this work is meant to be and who Dr. Carol Dweck is, I am adding a star."
236,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2202561-becky,4,"The premise of this book sounds pretty ""duh."" I ran across its title in several different contexts before I decided that if such dissimilar people swear by it, it can't be as obvious as it sounds. And its implications are wide-ranging and interesting. It made me see the world in a new way. It's entertaining and an easy read, and would be especially valuable to teachers, parents, and coaches, but really applies to pretty much everybody. Instead of subtitling it ""The New Psychology of Success"" (eyeroll, please) it could have been called ""What Great Teachers Know."" I didn't read quite all the way to the end, but something I felt was missing from this book is that few people have an overall ""fixed mindset"" or an overall ""growth mindset."" As I think about people I know, most have different mindsets for each realm of their life. Some people have an academic or career growth mindset but a fixed relationship or athletics mindset, for example. Since most people have a growth mindset in at least one area, learning to expand those attitudes into other areas seems like a useful path toward developing an advantageous mindset where it's lacking. And in fact, I think that's often what happens. A kid does badly in school and his parents put him in martial arts classes; not only does he love it, but he starts getting better grades and getting along with his friends better too. As he learns how to achieve in one area of his life, he begins to apply those same achievement skills to other areas as well. Like any other summary of this book, this sounds tediously obvious, but the implications are deeper than a summary can convey. "
237,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6317928-asra-syed,3,"I do agree with Carol Dweck's idea of mindsets as fixed or growth and how these mindsets can be limiting or beneficial. I've struggled with explaining to students how ""smart"" isn't something you are, and that instead you can work toward getting smarter and more capable, so Dweck's concepts will help with that. But I probably could have read an article about this or watched a video instead of reading this entire book. It gets incredibly redundant and she seems to take the ideas a little too far, attributing the mindsets to all sorts of famous accomplished people, which gets to be a stretch. Plus, she really seems to oversimplify or misunderstand the concept of depression (not that I can claim to really understand the mental illness myself, but I do know that it's a medical/chemical/emotional condition that can't just be fixed by changing one's mindset). I kept reading hoping that the book would provide concrete ways to work on changing mindsets instead of just redundancy proving that her ideas of these two mindsets it correct, but I guess you have to go pay for her Brainology material for that. Of course you do. "
238,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9522471-brian,1,"Very simplistic. Binary oppositions always are. Her use of athletes is very problematic. Was it Jordan's growth mindset or his fierce desire to win at all costs that has kind-of made him a pretty miserable human being that made him succeed? Looking back, she should be embarrassed about claiming Roger Clemens' mindset was what it took for him to succeed. At least she didn't include Lance Armstrong. And her take on the corporate world is strange. The way CEOs were rewarded during the time period she writes about had to do with increasing share holder value immediately. Mindset has nothing to do with it. In hindsight, her praise of Circuit City and GE's Jack Welch doesn't look so good today. This totally buys into the myth of ""you can be whatever you want to be if you try hard enough.""  "
239,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26683448-mohammed-h,5,"One of the most important books I have read. I watched my entire life and how I reacted to school, sports, arts, relationships and finally my business. I was shocked to know that I had a fixed mind set in my relationships, school and had a growth mind set to sports. Now I constantly ask myself and probe my brain for reactions. This book will change you and change people around you. Its infectious. Its important for your life, work and kids. I could not recommend a more important book to read."
240,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,1,"It's one thing to tell people their brains are like muscles. But the author pumps up that analogy until it explodes. Michael Jordan had to practice really really hard before he became a great basketball player. OK. But if he were 5 feet tall, it would not matter how hard he practiced; he would never have been an NBA MVP superstar. Yet the author writes ""Can anyone do anything? I don't really know."" Seriously!? That is literally farcical.http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-liv...This book has glowing reviews from reputable sources and positions the author as ""one of the world's leading researchers"" in psychology. So I'm holding it to a high standard. The author mentions Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and claims that ""Mindsets go further."" CBT is supported by numerous clinical trials. Where is there similarly rigorous evidence for a benefit from Mindsets? I could not find it in the book. I think there are better books covering the same area.

242,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78108898-exitgirl05,4,"Even if you think you know everything there is to know regarding mind, learning and developing, read this book. It's not the theory itself. Dr Carol Dweck offers examples of everyday situations in which every human finds himself. How we cope with professional challenges, parenting, relationships... It will make you think and it will surely give you a whole new perspective on learning process. It will help you become not smarter, but hungrier for knowledge. "
243,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"The big idea of the book is that we can divide people into 2 groups: 1st group has a fixed mindset believing that the qualities they posses are carved in stone. Characteristics such as intelligence, personality, and creativity are fixed traits, rather than something that can be developed. 2nd group has a growth mindset coming from a belief that our basic qualities are things we can cultivate through effort. Group 2 understands that people differ greatly – in aptitude, talents, interests, temperaments etc... but everyone can change and grow through application and experience. The book also goes deep into implications of each belief and points out some basic mistakes that teachers, managers and parents make in their every day life which forces those they influence into a fixed mindset. I love reading about success and this book instantly turned into one of my favorites on the topic, the mindset concept is absolutely critical to understand and I would highly recommend you to read this book!"
244,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5079848-amina,2,"2.5☆First, the concept was good, the first chapters were great but then the I found the book to be very repetitive, it could have been written in about 150 pages, and a little bit judgmental, sometimes even a bit hard on the people with the fixed mindset."
245,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9846570-leah,5,"Marking as one of my favourite self help/personal development books!!!I got so much from this book and it's permanently impacted my life. It was slightly repetitive but it was just really zoning in on the points.This is definitely a re-read so that I can take notes and study it more.Just off the top of my head here are some of my take aways:- Be growth-minded not fixed-minded. Fixed minded is when you believe people were born with innate talents and skills and they can't develop/learn/grow. While the growth mind set is about becoming anything or anyone you want and learning and growing into the person you want to be.- Every human is born into a set of genetic code from their parents and has experiences which can or need not define them. You can change how you act and the decisions you make if you want to, it will just take some effort and work- Lots of great information on how to raise your children in this book. How certain praises actuakly do harm instead of your intended good praise. Like saying ""Oh wow Billy you got 100% on your test? That means you made no mistakes that's great! You're so smart."" This instill fear into Billy's mind that he should try his best not to make mistakes in the future or else he will not be ""smart."" And children feed off of the praise their parents give them so this is so crucial. It's better to talk about their effort instead of judging them. Instead say "" Oh wow Billy you got 100% on your test? You must have worked really hard and studied, I'm so proud of your efforts.""- Shyness was also an interesting aspect of this book because if you are a shy person that basically means that you are more so fixed-minded because you find judgement of other people important to you. If you were growth minded then you would focus n working on your shyness and uncomfortableness to improve yourself instead of just defining yourself as shy and that's the end of it.- When you are raised by judgemental family it can influence you to become fixed-minded.Carol S. Dweck is a smart cookie, I look forward to her future publications ;)""the courage to be open—to welcome change and new ideas regardless of their source. Real self-confidence is not reflected in a title, an expensive suit, a fancy car, or a series of acquisitions. It is reflected in your mindset: your readiness to grow."""""
246,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10400867,2,"The idea of having a growth mindset isn’t revolutionary, however, just like any good self-help book, it focuses on a specific trait, repositions its importance, and expands its application.The idea of “growth mindset” is insightful and impactful. Once integrated within the mindset of an individual, relationship or organization, the applications become limitless. The main idea of the book:""Every one of us should believe that our basic qualities are things we can cultivate through effort. Yes, people differ greatly but everyone can change and grow through application and experience""As a result, we should change the way we look at any past set back, current challenge, or future perceived distasteful experience. We should think about and approach them as learning opportunities. Thinking of them in such away: a) increases our willingness to be exposed to challenging situations, and b) increases the learning, and thus, our development as individuals. All this will result, in continuous incremental learnings as time passes by.The idea isn’t just about changing the way you think, but it’s about making this way of thinking a habit. This habit, will “convert” any belief about oneself limits to a narrative about “learning opportunities”The author then spends a good 70% of the book showing how this is applied in different situations (teachers, spouses, workplace, and sports).The verdict:•	The book delivers a short, simple, self-evident yet important truth that can be delivered in an article or 4 pages max. The additional 270 pages was pure waste. Too repetitive. •	The author is ‘too’ in love with her theory, she tries to attribute all human achievements to it. She oversells it in my opinion.•	The examples she gives are too polarized, too ideal. She portrays people with fixed mindset in a stereotypical shallow way showing them as morons. I really did not like that about the book"
247,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239658-karen-chung,4,"This book has one relatively simple message that is repeated over and over again in many different forms throughout the narrative: that we need to approach everything in life not with a fixed mindset - i.e. that people are either born artists, athletes, good students, or whatever, or they are not - but with a ""growth"" mindset, i.e. that we are highly malleable, and achieve through effort, not just by happening to be talented. Due to its repetitiveness, which sets in very early in the book, I originally planned to give it only three stars. But the message is an extremely important one, and the illustrative anecdotes are interesting and worth reading, thus the fourth star. "
248,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8460201-karen,3,"The idea of a ""growth mindset"" is a simple one, but quite profound for many people who have grown up believing that talents and abilities are ""fixed"". A growth mindset is possessed by those who believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.Not sure where you sit? You can take a questionnaire here: https://mindsetonline.com/testyourmin...Because it is such a simple concept, I found the book a bit repetitive and I think it could have benefited from more around how to develop and change your fixed mindset, rather than continually trying to prove why having a growth mindset is better.I recommend this book to anyone interested in self development, who is a teacher/trainer, or has children!"
249,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38829282-nicholas-shaw,1,"How in the name of hell is this book rated so highly!? The central message is clearly that you should adopt the growth mindset if you wish to grow and improve at basically anything in life. If you have the fixed mindset you seem to believe you're stuck with what you've got, much frustration and general failure ensues.I can't imagine anyone arguing against hard work and effort to get anywhere in life but how is this book several hundred pages? Save yourself the effort and watch the TED talk at most if this summary isn't enough for you."
250,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11410080-rebecca,4,"Any book that helps you develop a new way to process failure, and a new way to learn and grow, is a book worth reading. I've already been telling everyone about the growth mindset, and I only just finished reading this. I wish everyone knew how to access and nourish their growth mindset, and I'm glad to start the journey towards my potential. Get outta here fixed mindset! This is the first ""self-help"" book I've ever read, and now I'm sad I didn't read it sooner. I highly recommend this."
251,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8164155-diana,5,I really enjoyed reading this awesome book. I delayed my reading a lot and wish that I could have read the book with the same enthusiasm from beginning to end. It was a little too much information for me but it was worth reading the whole book. I loved it! Will definitely go back to it in a few months to learn more from it. ;)

253,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23841736-sarah,5,This book was recommended to me by one of my jiujitsu instructors. I resisted because I'm not a fan of the self-help genre but I ended up really loving it. It's also helping me to understand a frustrating situation at work.This was excellent and very helpful.
254,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1128267-jason,0,"My dad had been talking about this book, so when we went to visit him and I saw it on his desk I started reading it. It made sense right away and was easy to get into. Your mindset (either a growth mindset or a fixed mindset) determines how you relate to your abilities and experiences in school, business, relationships, and sports (those are the areas she covers). I could see myself in both of the mindsets she described, and I think they're a useful tool for making sense of places where I struggle. They offer a way to organize a response. I have a sense of the freedom in the growth mindset: nothing sticks to you because you don't identify with the results; you're here to learn and grow, so fear and anger and results don't have such a grip on you. I picture someone loose in a stream of events, like a slippery fish. But it's a learning stream. It's funny, though. I feel like I need a break from these kinds of books: idea books to help you make something work, to get better at something. Maybe the Joker's monologues in The Dark Knight had an effect on me. (I saw it by myself late at night, which is the best time to come out of a movie.) I kind of liked them. I thought they were the best of their kind. Something like, ""They're all schemers . . ."" and he wants to disrupt it, subvert it, hold it up for its ridiculousness. This isn't exactly a schemer book, but it's definitely an aiming at success book (""success"" is in the sub-title). Ways to succeed rely on a simplification of what's going on. It's the only way to create a model to use to work with life, but I get tired of it eventually. I've read a lot of good ones this summer, though. I guess I'm ready to put my new tools to use. I don't need anymore new tools right now, thank you. I feel like I'm ready for Handke again. And maybe Philip Dick. I want to read Ubik. "
255,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13852634-alan-bevan,2,"I struggled to rate this book. It offers a single gem of a concept - perhaps not particularly original but nevertheless really important. And that gem is that how we think about ourselves can make all the difference. Do we see ourselves to have a fixed capacity or do we have a growth mindset? It reminded me of my Dad who consistently frustrated me by never trying anything new on the grounds that he was not the sort of person who did X. He genuinely seemed to believe he was not free to choose. He didn't see life as an opportunity to learn. This book offers a language to describe the alternative that he never saw, the 'growth mindset'.But that was it really for the book. That single concept is padded with countless (and to me tedious) anecdotes but it offered nothing more other than superficially considering the role of parents and teachers in relation to the development of mindsets.So yes, it contains a really important concept and I would have liked my father to read it but I reckon it would have more impact if condensed to a pithy 1000 word essay. But then there wouldn't be book to sell which would obviously be contrary to Dweck's mindset.And lastly, I am stunned that the publishers can get away with the sub heading, 'The new Psychology of Success'. New? Really?"
256,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5977628-kat,2,"I found this book a little frustrating. It's overall message is good, it explores the differences between having a fixed and growth mindset. A fixed mindset believes your intelligence, skills, talent, and life are all basically set in stone and can't be improved. A growth mindset believes that you can always become smarter or more skilled with effort, and views criticism as motivation to improve instead of a crushing blow. It's definitely an important lesson that everyone should learn. My frustration is mostly in how the lesson is delivered, and that is mostly though stories about grade school student, athletes, and CEOs. There is a lot of hand wringing about the folly of complementing your kids. The author tells a story of how she accidentally told her husband he was brilliant and gasped in horror at her mistake. There is praise of sleazy CEOs who've ""made it"" (while screwing their employees and the environment) and Harvey Weinstein of all people (though this was published in 2009). It just feels a little silly and like every other self help book that leans on stories about football players and men who realized their business might do better if their weren't such giant a**holes. There are better self improvement books out there."
257,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14858185-steven,2,"Disappointing and repetitive pop-psychology book based on 1 idea that seems dubious from anecdotal experience. The author talks about the ""fixed mindset"" those who believe that traits like intelligence, personality, sports ability etc. are largely determined genetically and those who believe in the ""growth mindset"" that all traits can be fundamentally changed with enough effort, with the growth mindset being the path to success.This is a false dichotomy. It's not an either/or (growth vs fixed mindset) but a continuum. We are part genetically determined, part environmentally determined. The assertion that only those with the growth mindset achieve their potential seems false and I'd like to see Dweck's data. Those who believe they're innately gifted in a specific trait, usually work and practice long and hard to perfect their skills in their particular talents, while ignoring the areas they are weak in. Dweck's handful of examples of people succeeding in an area they were initially believed to have little talent in hardly proves her thesis that one can do anything if one has the right mindset. "
258,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16612969-andrea,5,"In the book Mindset, by Carol Dweck, the author explains the fixed mindset and offers tips to help you move toward a more growth oriented mindset. A person with a fixed mindset believes that their intelligence, skills, and abilities are static and there is nothing they can do change that. Someone with a growth mindset believes that learning is a lifelong process. In the book, Dr Dweck used athlete John McEnroe as an example of someone with a fixed mindset. McEnroe believed that he was the best tennis player and if he lost a match, it was always due to some outside force that was beyond his control. He even rooted for his friends and family to lose their matches, so he could be the best in his circle. He never practiced, because he believed that someone with natural talent shouldn't require practice. On the opposite side of the spectrum, you have Michael Jordan. He was arguably one the greatest basketball players of all time, but he was cut from his high school team. With a lot of effort, time, and practice, he went on to the NBA. If you embrace a growth mindset, skills can be developed over time."
259,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34391111-solomon-mark,5,"Mindset is Excellent book. Carol Dweck explains about two types of Mindsets fixed and growth mindset. According to the author every person is having either Fixed or Growth mindset. Fixed mindset individuals perceives that Intelligent is unchangeable and static. Growth mindset individuals perceives that Intelligent can be changed and improved. Fixed mindset people avoid challenges, give-up when they encounters obstacles, they won’t take effort to make things better, they will avoid useful negative feedback from others and they won’t learn from their mistakes.Growth mindset people will be having desire to learn, never avoid challenges, learn from mistakes, they will take every effort to make things better, they will take valuable information from criticism and negative feedback.We have to learn from our mistakes and change ourself to improving our Intelligent and potential. In this book author gives many interesting examples on both fixed and growth mindsets. Every parent and individual should read this book. "
260,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15605093-hestia-istiviani,5,"THIS BOOK IS TOO AWESOME!I learn so many things about how powerful our mindset is. It not only talk about the definition on mindset, but also gives many applications on business, relationship, leadership, parenting, teaching, and coaching. I guess you will as surprised as me because we feel like we have walked to right pathway: to be proud of your almamater, to determine our skills instead of promoting ourselves to new things you have could learn from.I can't get over it. In the middle of reading, I listened to her podcasts, watched her TEDx Talks & interviews. Reading this book reminds me to others aligned book such as Sir Ken Robinson's Creative School, Tom Kelley's Creative Confidence, Susan Cain's Quite, and surprisingly Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In. It also makes me want to read Steven Levitt's Freakonomics and Arianna Huffington's Thrive. The conclusion is you have to start reading this book."
261,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/990216-elizabeth,3,"This has some interesting points about having a fixed mindset and a more flexible mindset, but there isn't enough depth to the anecdotes. I do recommend reading the chapter for teachers and parents as there are useful tips about motivating kids to learn and to change their own mindset. All in all, I would refer to the chart in the back as a shortcut for the information. "
262,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32415499-elizabeth-keatley,4,"This has been such an eye opening read. It will change not only how I conduct my daily personal life, but also how I praise and challenge my students."
263,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,4,"This book changed my perspective on abilities and potential. Dweck shows how to move from the fixed mindset (the belief that human qualities and abilities are set and essentially unalterable) to the growth mindset (the belief that those qualities and abilities can be cultivated through effort). Dweck, a psychologist, based the book on solid scientific research, not the pseudoscientific mystical nonsense often found in ""success psychology"" books. Dweck applies the mindsets to sports, business leadership, relationships, parenting, and teaching. The book has far too many anecdotes for my taste; it’s full of specific examples of famous CEOs and athletes, as well as ordinary people.My favorite parts were those that advised how to talk to children about their successes and failures. Intellectually, I agree with Dweck’s advice that you should praise effort, not ability, and that when a child does something quickly, you should challenge rather than praise them, but that can be emotionally difficult for a parent to do. I also found the section on bullying interesting, because I was bullied for most of my school years. I skimmed the many examples from sports, because I’m generally disinterested in sports.I read this because it was referred to in several books, articles, and podcasts about business and/or web design.The MindsetsFixed Mindset• Your qualities and intelligence are very basic to you and can’t change very much. If you have the ability, you’ll do well. If you don’t, you won’t.• Characteristics: passing up chances to learn, feeling labeled by a failure, getting discouraged when something requires effort.• Framework: judge and be judged; ""You have permanent traits and I'm judging them.""Growth Mindset• No matter your qualities and intelligence, you can always change substantially. Abilities can be cultivated and improved.• Characteristics: taking challenges, learning from failure, continuing effort.• Framework: learn and help learn; ""You are a developing person and I am interested in your development.""The Truth About Ability and Accomplishment• In the growth mindset, abilities can be cultivated, but that doesn’t mean that everything can or should be changed.• Benjamin Bloom, after 40 years of research on school learning, said, “What any person in the world can learn, almost all persons can learn, if provided with the appropriate prior and current conditions of learning.”• “Just because some people can do something with little or no training, it doesn’t mean that others can’t do it (and sometimes do it even better) with training.”• People (especially children) do better when praised for effort than ability.Relationships: Mindsets in Love (Or Not)• The fixed mindset believes that successful relationships don’t require effort. The growth mindset believes that they do.Bullying• To reduce bullying, change the school mindset.• Fight the atmosphere of judgement and create one of collaboration and self-improvement.• Empower bystanders to help victims.• Enforce discipline, but don’t judge the bully as a person. Make them feel liked and welcomed at school.• Praise the bully’s steps in the right direction (staying out of fighting, getting along with others). Praise efforts, not the person.• Teachers can point a bully away from judgment and towards compassion by not implying they’re a bad person, showing respect, and asking for the bully’s advice for helping bullied students.Parents, Teachers, and Coaches: Where Do Mindsets Come From?• Give children the growth-mindset message, “You are a developing person and I am interested in your development,” not the fixed-mindset message, “You have permanent traits and I’m judging them.”• Praising children’s intelligence harms motivation and performance. It gives a temporary boost, but if they run into difficulty, they’ll think failure means they’re dumb. Instead, praise for the growth-oriented process: what they accomplish through practice, study, persistence, strategy.• Don’t talk about others in terms of fixed judgments in front of children, or they’ll think you use the same fixed judgments on them.• When children do something quickly and perfectly, don’t praise their speed and perfection. Instead, say it was too easy and give them a challenge.• When a child fails, tell them you understand their disappointment, but they’ll need to work harder.• Use misbehavior as an occasion for teaching, not judgment.• When teachers judge, students will sabotage the teacher by not trying. When teachers care for students and show them school is a way to grow their minds, they try.Changing Mindsets: A WorkshopAs a family, talk about your efforts, strategies, setbacks, and learning every day."
264,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35853271-sonja,3,3.5 out of 5 stars.:: buddy read with my eldest brother[short review to come]
265,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4177031-troy-blackford,4,"Original '3-star' Review (3/11/14) [see update below]:This was a book of good ideas that felt rather stretched out. This is probably because it is based on the author's original newspaper article, which became unexpectedly successful. There is a definite vibe of 'let's cash in on this article's success by stretching it out into a book-length work' that plagues the first third of Mindset. But, if you can stick out the abysmal first part, which seeks to assure readers the ideas contained in the book are helpful with a brutal series of 'A woman in Topeka e-mailed me that she tried the ideas in this book, and SHE LOVED IT!' type statements (along with the inverse: 'A man in Fort Wayne failed to use these ideas, and HE'S MISERABLE!'), the book which follows does indeed have some great points. This is well worth thinking about.I chalk it up to the state of the modern publishing industry that Carol Dweck was unable to print a book a third or maybe half the length of this, as 'that's not what customers want to buy,' because I'm sure I would have preferred a leaner, meaner, more toned version of this book. But if you can sit out the filler, this book is full of great points that employees/employers, teachers, parents, and people learning any skill will do well to ponder.UPDATE (10/5/15): This is over a year after I've read this book, and I've seen Dr. Dweck's research mentioned countless times since. I didn't greatly appreciate, at the time of my prior review, that Dr. Dweck is a researcher, and wrote this book sharing her findings for popular consumption. I can certainly see how pressure to stretch her findings into a book-length work led to the deficiencies I noted earlier, but I very much appreciate the value of the work she did and feel my earlier rating of 'three stars' is simply not fair. Now that I have a better understanding of what this work is meant to be and who Dr. Carol Dweck is, I am adding a star."
266,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2202561-becky,4,"The premise of this book sounds pretty ""duh."" I ran across its title in several different contexts before I decided that if such dissimilar people swear by it, it can't be as obvious as it sounds. And its implications are wide-ranging and interesting. It made me see the world in a new way. It's entertaining and an easy read, and would be especially valuable to teachers, parents, and coaches, but really applies to pretty much everybody. Instead of subtitling it ""The New Psychology of Success"" (eyeroll, please) it could have been called ""What Great Teachers Know."" I didn't read quite all the way to the end, but something I felt was missing from this book is that few people have an overall ""fixed mindset"" or an overall ""growth mindset."" As I think about people I know, most have different mindsets for each realm of their life. Some people have an academic or career growth mindset but a fixed relationship or athletics mindset, for example. Since most people have a growth mindset in at least one area, learning to expand those attitudes into other areas seems like a useful path toward developing an advantageous mindset where it's lacking. And in fact, I think that's often what happens. A kid does badly in school and his parents put him in martial arts classes; not only does he love it, but he starts getting better grades and getting along with his friends better too. As he learns how to achieve in one area of his life, he begins to apply those same achievement skills to other areas as well. Like any other summary of this book, this sounds tediously obvious, but the implications are deeper than a summary can convey. "
267,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6317928-asra-syed,3,"I do agree with Carol Dweck's idea of mindsets as fixed or growth and how these mindsets can be limiting or beneficial. I've struggled with explaining to students how ""smart"" isn't something you are, and that instead you can work toward getting smarter and more capable, so Dweck's concepts will help with that. But I probably could have read an article about this or watched a video instead of reading this entire book. It gets incredibly redundant and she seems to take the ideas a little too far, attributing the mindsets to all sorts of famous accomplished people, which gets to be a stretch. Plus, she really seems to oversimplify or misunderstand the concept of depression (not that I can claim to really understand the mental illness myself, but I do know that it's a medical/chemical/emotional condition that can't just be fixed by changing one's mindset). I kept reading hoping that the book would provide concrete ways to work on changing mindsets instead of just redundancy proving that her ideas of these two mindsets it correct, but I guess you have to go pay for her Brainology material for that. Of course you do. "
268,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9522471-brian,1,"Very simplistic. Binary oppositions always are. Her use of athletes is very problematic. Was it Jordan's growth mindset or his fierce desire to win at all costs that has kind-of made him a pretty miserable human being that made him succeed? Looking back, she should be embarrassed about claiming Roger Clemens' mindset was what it took for him to succeed. At least she didn't include Lance Armstrong. And her take on the corporate world is strange. The way CEOs were rewarded during the time period she writes about had to do with increasing share holder value immediately. Mindset has nothing to do with it. In hindsight, her praise of Circuit City and GE's Jack Welch doesn't look so good today. This totally buys into the myth of ""you can be whatever you want to be if you try hard enough.""  "
269,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26683448-mohammed-h,5,"One of the most important books I have read. I watched my entire life and how I reacted to school, sports, arts, relationships and finally my business. I was shocked to know that I had a fixed mind set in my relationships, school and had a growth mind set to sports. Now I constantly ask myself and probe my brain for reactions. This book will change you and change people around you. Its infectious. Its important for your life, work and kids. I could not recommend a more important book to read."
270,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,1,"It's one thing to tell people their brains are like muscles. But the author pumps up that analogy until it explodes. Michael Jordan had to practice really really hard before he became a great basketball player. OK. But if he were 5 feet tall, it would not matter how hard he practiced; he would never have been an NBA MVP superstar. Yet the author writes ""Can anyone do anything? I don't really know."" Seriously!? That is literally farcical.http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-liv...This book has glowing reviews from reputable sources and positions the author as ""one of the world's leading researchers"" in psychology. So I'm holding it to a high standard. The author mentions Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and claims that ""Mindsets go further."" CBT is supported by numerous clinical trials. Where is there similarly rigorous evidence for a benefit from Mindsets? I could not find it in the book. I think there are better books covering the same area.

272,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78108898-exitgirl05,4,"Even if you think you know everything there is to know regarding mind, learning and developing, read this book. It's not the theory itself. Dr Carol Dweck offers examples of everyday situations in which every human finds himself. How we cope with professional challenges, parenting, relationships... It will make you think and it will surely give you a whole new perspective on learning process. It will help you become not smarter, but hungrier for knowledge. "
273,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"The big idea of the book is that we can divide people into 2 groups: 1st group has a fixed mindset believing that the qualities they posses are carved in stone. Characteristics such as intelligence, personality, and creativity are fixed traits, rather than something that can be developed. 2nd group has a growth mindset coming from a belief that our basic qualities are things we can cultivate through effort. Group 2 understands that people differ greatly – in aptitude, talents, interests, temperaments etc... but everyone can change and grow through application and experience. The book also goes deep into implications of each belief and points out some basic mistakes that teachers, managers and parents make in their every day life which forces those they influence into a fixed mindset. I love reading about success and this book instantly turned into one of my favorites on the topic, the mindset concept is absolutely critical to understand and I would highly recommend you to read this book!"
274,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5079848-amina,2,"2.5☆First, the concept was good, the first chapters were great but then the I found the book to be very repetitive, it could have been written in about 150 pages, and a little bit judgmental, sometimes even a bit hard on the people with the fixed mindset."
275,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9846570-leah,5,"Marking as one of my favourite self help/personal development books!!!I got so much from this book and it's permanently impacted my life. It was slightly repetitive but it was just really zoning in on the points.This is definitely a re-read so that I can take notes and study it more.Just off the top of my head here are some of my take aways:- Be growth-minded not fixed-minded. Fixed minded is when you believe people were born with innate talents and skills and they can't develop/learn/grow. While the growth mind set is about becoming anything or anyone you want and learning and growing into the person you want to be.- Every human is born into a set of genetic code from their parents and has experiences which can or need not define them. You can change how you act and the decisions you make if you want to, it will just take some effort and work- Lots of great information on how to raise your children in this book. How certain praises actuakly do harm instead of your intended good praise. Like saying ""Oh wow Billy you got 100% on your test? That means you made no mistakes that's great! You're so smart."" This instill fear into Billy's mind that he should try his best not to make mistakes in the future or else he will not be ""smart."" And children feed off of the praise their parents give them so this is so crucial. It's better to talk about their effort instead of judging them. Instead say "" Oh wow Billy you got 100% on your test? You must have worked really hard and studied, I'm so proud of your efforts.""- Shyness was also an interesting aspect of this book because if you are a shy person that basically means that you are more so fixed-minded because you find judgement of other people important to you. If you were growth minded then you would focus n working on your shyness and uncomfortableness to improve yourself instead of just defining yourself as shy and that's the end of it.- When you are raised by judgemental family it can influence you to become fixed-minded.Carol S. Dweck is a smart cookie, I look forward to her future publications ;)""the courage to be open—to welcome change and new ideas regardless of their source. Real self-confidence is not reflected in a title, an expensive suit, a fancy car, or a series of acquisitions. It is reflected in your mindset: your readiness to grow."""""
276,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10400867,2,"The idea of having a growth mindset isn’t revolutionary, however, just like any good self-help book, it focuses on a specific trait, repositions its importance, and expands its application.The idea of “growth mindset” is insightful and impactful. Once integrated within the mindset of an individual, relationship or organization, the applications become limitless. The main idea of the book:""Every one of us should believe that our basic qualities are things we can cultivate through effort. Yes, people differ greatly but everyone can change and grow through application and experience""As a result, we should change the way we look at any past set back, current challenge, or future perceived distasteful experience. We should think about and approach them as learning opportunities. Thinking of them in such away: a) increases our willingness to be exposed to challenging situations, and b) increases the learning, and thus, our development as individuals. All this will result, in continuous incremental learnings as time passes by.The idea isn’t just about changing the way you think, but it’s about making this way of thinking a habit. This habit, will “convert” any belief about oneself limits to a narrative about “learning opportunities”The author then spends a good 70% of the book showing how this is applied in different situations (teachers, spouses, workplace, and sports).The verdict:•	The book delivers a short, simple, self-evident yet important truth that can be delivered in an article or 4 pages max. The additional 270 pages was pure waste. Too repetitive. •	The author is ‘too’ in love with her theory, she tries to attribute all human achievements to it. She oversells it in my opinion.•	The examples she gives are too polarized, too ideal. She portrays people with fixed mindset in a stereotypical shallow way showing them as morons. I really did not like that about the book"
277,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239658-karen-chung,4,"This book has one relatively simple message that is repeated over and over again in many different forms throughout the narrative: that we need to approach everything in life not with a fixed mindset - i.e. that people are either born artists, athletes, good students, or whatever, or they are not - but with a ""growth"" mindset, i.e. that we are highly malleable, and achieve through effort, not just by happening to be talented. Due to its repetitiveness, which sets in very early in the book, I originally planned to give it only three stars. But the message is an extremely important one, and the illustrative anecdotes are interesting and worth reading, thus the fourth star. "
278,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8460201-karen,3,"The idea of a ""growth mindset"" is a simple one, but quite profound for many people who have grown up believing that talents and abilities are ""fixed"". A growth mindset is possessed by those who believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.Not sure where you sit? You can take a questionnaire here: https://mindsetonline.com/testyourmin...Because it is such a simple concept, I found the book a bit repetitive and I think it could have benefited from more around how to develop and change your fixed mindset, rather than continually trying to prove why having a growth mindset is better.I recommend this book to anyone interested in self development, who is a teacher/trainer, or has children!"
279,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38829282-nicholas-shaw,1,"How in the name of hell is this book rated so highly!? The central message is clearly that you should adopt the growth mindset if you wish to grow and improve at basically anything in life. If you have the fixed mindset you seem to believe you're stuck with what you've got, much frustration and general failure ensues.I can't imagine anyone arguing against hard work and effort to get anywhere in life but how is this book several hundred pages? Save yourself the effort and watch the TED talk at most if this summary isn't enough for you."
280,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11410080-rebecca,4,"Any book that helps you develop a new way to process failure, and a new way to learn and grow, is a book worth reading. I've already been telling everyone about the growth mindset, and I only just finished reading this. I wish everyone knew how to access and nourish their growth mindset, and I'm glad to start the journey towards my potential. Get outta here fixed mindset! This is the first ""self-help"" book I've ever read, and now I'm sad I didn't read it sooner. I highly recommend this."
281,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8164155-diana,5,I really enjoyed reading this awesome book. I delayed my reading a lot and wish that I could have read the book with the same enthusiasm from beginning to end. It was a little too much information for me but it was worth reading the whole book. I loved it! Will definitely go back to it in a few months to learn more from it. ;)

283,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23841736-sarah,5,This book was recommended to me by one of my jiujitsu instructors. I resisted because I'm not a fan of the self-help genre but I ended up really loving it. It's also helping me to understand a frustrating situation at work.This was excellent and very helpful.
284,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1128267-jason,0,"My dad had been talking about this book, so when we went to visit him and I saw it on his desk I started reading it. It made sense right away and was easy to get into. Your mindset (either a growth mindset or a fixed mindset) determines how you relate to your abilities and experiences in school, business, relationships, and sports (those are the areas she covers). I could see myself in both of the mindsets she described, and I think they're a useful tool for making sense of places where I struggle. They offer a way to organize a response. I have a sense of the freedom in the growth mindset: nothing sticks to you because you don't identify with the results; you're here to learn and grow, so fear and anger and results don't have such a grip on you. I picture someone loose in a stream of events, like a slippery fish. But it's a learning stream. It's funny, though. I feel like I need a break from these kinds of books: idea books to help you make something work, to get better at something. Maybe the Joker's monologues in The Dark Knight had an effect on me. (I saw it by myself late at night, which is the best time to come out of a movie.) I kind of liked them. I thought they were the best of their kind. Something like, ""They're all schemers . . ."" and he wants to disrupt it, subvert it, hold it up for its ridiculousness. This isn't exactly a schemer book, but it's definitely an aiming at success book (""success"" is in the sub-title). Ways to succeed rely on a simplification of what's going on. It's the only way to create a model to use to work with life, but I get tired of it eventually. I've read a lot of good ones this summer, though. I guess I'm ready to put my new tools to use. I don't need anymore new tools right now, thank you. I feel like I'm ready for Handke again. And maybe Philip Dick. I want to read Ubik. "
285,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13852634-alan-bevan,2,"I struggled to rate this book. It offers a single gem of a concept - perhaps not particularly original but nevertheless really important. And that gem is that how we think about ourselves can make all the difference. Do we see ourselves to have a fixed capacity or do we have a growth mindset? It reminded me of my Dad who consistently frustrated me by never trying anything new on the grounds that he was not the sort of person who did X. He genuinely seemed to believe he was not free to choose. He didn't see life as an opportunity to learn. This book offers a language to describe the alternative that he never saw, the 'growth mindset'.But that was it really for the book. That single concept is padded with countless (and to me tedious) anecdotes but it offered nothing more other than superficially considering the role of parents and teachers in relation to the development of mindsets.So yes, it contains a really important concept and I would have liked my father to read it but I reckon it would have more impact if condensed to a pithy 1000 word essay. But then there wouldn't be book to sell which would obviously be contrary to Dweck's mindset.And lastly, I am stunned that the publishers can get away with the sub heading, 'The new Psychology of Success'. New? Really?"
286,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5977628-kat,2,"I found this book a little frustrating. It's overall message is good, it explores the differences between having a fixed and growth mindset. A fixed mindset believes your intelligence, skills, talent, and life are all basically set in stone and can't be improved. A growth mindset believes that you can always become smarter or more skilled with effort, and views criticism as motivation to improve instead of a crushing blow. It's definitely an important lesson that everyone should learn. My frustration is mostly in how the lesson is delivered, and that is mostly though stories about grade school student, athletes, and CEOs. There is a lot of hand wringing about the folly of complementing your kids. The author tells a story of how she accidentally told her husband he was brilliant and gasped in horror at her mistake. There is praise of sleazy CEOs who've ""made it"" (while screwing their employees and the environment) and Harvey Weinstein of all people (though this was published in 2009). It just feels a little silly and like every other self help book that leans on stories about football players and men who realized their business might do better if their weren't such giant a**holes. There are better self improvement books out there."
287,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14858185-steven,2,"Disappointing and repetitive pop-psychology book based on 1 idea that seems dubious from anecdotal experience. The author talks about the ""fixed mindset"" those who believe that traits like intelligence, personality, sports ability etc. are largely determined genetically and those who believe in the ""growth mindset"" that all traits can be fundamentally changed with enough effort, with the growth mindset being the path to success.This is a false dichotomy. It's not an either/or (growth vs fixed mindset) but a continuum. We are part genetically determined, part environmentally determined. The assertion that only those with the growth mindset achieve their potential seems false and I'd like to see Dweck's data. Those who believe they're innately gifted in a specific trait, usually work and practice long and hard to perfect their skills in their particular talents, while ignoring the areas they are weak in. Dweck's handful of examples of people succeeding in an area they were initially believed to have little talent in hardly proves her thesis that one can do anything if one has the right mindset. "
288,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16612969-andrea,5,"In the book Mindset, by Carol Dweck, the author explains the fixed mindset and offers tips to help you move toward a more growth oriented mindset. A person with a fixed mindset believes that their intelligence, skills, and abilities are static and there is nothing they can do change that. Someone with a growth mindset believes that learning is a lifelong process. In the book, Dr Dweck used athlete John McEnroe as an example of someone with a fixed mindset. McEnroe believed that he was the best tennis player and if he lost a match, it was always due to some outside force that was beyond his control. He even rooted for his friends and family to lose their matches, so he could be the best in his circle. He never practiced, because he believed that someone with natural talent shouldn't require practice. On the opposite side of the spectrum, you have Michael Jordan. He was arguably one the greatest basketball players of all time, but he was cut from his high school team. With a lot of effort, time, and practice, he went on to the NBA. If you embrace a growth mindset, skills can be developed over time."
289,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34391111-solomon-mark,5,"Mindset is Excellent book. Carol Dweck explains about two types of Mindsets fixed and growth mindset. According to the author every person is having either Fixed or Growth mindset. Fixed mindset individuals perceives that Intelligent is unchangeable and static. Growth mindset individuals perceives that Intelligent can be changed and improved. Fixed mindset people avoid challenges, give-up when they encounters obstacles, they won’t take effort to make things better, they will avoid useful negative feedback from others and they won’t learn from their mistakes.Growth mindset people will be having desire to learn, never avoid challenges, learn from mistakes, they will take every effort to make things better, they will take valuable information from criticism and negative feedback.We have to learn from our mistakes and change ourself to improving our Intelligent and potential. In this book author gives many interesting examples on both fixed and growth mindsets. Every parent and individual should read this book. "

It not only talk about the definition on mindset, but also gives many applications on business, relationship, leadership, parenting, teaching, and coaching. I guess you will as surprised as me because we feel like we have walked to right pathway: to be proud of your almamater, to determine our skills instead of promoting ourselves to new things you have could learn from.I can't get over it. In the middle of reading, I listened to her podcasts, watched her TEDx Talks & interviews. Reading this book reminds me to others aligned book such as Sir Ken Robinson's Creative School, Tom Kelley's Creative Confidence, Susan Cain's Quite, and surprisingly Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In. It also makes me want to read Steven Levitt's Freakonomics and Arianna Huffington's Thrive. The conclusion is you have to start reading this book."

I do recommend reading the chapter for teachers and parents as there are useful tips about motivating kids to learn and to change their own mindset. All in all, I would refer to the chart in the back as a shortcut for the information. "
292,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32415499-elizabeth-keatley,4,"This has been such an eye opening read. It will change not only how I conduct my daily personal life, but also how I praise and challenge my students."
293,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,4,"This book changed my perspective on abilities and potential. Dweck shows how to move from the fixed mindset (the belief that human qualities and abilities are set and essentially unalterable) to the growth mindset (the belief that those qualities and abilities can be cultivated through effort). Dweck, a psychologist, based the book on solid scientific research, not the pseudoscientific mystical nonsense often found in ""success psychology"" books. Dweck applies the mindsets to sports, business leadership, relationships, parenting, and teaching. The book has far too many anecdotes for my taste; it’s full of specific examples of famous CEOs and athletes, as well as ordinary people.My favorite parts were those that advised how to talk to children about their successes and failures. Intellectually, I agree with Dweck’s advice that you should praise effort, not ability, and that when a child does something quickly, you should challenge rather than praise them, but that can be emotionally difficult for a parent to do. I also found the section on bullying interesting, because I was bullied for most of my school years. I skimmed the many examples from sports, because I’m generally disinterested in sports.I read this because it was referred to in several books, articles, and podcasts about business and/or web design.The MindsetsFixed Mindset• Your qualities and intelligence are very basic to you and can’t change very much. If you have the ability, you’ll do well. If you don’t, you won’t.• Characteristics: passing up chances to learn, feeling labeled by a failure, getting discouraged when something requires effort.• Framework: judge and be judged; ""You have permanent traits and I'm judging them.""Growth Mindset• No matter your qualities and intelligence, you can always change substantially. Abilities can be cultivated and improved.• Characteristics: taking challenges, learning from failure, continuing effort.• Framework: learn and help learn; ""You are a developing person and I am interested in your development.""The Truth About Ability and Accomplishment• In the growth mindset, abilities can be cultivated, but that doesn’t mean that everything can or should be changed.• Benjamin Bloom, after 40 years of research on school learning, said, “What any person in the world can learn, almost all persons can learn, if provided with the appropriate prior and current conditions of learning.”• “Just because some people can do something with little or no training, it doesn’t mean that others can’t do it (and sometimes do it even better) with training.”• People (especially children) do better when praised for effort than ability.Relationships: Mindsets in Love (Or Not)• The fixed mindset believes that successful relationships don’t require effort. The growth mindset believes that they do.Bullying• To reduce bullying, change the school mindset.• Fight the atmosphere of judgement and create one of collaboration and self-improvement.• Empower bystanders to help victims.• Enforce discipline, but don’t judge the bully as a person. Make them feel liked and welcomed at school.• Praise the bully’s steps in the right direction (staying out of fighting, getting along with others). Praise efforts, not the person.• Teachers can point a bully away from judgment and towards compassion by not implying they’re a bad person, showing respect, and asking for the bully’s advice for helping bullied students.Parents, Teachers, and Coaches: Where Do Mindsets Come From?• Give children the growth-mindset message, “You are a developing person and I am interested in your development,” not the fixed-mindset message, “You have permanent traits and I’m judging them.”• Praising children’s intelligence harms motivation and performance. It gives a temporary boost, but if they run into difficulty, they’ll think failure means they’re dumb. Instead, praise for the growth-oriented process: what they accomplish through practice, study, persistence, strategy.• Don’t talk about others in terms of fixed judgments in front of children, or they’ll think you use the same fixed judgments on them.• When children do something quickly and perfectly, don’t praise their speed and perfection. Instead, say it was too easy and give them a challenge.• When a child fails, tell them you understand their disappointment, but they’ll need to work harder.• Use misbehavior as an occasion for teaching, not judgment.• When teachers judge, students will sabotage the teacher by not trying. When teachers care for students and show them school is a way to grow their minds, they try.Changing Mindsets: A WorkshopAs a family, talk about your efforts, strategies, setbacks, and learning every day."
294,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35853271-sonja,3,3.5 out of 5 stars.:: buddy read with my eldest brother[short review to come]
295,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4177031-troy-blackford,4,"Original '3-star' Review (3/11/14) [see update below]:This was a book of good ideas that felt rather stretched out. This is probably because it is based on the author's original newspaper article, which became unexpectedly successful. There is a definite vibe of 'let's cash in on this article's success by stretching it out into a book-length work' that plagues the first third of Mindset. But, if you can stick out the abysmal first part, which seeks to assure readers the ideas contained in the book are helpful with a brutal series of 'A woman in Topeka e-mailed me that she tried the ideas in this book, and SHE LOVED IT!' type statements (along with the inverse: 'A man in Fort Wayne failed to use these ideas, and HE'S MISERABLE!'), the book which follows does indeed have some great points. This is well worth thinking about.I chalk it up to the state of the modern publishing industry that Carol Dweck was unable to print a book a third or maybe half the length of this, as 'that's not what customers want to buy,' because I'm sure I would have preferred a leaner, meaner, more toned version of this book. But if you can sit out the filler, this book is full of great points that employees/employers, teachers, parents, and people learning any skill will do well to ponder.UPDATE (10/5/15): This is over a year after I've read this book, and I've seen Dr. Dweck's research mentioned countless times since. I didn't greatly appreciate, at the time of my prior review, that Dr. Dweck is a researcher, and wrote this book sharing her findings for popular consumption. I can certainly see how pressure to stretch her findings into a book-length work led to the deficiencies I noted earlier, but I very much appreciate the value of the work she did and feel my earlier rating of 'three stars' is simply not fair. Now that I have a better understanding of what this work is meant to be and who Dr. Carol Dweck is, I am adding a star."
296,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2202561-becky,4,"The premise of this book sounds pretty ""duh."" I ran across its title in several different contexts before I decided that if such dissimilar people swear by it, it can't be as obvious as it sounds. And its implications are wide-ranging and interesting. It made me see the world in a new way. It's entertaining and an easy read, and would be especially valuable to teachers, parents, and coaches, but really applies to pretty much everybody. Instead of subtitling it ""The New Psychology of Success"" (eyeroll, please) it could have been called ""What Great Teachers Know."" I didn't read quite all the way to the end, but something I felt was missing from this book is that few people have an overall ""fixed mindset"" or an overall ""growth mindset."" As I think about people I know, most have different mindsets for each realm of their life. Some people have an academic or career growth mindset but a fixed relationship or athletics mindset, for example. Since most people have a growth mindset in at least one area, learning to expand those attitudes into other areas seems like a useful path toward developing an advantageous mindset where it's lacking. And in fact, I think that's often what happens. A kid does badly in school and his parents put him in martial arts classes; not only does he love it, but he starts getting better grades and getting along with his friends better too. As he learns how to achieve in one area of his life, he begins to apply those same achievement skills to other areas as well. Like any other summary of this book, this sounds tediously obvious, but the implications are deeper than a summary can convey. "
297,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6317928-asra-syed,3,"I do agree with Carol Dweck's idea of mindsets as fixed or growth and how these mindsets can be limiting or beneficial. I've struggled with explaining to students how ""smart"" isn't something you are, and that instead you can work toward getting smarter and more capable, so Dweck's concepts will help with that. But I probably could have read an article about this or watched a video instead of reading this entire book. It gets incredibly redundant and she seems to take the ideas a little too far, attributing the mindsets to all sorts of famous accomplished people, which gets to be a stretch. Plus, she really seems to oversimplify or misunderstand the concept of depression (not that I can claim to really understand the mental illness myself, but I do know that it's a medical/chemical/emotional condition that can't just be fixed by changing one's mindset). I kept reading hoping that the book would provide concrete ways to work on changing mindsets instead of just redundancy proving that her ideas of these two mindsets it correct, but I guess you have to go pay for her Brainology material for that. Of course you do. "
298,0345472322,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9522471-brian,1,"Very simplistic. Binary oppositions always are. Her use of athletes is very problematic. Was it Jordan's growth mindset or his fierce desire to win at all costs that has kind-of made him a pretty miserable human being that made him succeed? Looking back, she should be embarrassed about claiming Roger Clemens' mindset was what it took for him to succeed. At least she didn't include Lance Armstrong. And her take on the corporate world is strange. The way CEOs were rewarded during the time period she writes about had to do with increasing share holder value immediately. Mindset has nothing to do with it. In hindsight, her praise of Circuit City and GE's Jack Welch doesn't look so good today. This totally buys into the myth of ""you can be whatever you want to be if you try hard enough.""  "

I watched my entire life and how I reacted to school, sports, arts, relationships and finally my business. I was shocked to know that I had a fixed mind set in my relationships, school and had a growth mind set to sports. Now I constantly ask myself and probe my brain for reactions. This book will change you and change people around you. Its infectious. Its important for your life, work and kids. I could not recommend a more important book to read."
