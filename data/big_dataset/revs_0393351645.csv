0,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"Narrated by Barbara Caruso who also narrated Sue Hubbell's books Broadsides from the Other Orders: A Book of Bugs & Waiting for Aphrodite: Journeys into the Time Before Bones. This book is very much in the same vein, often almost poetic yet filled with facts & interesting tidbits.The Good:I really liked how she frames our current age in the eyes of a researcher from the future studying what is left behind after a geologic age or two. What fossils will we leave? What strange chemicals & materials will be found in layers of rock? It's a good perspective to take since ours is typically so short. As she points out, a long time to us is an eye blink in geologic time or even that of many types of plants & animals. Trilobytes died out a quarter of a billion years ago & yet thrived for as long. By comparison, human-like beings have only been around for a quarter of a million years with modern, sentient humans for roughly a fifth of that time. The Industrial Age is only a couple of centuries old & it's during this time when we have changed the planet as much as the other great extinction events in the 4.5 billion years of Earth's history.She's of the opinion that technology got us into this mess & it should be used to get us out of it, although she doesn't state it as directly as Asimov did. She gives a lot of great examples of new or maturing technologies that are minimizing out impact on the environment. Some were new to me, especially some in exotic locales, but few were explored in any depth which was a problem at times.She didn't do very well at robotics & AI, but did a great job with genes, epigenetics, & our microbiome. All of which combined to ask some great questions about how we define humanity, self awareness, & intelligence. I think Harrari does a better job in Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, but she asks the questions in a warmer way than he did with his algorithms.Her travels gave her a great overview of the world which helped the wandering style of the book. She covers a lot of range, but is definitely but is definitely best when sticking to softer subjects. There were some great insights & even funny moments. I forget the context & the exact wording, but she said something about as the great sage put it, ""Birds do it, bees do it, even educated fleas do it."" which about had me rolling. I never thought of Cole Porter in that way & tend to hear Joan Jett doing ""Tank Girl"" or see the chorus scene anyway.The Bad:She gets too humanistic at times. One quote was something about 'rabies knows anger & rage better than we know it ourselves'. Attributing volition or knowledge to diseases is ridiculous. It really undermined an otherwise great presentation on just how much bacteria can steer our thinking. She used Toxoplasmosis example, even extending it beyond the rat-cat cycle. She has a tendency to use numbers to make a point without putting them in perspective & even suggests incorrect correlations such as when she compares solar energy station outputs with that of others. Storing energy in sufficient quantity is still very difficult & inefficient, so comparing it directly to stable power sources doesn't work without a lot of qualifications. She provides none. She ignores the danger of promoting industrialization & subsequent colonization in marginal areas like the Nevada desert, too. Her description of the Swedish Solar Stirling Engine Plant had me thinking it was far better than a little research showed it is. It makes me wonder just what the ROI is on any of the schemes she promotes such as gathering the heat of commuters from subway stations. ROI is ALWAYS a consideration. I've looked into alternative energy sources for my own farm & wouldn't mind paying a little extra to help the environment, but the last time I looked at wind turbines, it would have been a ridiculous investment of time & money. I can't afford to lay out $10,000 & only see a $2500 return in 5 years.Her views on living with wildlife are idyllic at best. In dealing with pests & invasive species, she's unbelievably naive. She mentions collecting 1,000 pythons out of the Everglades in a decade, says there are an estimated 30,000, tells of one with 86 eggs, & yet makes it sound as if eradicating them is a possibility. Seriously? She didn't mention New Zealand's issues with rats, Australia's with rabbits, or ours with Gypsy moths. Hasn't she read Silent Spring? While we've gotten a little better, government attempts to eradicate pests are often far worse than the pests themselves. Heck, our government is the reason we have a lot of the pests in the first place. Multifloral rose was actively planted by Federal mandate to halt erosion after their half-assed assessment assured them it wouldn't spread by seed. They only tested with 3 species of birds, all of which had gravels, though. Song birds don't, weren't tested & wound up being perfect Johnny Roseseeds. Not only do they prep the seed by dissolving the protective skin, but deposit it with fertilizer & moisture when they poop.Her idea that large crop farming is hampered by crops which can't reproduce 'naturally' or patented seeds is ridiculous. There's very little natural about how wheat has stayed ahead of wheat rust nor should there be & seeds have been patented for over a century. Her use of the 'organic' label as something good is silly. Bt is used on organic corn, just not engineered in. Some of the 'natural' chemicals allowed are far worse than their manufactured counterparts & lack the quality controls. While she has a lot of company in her belief, I expected better from her. She needs to spend less time traveling to exotic locales & spend a little more time at home with local farmers & research what the 'organic' label really means.Overall it was an enjoyable look at the Anthropocene epoch, if one that lacked some critical details & played a bit loose with facts. Considering the territory she covered, that was inevitable. She asked some good questions & showed a pretty balanced view overall. I'll give it 3.5 stars & round up to 4, but with a warning not to take everything she says at face value."
1,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,5,"Five stars because it deserves 4.5... and everyone should read it, and almost everyone will enjoy and/or learn something from it. For those people who are still heedless of their impact on Mother Nature, some of the interlinked essays will, I hope, serve as prod. For those people who despair, many of the essays give hope that our inventiveness will enable us to live better within our biosphere.Yes, as others have mentioned, Ackerman covers a lot of ground. It's a survey - there's a list of books ""For Further Reading."" Here we get anecdotes, outlines, ideas. And, yes, her prose is almost purple. Whether or not that's a good thing depends on the reader; I definitely prefer it to the dry academic tone of some serious science books, or the forced wit of some pop science books.Bladeless wind turbines, 3D printing of organs, vertical gardens on skyscrapers, more of our body is microbes than human, sustainable mariculture, epigenetics, not just a disconnect from real life but also more myopia from our immersion in our devices, invasive species, Apps for Apes, palm oil in our products kills orangutans, mind-controlled prosthetics, bringing extinct species back to life, bringing AL to AI, treated wastewater getting further filtered through places like the Wakodahatchee Wetlands, etc. So much to learn about! Even:""From her early years of seventeen to twenty-one, [Mary] Shelley was herself consumed by physical creation and literally sparking life, becoming pregnant and giving birth repeatedly, only to have three of her four children die soon after birth. She was constantly pregnant, nursing, or mourning--creating and being depleted by her own creations.""And just one example of the writing style: ""About 500,000 nanometers would fit in the period at the end of this sentence, with room left over for a rave of microbes and a dictator's heart."""
2,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1459884-krysten,2,"Ehhh... more like 2.5 stars. The writing was bad - journalistic at times, downright cringe-worthy at others (something about a father's voice ""so husky it could haul a sled"" eeuuurrrgggh). The tone was reverential, upbeat and hopeful in the face of discussions of mass extinctions and the price the planet will pay for our time on earth. And some of the details were just... made up. Like she read human features in the faces of sheep that had human cells in their organs. I would bet a lot of money Ackerman couldn't pick these supposedly human-looking specimens out of a lineup because spoiler alert they look like completely normal sheep (which I discovered through the magic of the internet). Ackerman uses offensive terms like ""cr*ppled"" and ""g*psy"" because it's fucking 1985 apparently. She also speaks of autism as a ""disease"" and then makes sweeping generalizations about human behavior without so much as a nod to neurodivergence. If ""we"" are all as ""connected"" as she insists, maybe she could do a quick google search to reveal how antiquated and harmful her terminology often is?All that said, I did learn some things. Thanks to some truly purple prose, I did not enjoy learning those things."
3,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7092147-nancy,5,"Welcome to the Anthropocene EraApes playing with iPads, Japanese tourists visiting industrial sites, the great black marble that is the earth ringed with lights at night: all these are manifestations of the Anthropocene Era, the era in which man is the dominant force shaping the world. The book is a series of stories each in a separate chapter ranging from nature to technology to the human body. I found each chapter well written, almost poetic. Whether you agree with her position that the way man has used and abused the environment is remediable not necessarily by using more technology but by modifying our behavior, including industrial and social behavior, she makes interesting points.The ending chapters on the human body, particularly the factors we are beginning to understand in how our DNA influences what we become and the role played by the environment, were my favorite chapters, but there are other excellent sections ranging from the sea to outer space. I highly recommend this book if you're interested in science, technology and the study of the human body. It's not a text book. It's an enjoyable read that gives you ideas to challenge the way you view the world. I reviewed this book for the Amazon Vine Program."
4,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,2,"I got a proof copy of this from Bookbridgr, so I'm not sure how many of the issues are going to be dealt with before the completed book is rolled out. There were still a lot of errors at this stage -- a bit where some words were struck out, problems with punctuation, etc. I think the purple prose will be there to stay, though; the writing isn't terrible, but it's rather overloaded, and I'm not keen on Ackerman's flights of imagination. It's one thing to imagine the trace we're leaving on the earth for future archaeologists, it's another to imagine those future archaeologists. That's science fiction, which I don't have any argument with, but I don't tend to like it when that crosses over into my supposed non-fiction.Ackerman picked an interesting topic, though, and aside from the blizzard of adjectives, this book is an easy read. It's not a pessimistic humans-are-destroying-the-world sort of book; at one point she mentions the idea of (some) industrial landscapes being beautiful, which is apparently a growing tourist thing in some parts of the world.Her chapters are short, though her sentences are long, and all in all it's a quick one. I'm not impressed by her writing style, but I would like to read more on the same topic with a similar outlook."
5,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876945-ryan,2,"I think the author tried to cram too many subjects into the book. With a title like that, admittedly it's a lot of ground to cover. I thought it would be mainly about how we have altered the physical landscape and ecosystems of the Earth, but it also went into how the latest technologies have reshaped our definition of being human beings ala cybernetics and robotics and 3D printed organs and body parts. Chapters on invasive species, climate change and mass extinction were expected, but there were also those on our advances in medical knowledge of genetics and the ecology of microbes in our bodies that were a little off topic, I felt. Overall the book felt more like a collection of various articles that are about current trends in biology and medical science. It is a celebration of human ingenuity without tempering it with caution and the realization that our impact on the environment has mainly been very negative, not just for other life but ultimately for our own future. Indeed, we already have all the technology and knowledge we need to avert the crisis of overshoot, so it is cultural and behavioral change that we need desperately to save the human race, not glorification of technology, which is what this book is mainly about.The language is evocative and even flowery at times, which was pleasantly surprising for a book about science and technology. However it could have been better footnoted and referenced, what with all the cutting edge research and at times incredible statements made. Instead we are given a long list of 'further reading' at the end, which was not even ordered by chapter or topic."
6,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27336880-jim-byers,4,"I received this book through the Goodreads giveaway program. I was not familiar with Ms. Ackerman's prior books and after reading The Human Age, I realize that have I have found a profound authority on natural science. The scope of this book is beyond broad. She addresses human awareness in primates in contrast to robots that can solve problems by analyzing their own experiences. The anthropogenic point of view is examined on land, in the depths of the sea, from outer space and beyond our universe The rapidity of change in societies, science, technology and the impact man on the earth's environment are explored even handily. So, if you are open to a mind expanding journey, I would encourage you to read this book. "
7,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/994755-kathryn-bashaar,2,"It seems like I should have really liked this book, but I ended up not quite finishing it. It covers some very interesting topics about how human beings have shaped, and continue to shape, the world we live in, and it is very optimistic about how we can use our cleverness to solve the problems that our own cleverness has caused. Ackerman covers some very cool projects and technologies. But I think that was one of my problems with the book: it covers SO much, and necessarily just at the surface level, that I felt overwhelmed and disoriented reading it. Also, I'm just not crazy about Ackerman's over-the-top writing style, way too many similes, some of them lovely but others weird and forced. I think others might really enjoy this book, but it just wasn't for me. "
8,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4," What do you get when you mix techno-optimism with environmental pessimism you get something like ""fear and loathing in the anthropocene"" or this book. Weirdness is taking over like a climate changing hurricane in a robotic singularity. Definitely interesting times. This book in part mourns the loss of the natural world and marvels at the weirdly human concoctions we dream up. Both alarming, nostalgic, marveling and full of wonder and horror. Humans are casting spells but like the sorcerer's apprentice are we too clever by half."
9,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4548673-susan,4,"Using her wonderfully poetic language, Ackerman takes a long look at the impact we have on our earth. Calling this epoch of geological history Anthropocene, or the Human Age, she presents world-wide examples of how we are trying to mitigate the effects of humans on all aspects of our planet. She examines, among other things, changes in animal habitats and migrations, the warming of our climate, the changing oceans and the constant battle to supplant fossil fuels with other energy resources. Some responses to theses issues are definitely off the wall, but others show great promise. We need to address our resistance to change."
10,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2959978-fkellysun,5,"Wonderful look at all the things that make us what we are, and the effect we have on the planet. A series of essays that are lyrically and beautifully written, making us think, alternately depressing and inspiring."
11,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9511423-niknik,4,"»I received this book for free in a Goodreads First Read Giveaway«At first, I wasn't aware that this was going to be a non-fiction read or that Diane Ackerman is usually a science writer (I was only aware of her fictional book, ""The Zookeeper's Wife""). However, this book turned out to be absolutely fascinating!The book covers the ability we, Homo Sapiens, have to vastly change our world through technology and exponentially advancing know-how. While it addresses the obvious negative effects we have on our environment and the planet, it's not all ""doom-&-gloom"".Instead, the book is more focused on how we can better the environment by adapting and changing with the changing climate, developing intelligent ""green"" urban solutions and redefining our concept of what it means to be a human in this Human Age or the Anthropocene.The ingenuity of humans to create an eco-friendly environment from existing buildings, railways and other man-made items is incredible and happening at present. But also, the advances in genetics and artificial intelligence is redefining the world and our future as we know it.If you are interested in science, presented in a clear and straightforward manner, you should enjoy this book. Many of the advancements being made these days are straight from the world of science fiction; 3D printing of organs and body parts; robots learning from the environment to create robots-with-personalities; and influencing our health and medicine through changing the microbiotic composition of our bodies.Overall, a smart and interesting read."
12,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931538-sara,5,"This book really is amazing. I've read many of her books and learned a lot from each one. Here she points out how humans have shaped the entire planet beginning with planting crops and domesticating animals instead of merely hunting and gathering. The Industrial Revolution had a huge impact which continues to this day. Good and bad are profiled---not only climate change as the results of the petroleum industries but the amazing innovations humans are developing, like saving seeds and animal DNA, heating train stations in Sweden with human body heat that warms huge tanks of water which then heats nearby homes, waste water from factories being turned into steam to heat whole towns also in Sweden, using the braking of other trains to run trains the same way a Prius works in Paris, vertical gardening in the ocean in Maine, teaching orangutans to use iPads in order to communicate much as many parents are now teaching their children sign language before they can speak, and many, many others. Also impressive is her vocabulary as well as the connections she makes between ideas. Highly recommended."
13,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/233482-kevin-mcallister,5,"It's hard to believe it's been 25 years since I read A Natural History of the Senses by Diane Ackerman. In her latest work The Human Age she talks about how much we have changed and shaped the world in just a short period of time. The change has indeed been vast and continues to accelerate. But one thing that hasn't changed is how wonderful Ackerman writes. I simply can not think of another author who waxes so poetic while writing about science. With each page I'm enthralled by both the beauty and brilliance of her words. By all means, read this book. And be prepared, to be not just richly educated, but totally amazed. "
14,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/883937-sharon-bakar,5,"Fascinating account of what it means to live in the anthropocene and our changing relationship with nature. Thoroughly researched and informed by the latest scientific and medical literature, it I also beautifully (even poetically) written. At a point where we are in danger of giving in to despair because of climate change and our horrendous burden on the planet's ecosystem, it offers plenty of food for thought and some degree of hope. Human ingenuity will be our salvation."
15,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"A perfect tonic to books like The Sixth Extinction, this is an intriguing and inspiring look at how some of the world’s brightest minds are working to mitigate the negative impacts we have had on the environment and improve human life through technology. Part 1 is the weakest – most of us are already all too aware of how we’ve trashed nature – but the book gets stronger as it goes on. My favorite chapters were the last five, about 3D printing, bionic body parts and human–animal hybrids created for medical use, and how epigenetics and the microbial life we all harbor might influence our personality and behavior more than we think.As in David R. Boyd’s The Optimistic Environmentalist, Ackerman highlights some innovative programs that are working to improve the environment, such as “seeding the Antarctic Ocean with iron to trigger the growth of [blue-green] algae,” vertical gardens and green roofs, sustainable building models, “cradle to cradle” (completely recyclable or reusable) production technology, the wildlife-friendly Green Belt Corridor in Europe.Some of the most interesting factoids for me were:•	“Because plastics take so long to degrade, they, too, will show up in the fossil record.”•	Studies have shown that city birds live faster-paced lives than country ones•	Bat guano and horse chestnuts have helped produce explosives for various war efforts•	“mothers who lived through the stresses of hurricanes and tropical storms while they were pregnant were more likely to have autistic children” (epigenetics)•	Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite often contracted from cats or from eating undercooked meat, may infect up to 25% Americans and 50% of Britons and is associated with mental illness and hyperactivityAckerman’s effusive, lyrical style can grate, especially in earlier chapters (“where the only low-hanging fruit are the stars, one’s sanity can tremble on a stem slender as a marigold’s” and, describing a python’s movement, “slipping through the sawgrass, sibilant as sassafras, slanting up to their prey, and then—slam!”). If there’s a metaphor there to be made, she generally won’t resist the urge. However, for the most part I found her enthusiasm infectious. This book will genuinely make you feel more hopeful about the future of human life on earth."
16,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3723031-leigh,3,"A lovely and lyrical, if not at times overwrought and overly-romanticized, look at humanity and the roles we play in the world around us, and just how deeply it can affect us in return. A highly literary book of science essays, strange as it may seem, especially to uninitiated.It hurts to admit it, but Ackerman's poetic waxing gets tiresome at points throughout the book, which could have benefited from some more scientific references, facts and/or figures. Half of what she writes sounds like exaggeration, and I felt an odd need to fact check half of her claims. I'm hoping the finished version had more footnotes and references to back up some of the more fantastical elements she discusses. I know that both humans and nature are capable are of far more than any of us can ever know, but it's nice to have the proof on hand just in case.Her writing is enviously beautiful and insightful, and her overall outlook on humanity is overwhelmingly positive, and I'm definitely going to be on the lookout for more of her previous work. I may be too cynical to have truly enjoyed this particular book for what it is, but that doesn't mean I don't appreciate the skill and tenderness with which it was written and the hopeful humanist message it leaves.*I received an ARC as part of the FirstReads program.*"
17,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49989-kathy,5,"It's kind of a Readers' Digest collection of everything humans do to tinker with the earth. I haven't read the last couple chapters because I just don't want to be finished with it. Here's a few paragraphs I liked: ""A warmer world won't be terrible for everyone, and it's bound to inspire new technologies and good surprises, not just tragedy."" ""Tuvalu, a country in the South Pacific has begun evacuating it's people to New Zealand and the president of Kiribati an island nation of 32 atolls sprinkled across 3,500,000 km of ocean between Australia and Hawaii is negotiating with Fiji to buy 5000 acres of land so that his population of over 102,000 can relocate. One Kiribati native, Ioane Teitiota, appealed for refugee status to Auckland, New Zealand, arguing that none of Kiribati atolls is more than 2 m above sea level and therefore his life was endangered by the rising seas of global warming. The judge who heard his case found the claim novel, but not persuasive.""Since my grandson is serving a mission for the LDS church in Kiribati I was very heartened by Ackerman's positive take on the climate situation.I need a copy of this book. There is so much I want to highlight. I just found the neatest used bookstore. It is actually a Goodwill. I will call and see if they have it.Kathy"
18,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1076172-sarah,4,"Informative and beautifully written, Diane Ackerman's newest work The Human Age describes many of the dumb things we as humans have done to harm our planet. But even better, it spends much more time expounding on really awesome things we as humans have done to stop or reverse that harm. The old adage ""You get more flies with honey than vinegar"" comes to mind as I reflect on the way Ackerman artfully approached this topic. Her descriptions of many recent innovations humans have made to help Mother Earth were uplifting and awe-inspiring, and she truly is a poet with her countless vivid metaphors and flowery prose (sometimes flowery prose gets on my nerves but in this case it did not). I appreciated her gentle encouragement to be more aware of the effect I am having on our planet in the way I live my life."
19,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5583201-sandra,5,One of the most enjoyable non-fiction books I have read this year. Ackerman combines her broad thoughts on how humans have adapted to and changed the environment with vivid poetic prose. Ackerman is immensely talented at describing scientific knowledge in an engaging and easy to comprehend fashion. Ackerman outlines in this book that humans mastered nature in the Industrial Age and now in the Anthropocene era we must be dedicated to solving the problems we brought on from industrialization - encouraging the relentless problem solvers and creative minds among us to come up with long-term sustainable solutions for the future of planet Earth.This was the first book I have read by Diane Ackerman and I am really looking forward to reading her other works.
20,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4934590-david-yoon,3,"Maybe we don’t need another book telling us how we as a species are having untold effects on the planet. Climate change, animal extinction, oceanic pollution, energy issues - we face severe challenges but Ackerman is an optimist (and a poet besides). She explores innovative solutions that showcase our resourcefulness as a species and is cautiously optimistic about our ability to solve some of the very problems we’ve created. Like other books of it’s ilk, she can only offer fleeting glimpses of our ingenuity as she cruises on to the next but it is with an infectious sense of wonder. "
21,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4546014-cathryn-wellner,4,"I found this book fascinating, both for Ackerman's take on what has come to be called the Anthropocene and for the many examples she gives of people making strides to mitigate our abuse of the planet. In some ways I would have liked fewer examples and more exploration of them, but as an overview of our impact on our earthship it is thought provoking. And as a nudge for all of us to consider how we can be part of the solution to our environmental ills, it is an important book."
22,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29326917-silea,2,"I'm not sure it's fair to say i 'read' this book. I certainly skimmed it. Well, as much as i could while rolling my eyes constantly at the malicious abuse of the english language. I'd never seen purple prose in non-fiction before (well, excluding biographies), so i guess i can tick that off the Bucket List."
23,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25497151-bruce,1,"I had to return this book before I finished reading it, but I probably would have abandoned it anyway. Her observations on our modern world are hardly insightful. She mostly just states what to most of us who pay attention would deem to be obvious. Pretty dull stuff."
24,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4605502-david-melbie,4,This book is wonderful and I loved it! Humanity happens!
25,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22851642-rose,4,Reads like a collection of essays rather than a sustained narrative but interesting and lively with some intriguing ideas of how to fix the world's current predicament.
26,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79272479-excuse-all-the-blood,2,"Half lament to the earth, half salute to human ingenuity, the information in this 310 page book probably could have been aptly summarized in 20 pages. Most of these pages were filled with anti-descriptive metaphors and similes. One paragraph compared the size of DNA to the size of a gnat whisker. A. Gnat. Whisker. Three thoughts: A) Do gnats even have whiskers? B) Even if they do, having never seen one I don’t see how the comparison helps anyone establish a greater understanding of DNA or it’s sizeC) “Smaller than a gnat whisker” sounds like a phrase that should only be used by your southern MeeMaw - not in books attempting to maintain a scientific tone. Despite this, the 20 pages of information that could be sieved through awful similes was very interesting and thought provoking. 4 stars for the spattering of good information, zero stars for gnat whiskers. Average it out, 2 stars."
27,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28108653-steve-comstock,4,"Full of perspective. This is my first Ackerman book, and I'm addicted. She is remarkable. She has the ability to talk about big issues in an approachable, almost lighthearted way. The Human Age takes a step back and takes a look at the Anthropocene age (a term some experts use, notably Paul Crutzen to refer to the current geological age) and the ascent of human file over the planet. Ackerman examines our humble origins and the thresholds of discovery we have yet to cross. She is honest about our mistakes, our disregard for the earth, our sometimes unwise decisions to change the earth into our likeness, but she is optimistic about our future. "
28,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1753204-marcy,5,"Quite an extraordinary book. The writing is poetic and the ideas provocative. The book really pushes you to ask new kinds of questions about our role on the planet, the not-so-thin line separating nature and not nature. Plus there are so many fascinating projects profiled in the book. I relished every page."
29,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36478217-steven-e-farley,3,"I wish I could give half stars. Three feels a bit too harsh, four feels a bit too generous. Diane Ackerman is an excellent writer. The problem here is perhaps the book is almost more concerned with being a colorfully written than dealing with the content at hand. And there is surely some good content, if a bit unorganized. Most of the chapters here skirt the edge of current science so as to more appropriately be titled ""Science Now"" (admittedly that's not a terribly creative title). It doesn't delve into our past as much as it fancies our future. There are interesting anecdotes and stories of monkeys interacting with technology, humans with the environment, and computers with everything. Many topics are cause for reflection and thought, and as already mentioned the language is at times inspiringly descriptive. This is writing that borders on poetic flourish. Alas focus is sacrificed for this beauty, and the book sometimes jumps from topic to topic without ever delivering a clear picture to the reader of just want the point of all of this is. It would have perhaps been more appropriately packaged as a series of articles in a tech or pop science publication. It meanders along saying ""look at how cool this is and look at how cool I'm describing it."" And indeed, they are both quite cool. However for a book with so much interesting content at hand it seems like the point somehow suffocated underneath its own weight. A misnomered title and a bit long-winded and aimless, it is still nonetheless a worthwhile journey through the edge of human knowledge and impact with a beautiful vividly colored viewfinder to peer into the mists of the future.

It was interesting, and made me want to learn more about a lot of what they covered. Recommended to fans of science, new developments, and interesting ways for ideas to come together. I feel like I learned a lot from it. "

This book is all about wordy descriptions, unnecessary adjectives and adverbs, a lot of empty space. If you're curious about the Anthropocene (The Human Age) and want some actual content, try Kolbert's 'The Sixth Extinction'. Yes, it's a bit darker, but it actually talks about the way humans have shaped the world instead of just narrating pictures while wearing out the spine on a thesaurus."
41,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1532739-cary,2,"This book didn't do much for me - for a few reasons. First, it didn't present anything particularly new (to me at least). Second, it was, as far as I got, anecdotal. And, finally, it was very unfocused. If there was a point to it beyond the author gee-whizzing about how we've changed the world more than any other species in recent geologic history, it was not apparent.There's nothing wrong with a synthesis book, but after having read several of Jared Diamond's books that explore similar themes, this book just didn't cut it."

This is not a doomsday book on the future of us as a human race, is it a warning, yes. Ackerman looks at history and the changes the earth and humans have already made, and then compares them to the NOW, in a way that makes one think of the ways we feel we are conserving and what still needs to be done. She also doesn't ""blame"" all humans on the evolution changes, but also looks at the animal kingdom itself, changes happen, it is part of evolution as a whole. "

It was interesting, educational and with such beauty in the written word itself. Diane Ackerman writes poetry with her prose. I listened to this as an audio book and I know I missed some ideas because I was so busy envisioning and reveling in what she had just described that I failed to follow her to the next sentence.

To say it is a scientific book does not do justice to the clever and beautiful writing of Diane Ackerman . Each chapter was a story unto itself, about people, animals, the human body, our planet. No lecturing and scolding but some wonderful stories and insights that really make you think. I will have to research her other books to see what else I will want to read of Ackerman. "

So much disparate and gorgeous information woven together and presented in a tantalizing package makes her such a unique and laudable writer. But if each sentence is read individually and not in a pell-mell rush forward, the lushness and silliness sometimes is overwhelming. I don't like this cover or title."

Ackerman does an excellent job of making the book approachable and understandable by the layperson, and her uses of her own life choices and effects on the earth neatly brings it all home to each of us.

54,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,2,"A disappointing bookAckerman is fairly good, though nothing extraordinary, until about three-fifths in, then she kind of loses it.First, on 172, she calls the quantum world and the technology it has spawned a “high-tech shamanism.”Wrong on multiple accounts. First, we can’t see, say, most subatomic particles. But, at a slightly higher level, we can see the tracks of their disintegration or collision in cloud chambers and through other devices, and the empirical evidence matches theoretical predictions. This is not the case with alleged gods and ghosts.Second, she misdefines actual shamanism. Per the likes of Mircea Eliade and other scholars of comparative religion, true shamans are intermediaries between their people on earth and the high sky god. Shamanism is not pantheism.A few pages later, like many science writers today, she goes overboard on a love for all things “neuro-.” Checking in with a good philosopher of mind (or even an OK one like myself) would be helpful. Yes, everything does rewire our brains. EVERYthing. That includes farting in bed.Next, the nano-world chapter. First, feeling love for a Ray Kurzweil prediction is always a way to start losing me.Second, claiming silver “kills microbes” is not true. Rather, silver ions are better at killing many (tho not all) microbes than ions of other heavy metals, which have similar antibiotic powers. The deal is that cooper is usually in bronze, not pure copper, and copper oxidizes where silver doesn’t.. Gold is far more expensive. Antimony, arsenic, mercury and lead are all far more toxic to humans than silver. Sadly, silver nanoparticles appear to be turning into a health gimmick, like copper in the past. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligody...After that, she assumes we will get used to living inside a digital bubble. Salvific technologists generally make such assumptions. And there’s no guarantee they’ll be true. At least not if she means “adapt well” rather than “adapt haltingly and very imperfectly.”Next, an error. Stirrups did supply lateral stability. But not front-to-rear stability. She doesn’t directly claim that they did, but she goes on to from talking about bowmen and javelinists on horseback benefiting from lateral stability to talking about knights charging on lances. She may not have meant to imply that stirrups give front-to-back stability, but she certainly opened the door for people like me to infer she did.And, I’ll definitely pass on a borg-based internet. Ackerman wrote before the worst of Facebook (so far) arose, but even half a dozen years ago, one could have had some sort of guess, just from Shrub Bush, then Dear Leader, spying on people via the NSA, that a Borg-based Net is a horrible idea.Next after that? No, plants don’t chat. Plants may, if I allow that much, not anthropomorphizing but zoomorphizing, may communicate in some generic way. But plants don’t chat and they sure as hell don’t text. There’s no intentionality that I see. Plants also aren’t “barbaric” or many other things. Chimps, like humans, may be murderous; Venus flytraps are not. I have no problem extending human consciousness attributes to animals that have a certain level of consciousness; that includes not only primates, but at least corvids among birds, cetaceans and pachyderms as well as canids and equines among mammals; and squids and octopi among mollusks. Likewise, when a robot reaches that level of consciousness (which I don’t expect in my lifetime), I’ll do it there too. Per Jessica Riskin, I wouldn’t even attribute “agency” short of consciousness to plants. And, in any case, Riskin’s concept is about agency, period — not emotions, let alone Humean passions, driving agentic decisions.Chapter after that, “Robots on a Date,” Ackerman is surprisingly gullible — no other word for it — about chatbots talking to each other and the sensibility level of their communication. The example she cites isn’t tremendously beyond what we would have had 50 years ago if two Elizas of Joseph Weizenbaum fame had been made able to chat with each other. It’s certainly not that far beyond the actual Eliza-human interactions.That’s a kind of anti-speciesism, if you will, albeit naïve at best, gullible and uninformed at worst. Weirdly, it comes after committing high-level speciesism in the previous chapter by saying that robots can’t be conscious in the way humans are because their consciousness can’t be embodied. Technically true, if you’re limiting “body” to a carbon-and-water based sac of gel weighing about 80-100 kilograms. In the broader sense of “embodied cognition,” totally untrue, of course.Also, while Ackerman can wax poetic in her language, she can also wax inaccurate. Having a screw in a bone to help fix a break is NOT “bionic.” If she didn’t watch “Six Million Dollar Man,” Merriam Webster will straighten her out. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dicti...Finally (and not the first time I’ve complained about a blurb/PR authorial photo for a book … it’s vaguely offputting to see one that’s at least 15 years old as of the time the book was written. I just have this vague feeling that she’s almost a polar opposite of, say, a Barbara Ehrenreich on aging and dying issues. The photo, the yearning for Kurzweilian ideas, and other things all just seem to point to that."

84,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,2,"A disappointing bookAckerman is fairly good, though nothing extraordinary, until about three-fifths in, then she kind of loses it.First, on 172, she calls the quantum world and the technology it has spawned a “high-tech shamanism.”Wrong on multiple accounts. First, we can’t see, say, most subatomic particles. But, at a slightly higher level, we can see the tracks of their disintegration or collision in cloud chambers and through other devices, and the empirical evidence matches theoretical predictions. This is not the case with alleged gods and ghosts.Second, she misdefines actual shamanism. Per the likes of Mircea Eliade and other scholars of comparative religion, true shamans are intermediaries between their people on earth and the high sky god. Shamanism is not pantheism.A few pages later, like many science writers today, she goes overboard on a love for all things “neuro-.” Checking in with a good philosopher of mind (or even an OK one like myself) would be helpful. Yes, everything does rewire our brains. EVERYthing. That includes farting in bed.Next, the nano-world chapter. First, feeling love for a Ray Kurzweil prediction is always a way to start losing me.Second, claiming silver “kills microbes” is not true. Rather, silver ions are better at killing many (tho not all) microbes than ions of other heavy metals, which have similar antibiotic powers. The deal is that cooper is usually in bronze, not pure copper, and copper oxidizes where silver doesn’t.. Gold is far more expensive. Antimony, arsenic, mercury and lead are all far more toxic to humans than silver. Sadly, silver nanoparticles appear to be turning into a health gimmick, like copper in the past. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligody...After that, she assumes we will get used to living inside a digital bubble. Salvific technologists generally make such assumptions. And there’s no guarantee they’ll be true. At least not if she means “adapt well” rather than “adapt haltingly and very imperfectly.”Next, an error. Stirrups did supply lateral stability. But not front-to-rear stability. She doesn’t directly claim that they did, but she goes on to from talking about bowmen and javelinists on horseback benefiting from lateral stability to talking about knights charging on lances. She may not have meant to imply that stirrups give front-to-back stability, but she certainly opened the door for people like me to infer she did.And, I’ll definitely pass on a borg-based internet. Ackerman wrote before the worst of Facebook (so far) arose, but even half a dozen years ago, one could have had some sort of guess, just from Shrub Bush, then Dear Leader, spying on people via the NSA, that a Borg-based Net is a horrible idea.Next after that? No, plants don’t chat. Plants may, if I allow that much, not anthropomorphizing but zoomorphizing, may communicate in some generic way. But plants don’t chat and they sure as hell don’t text. There’s no intentionality that I see. Plants also aren’t “barbaric” or many other things. Chimps, like humans, may be murderous; Venus flytraps are not. I have no problem extending human consciousness attributes to animals that have a certain level of consciousness; that includes not only primates, but at least corvids among birds, cetaceans and pachyderms as well as canids and equines among mammals; and squids and octopi among mollusks. Likewise, when a robot reaches that level of consciousness (which I don’t expect in my lifetime), I’ll do it there too. Per Jessica Riskin, I wouldn’t even attribute “agency” short of consciousness to plants. And, in any case, Riskin’s concept is about agency, period — not emotions, let alone Humean passions, driving agentic decisions.Chapter after that, “Robots on a Date,” Ackerman is surprisingly gullible — no other word for it — about chatbots talking to each other and the sensibility level of their communication. The example she cites isn’t tremendously beyond what we would have had 50 years ago if two Elizas of Joseph Weizenbaum fame had been made able to chat with each other. It’s certainly not that far beyond the actual Eliza-human interactions.That’s a kind of anti-speciesism, if you will, albeit naïve at best, gullible and uninformed at worst. Weirdly, it comes after committing high-level speciesism in the previous chapter by saying that robots can’t be conscious in the way humans are because their consciousness can’t be embodied. Technically true, if you’re limiting “body” to a carbon-and-water based sac of gel weighing about 80-100 kilograms. In the broader sense of “embodied cognition,” totally untrue, of course.Also, while Ackerman can wax poetic in her language, she can also wax inaccurate. Having a screw in a bone to help fix a break is NOT “bionic.” If she didn’t watch “Six Million Dollar Man,” Merriam Webster will straighten her out. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dicti...Finally (and not the first time I’ve complained about a blurb/PR authorial photo for a book … it’s vaguely offputting to see one that’s at least 15 years old as of the time the book was written. I just have this vague feeling that she’s almost a polar opposite of, say, a Barbara Ehrenreich on aging and dying issues. The photo, the yearning for Kurzweilian ideas, and other things all just seem to point to that."

90,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5071406-kat-asharya,3,"I was a huge fan of Ackerman's A Natural History of the Senses and A Natural History of Love, both of which I adored for their sensuous, rich language and heartfelt erudition. Ackerman's poetic and emotional sensibility really suited the subject matter of those books, which felt like masterworks of scientific writing that managed to connect heart and mind. Here, I felt there was a mismatch between her approach and the subject matter: the language felt a bit ""purple"" at times (though still often beautiful) and the emotional approach towards a new age of science and technology defined by human intervention came across a bit daft and uncritical in certain moments. I also felt the book often read as scattered, mostly because it felt unstructured -- it's best to dip in and out of the essays here, a bit like reading a blog or a website. There is still so much fascinating material here, though, especially if you're interested in science, technology and what's coming down the pike, that it was often still a pleasure to read. And it's refreshing to read something with such optimism and hope about the future and humans' ingenuity in tackling its challenges. I only hope Ackerman's faith in our cleverness proves right..."

There are also a lot of fascinating technologies that she introduces to the reader. An enlightening read.""For ages, nature was the only place we went to feel surrounded by forces larger than ourselves. Now our cities, buildings, and technologies are also playing that role....An important part of the landscape, our built environment is an expression of nature...""""On land, humans figure as a geologic agent comparable to the relentless power of erosion or volcanic eruption, and in the oceans, our impact is on par with an asteroid's.

We are now in the era of the Anthropocene - Human Age - a name which emphasises our unparalleled dominion over the whole planet. Never before has one species been able to radically alter the entire natural world. And it is with this that the book begins. The overall feeling of the book is positive, even exciting, although climate change and other destruction we've created in our conquest of the planet must also be addressed and some of the new technology we're creating will have worrying moral and practical implications in the future. It was a very accessible read, it wasn't a heavy read loaded in scientific jargon, and the author met and worked with many people that were involved with the different subjects in the book."

Where to start... fascinating detail about 3D printing using human cells. I didn't know the extent of this even now, and it will only grow and help us renew and recover in future, our relationship to Genghis Khan and his proliferative ways, how significantly the experiences of our ancestors still affect our individual genomes today. The final chapter about our relationship with microbes was a real eye opener - I knew they were a big part of our lives but the extent is so much greater than I thought. Really interesting, very well developed information, told in a thoughtful and compelling way. Well done, Diane Ackerman."

A poet and an anthropologist -what a great combo: readers get the facts, and those facts are so beautifully worded that they stay with you for years and years. I still have lines from her previous works pop into my head 15 to 20 years later and I love that. This book had a few too many other voices for a 5 star review- Ackerman does her research impeccably, but in this new piece she quotes her sources more often than not. Since it's her voice I want to hear, these read like interruptions and I started skimming those to get back to the poet's voice as soon as I could. So...not Natural History of the Senses, et al., but I'll always look forward to her next work."

This is an ambitious subject to tackle, and sadly I kept feeling like Ackerman was unsuited for the task. Even within individual chapters, Ackerman jumped so quickly between ideas that it was impossible to read without having to constant re-read. Just when I got into a particular exploration I was distracted by Ackerman's over-the-top writing style (way too many adjectives and similes that were serious stretches) and the numerous typographical errors. This may seem petty, but I kept feeling like she was bragging (did I mention I'm a private pilot?) Kudos to the cover designer - it will be beautiful on my coffee table!"
96,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3196101-zachary,2,"This was an odd book. For the first half or so, I really enjoyed it and its poetic take on humanity's effects upon and relationship with nature. There is a great beauty there, and a loveliness of spirit. However, and I can't say for certain if this is me, or if the author's writing changed, but the second half increasingly grated on me. The language got way too purple and fanciful. I ended up annoyed, and waiting for the book to be over. I hate it when that happens, and I don't enjoy or appreciate the feeling of having claw my way to the end of a book. So I find myself puzzled. I thought for a while that this would be a book to which I would give five stars, and now I find myself giving it only two.

There are a lot of great musings about humans' place in nature and how the species has affected the planet on an unprecedented scale in many ways. There are also a lot of fascinating technologies that she introduces to the reader. An enlightening read.""For ages, nature was the only place we went to feel surrounded by forces larger than ourselves. Now our cities, buildings, and technologies are also playing that role....An important part of the landscape, our built environment is an expression of nature...""""On land, humans figure as a geologic agent comparable to the relentless power of erosion or volcanic eruption, and in the oceans, our impact is on par with an asteroid's. The reef death we've caused will be visible in the fossil record.""""Our mistakes are legion, but our talent is immeasurable.""Definitely recommend for those interested in environment, science, and philosophical musings on the human species."
122,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12791344-natasha,5,"A very interesting and timely read on the status of us humans and our planet; the amazing (and destructible) things we've achieved and the even more amazing things we're capable of in the future. We are now in the era of the Anthropocene - Human Age - a name which emphasises our unparalleled dominion over the whole planet. Never before has one species been able to radically alter the entire natural world. And it is with this that the book begins. The overall feeling of the book is positive, even exciting, although climate change and other destruction we've created in our conquest of the planet must also be addressed and some of the new technology we're creating will have worrying moral and practical implications in the future. It was a very accessible read, it wasn't a heavy read loaded in scientific jargon, and the author met and worked with many people that were involved with the different subjects in the book."
123,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11898448-bev-simpson,5,"Wow, fascinating book - absolutely chock full of interesting facts and detailed descriptions of subjects of great significance to humans and the planet we share with others. Where to start... fascinating detail about 3D printing using human cells. I didn't know the extent of this even now, and it will only grow and help us renew and recover in future, our relationship to Genghis Khan and his proliferative ways, how significantly the experiences of our ancestors still affect our individual genomes today. The final chapter about our relationship with microbes was a real eye opener - I knew they were a big part of our lives but the extent is so much greater than I thought. Really interesting, very well developed information, told in a thoughtful and compelling way. Well done, Diane Ackerman."
124,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10685004-chris,4,"I'm a huge fan of Ackerman- she's in my top 5 favorite non-fiction writers. A poet and an anthropologist -what a great combo: readers get the facts, and those facts are so beautifully worded that they stay with you for years and years. I still have lines from her previous works pop into my head 15 to 20 years later and I love that. This book had a few too many other voices for a 5 star review- Ackerman does her research impeccably, but in this new piece she quotes her sources more often than not. Since it's her voice I want to hear, these read like interruptions and I started skimming those to get back to the poet's voice as soon as I could. So...not Natural History of the Senses, et al., but I'll always look forward to her next work."
125,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17751474-callie,2,"I wanted to love this book, but I ended up loving the cover art more than what was inside... This is an ambitious subject to tackle, and sadly I kept feeling like Ackerman was unsuited for the task. Even within individual chapters, Ackerman jumped so quickly between ideas that it was impossible to read without having to constant re-read. Just when I got into a particular exploration I was distracted by Ackerman's over-the-top writing style (way too many adjectives and similes that were serious stretches) and the numerous typographical errors. This may seem petty, but I kept feeling like she was bragging (did I mention I'm a private pilot?) Kudos to the cover designer - it will be beautiful on my coffee table!"
126,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3196101-zachary,2,"This was an odd book. For the first half or so, I really enjoyed it and its poetic take on humanity's effects upon and relationship with nature. There is a great beauty there, and a loveliness of spirit. However, and I can't say for certain if this is me, or if the author's writing changed, but the second half increasingly grated on me. The language got way too purple and fanciful. I ended up annoyed, and waiting for the book to be over. I hate it when that happens, and I don't enjoy or appreciate the feeling of having claw my way to the end of a book. So I find myself puzzled. I thought for a while that this would be a book to which I would give five stars, and now I find myself giving it only two. Very odd, and very disappointing, as the central message of the book is a good one."
127,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1804873-francine,4,"Written by a celebrated author; this woman knows her science! Ackerman is a naturalist, living in Ithaca, NY and is an author, poet and sometimes a college professor. Aren't we lucky that we can read her books to become better aware of our natural world?I really liked this book. The language is clear, even vivid at times. The book is written with an optimistic tone even though so much is wrong with the world today.The writing reminds me a bit of Jared Diamond, if you haven't read him, you should.Highly recommended.Also, extensive Notes and Bibliography give the reader opportunities for further exploration."
128,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15164426-steph-bader,5,"I love Ackerman - her writing is a feast for the mind. This, her latest, is no exception. She takes us through what we as humans have done to our world, talks about some of the innovations that are being created to solve for the damage we have done, and then launches into a delightful discussion of biology, epigenetics and the growing understanding of our microbial components. She left me thinking and wondering, with a slim hope that there might be solutions to our seeming rush to global disaster, and a renewed wonder of the science that's happening as we speak. Read this book. It was a true pleasure."
129,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16181797-wayland-smith,3,"A far ranging book, this talks about how humans have changed the planet. The author covers a lot of green technology options, but it's not just about that. She also talks about new developments in gene research, prosthetics, 3D printing, and other world-changing developments. There's a lot of research and a lot of varied ideas. There are so many different ones that, while they are all explained well, there's not a ton of depth on any of them. It was interesting, and made me want to learn more about a lot of what they covered. Recommended to fans of science, new developments, and interesting ways for ideas to come together. I feel like I learned a lot from it. "
130,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3736078-uwe-hook,2,"I can imagine someone listening to the audiobook of this and wondering if, instead of pages full of text, the book is actually a picture-heavy coffeetable book. This book is all about wordy descriptions, unnecessary adjectives and adverbs, a lot of empty space. If you're curious about the Anthropocene (The Human Age) and want some actual content, try Kolbert's 'The Sixth Extinction'. Yes, it's a bit darker, but it actually talks about the way humans have shaped the world instead of just narrating pictures while wearing out the spine on a thesaurus."
131,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1532739-cary,2,"This book didn't do much for me - for a few reasons. First, it didn't present anything particularly new (to me at least). Second, it was, as far as I got, anecdotal. And, finally, it was very unfocused. If there was a point to it beyond the author gee-whizzing about how we've changed the world more than any other species in recent geologic history, it was not apparent.There's nothing wrong with a synthesis book, but after having read several of Jared Diamond's books that explore similar themes, this book just didn't cut it."

The challenges are enormous but thinkers and doers are on a good track."
133,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5406525-janette-mcmahon,4,"A very readable nonfiction concerning the changes that both human and nature itself has on our environment. This is not a doomsday book on the future of us as a human race, is it a warning, yes. Ackerman looks at history and the changes the earth and humans have already made, and then compares them to the NOW, in a way that makes one think of the ways we feel we are conserving and what still needs to be done. She also doesn't ""blame"" all humans on the evolution changes, but also looks at the animal kingdom itself, changes happen, it is part of evolution as a whole. "
134,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10453515-shawndra,5,"I enjoyed this book both for the content and for the writing. It was interesting, educational and with such beauty in the written word itself. Diane Ackerman writes poetry with her prose. I listened to this as an audio book and I know I missed some ideas because I was so busy envisioning and reveling in what she had just described that I failed to follow her to the next sentence. If you are a writer of fiction or non-fiction, read this book to learn how to make a simple sentence polished, clear, and beautiful."
135,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7272199-mike-steinharter,5,"This was a wonderful book. To say it is a scientific book does not do justice to the clever and beautiful writing of Diane Ackerman . Each chapter was a story unto itself, about people, animals, the human body, our planet. No lecturing and scolding but some wonderful stories and insights that really make you think. I will have to research her other books to see what else I will want to read of Ackerman. "
136,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2266545-allyson,4,"As with almost everyone of her books, I found this almost amazing and just a little but annoying. So much disparate and gorgeous information woven together and presented in a tantalizing package makes her such a unique and laudable writer. But if each sentence is read individually and not in a pell-mell rush forward, the lushness and silliness sometimes is overwhelming. I don't like this cover or title."
137,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1335578-maggie,4,"This book, about the effects of humans on the earth, is broken into sections, which makes it both easier to understand and gives the reader a small break in the science. Ackerman does an excellent job of making the book approachable and understandable by the layperson, and her uses of her own life choices and effects on the earth neatly brings it all home to each of us. This was not a book that drove me to read it, but it was always interesting and very informative. "

The second half of the book seemed to be somewhat off topic. The first half was all about the environment and how humans interact with nature but the second half was all about future technologies in all fields, not just the environment. The book was very interesting but I feel like all the various topics could have been related together better. "

This is not a doomsday book on the future of us as a human race, is it a warning, yes. Ackerman looks at history and the changes the earth and humans have already made, and then compares them to the NOW, in a way that makes one think of the ways we feel we are conserving and what still needs to be done. She also doesn't ""blame"" all humans on the evolution changes, but also looks at the animal kingdom itself, changes happen, it is part of evolution as a whole. "

I listened to this as an audio book and I know I missed some ideas because I was so busy envisioning and reveling in what she had just described that I failed to follow her to the next sentence. If you are a writer of fiction or non-fiction, read this book to learn how to make a simple sentence polished, clear, and beautiful."

To say it is a scientific book does not do justice to the clever and beautiful writing of Diane Ackerman . Each chapter was a story unto itself, about people, animals, the human body, our planet. No lecturing and scolding but some wonderful stories and insights that really make you think. I will have to research her other books to see what else I will want to read of Ackerman. "

So much disparate and gorgeous information woven together and presented in a tantalizing package makes her such a unique and laudable writer.

Ackerman does an excellent job of making the book approachable and understandable by the layperson, and her uses of her own life choices and effects on the earth neatly brings it all home to each of us.

174,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,2,"A disappointing bookAckerman is fairly good, though nothing extraordinary, until about three-fifths in, then she kind of loses it.First, on 172, she calls the quantum world and the technology it has spawned a “high-tech shamanism.”Wrong on multiple accounts. First, we can’t see, say, most subatomic particles. But, at a slightly higher level, we can see the tracks of their disintegration or collision in cloud chambers and through other devices, and the empirical evidence matches theoretical predictions. This is not the case with alleged gods and ghosts.Second, she misdefines actual shamanism. Per the likes of Mircea Eliade and other scholars of comparative religion, true shamans are intermediaries between their people on earth and the high sky god. Shamanism is not pantheism.A few pages later, like many science writers today, she goes overboard on a love for all things “neuro-.” Checking in with a good philosopher of mind (or even an OK one like myself) would be helpful. Yes, everything does rewire our brains. EVERYthing. That includes farting in bed.Next, the nano-world chapter. First, feeling love for a Ray Kurzweil prediction is always a way to start losing me.Second, claiming silver “kills microbes” is not true. Rather, silver ions are better at killing many (tho not all) microbes than ions of other heavy metals, which have similar antibiotic powers. The deal is that cooper is usually in bronze, not pure copper, and copper oxidizes where silver doesn’t.. Gold is far more expensive. Antimony, arsenic, mercury and lead are all far more toxic to humans than silver. Sadly, silver nanoparticles appear to be turning into a health gimmick, like copper in the past. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligody...After that, she assumes we will get used to living inside a digital bubble. Salvific technologists generally make such assumptions. And there’s no guarantee they’ll be true. At least not if she means “adapt well” rather than “adapt haltingly and very imperfectly.”Next, an error. Stirrups did supply lateral stability. But not front-to-rear stability. She doesn’t directly claim that they did, but she goes on to from talking about bowmen and javelinists on horseback benefiting from lateral stability to talking about knights charging on lances. She may not have meant to imply that stirrups give front-to-back stability, but she certainly opened the door for people like me to infer she did.And, I’ll definitely pass on a borg-based internet. Ackerman wrote before the worst of Facebook (so far) arose, but even half a dozen years ago, one could have had some sort of guess, just from Shrub Bush, then Dear Leader, spying on people via the NSA, that a Borg-based Net is a horrible idea.Next after that? No, plants don’t chat. Plants may, if I allow that much, not anthropomorphizing but zoomorphizing, may communicate in some generic way. But plants don’t chat and they sure as hell don’t text. There’s no intentionality that I see. Plants also aren’t “barbaric” or many other things. Chimps, like humans, may be murderous; Venus flytraps are not. I have no problem extending human consciousness attributes to animals that have a certain level of consciousness; that includes not only primates, but at least corvids among birds, cetaceans and pachyderms as well as canids and equines among mammals; and squids and octopi among mollusks. Likewise, when a robot reaches that level of consciousness (which I don’t expect in my lifetime), I’ll do it there too. Per Jessica Riskin, I wouldn’t even attribute “agency” short of consciousness to plants. And, in any case, Riskin’s concept is about agency, period — not emotions, let alone Humean passions, driving agentic decisions.Chapter after that, “Robots on a Date,” Ackerman is surprisingly gullible — no other word for it — about chatbots talking to each other and the sensibility level of their communication. The example she cites isn’t tremendously beyond what we would have had 50 years ago if two Elizas of Joseph Weizenbaum fame had been made able to chat with each other. It’s certainly not that far beyond the actual Eliza-human interactions.That’s a kind of anti-speciesism, if you will, albeit naïve at best, gullible and uninformed at worst. Weirdly, it comes after committing high-level speciesism in the previous chapter by saying that robots can’t be conscious in the way humans are because their consciousness can’t be embodied. Technically true, if you’re limiting “body” to a carbon-and-water based sac of gel weighing about 80-100 kilograms. In the broader sense of “embodied cognition,” totally untrue, of course.Also, while Ackerman can wax poetic in her language, she can also wax inaccurate. Having a screw in a bone to help fix a break is NOT “bionic.” If she didn’t watch “Six Million Dollar Man,” Merriam Webster will straighten her out. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dicti...Finally (and not the first time I’ve complained about a blurb/PR authorial photo for a book … it’s vaguely offputting to see one that’s at least 15 years old as of the time the book was written. I just have this vague feeling that she’s almost a polar opposite of, say, a Barbara Ehrenreich on aging and dying issues. The photo, the yearning for Kurzweilian ideas, and other things all just seem to point to that."

Ackerman's poetic and emotional sensibility really suited the subject matter of those books, which felt like masterworks of scientific writing that managed to connect heart and mind. Here, I felt there was a mismatch between her approach and the subject matter: the language felt a bit ""purple"" at times (though still often beautiful) and the emotional approach towards a new age of science and technology defined by human intervention came across a bit daft and uncritical in certain moments. I also felt the book often read as scattered, mostly because it felt unstructured -- it's best to dip in and out of the essays here, a bit like reading a blog or a website. There is still so much fascinating material here, though, especially if you're interested in science, technology and what's coming down the pike, that it was often still a pleasure to read. And it's refreshing to read something with such optimism and hope about the future and humans' ingenuity in tackling its challenges. I only hope Ackerman's faith in our cleverness proves right..."

First, we can’t see, say, most subatomic particles. But, at a slightly higher level, we can see the tracks of their disintegration or collision in cloud chambers and through other devices, and the empirical evidence matches theoretical predictions. This is not the case with alleged gods and ghosts.Second, she misdefines actual shamanism. Per the likes of Mircea Eliade and other scholars of comparative religion, true shamans are intermediaries between their people on earth and the high sky god. Shamanism is not pantheism.A few pages later, like many science writers today, she goes overboard on a love for all things “neuro-.” Checking in with a good philosopher of mind (or even an OK one like myself) would be helpful. Yes, everything does rewire our brains. EVERYthing. That includes farting in bed.Next, the nano-world chapter. First, feeling love for a Ray Kurzweil prediction is always a way to start losing me.Second, claiming silver “kills microbes” is not true. Rather, silver ions are better at killing many (tho not all) microbes than ions of other heavy metals, which have similar antibiotic powers. The deal is that cooper is usually in bronze, not pure copper, and copper oxidizes where silver doesn’t.. Gold is far more expensive. Antimony, arsenic, mercury and lead are all far more toxic to humans than silver. Sadly, silver nanoparticles appear to be turning into a health gimmick, like copper in the past. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligody...After that, she assumes we will get used to living inside a digital bubble. Salvific technologists generally make such assumptions. And there’s no guarantee they’ll be true. At least not if she means “adapt well” rather than “adapt haltingly and very imperfectly.”Next, an error. Stirrups did supply lateral stability. But not front-to-rear stability. She doesn’t directly claim that they did, but she goes on to from talking about bowmen and javelinists on horseback benefiting from lateral stability to talking about knights charging on lances. She may not have meant to imply that stirrups give front-to-back stability, but she certainly opened the door for people like me to infer she did.And, I’ll definitely pass on a borg-based internet. Ackerman wrote before the worst of Facebook (so far) arose, but even half a dozen years ago, one could have had some sort of guess, just from Shrub Bush, then Dear Leader, spying on people via the NSA, that a Borg-based Net is a horrible idea.Next after that? No, plants don’t chat. Plants may, if I allow that much, not anthropomorphizing but zoomorphizing, may communicate in some generic way. But plants don’t chat and they sure as hell don’t text. There’s no intentionality that I see. Plants also aren’t “barbaric” or many other things. Chimps, like humans, may be murderous; Venus flytraps are not. I have no problem extending human consciousness attributes to animals that have a certain level of consciousness; that includes not only primates, but at least corvids among birds, cetaceans and pachyderms as well as canids and equines among mammals; and squids and octopi among mollusks. Likewise, when a robot reaches that level of consciousness (which I don’t expect in my lifetime), I’ll do it there too. Per Jessica Riskin, I wouldn’t even attribute “agency” short of consciousness to plants. And, in any case, Riskin’s concept is about agency, period — not emotions, let alone Humean passions, driving agentic decisions.Chapter after that, “Robots on a Date,” Ackerman is surprisingly gullible — no other word for it — about chatbots talking to each other and the sensibility level of their communication. The example she cites isn’t tremendously beyond what we would have had 50 years ago if two Elizas of Joseph Weizenbaum fame had been made able to chat with each other. It’s certainly not that far beyond the actual Eliza-human interactions.That’s a kind of anti-speciesism, if you will, albeit naïve at best, gullible and uninformed at worst. Weirdly, it comes after committing high-level speciesism in the previous chapter by saying that robots can’t be conscious in the way humans are because their consciousness can’t be embodied. Technically true, if you’re limiting “body” to a carbon-and-water based sac of gel weighing about 80-100 kilograms. In the broader sense of “embodied cognition,” totally untrue, of course.Also, while Ackerman can wax poetic in her language, she can also wax inaccurate. Having a screw in a bone to help fix a break is NOT “bionic.” If she didn’t watch “Six Million Dollar Man,” Merriam Webster will straighten her out. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dicti...Finally (and not the first time I’ve complained about a blurb/PR authorial photo for a book … it’s vaguely offputting to see one that’s at least 15 years old as of the time the book was written. I just have this vague feeling that she’s almost a polar opposite of, say, a Barbara Ehrenreich on aging and dying issues. The photo, the yearning for Kurzweilian ideas, and other things all just seem to point to that."

210,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5071406-kat-asharya,3,"I was a huge fan of Ackerman's A Natural History of the Senses and A Natural History of Love, both of which I adored for their sensuous, rich language and heartfelt erudition. Ackerman's poetic and emotional sensibility really suited the subject matter of those books, which felt like masterworks of scientific writing that managed to connect heart and mind. Here, I felt there was a mismatch between her approach and the subject matter: the language felt a bit ""purple"" at times (though still often beautiful) and the emotional approach towards a new age of science and technology defined by human intervention came across a bit daft and uncritical in certain moments. I also felt the book often read as scattered, mostly because it felt unstructured -- it's best to dip in and out of the essays here, a bit like reading a blog or a website. There is still so much fascinating material here, though, especially if you're interested in science, technology and what's coming down the pike, that it was often still a pleasure to read. And it's refreshing to read something with such optimism and hope about the future and humans' ingenuity in tackling its challenges. I only hope Ackerman's faith in our cleverness proves right..."
211,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40292411-nicole,4,"This author has such a unique perspective and such an eloquent way of articulating it. There are a lot of great musings about humans' place in nature and how the species has affected the planet on an unprecedented scale in many ways. There are also a lot of fascinating technologies that she introduces to the reader. An enlightening read.""For ages, nature was the only place we went to feel surrounded by forces larger than ourselves. Now our cities, buildings, and technologies are also playing that role....An important part of the landscape, our built environment is an expression of nature...""""On land, humans figure as a geologic agent comparable to the relentless power of erosion or volcanic eruption, and in the oceans, our impact is on par with an asteroid's. The reef death we've caused will be visible in the fossil record.""""Our mistakes are legion, but our talent is immeasurable.""Definitely recommend for those interested in environment, science, and philosophical musings on the human species."

We are now in the era of the Anthropocene - Human Age - a name which emphasises our unparalleled dominion over the whole planet. Never before has one species been able to radically alter the entire natural world. And it is with this that the book begins. The overall feeling of the book is positive, even exciting, although climate change and other destruction we've created in our conquest of the planet must also be addressed and some of the new technology we're creating will have worrying moral and practical implications in the future. It was a very accessible read, it wasn't a heavy read loaded in scientific jargon, and the author met and worked with many people that were involved with the different subjects in the book."

Where to start... fascinating detail about 3D printing using human cells. I didn't know the extent of this even now, and it will only grow and help us renew and recover in future, our relationship to Genghis Khan and his proliferative ways, how significantly the experiences of our ancestors still affect our individual genomes today. The final chapter about our relationship with microbes was a real eye opener - I knew they were a big part of our lives but the extent is so much greater than I thought. Really interesting, very well developed information, told in a thoughtful and compelling way. Well done, Diane Ackerman."

A poet and an anthropologist -what a great combo: readers get the facts, and those facts are so beautifully worded that they stay with you for years and years. I still have lines from her previous works pop into my head 15 to 20 years later and I love that. This book had a few too many other voices for a 5 star review- Ackerman does her research impeccably, but in this new piece she quotes her sources more often than not. Since it's her voice I want to hear, these read like interruptions and I started skimming those to get back to the poet's voice as soon as I could. So...not Natural History of the Senses, et al., but I'll always look forward to her next work."

This is an ambitious subject to tackle, and sadly I kept feeling like Ackerman was unsuited for the task. Even within individual chapters, Ackerman jumped so quickly between ideas that it was impossible to read without having to constant re-read. Just when I got into a particular exploration I was distracted by Ackerman's over-the-top writing style (way too many adjectives and similes that were serious stretches) and the numerous typographical errors. This may seem petty, but I kept feeling like she was bragging (did I mention I'm a private pilot?) Kudos to the cover designer - it will be beautiful on my coffee table!"
216,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3196101-zachary,2,"This was an odd book. For the first half or so, I really enjoyed it and its poetic take on humanity's effects upon and relationship with nature. There is a great beauty there, and a loveliness of spirit. However, and I can't say for certain if this is me, or if the author's writing changed, but the second half increasingly grated on me. The language got way too purple and fanciful. I ended up annoyed, and waiting for the book to be over. I hate it when that happens, and I don't enjoy or appreciate the feeling of having claw my way to the end of a book. So I find myself puzzled. I thought for a while that this would be a book to which I would give five stars, and now I find myself giving it only two. Very odd, and very disappointing, as the central message of the book is a good one."

She takes us through what we as humans have done to our world, talks about some of the innovations that are being created to solve for the damage we have done, and then launches into a delightful discussion of biology, epigenetics and the growing understanding of our microbial components. She left me thinking and wondering, with a slim hope that there might be solutions to our seeming rush to global disaster, and a renewed wonder of the science that's happening as we speak.

She also talks about new developments in gene research, prosthetics, 3D printing, and other world-changing developments. There's a lot of research and a lot of varied ideas. There are so many different ones that, while they are all explained well, there's not a ton of depth on any of them.

Where to start... fascinating detail about 3D printing using human cells. I didn't know the extent of this even now, and it will only grow and help us renew and recover in future, our relationship to Genghis Khan and his proliferative ways, how significantly the experiences of our ancestors still affect our individual genomes today. The final chapter about our relationship with microbes was a real eye opener - I knew they were a big part of our lives but the extent is so much greater than I thought. Really interesting, very well developed information, told in a thoughtful and compelling way. Well done, Diane Ackerman."
244,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10685004-chris,4,"I'm a huge fan of Ackerman- she's in my top 5 favorite non-fiction writers. A poet and an anthropologist -what a great combo: readers get the facts, and those facts are so beautifully worded that they stay with you for years and years. I still have lines from her previous works pop into my head 15 to 20 years later and I love that. This book had a few too many other voices for a 5 star review- Ackerman does her research impeccably, but in this new piece she quotes her sources more often than not. Since it's her voice I want to hear, these read like interruptions and I started skimming those to get back to the poet's voice as soon as I could. So...not Natural History of the Senses, et al., but I'll always look forward to her next work."
245,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17751474-callie,2,"I wanted to love this book, but I ended up loving the cover art more than what was inside... This is an ambitious subject to tackle, and sadly I kept feeling like Ackerman was unsuited for the task. Even within individual chapters, Ackerman jumped so quickly between ideas that it was impossible to read without having to constant re-read. Just when I got into a particular exploration I was distracted by Ackerman's over-the-top writing style (way too many adjectives and similes that were serious stretches) and the numerous typographical errors. This may seem petty, but I kept feeling like she was bragging (did I mention I'm a private pilot?) Kudos to the cover designer - it will be beautiful on my coffee table!"
246,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3196101-zachary,2,"This was an odd book. For the first half or so, I really enjoyed it and its poetic take on humanity's effects upon and relationship with nature. There is a great beauty there, and a loveliness of spirit. However, and I can't say for certain if this is me, or if the author's writing changed, but the second half increasingly grated on me. The language got way too purple and fanciful. I ended up annoyed, and waiting for the book to be over. I hate it when that happens, and I don't enjoy or appreciate the feeling of having claw my way to the end of a book. So I find myself puzzled. I thought for a while that this would be a book to which I would give five stars, and now I find myself giving it only two. Very odd, and very disappointing, as the central message of the book is a good one."
247,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1804873-francine,4,"Written by a celebrated author; this woman knows her science! Ackerman is a naturalist, living in Ithaca, NY and is an author, poet and sometimes a college professor. Aren't we lucky that we can read her books to become better aware of our natural world?I really liked this book. The language is clear, even vivid at times. The book is written with an optimistic tone even though so much is wrong with the world today.The writing reminds me a bit of Jared Diamond, if you haven't read him, you should.Highly recommended.Also, extensive Notes and Bibliography give the reader opportunities for further exploration."
248,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15164426-steph-bader,5,"I love Ackerman - her writing is a feast for the mind. This, her latest, is no exception. She takes us through what we as humans have done to our world, talks about some of the innovations that are being created to solve for the damage we have done, and then launches into a delightful discussion of biology, epigenetics and the growing understanding of our microbial components. She left me thinking and wondering, with a slim hope that there might be solutions to our seeming rush to global disaster, and a renewed wonder of the science that's happening as we speak. Read this book. It was a true pleasure."
249,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16181797-wayland-smith,3,"A far ranging book, this talks about how humans have changed the planet. The author covers a lot of green technology options, but it's not just about that. She also talks about new developments in gene research, prosthetics, 3D printing, and other world-changing developments. There's a lot of research and a lot of varied ideas. There are so many different ones that, while they are all explained well, there's not a ton of depth on any of them. It was interesting, and made me want to learn more about a lot of what they covered. Recommended to fans of science, new developments, and interesting ways for ideas to come together. I feel like I learned a lot from it. "
250,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3736078-uwe-hook,2,"I can imagine someone listening to the audiobook of this and wondering if, instead of pages full of text, the book is actually a picture-heavy coffeetable book. This book is all about wordy descriptions, unnecessary adjectives and adverbs, a lot of empty space. If you're curious about the Anthropocene (The Human Age) and want some actual content, try Kolbert's 'The Sixth Extinction'. Yes, it's a bit darker, but it actually talks about the way humans have shaped the world instead of just narrating pictures while wearing out the spine on a thesaurus."
251,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1532739-cary,2,"This book didn't do much for me - for a few reasons. First, it didn't present anything particularly new (to me at least). Second, it was, as far as I got, anecdotal. And, finally, it was very unfocused. If there was a point to it beyond the author gee-whizzing about how we've changed the world more than any other species in recent geologic history, it was not apparent.There's nothing wrong with a synthesis book, but after having read several of Jared Diamond's books that explore similar themes, this book just didn't cut it."

The challenges are enormous but thinkers and doers are on a good track."
253,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5406525-janette-mcmahon,4,"A very readable nonfiction concerning the changes that both human and nature itself has on our environment. This is not a doomsday book on the future of us as a human race, is it a warning, yes. Ackerman looks at history and the changes the earth and humans have already made, and then compares them to the NOW, in a way that makes one think of the ways we feel we are conserving and what still needs to be done. She also doesn't ""blame"" all humans on the evolution changes, but also looks at the animal kingdom itself, changes happen, it is part of evolution as a whole. "
254,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10453515-shawndra,5,"I enjoyed this book both for the content and for the writing. It was interesting, educational and with such beauty in the written word itself. Diane Ackerman writes poetry with her prose. I listened to this as an audio book and I know I missed some ideas because I was so busy envisioning and reveling in what she had just described that I failed to follow her to the next sentence. If you are a writer of fiction or non-fiction, read this book to learn how to make a simple sentence polished, clear, and beautiful."
255,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7272199-mike-steinharter,5,"This was a wonderful book. To say it is a scientific book does not do justice to the clever and beautiful writing of Diane Ackerman . Each chapter was a story unto itself, about people, animals, the human body, our planet. No lecturing and scolding but some wonderful stories and insights that really make you think. I will have to research her other books to see what else I will want to read of Ackerman. "
256,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2266545-allyson,4,"As with almost everyone of her books, I found this almost amazing and just a little but annoying. So much disparate and gorgeous information woven together and presented in a tantalizing package makes her such a unique and laudable writer. But if each sentence is read individually and not in a pell-mell rush forward, the lushness and silliness sometimes is overwhelming. I don't like this cover or title."
257,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1335578-maggie,4,"This book, about the effects of humans on the earth, is broken into sections, which makes it both easier to understand and gives the reader a small break in the science. Ackerman does an excellent job of making the book approachable and understandable by the layperson, and her uses of her own life choices and effects on the earth neatly brings it all home to each of us. This was not a book that drove me to read it, but it was always interesting and very informative. "

The second half of the book seemed to be somewhat off topic. The first half was all about the environment and how humans interact with nature but the second half was all about future technologies in all fields, not just the environment. The book was very interesting but I feel like all the various topics could have been related together better. "

It had just enough interesting material to keep me reading to page 137, when boringly skimming I realized all the information could be gleaned from 10 minutes on wikipedia and that I was annoyed, and waiting for the book to be over. So I quit. Persons concerned with global warming would likely love it."

It turned out to be just a recap of some of the new technology in-flight, with many of the tired comments on how technology is changing our youth, etc. I found Ackerman's fondness for high school essay-style metaphor pretty distracting and not very enlightening."

264,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,2,"A disappointing bookAckerman is fairly good, though nothing extraordinary, until about three-fifths in, then she kind of loses it.First, on 172, she calls the quantum world and the technology it has spawned a “high-tech shamanism.”Wrong on multiple accounts. First, we can’t see, say, most subatomic particles. But, at a slightly higher level, we can see the tracks of their disintegration or collision in cloud chambers and through other devices, and the empirical evidence matches theoretical predictions. This is not the case with alleged gods and ghosts.Second, she misdefines actual shamanism. Per the likes of Mircea Eliade and other scholars of comparative religion, true shamans are intermediaries between their people on earth and the high sky god. Shamanism is not pantheism.A few pages later, like many science writers today, she goes overboard on a love for all things “neuro-.” Checking in with a good philosopher of mind (or even an OK one like myself) would be helpful. Yes, everything does rewire our brains. EVERYthing. That includes farting in bed.Next, the nano-world chapter. First, feeling love for a Ray Kurzweil prediction is always a way to start losing me.Second, claiming silver “kills microbes” is not true. Rather, silver ions are better at killing many (tho not all) microbes than ions of other heavy metals, which have similar antibiotic powers. The deal is that cooper is usually in bronze, not pure copper, and copper oxidizes where silver doesn’t.. Gold is far more expensive.

Where to start... fascinating detail about 3D printing using human cells. I didn't know the extent of this even now, and it will only grow and help us renew and recover in future, our relationship to Genghis Khan and his proliferative ways, how significantly the experiences of our ancestors still affect our individual genomes today. The final chapter about our relationship with microbes was a real eye opener - I knew they were a big part of our lives but the extent is so much greater than I thought. Really interesting, very well developed information, told in a thoughtful and compelling way. Well done, Diane Ackerman."
274,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10685004-chris,4,"I'm a huge fan of Ackerman- she's in my top 5 favorite non-fiction writers. A poet and an anthropologist -what a great combo: readers get the facts, and those facts are so beautifully worded that they stay with you for years and years. I still have lines from her previous works pop into my head 15 to 20 years later and I love that. This book had a few too many other voices for a 5 star review- Ackerman does her research impeccably, but in this new piece she quotes her sources more often than not. Since it's her voice I want to hear, these read like interruptions and I started skimming those to get back to the poet's voice as soon as I could. So...not Natural History of the Senses, et al., but I'll always look forward to her next work."
275,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17751474-callie,2,"I wanted to love this book, but I ended up loving the cover art more than what was inside... This is an ambitious subject to tackle, and sadly I kept feeling like Ackerman was unsuited for the task. Even within individual chapters, Ackerman jumped so quickly between ideas that it was impossible to read without having to constant re-read. Just when I got into a particular exploration I was distracted by Ackerman's over-the-top writing style (way too many adjectives and similes that were serious stretches) and the numerous typographical errors. This may seem petty, but I kept feeling like she was bragging (did I mention I'm a private pilot?) Kudos to the cover designer - it will be beautiful on my coffee table!"
276,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3196101-zachary,2,"This was an odd book. For the first half or so, I really enjoyed it and its poetic take on humanity's effects upon and relationship with nature. There is a great beauty there, and a loveliness of spirit. However, and I can't say for certain if this is me, or if the author's writing changed, but the second half increasingly grated on me. The language got way too purple and fanciful. I ended up annoyed, and waiting for the book to be over. I hate it when that happens, and I don't enjoy or appreciate the feeling of having claw my way to the end of a book. So I find myself puzzled. I thought for a while that this would be a book to which I would give five stars, and now I find myself giving it only two. Very odd, and very disappointing, as the central message of the book is a good one."
277,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1804873-francine,4,"Written by a celebrated author; this woman knows her science! Ackerman is a naturalist, living in Ithaca, NY and is an author, poet and sometimes a college professor. Aren't we lucky that we can read her books to become better aware of our natural world?I really liked this book. The language is clear, even vivid at times. The book is written with an optimistic tone even though so much is wrong with the world today.The writing reminds me a bit of Jared Diamond, if you haven't read him, you should.Highly recommended.Also, extensive Notes and Bibliography give the reader opportunities for further exploration."
278,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15164426-steph-bader,5,"I love Ackerman - her writing is a feast for the mind. This, her latest, is no exception. She takes us through what we as humans have done to our world, talks about some of the innovations that are being created to solve for the damage we have done, and then launches into a delightful discussion of biology, epigenetics and the growing understanding of our microbial components. She left me thinking and wondering, with a slim hope that there might be solutions to our seeming rush to global disaster, and a renewed wonder of the science that's happening as we speak. Read this book. It was a true pleasure."
279,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16181797-wayland-smith,3,"A far ranging book, this talks about how humans have changed the planet. The author covers a lot of green technology options, but it's not just about that. She also talks about new developments in gene research, prosthetics, 3D printing, and other world-changing developments. There's a lot of research and a lot of varied ideas. There are so many different ones that, while they are all explained well, there's not a ton of depth on any of them. It was interesting, and made me want to learn more about a lot of what they covered. Recommended to fans of science, new developments, and interesting ways for ideas to come together. I feel like I learned a lot from it. "
280,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3736078-uwe-hook,2,"I can imagine someone listening to the audiobook of this and wondering if, instead of pages full of text, the book is actually a picture-heavy coffeetable book. This book is all about wordy descriptions, unnecessary adjectives and adverbs, a lot of empty space. If you're curious about the Anthropocene (The Human Age) and want some actual content, try Kolbert's 'The Sixth Extinction'. Yes, it's a bit darker, but it actually talks about the way humans have shaped the world instead of just narrating pictures while wearing out the spine on a thesaurus."
281,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1532739-cary,2,"This book didn't do much for me - for a few reasons. First, it didn't present anything particularly new (to me at least). Second, it was, as far as I got, anecdotal. And, finally, it was very unfocused. If there was a point to it beyond the author gee-whizzing about how we've changed the world more than any other species in recent geologic history, it was not apparent.There's nothing wrong with a synthesis book, but after having read several of Jared Diamond's books that explore similar themes, this book just didn't cut it."
282,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11227904-naila-hameed,3,"Totally Enjoyed reading the Human Age !This book is very informative, specially about latest advances in science and technology.Although it takes into account most of the environmental concerns , at the same time it is a very uplifting book.It talks about the latest advances in neuroscience, robotics, 3Dprinting, nanotechnology and a host of other fields of Science that make us look at the future with hope and awe.the speed of change is breathtaking and most of it is unexpected but very good. The challenges are enormous but thinkers and doers are on a good track."
283,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5406525-janette-mcmahon,4,"A very readable nonfiction concerning the changes that both human and nature itself has on our environment. This is not a doomsday book on the future of us as a human race, is it a warning, yes. Ackerman looks at history and the changes the earth and humans have already made, and then compares them to the NOW, in a way that makes one think of the ways we feel we are conserving and what still needs to be done. She also doesn't ""blame"" all humans on the evolution changes, but also looks at the animal kingdom itself, changes happen, it is part of evolution as a whole. "
284,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10453515-shawndra,5,"I enjoyed this book both for the content and for the writing. It was interesting, educational and with such beauty in the written word itself. Diane Ackerman writes poetry with her prose. I listened to this as an audio book and I know I missed some ideas because I was so busy envisioning and reveling in what she had just described that I failed to follow her to the next sentence. If you are a writer of fiction or non-fiction, read this book to learn how to make a simple sentence polished, clear, and beautiful."
285,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7272199-mike-steinharter,5,"This was a wonderful book. To say it is a scientific book does not do justice to the clever and beautiful writing of Diane Ackerman . Each chapter was a story unto itself, about people, animals, the human body, our planet. No lecturing and scolding but some wonderful stories and insights that really make you think. I will have to research her other books to see what else I will want to read of Ackerman. "
286,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2266545-allyson,4,"As with almost everyone of her books, I found this almost amazing and just a little but annoying. So much disparate and gorgeous information woven together and presented in a tantalizing package makes her such a unique and laudable writer. But if each sentence is read individually and not in a pell-mell rush forward, the lushness and silliness sometimes is overwhelming. I don't like this cover or title."
287,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1335578-maggie,4,"This book, about the effects of humans on the earth, is broken into sections, which makes it both easier to understand and gives the reader a small break in the science. Ackerman does an excellent job of making the book approachable and understandable by the layperson, and her uses of her own life choices and effects on the earth neatly brings it all home to each of us. This was not a book that drove me to read it, but it was always interesting and very informative. "
288,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10450353-marilyn,5,"Computer-communicating apes? Disappearing coral reefs. Transforming cities into dynamic ecosystems. Reanimating ancient Neanderthal DNA, technology-altered memory, and 3D printing with human cells for ""ink"" to recreate damaged body parts, mind-altering microbes. Diane Ackerman explains our future with humor and grace. We should read and be informed of what is happening to us now at warp speed. Astonishing."
289,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3481909-natalie,4,"This brought a lot of things to my attention. Made me want to work towards being kinder to the Earth. The second half of the book seemed to be somewhat off topic. The first half was all about the environment and how humans interact with nature but the second half was all about future technologies in all fields, not just the environment. The book was very interesting but I feel like all the various topics could have been related together better. "
290,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2455252-linda-hart,2,"Pretty dull stuff.This is a collection of various subjects related to current unrelated trends in environmental, biological, and medical science. It had just enough interesting material to keep me reading to page 137, when boringly skimming I realized all the information could be gleaned from 10 minutes on wikipedia and that I was annoyed, and waiting for the book to be over. So I quit. Persons concerned with global warming would likely love it."
291,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30791639-george-mcdonald,2,"I was pretty disappointed. I was expecting a scientific look at the impact humans are having on the globe. It turned out to be just a recap of some of the new technology in-flight, with many of the tired comments on how technology is changing our youth, etc. I found Ackerman's fondness for high school essay-style metaphor pretty distracting and not very enlightening."
292,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12241600-jan,4,"A very, very interesting book on the anthropocene (an informal geologic chronological term for the proposed epoch that began when human activities had a significant global impact on the Earth's ecosystems)Where we've been right up to where we are headed but it is in no way a doomsday book. Give it a read."
293,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15984398-laurie,4,"Overall very enlightening and tons of information about what humans have done to affect everything about the world: plants, animals, oceans, geography, weather, etc. And about how we can change more and hopefully for the better. A little ... um, not repetitious exactly, but the same sorts of information over and over so I was ready for it to end sooner. Lots of interesting stuff though."
294,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,2,"A disappointing bookAckerman is fairly good, though nothing extraordinary, until about three-fifths in, then she kind of loses it.First, on 172, she calls the quantum world and the technology it has spawned a “high-tech shamanism.”Wrong on multiple accounts. First, we can’t see, say, most subatomic particles. But, at a slightly higher level, we can see the tracks of their disintegration or collision in cloud chambers and through other devices, and the empirical evidence matches theoretical predictions. This is not the case with alleged gods and ghosts.Second, she misdefines actual shamanism. Per the likes of Mircea Eliade and other scholars of comparative religion, true shamans are intermediaries between their people on earth and the high sky god. Shamanism is not pantheism.A few pages later, like many science writers today, she goes overboard on a love for all things “neuro-.” Checking in with a good philosopher of mind (or even an OK one like myself) would be helpful. Yes, everything does rewire our brains. EVERYthing. That includes farting in bed.Next, the nano-world chapter. First, feeling love for a Ray Kurzweil prediction is always a way to start losing me.Second, claiming silver “kills microbes” is not true. Rather, silver ions are better at killing many (tho not all) microbes than ions of other heavy metals, which have similar antibiotic powers. The deal is that cooper is usually in bronze, not pure copper, and copper oxidizes where silver doesn’t.. Gold is far more expensive. Antimony, arsenic, mercury and lead are all far more toxic to humans than silver. Sadly, silver nanoparticles appear to be turning into a health gimmick, like copper in the past. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligody...After that, she assumes we will get used to living inside a digital bubble. Salvific technologists generally make such assumptions. And there’s no guarantee they’ll be true. At least not if she means “adapt well” rather than “adapt haltingly and very imperfectly.”Next, an error. Stirrups did supply lateral stability. But not front-to-rear stability. She doesn’t directly claim that they did, but she goes on to from talking about bowmen and javelinists on horseback benefiting from lateral stability to talking about knights charging on lances. She may not have meant to imply that stirrups give front-to-back stability, but she certainly opened the door for people like me to infer she did.And, I’ll definitely pass on a borg-based internet. Ackerman wrote before the worst of Facebook (so far) arose, but even half a dozen years ago, one could have had some sort of guess, just from Shrub Bush, then Dear Leader, spying on people via the NSA, that a Borg-based Net is a horrible idea.Next after that? No, plants don’t chat. Plants may, if I allow that much, not anthropomorphizing but zoomorphizing, may communicate in some generic way. But plants don’t chat and they sure as hell don’t text. There’s no intentionality that I see. Plants also aren’t “barbaric” or many other things. Chimps, like humans, may be murderous; Venus flytraps are not. I have no problem extending human consciousness attributes to animals that have a certain level of consciousness; that includes not only primates, but at least corvids among birds, cetaceans and pachyderms as well as canids and equines among mammals; and squids and octopi among mollusks. Likewise, when a robot reaches that level of consciousness (which I don’t expect in my lifetime), I’ll do it there too. Per Jessica Riskin, I wouldn’t even attribute “agency” short of consciousness to plants. And, in any case, Riskin’s concept is about agency, period — not emotions, let alone Humean passions, driving agentic decisions.Chapter after that, “Robots on a Date,” Ackerman is surprisingly gullible — no other word for it — about chatbots talking to each other and the sensibility level of their communication. The example she cites isn’t tremendously beyond what we would have had 50 years ago if two Elizas of Joseph Weizenbaum fame had been made able to chat with each other. It’s certainly not that far beyond the actual Eliza-human interactions.That’s a kind of anti-speciesism, if you will, albeit naïve at best, gullible and uninformed at worst. Weirdly, it comes after committing high-level speciesism in the previous chapter by saying that robots can’t be conscious in the way humans are because their consciousness can’t be embodied. Technically true, if you’re limiting “body” to a carbon-and-water based sac of gel weighing about 80-100 kilograms. In the broader sense of “embodied cognition,” totally untrue, of course.Also, while Ackerman can wax poetic in her language, she can also wax inaccurate. Having a screw in a bone to help fix a break is NOT “bionic.” If she didn’t watch “Six Million Dollar Man,” Merriam Webster will straighten her out. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dicti...Finally (and not the first time I’ve complained about a blurb/PR authorial photo for a book … it’s vaguely offputting to see one that’s at least 15 years old as of the time the book was written. I just have this vague feeling that she’s almost a polar opposite of, say, a Barbara Ehrenreich on aging and dying issues. The photo, the yearning for Kurzweilian ideas, and other things all just seem to point to that."
295,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34081077-chezlani-casar,2,"The topics and projects she mentions are extremely interesting; however, the flowery prose, while pretty, seemed totally unsuited to this kind of book. I got bored with the embellishments while waiting for the salient points. Haven't brung myself to finish it yet."
296,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4861304-susannah,1,"Didn't finish. Extremely low information density made it boring. Prioritization of pretty language over scientific accuracy was extremely annoying. If she was misleading or wrong about things I knew, how could I trust the things I didn't know about?"
297,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8552725-roberta-emerson,5,Non-fiction isn't usually my thing. But the prose in this book is nothing short of environmental poetry. Just stunning. I so look forward to hearing her at the Literary Sojourn in Colorado this October. 
298,0393351645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18625510-hugh-stephens,5,Everyone should read this book. Beautiful writing in a book that's positive and upbeat in this strange day and age.
