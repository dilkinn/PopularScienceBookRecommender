0,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/267189-todd-n,2,"Timothy Ferriss spoke at a management meeting last week where I work. A few of the managers came back pretty impressed, so I cadged a copy off of a manager and skimmed/read it one sitting Friday night.The effect of this book is like being trapped in a room with a manic-depressive during the manic part of his cycle. Imagine a cross between Brad Pitt in 12 Monkeys and a late-night infomercial. Then add a dash of narcissistic personality disorder to get an idea of the tone of this book.This book is one in a series of books lately -- including Rich Dad, Poor Dad -- that damns the middle class for a lack of imagination as demonstrated by showing up for work every day and upholding the social contract, among other things. The middle class, far from being admired for being the people that the economy and that this country is built on, should be pitied as they pathetically roll down 101 in their Civics and Jettas to their white collar jobs. Why build a career when you could be selling can openers at a profit through the miracle of AdWords?Offered as an example of the breakthrough thinking in this book is the time the author won a kickboxing championship by reading the rules, finding loopholes, and then winning on a technicality. It's hard to imagine an attitude further from the Renaissance concept of virtu than this.The part of the book that I greatly enjoyed concerned ""time management"" and gave valuable tips on how not to be such a fucking patsy at work. I put ""time management"" in quotes because he believes that time management is part of the problem. He offers great advice on handling email (check only twice a day) and handling it (send clear if-then emails). He also gives great advice on how to make yourself valuable and productive enough to negotiate a better work-life balance, assuming you have the talent and energy to pull it off. But in this day of telecommuting, this is really less radical than he makes it sound. He makes a good case for quitting any job that doesn't allow working from home on a regular basis.Another highlight of this book is a reprint of a hilarious article from Esquire about outsourcing personal chores to India. It's too bad that the rest of the book couldn't take on the same humorous and likable tone while making its sometimes valid points.I guess you could sum up this book like this: ""There's no TEAM in I."""
1,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2055931-jonathan-el-bizri,1,"EDIT: I've left my original opinion below. However, as time has passed, I don't really think I can recommend this book as anything but entertainment. Anything useful has been written elsewhere, better, and by people who aren't lying to you.-----I hesitantly recomend this book. The reasons why are towards the end of the review.The douchebaggery and straight up disengenuity espoused almost drips off the pages: quite remarkable even in the self-help, think-outside-the-box, start-your-own-business genre. Much of what Ferris recommends just plain doesn't work (I'm talking from experience). Other things are slightly ridiculous: an entire chapter is spent discussing how one can get people to stop bugging you at your cubicle by lying to their faces about how busy you are, or using other, more passive-aggressive methods to avoid them. Yet more suggestions are even more unethical and unsound: how to get your boss to sign you up to work at home, so you can go off and get your job 'done' in an hour a day and then get on with pursuing your just rewards. Apparently, as long as no one realizes what useless timewaster you >used< to be, Ferris thinks it is perfectly acceptable to use this new found time to your own ends, as long as no one catches on.According to Ferris, we should all use methods to arbitrage the actual productivity of others - such as email friends and colleagues for information rather than finding it ourselves, despite the fact he also espouses avoiding all such requests from others, getting them to 'channel' their communications into forms that you can either ignore or answer as quickly as possible, preferably through an executive assistant. As far as that secret 'get rich quick, live on the beach' lifestyle he promises? It involves the same arbitrage, only commercially. In other words, we should all start websites that dropship stuff and by google adwords and we'll all be rich. Life doesn't work like that: someone has to make shit, and the web is already saturated with stores.Why do I recomend this book anyway? Well, despite the shitloads of pie in the sky bad advice, and the loads of leeching & douchebaggery that Ferris seems to think he is the original source for, there is a lot to be learned in regards to automating and simplifying one's life, and practicing and developing an enterpreneurial outlook to improving one's situation.So, read between the lines, recognize the Ferris is an untrustworthy weasel frat boy out to promote himself and sell books. But, take note that while the lifestyle he espouses in his book just doesn't add up, his overall philosophy has served him well, and there is definitely utility in the tactics that serve this get-someone-else-to-do-it-for-you life strategy. "
2,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/623773-emma,2,"At first I thought this was the bee's knees, toes, and ankles. But as I read further I began to realize that this guy ""wins"" by cheating, ""delegates"" by leaving everything in the hands of his $5/hour personal assistant in India, and sells books by promising to tell you how to get rich, and delivers a book on how to get everyone around you to be really annoyed with you for shirking any responsibility. He encourages you to lease expensive cars so you can feel like you are living the ""life of your dreams"". And then he puts Walden in his list of resources. I'm confused. I guess he's saying that if you really want to drive a fancy car, then make that your priority, and then when you can afford to lease it, you'll be happy. I'm hoping that would then teach you that maybe a car is not the most important thing in your life and you might want to spend your $2500 a month on rent, food, health insurance and the like. So you don't have to live in Borneo in order to drive your new car.Reading this book made me realize that I already have a life that involves meaningful work, setting my own schedule, and choosing whatever projects I want to do. And oh yeah, passive income. No, I don't drive a Ferrari and vacation in Argentina because the exchange rate is awesome. But you know? I don't really want to.I agree with some of his instructions on automation, especially the importance of not having decision-making bottlenecks. However, if you care about the reputation of your company you might want to have *some* input on its day to day operations. I guess now we know why he is described as a ""serial"" entrepreneur on the book jacket.I give him points for being honest. If someone wanted his kind of lifestyle, this would be a fairly good roadmap. Except for one thing: his sales ability. Which he doesn't really teach in this book. He definitely has a different take on business and the point of life, and perhaps it is useful just in that sense. He is definitely marching to the beat of his own drummer. I just am not sure I want to march with him."

4,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/880021-david-sasaki,2,"I don't know how else to put it. Timothy Ferris is a douche. There is, in fact, an entire genre of blog literature that explains why Timothy Ferriss is a douche. Even New York Times columnist Frank Bruni got in on the action. Since I already heard Ferriss' insecure egocentricity on full display during his Long Now talk, I came to this book expecting a self-obsessed hustler to peddle his ""you-too-can-be-like-me"" vision. But I still wanted to read the book. I wanted to understand why it became a bestseller and why Ferris, the arch-egocentic, has become so influential among ambitious American men of my generation. (If you haven't heard of Ferriss before, you probably don't spend much time reading tech and entrepreneurship blogs.)What I didn't expect was to come to feel a deep sympathy for Ferriss. Despite the fact that he's a jerk, he isn't a terrible writer and the biographic sections of the book are rich fodder for psychoanalysis. Like Ferris, I also grew up with an instinctive, acute resentment of authority and hierarchical structures. It is still the most defining characteristic of my personality, but I have learned to control the resentment and anger as I have matured. Like Ferriss, I too was also extremely motivated and reasonably precocious. This combination of wanting to accomplish so much while spending most of my energy rebelling against the institutions around me led to constant anxiety and insecurity. ""Does not fulfill potential"" was scribbled across all of my report cards, which led me to rebel against my teachers and parents even more, all the while internalizing the basic notion that I was letting people down.Like Ferriss, I knew that I didn't want to define my life by others' expectations. I wanted to find my own path and define my own expectations. Part of that — like Ferriss — was to travel the world. That is where our paths began to diverge. Ferriss embraced a deep individualism that prioritizes self-improvement as the definition of success. Among his conclusions: Don't search for meaningful work; find a way to make as much money in as little time as possible, and spend the rest of your time having fun. There is no meaning in life; what we really want is excitement, not 'meaning.' Don't let others interrupt your path toward personal perfection; if they start blabbering, cut them off and return to focusing on yourself.Ferriss is obsessed with his own image. He constantly reminds the reader that he is a world champion of kickboxing, the winner of a tango championship in Argentina, a polyglot, a motorcycle racer, a chef, and a weight-lifter. But he is driven only by extrinsic motivation. He does not appreciate the ""craftsmanship"" of his pastimes; that is, in the words of Richard Sennett, ""the desire to do a job well for its own sake."" For Ferriss, it's all about winning a trophy, bragging to his friends, or checking something off his to-do list. The collective, the individual, and the twilight of the elites Why has Ferriss' vision of ""the good life"" proved so appealing among my generation? Why has the perfection of the self become such a popular pursuit? I am easily persuaded by Christopher Hayes' argument that the rise of American meritocracy over the past fifty years has led to extreme, individualistic competition among ambitious elites at the expense of our concern for collective well being. In order to be successful in America today you have to focus on yourself. The idea of placing one's community (or one's work team) ahead of one's self is passé. David Brooks has written a lot about the individual versus collective world views. From China, he penned a column noting that Asian economies are challenging the assumption that a culture of individualism creates incentives for greater economic growth. Then, following President Obama's second inaugural address (which he calls ""among the best of the past half-century""), Brooks examines the pros and cons of the individualist versus collectivist society. It is the cultural debate that underlies almost all other contemporary political debates. Like Ferriss, I too am deeply individualistic. The day after I graduated from high school I packed up all my belongings and drove to Alaska to spend six months by myself. I wanted to disconnect from all institutions, responsibilities, and expectations. But unlike Ferriss, during my 20s I came to a deep appreciation of the satisfaction that can come from participating in a community that isn't defined by hierarchical structures or individual achievements. I am speaking of my time working at Global Voices, which finally gave me a productive channel to focus my energy toward the goals of a greater community. There is satisfaction that comes from individual accomplishments. But, in my experience, nothing is as satisfying as building something together as a team. I fear we are losing the ""craft of cooperation."" If there has one thing my generation has learned, it is self-promotion — and no one can out-self-promote Timothy Ferriss. I hope that one day he can take a break from perfecting his self in order to experience the pleasure of cultivating community."
5,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1613125-craig,1,"Instead of focusing on this book's lame contents (it was really bad) I decided to share my review of how it was otherwise used in the hopes that it might inspire others.First of all, I found the book's paper a little rough in texture. This eliminated it from being used in the outhouse or camping, if you know what I mean. The raspy paper DID, however, have just the right stuff to be 'ripped and rolled' into some really effective starter wicks in the old fireplace. Went up like a charm and led to a toasty warm fire in no time. Very little smoke produced and it left a good, clean ash.The pages and binding that remained sat limply and dejected by the hearth for much of the evening before inspiration struck once again. I tore the front cover off (I am reluctant to burn colored ink in my fireplace -- call me old-fashioned) and ripped it into some smaller pieces to fold and wedge into a drafty window to help keep it closed. I made sure to have the outer cover facing outward to better repel any moisture that might attack the paper from the window seam. Again -- like it was MADE for the task!Finally, and I'm not proud of it -- I like to minimize my footprint on Mother Earth -- I had to let the binding go. No good for burning and I doubt even a hungry squirrel would find it appealing. It was dropped in the trash by the light of the crackling fire on that dark snowy night.I sat by the roaring fire as light sleet pellets tickle the window, pondering the fate of the environment. With so many copies of this book very likely suffering some form of destruction around the globe what's a species to do?"
6,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/314539-maria-andreu,5,"A few weeks ago in NYC, I sat with two of the smartest people I know at a cool brunch.""But explain it to me,"" I said. ""Just what is it about the 4-Hour Work Week that we haven't already seen?"" Having a background in a ""work-smarter-not-harder"" industry (the coaching industry), what I'd heard about 4HWW had not impressed me as anything particularly fresh and new.""Well,"" said one friend, ""It's just never all been put in a book like this before.""""Okay."" That didn't sound so compelling to me.""Well,"" attempted the other. ""It's Tim, too. His personality. The way he gets things across."" Still unimpressed.But here's the thing - two people I really believe in and trust were telling me I HAD to read this book. So I sucked it up and ordered it from Amazon (who, I believe, I single-handedly keep in business, though my scant GoodReads list may not yet reflect it).So I decided to give it a shot and ate it up in a weekend. A fun and easy read. The premise is basically this: so many of us ""follow the rules"" and strive to tolerate the best job we can get for 40 years, holding off for retirement. Tim Ferriss, the 30-year-old author of this book, posits an entirely different worldview and a straightforward plan for achieving living it - set up automatic profit centers, and take ""mini retirements"" throughout your life (which he does, and explains in fun and interesting detail. He's studied tango in Argentina, martial arts in Berlin. Cool reading). The thing I most enjoyed about this book were the practical tips. I was familiar with many of them, having an internet entrepreneur background, but still found plenty of interesting information to make it worth my while. Lots of good detail on the travel side too. He gives you not just the theory, but the web addresses and the exact plan for setting up your own online business and ""mini-retirement-lifestyle.""It's interesting to look at the negative reviews of this book. A lot of them sound like, ""Yes, that would be nice, but..."" A careful read of the book should push you out of that ""it could never work for me,"" mentality. Worth giving a shot."
7,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,5,"I found this book on a recommendation from a good friend, and if it wasn't for that I might have put it down right away, because the tone is very markety, and the author makes a lot of big claims with little substance.That being said, the author must be a smart guy because there is a lot of good stuff in this book.Big Takeaways1. Most of us have the idea that we are supposed to work until we are 60, then retire and live the good life. Tim does a great job pointing out how backwards that idea is, and gives lots of suggestions for how to change your life to accommodate. He calls those who have done so the ""New Rich"", as they are rich in life - which is not related to being rich in dollars. 2. Take 'mini-retirements' throughout your life instead of planning to retire at the end of your life (which I probably wouldn't do anyways). This means every 5 years take a year off to go on a big adventure. Tim's point is you don't need to be rich to do this, and gives a lot of advice on how to go about it. I don't think he'll convince too many people, but it does sound like he's starting to have a following.3. Be a business owner - not a business runner. One gives you lots of free time - the other consumes your life (which I can currently attest to :)4. Time is your most valuable asset. Tim gives a lot of good tips for time management - which aren't unique, but every time you read them helps you. The ones that stuck out for me were:  - only check email 3 times a day at set intervals - outsource everything you can to 3rd parties (like a virtual concierge in India who works for $5/hr) - batch activities like paying bills for max efficiency - give employees autonomous rules/guidelines - avoid meetings whenever possible - use emails instead (works wonders)5. Try to start businesses that can be completely outsourced after you've set them up, so they run on auto-pilot. The author did it with a nutrient company - I'm dubious on this one though.6. 80/20 rule. 80% of your revenue probably comes from 20% of your customers. You can save a lot of time and make more money by focusing where it matters - on the 20%. This applies to most things in life, and although I've read it before it was a good refresher.7. Reach out to important people. Don't be afraid to reach out to important/famous people for advice. They are often more accessible than you think. Tim had good tips for this - like always uses phone's and not emails.8. Avoid excessive information: too much information input can overload you, so avoid reading news on subjects that don't relate to what you do. If something important happens in the world you will hear about it - or its good conversation when you meet with a friend (""whats new in the world?"")"
8,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/566769-rasmus,2,"Although mr. Ferriss has some good ideas and goals, there is one word that describes why, I am not a fan of this book: Scumbaggery.While I totally agree with Tim Ferriss, when he says that most meetings are useless and should be avoided, I cannot agree with his recommendation of making up excuses and lies, in order to leave early or not show up. This is just one example of behavior recommended in this book, and it quite frankly disgusts me.I am all for automating the dull aspects of my life, taking on personal assistants and applying to 80/20 principle where ever it fits, but I never ever want to do so at the price of my own dignity. The book has good ideas but is ultimately written for people without scruples of any kind.The author brags about winning a martial arts contest by bending the rules. He's being a scumbag and encouraging others to follow in his footsteps. I'm sorry, but that's not me."
9,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1696949-j-f-penn,5,"The book that changed my life a few years ago. My aim was to be location independent, after a number of businesses and investments that tied me to one place. 5 years later, I am location independent and a full-time author-entrepreneur. This book helped me see it was possible. "
10,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/278544-kara,1,"I just started this book, and I can't even finish it. Aside from the author grating on my last nerve with each page turn, I find his outlook on life to be overly fantastical. This book appeals to people who are working in dead end jobs that are hellish to say the least, and offers a way out to people who have lost hope. But I'll tell you something. If making a ton of money, working a 4-hour work week, and living like a millionaire were easy, everyone would do it. The fact that he's one of FEW that do, tells you that it's not for everyone. He takes you through an exercise that makes you write down your worst-case scenario of things that would happen if you just quit your job today to live like this. I'm not sure how he can just sit there and think that losing your home, going bankrupt, having your credit ruined, etc. isn't ""the end of the world"", but it's damn near close. Something tells me he's never had to deal with anything like a mortgage or the a home foreclosure.I saw him on the Today Show once with Donny Deutsch who vehemently disagreed with everything this guy had to say. Donny, who is one of the ""living dead"" according to Timothy Ferris, is also a highly successful businessman. Just proof that life is what YOU make of it - not what someone else tells you to. Read this book if you think your life is totally in the toilet and you have no other recourse. Just make sure you realize you'll be one of about 1% of people who can actually make this work..."

A surprised cliché—because I really didn’t expect to join the cadre of readers whose lives were challenged and even changed by this book. I’m an efficiency nut, so I figured there might be a few good tips in here for streamlining my workflow (and there were). But what I wasn’t expecting was a call to reevaluate my life, my work, and my direction. I read it at just the right time, when I was shifting focus on projects anyway and ready for an overhaul. I filled up pages of notes reading the opening chapters and ended up with actionable daily, weekly, and yearly goals. Call me clichéd again: I highly recommend this book."

Rather than hating reality, I'll show you how to bend it to your will. It's easier than it sounds.""Timothy Ferriss promises the stars in the sky in his new-classic business/self help book, The 4-Hour Workweek. Though he gives some good productivity tips, he fails to provide a true road map to freeing yourself from the 9-to-5 grind. Partially, this is because there is no real road map to doing this.But he does detail how he found his way into a life of his dreams. Readers can take whatever lessons and information from that as they will.After Ferriss relates a timeline of his life story, he begins by detailing his ""DEAL"" plan to a four hour work week which consists of ""definition, elimination, automation and liberation"". Each step of this process, he says, helps guide the reader to a new world of free time. Though, he admits, traditional bosses may have serious problems with your new program and, perhaps, you should go more ""DELA"". Yes, understatement.""Resolve now to test the concepts as an exercise in lateral thinking. If you try it, you'll see just how deep the rabbit hole goes, and you won't ever go back.""He examines the concepts of ""busy work"" and suggests boiling your workload down to the most important tasks you complete. Then, just do those as fast as possible. Don't allow yourself to be derailed by the internet or chatty coworkers. (Not a friendly method, but Ferriss seems to have his eyes on the prize rather than concerning himself with making friends.)Out of everything he suggests in the first part of this book, I was most taken with the idea of only checking your email once a day or week. There is a definite time-suck there that maybe I have been blinding myself to.After that, Ferriss enters more conceptual territory with an idea about creating a business for yourself that essentially runs itself or can be run by someone else, cheaply. For example, a website that sells something awesome. But, what exactly that something or muse is, that's for you, the reader, to discover on your own.It reminded me of Godin's Purple Cow: Transform Your Business by Being Remarkable. You know an awesome product or ""purple cow"" when you see it, but how exactly to make one isn't a clear thing. Interesting idea, but necessarily helpful for those looking for actionable items to improve their work life.The most useful part of the book, in my opinion, is his encouragement to create a dream plan by ""dreamlining"". Write down what you want to do. Create a timeline. Crunch the numbers. It may cost less than you thought and, with it on paper, it takes on a bit of reality already. If you don't get started, how do you know what you might accomplish.""It's lonely at the top. Ninety-nine percent of people in the world are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for the mediocre. The level of competition is thus fiercest for 'realistic' goals, paradoxically making them the most time-and energy-consuming. It is easier to raise $1,000,000 than it is $100,000.""Ferriss' tone in this book has been criticized by readers and I see what they mean. Some of his ideas are alienating. Sometimes he seems to say: I've done this-this-this and this, and it's so easy that if you can't figure it out too, especially with the book I've put in your hands, then you must be either complacent or dumb.But I took this book to be written by someone who dared, a nod to Brené Brown, greatly. Ferriss believed his life could be something other than a slog and yours could too. He's written down some tips to help you along the way that he discovered through real life trial and error. Read it or not. He'll be over there, living the life of his dreams.Recommended, with reservations, to folks interested in life-hacking their work/life balance. I think we can achieve whatever dreams we set our minds to while still being friendly."
14,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3399794-naveed,1,"This book is garbage. I donated it to my local library shortly after completing it. First off - the number of plugs Ferriss puts in his book is unbelievable. He's clearly getting a small cut from each of these people who want to ""advertise"" in his book. Secondly - he talks mostly about himself throughout this book. As opposed to Guy Kawasaki who might actually give instructions, and most likely will inspire, Tim Ferriss is so insecure about himself that he has to talk about his own dance skills before he gets into the meat of the book. This is the plan that Timmy here recommends - get your company to let you work remotely. Once they say yes (because that's just SO easy for everyone apparently), then you stop actually delivering results because now you're working from home, you outsource all your tasks to do (yes he really tells you to outsource ALL your job work), you travel to countries where the dollar is quite strong, and then in your spare time on a beach lagoon you create a product that can sell. You sell this product in exclusive magazines and TV - you don't try and mass market it because then it becomes a commodity. By only advertising in select places, you control the price forever, as he says. Bear in mind - you're doing all this because your company is willing to turn a deaf ear to your lack of results. Wait - there's more. Instead of creating a product - which can be easily replicated - create something else - INFORMATION, he says. Create an instructional DVD or CD (and of course he shows you the best places to produce them for you), or perhaps write an instructional book, and then sell this book to the masses. I'm sitting there reading this book and it occurred to me - this guy just DID EXACTLY THAT to me! He created so-called information, marketed the hell out of it via a blog and a catchy title, and then I lost my $19.99 to him. So I've been made out like a fool, and it was so easy that he explains how everyone can do it. This book is so filled with garbage that Tim Ferriss actually spends several pages in his book writing a line by line SCRIPT that you can use with your boss when you persuade them to let you work from home. Save your time and your money. Guy Kawasaki is better - start a good business, claim tax benefits, and work hard, and you'll be happy. Did anyone really think you can make enough money to live and support a family when you only work four hours a week? Pure garbage."
15,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2270248-kyle,1,"I am always interested in life-hacks that can make work more productive and leave more time for leisure so this book grabbed my attention. Little did I know that reading it would feel like listening to a confessional from someone who will leave no corner uncut. If you have no qualms about out-sourcing work and under-paying people to do it, then this book may be for you. If not--and you have no anthropological interest in the delusional contours of petty bourgeois entrepreneurial capitalism at the dawn of the 21st century--then avoid at all costs. "
16,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726885-livia-blackburne,3,"It does a good job of challenging people to rethink the status quo and evaluate what they're doing with their time. It's often hard to think outside the box and imagine your life as you'd really like to live it, and Ferris does a good job of shaking things up.That said, many of the tactics Ferris suggests are morally questionable. You'll get more out of the book if you have no qualms about calling in ""sick"" at work, hiring overseas assistants at below minimum wage to do your busy work, setting up fake ebay auctions and canceling them at the last minute to assess consumer interest, etc. At one point, Ferris encourages people to aggressively look up the personal email addresses/ phone numbers of famous successful people to get them to be mentors. Later on the book, Ferris gives his strategies for outsourcing his phone calls/emails and avoiding all but absolutely necessary calls. So is it okay to demand other busy people's time but not his?There are some good life hacks here that might save time, although not as much as the title claims. He claims that you can get a week's worth of work done in less than a quarter of time, but the only solid suggestions I gleaned were 1)check email less often 2) don't multitask, and 3) avoid meetings like the plague. Good tips, but they won't bring you down to a four hour work week unless you were absolutely hopeless before.So it's worth reading once for the tips, and I do intend to avoid multitasking and check email less, as he suggests. But much of Ferris' strategy relies on getting others to do your work for you. If everyone started doing it, the world economy would come to a screeching halt."
17,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/991168-amber,4,"Reading the first third of this book was one of the most self-indulgent activities I’ve ever done. (And yes, I read fiction.) It was so nice to hear that someone else in the world doesn't understand why we spend so much time on meaningless meetings and other time-fillers when there are so many meaningful things we long to do.This book is worth reading though there are a few things you'll have to endure to finish it:-potty-mouth words-author-coined terms and antonyms that include the word “rich” (ug. is this some kind of prerequisite to publishing a business book?)-and I’m sorry to tell you there are also self-help action plans at the end of every chapterBut my friends, it is WORTH it. Ferris starts with a message that rings true right to your soul. He says working nonstop for 45 years and then retiring and doing nothing makes no sense. He says you should figure out what dreams would fulfill you and then work on making enough money to accomplish those. And then he makes other completely sane statements that few people have been bold enough to make. It is moving, it feels revolutionary. Ferris then goes on to tell you task for task how to build a business you can run with just a few hours a week from anywhere in the world. Though I admire Ferris for being so bold as to back up his promise, and for actually filling the book with some meaty details, I have to admit the book often degenerates at this point and reminds me of ""How to Get Anyone to Do Anything"" (is that the title?). And although Ferris seems to miss the point that fulfillment can come from things other than international travel adventures (he mentions serving in charities abroad, but seems to overlook being kind to and serving the people around you), I still love this book. It wakes you up, and honestly, I think it would only benefit the world if a few more adults did interesting things and had an adventure every now and then instead of reading a lot of email and watching a lot of T.V. and news.I'll end by sharing one of my favorite parts:Challenging the Status Quo vs. Being Stupid1. “Retirement Is Worst-Case Scenario Insurance…: in this case, becoming physically incapable of working and needing a reservoir of capital to survive.”2. “Interest and Energy Are Cyclical…: Alternating periods of activity and rest is necessary to survive, let alone thrive. Capacity, interest, and mental endurance all wax and wane.” p. 313. “Less Is Not Laziness…: Doing less meaningless work, so that you can focus on things of greater personal importance, is NOT laziness. This is hard for most to accept, because our culture tends to reward personal sacrifice instead of personal productivity.” p. 324. “The Timing Is Never Right…: The universe doesn’t conspire against you, but it doesn’t go out of its way to line up all the pins either.”5. “Ask for Forgiveness, Not Permission…: If it isn’t going to devastate those around you…Most people are fast to stop you before you get started but hesitant to get in the way if you’re moving.” p. 336. “Emphasize Strengths, Don’t Fix Weaknesses…: It is far more lucrative and fun to leverage your strengths…The choice is between multiplication of results using strengths or incremental improvement fixing weaknesses that will, at best, become mediocre.” p. 347. “Things in Excess Become Their Opposite…: Too much, too many, and too often of what you want becomes what you don’t want. This is true of possessions and even time.”8. “Money Alone Is Not the Solution…: In part, it’s laziness. “If I only had more money” is the easiest way to postpone…self-examination.” p. 359. “Relative Income Is More Important Than Absolute Income…: Relative income [measures both] the dollar and time.”10. “Distress Is Bad, Eustress is Good…: [Be] equally aggressive in removing distress and finding eustress.” p. 38"

19,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13209822-vaishali,5,"One of the most useful books I've ever read. This is it, folks... THE playbook for a life by your design, under your exclusive control. I am truly grateful to the author for compiling this. Thanks, Tim !"
20,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,4,"Timothy Ferriss explains how he freed himself from the rat race and slashed his working hours by delegating, outsourcing, and automating his businesses. He spends his new free time living on his terms, which for him means traveling the world. He wants you to do the same, and provides the motivation and action steps to do so. The basic message of this book: take shortcuts.In most cases, those shortcuts involve working smarter. In a few instances, however, Ferriss promotes what I would consider questionable or unethical behavior (such as telling ""half-truths"" to your boss or others, or taking advantage of loopholes in rules). Ferriss comes across as someone I could never fully trust, and thus wouldn't want to emulate entirely.Ferriss says that “Becoming a member of the NR [New Rich] is not just about working smarter. It's about building a system to replace yourself.” Ferriss calls this system Income Autopilot. He says the path to wealth and freedom is to own, not run, a business. An owner has people and systems do the work, while someone running a business is another cog in the machine.Ferriss advocates creating a product business that you can quickly scale through delegation and automation. He discourages service businesses because they’re not as easy to scale. He says that if you have a service business, you should convert it into a product business by turning your services into information products like ebooks, webinars, audio recordings, etc. I found this an interesting point, because my web design company, OptimWise, is a service business, and I’m looking to maximize profits with the least effort.One of Ferriss’ main ideas is that rather than postponing fun activities until retirement, you should take several mini-retirements that are weeks or months long, throughout your working life. This book was part of the reason that I quit my 9-5 job to start OptimWise. I wanted the freedom of working when and where I wanted, so that work fits around life, not vice versa. I really liked The Parable of the Mexican Fisherman referenced in this book.I really liked Ferriss' advice about going on an information diet. I’ve tried to follow his advice by frequently unsubscribing from email newsletters and RSS feeds. After reading this book the first time in 2008, I stopped reading the newspaper and news sites, and replaced them with NPR’s daily 5-minute news summary podcast.Ferriss advocates effectiveness in place of efficiency. He says to eliminate all the unnecessary busyness that takes up most of our time, and focus on the tasks that actually matter.Ferriss certainly presents an extreme example of the New Rich lifestyle. What if you love your job and have no desire to leave it? This book is still worth reading for the lessons about prioritization and time-management.Notes• DEAL: Define, Eliminate, Automate, Liberate.• People don’t want to be millionaires. They want the millionaire lifestyle. You can have it without being a millionaire.• Effectiveness is more important than efficiency; doing a few things effectively is better than doing many things efficiently.• The seeming lack of time is actually a lack of prioritization. Focus on the important.• Use the Pareto Principle and Parkinson’s Law to limit the tasks you undertake.• Consume information only when the need is immediate and obvious. Use “just-in-time” learning.• Eliminate before you delegate.• Don’t let people interrupt you. Force people to define their requests before you spend time on them. Empower others to act without interrupting you.• Batch routine tasks. Check email and phone messages only at predetermined times.• If you have a service business, sell information products (ebooks, audio, video, etc.) for $50-$200 (a price high enough to increase the perception of quality)."
21,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1182271-aaron-minks,5,"One of the few books I have read more than once. Timothy Feriss does an excellent job of explaining the lifestyle and methods of the new rich. Not only that, but he provides web addresses, phone numbers, and more for manufacturers, drop shippers, and mentors. This is a life changing book for any person involved or interested in business."
22,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3006762-r-b-kiernan,1,"The book should be entitled, ""Everything that's Wrong with this Country."" All you need to do is cultivate ignorance, outsource everything, and never think for yourself. If you have absolutely no ethics whatsoever and want to con the masses, then you too can Get Rich Quick. Here's how:1. Pretend you're an expert on... anything. He specifically explains that it doesn't even matter what you might or might not actually know. You do this by repackaging the works of others and selling ""your"" ideas on-line -- to the gullible masses. Seriously, he begins by admitting he first made his fortune selling (allegedly) nutritional supplements that cost almost nothing to make and weren't based on science, but were then hyped to the point the uninformed public was paying through the nose to get it. This gave him ideas on how to further hype his message to an even larger audience, without bothering to sell anything tangible. Just tell them how they, too, can get rich quick by pretending to actually know something. He then gives advice about ""paraphrasing and combining points from several books,"" borrowing from the public domain, and/or compensating some other ""expert."" This way, you don't need to be bothered to actually learn anything, which brings me to step #2.2. Stay uneducated. This is in the chapter entitled ""The Low Information Diet."" He admits he doesn't bother staying abreast on the news or any other kinds of current events -- even to the point that, during election seasons, he simply asks his more educated friends about whom will win their votes and then votes for those candidates. Not kidding. He justifies this by saying how the time it takes to, you know, LEARN THINGS, is time that could be spent running a business on autopilot or having fun. Apparently, not knowing a damn thing is a virtue he calls ""Cultivating Selective Ignorance."" I prefer to call it, ""The Suicide of Democracy."" If having an educated and well-informed populace is fundamental to having a flourishing democracy, this is how we'll end up with a plutocracy where the stupidest few prey on the desperate and stupid masses, while outsourcing all the jobs they might create. This brings me to point #3.3. Outsource everything -- including your brain -- to a 3rd World Country: He hires virtual assistants in various 3rd World Countries, especially India, who are then given fabulous access to all of his personal information to the point they can pretend to be him and make all of his personal and business decisions. They send all of his correspondence, including e-mails and anything of an official nature (which causes me to assume they wrote this book for him. They certainly wrote many of the excellent reviews on Amazon). Personal business which can be done remotely are always done by them. As he states he can't be bothered to think for himself, it shouldn't be surprising he isn't interested in working for himself, either. Hey, what could possibly go wrong by hiring complete strangers and giving them all information about you in order to think for you, do your work and run your errands? Finally, point #4:4. Avoid those who want knowledge: If you can't be bothered knowing anything, why should they? Whether it's your boss or your client, do everything in your power to avoid those people because of how they drain your time. The boss wants you to attend a meeting? Just tell him you're too busy and further kill morale by then asking those other suckers - aka, co-workers - for a quick breakdown of what happened. Clients? Don't get back to them right away, if ever. If they demand to actually know something, have those remote virtual assistants send them just enough to get them to shut up.There are a couple, minuscule, points the author makes that are reasonably valid, such as: It's good to streamline your many processes and it's good to have solid goals. Also, I could say that the book begins by being very motivational. If I were critiquing this on just the first few pages it would likely have 4 stars. As it's written, the unethical, stupid and lazy b.s. kills any chance of this even getting 2 stars.I wish I hadn't bought this on Kindle.I wish I had read the bad reviews, first."
23,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49415231-amir-tesla,4,"Wow, this book literally equipped me with a new pair of eyes. The 4 hour work week basically means automating and delegating task as much as possible. This would give you enough freedom to start a new business.Another amazing insight of the book helps you escape the 5-9 routine. How? Well, it teaches you clever tricks (which is to be played on your boss). To summarize 10-20 pages, you call in sick for 2 days. You show up on day third and show how significantly you have been productive at home, then you propose a trial of 2 weeks to remote-work 2 days a week. By proving your productivity, you will gain a full-time remote work. So you can spend your weeks where ever you want while doing and enjoying your job. I have oversimplified the whole process, but, you get the idea. I highly recommend this book if you seek more freedom and aspire to run your own business. Aside from these, the book is filled with numerous productivity hacks which constituted a remarkable journey for me a productivity addict."
24,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1120545-chip-and-katie-moore,2,"Overall, I appreciate the idea he brings up in the fact that people waste their days with nonsense (this may come from the fact that I worked in the government for years). As a computer guy, I also appreciate the fact that many people don't fully harness the power of auto-replies, faqs, macros, scripts, batching, etc. to eliminate a good 80% of their work in an office environment. That being the case, the idea of doing all of this doesn't work everywhere (only certain office/sales jobs I suspect), and no boss I've had has ever really appreciated the work I went through to be more efficient either. Even when my work propagated to others and our unit had plenty of free time, all that happened was more filler was added to our workload to make us look busy, or our staff was assigned elsewhere to places not as efficient. So, I'd recommend following the advise he offers for being more efficient and less plugged in, but not necessarily making it known you're doing so unless you're forced into a corner.The other part of the book espousing the benefits of Direct Marketing are much like the ideas of Rich Dad/Poor Dad for real estate - cute ideas, and I truly believe they will work for some, but not everyone has what it takes to get in on these 'get-rich-quick' ideas at the right time. I feel like success in these field requires a type of personality not everyone has, or wants to have (he references the 'Girls Gone Wild' videos as a good example of direct marketing)?? That may be a true example - but all the money in the world can't make taking advantage of a bunch of drunk girls appealing to me - so, for me it's not a good example.I'll end by saying the book is short enough to warrant reading. It has some interesting enough ideas peppered throughout that if you can plow through the stuff that you don't like, get it out from the library and read it or flip through it at the book store to see if you get anything from it, but don't necessarily buy thinking it will change your life."
25,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26-douglas,5,"Many of my friends have read this book and my friend Alex kept talking it up, so I picked it up.Very few books have really changed the way I envision how I am going to live my life. So far, I have only two: Rich Dad Poor Dad and this one. Though Rich Dad introduced me to the concept of owning assets that pay you to free your time, 4-hour workweek dispels a lot of myths about the need to make millions to live the life that we all dream about. In actuality, its a lot closer than we all realize.Everyone should read this book. Almost every single one of my friends has gone through the book. Some with criticism, but the rest gave it good reviews. Get the book, it will deliver a message you should really chew on. "
26,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2512574-jami,1,"I figure, having been unemployed most of this year, I'd see if there were any suggestions in this book that I could actually apply into the kind of career I actually want to do. Well, that and it was free on a holiday promotion. There are words to describe my opinion of this book, however most of them would break the terms and conditions of this site. Suffice it to say, it's one big sales pitch for being an egomaniac, passive agressive jerk. It boils entirely down to outsource or eliminate anything you can, any way you can, handwaves at ""creating"" businesses with no actual, practical advice on how to determine a market need (which is the hardest part of any business: Figuring out what's needed in the first place!), and then spend lots of your time places where the exchange rate makes you comparatively rich.Not even worth free."

However, he has about 3 points I took away, and I can appreciate him for that: 1. Don't waste time trying to accomplish things that don't help your bottom line 2. More time given to do things makes more time to procrastinate 3. ""Batch"" activities at one time to get them done faster (i.e. check email once a day maybe). If these lessons stick, then I can see myself raising the stars. Otherwise, the messages in this book really weren't applicable to anyone in a caring, teaching, or hourly profession. This talked about marketing and selling things to make a buck, when many, many people don't do that and don't aspire to do that. There are many professions the author ignores. Maybe I wasn't the right audience? I certainly am not going to outsource all my emailing to India and hire a personal assistant just so I can effectively practice the art of delegating (that was a long chapter), because that just doesn't sit well with me. I also am not going to spend every moment of my free time traveling the world just to accomplish brag-worthy feats instead of spending time with my family and friends (that was a pretty long chapter too), because that just seems sort of empty. But again, I guess I am not the right audience."
28,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15715846-rosie-nguy-n,4,"This book is not for those who are loving their full time job, or experts, as the tricks in the book maybe viewed as cheating from the people who have tried so hard and spent so much time to thrive and become specialists in their areas. Yet I have no problem with that. Yeah, Tim Ferriss is an aggressive and competitive guy. Some of his actions mentioned in the book may make people feel not comfortable, and prone to oppose to his arguments. But the things he said make sense to me, and gosh, he is hilarious. Plus, it's cool that the book gave me more ideas to improve my writing style. Brilliant. "
29,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6557396-donna,1,"4 Hour Work Week is about adopting a new mindset completely toward your work/life balance.

For the author there are more satisfying ways to be financially stable and live a life of freedom.... that is the major theme.. .... but the book got pretty technical and involved about entrepreneurship and making a plan at the end - I felt totally out of my element, felt overwhelmed by the changes I had to start making, clearly I needed to read more books before I got started .. I guess I’m just not interested in business .. Still working 40 hours a week :((( fukk "
30,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/267189-todd-n,2,"Timothy Ferriss spoke at a management meeting last week where I work. A few of the managers came back pretty impressed, so I cadged a copy off of a manager and skimmed/read it one sitting Friday night.The effect of this book is like being trapped in a room with a manic-depressive during the manic part of his cycle. Imagine a cross between Brad Pitt in 12 Monkeys and a late-night infomercial. Then add a dash of narcissistic personality disorder to get an idea of the tone of this book.This book is one in a series of books lately -- including Rich Dad, Poor Dad -- that damns the middle class for a lack of imagination as demonstrated by showing up for work every day and upholding the social contract, among other things. The middle class, far from being admired for being the people that the economy and that this country is built on, should be pitied as they pathetically roll down 101 in their Civics and Jettas to their white collar jobs. Why build a career when you could be selling can openers at a profit through the miracle of AdWords?Offered as an example of the breakthrough thinking in this book is the time the author won a kickboxing championship by reading the rules, finding loopholes, and then winning on a technicality. It's hard to imagine an attitude further from the Renaissance concept of virtu than this.The part of the book that I greatly enjoyed concerned ""time management"" and gave valuable tips on how not to be such a fucking patsy at work. I put ""time management"" in quotes because he believes that time management is part of the problem. He offers great advice on handling email (check only twice a day) and handling it (send clear if-then emails). He also gives great advice on how to make yourself valuable and productive enough to negotiate a better work-life balance, assuming you have the talent and energy to pull it off. But in this day of telecommuting, this is really less radical than he makes it sound. He makes a good case for quitting any job that doesn't allow working from home on a regular basis.Another highlight of this book is a reprint of a hilarious article from Esquire about outsourcing personal chores to India. It's too bad that the rest of the book couldn't take on the same humorous and likable tone while making its sometimes valid points.I guess you could sum up this book like this: ""There's no TEAM in I."""
31,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2055931-jonathan-el-bizri,1,"EDIT: I've left my original opinion below. However, as time has passed, I don't really think I can recommend this book as anything but entertainment. Anything useful has been written elsewhere, better, and by people who aren't lying to you.-----I hesitantly recomend this book. The reasons why are towards the end of the review.The douchebaggery and straight up disengenuity espoused almost drips off the pages: quite remarkable even in the self-help, think-outside-the-box, start-your-own-business genre. Much of what Ferris recommends just plain doesn't work (I'm talking from experience). Other things are slightly ridiculous: an entire chapter is spent discussing how one can get people to stop bugging you at your cubicle by lying to their faces about how busy you are, or using other, more passive-aggressive methods to avoid them. Yet more suggestions are even more unethical and unsound: how to get your boss to sign you up to work at home, so you can go off and get your job 'done' in an hour a day and then get on with pursuing your just rewards. Apparently, as long as no one realizes what useless timewaster you >used< to be, Ferris thinks it is perfectly acceptable to use this new found time to your own ends, as long as no one catches on.According to Ferris, we should all use methods to arbitrage the actual productivity of others - such as email friends and colleagues for information rather than finding it ourselves, despite the fact he also espouses avoiding all such requests from others, getting them to 'channel' their communications into forms that you can either ignore or answer as quickly as possible, preferably through an executive assistant. As far as that secret 'get rich quick, live on the beach' lifestyle he promises? It involves the same arbitrage, only commercially. In other words, we should all start websites that dropship stuff and by google adwords and we'll all be rich. Life doesn't work like that: someone has to make shit, and the web is already saturated with stores.Why do I recomend this book anyway? Well, despite the shitloads of pie in the sky bad advice, and the loads of leeching & douchebaggery that Ferris seems to think he is the original source for, there is a lot to be learned in regards to automating and simplifying one's life, and practicing and developing an enterpreneurial outlook to improving one's situation.So, read between the lines, recognize the Ferris is an untrustworthy weasel frat boy out to promote himself and sell books. But, take note that while the lifestyle he espouses in his book just doesn't add up, his overall philosophy has served him well, and there is definitely utility in the tactics that serve this get-someone-else-to-do-it-for-you life strategy. "
32,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/623773-emma,2,"At first I thought this was the bee's knees, toes, and ankles. But as I read further I began to realize that this guy ""wins"" by cheating, ""delegates"" by leaving everything in the hands of his $5/hour personal assistant in India, and sells books by promising to tell you how to get rich, and delivers a book on how to get everyone around you to be really annoyed with you for shirking any responsibility. He encourages you to lease expensive cars so you can feel like you are living the ""life of your dreams"". And then he puts Walden in his list of resources. I'm confused. I guess he's saying that if you really want to drive a fancy car, then make that your priority, and then when you can afford to lease it, you'll be happy. I'm hoping that would then teach you that maybe a car is not the most important thing in your life and you might want to spend your $2500 a month on rent, food, health insurance and the like. So you don't have to live in Borneo in order to drive your new car.Reading this book made me realize that I already have a life that involves meaningful work, setting my own schedule, and choosing whatever projects I want to do. And oh yeah, passive income. No, I don't drive a Ferrari and vacation in Argentina because the exchange rate is awesome. But you know? I don't really want to.I agree with some of his instructions on automation, especially the importance of not having decision-making bottlenecks. However, if you care about the reputation of your company you might want to have *some* input on its day to day operations. I guess now we know why he is described as a ""serial"" entrepreneur on the book jacket.I give him points for being honest. If someone wanted his kind of lifestyle, this would be a fairly good roadmap. Except for one thing: his sales ability. Which he doesn't really teach in this book. He definitely has a different take on business and the point of life, and perhaps it is useful just in that sense. He is definitely marching to the beat of his own drummer. I just am not sure I want to march with him."

34,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/880021-david-sasaki,2,"I don't know how else to put it. Timothy Ferris is a douche. There is, in fact, an entire genre of blog literature that explains why Timothy Ferriss is a douche. Even New York Times columnist Frank Bruni got in on the action. Since I already heard Ferriss' insecure egocentricity on full display during his Long Now talk, I came to this book expecting a self-obsessed hustler to peddle his ""you-too-can-be-like-me"" vision. But I still wanted to read the book. I wanted to understand why it became a bestseller and why Ferris, the arch-egocentic, has become so influential among ambitious American men of my generation. (If you haven't heard of Ferriss before, you probably don't spend much time reading tech and entrepreneurship blogs.)What I didn't expect was to come to feel a deep sympathy for Ferriss. Despite the fact that he's a jerk, he isn't a terrible writer and the biographic sections of the book are rich fodder for psychoanalysis. Like Ferris, I also grew up with an instinctive, acute resentment of authority and hierarchical structures. It is still the most defining characteristic of my personality, but I have learned to control the resentment and anger as I have matured. Like Ferriss, I too was also extremely motivated and reasonably precocious. This combination of wanting to accomplish so much while spending most of my energy rebelling against the institutions around me led to constant anxiety and insecurity. ""Does not fulfill potential"" was scribbled across all of my report cards, which led me to rebel against my teachers and parents even more, all the while internalizing the basic notion that I was letting people down.Like Ferriss, I knew that I didn't want to define my life by others' expectations. I wanted to find my own path and define my own expectations. Part of that — like Ferriss — was to travel the world. That is where our paths began to diverge. Ferriss embraced a deep individualism that prioritizes self-improvement as the definition of success. Among his conclusions: Don't search for meaningful work; find a way to make as much money in as little time as possible, and spend the rest of your time having fun. There is no meaning in life; what we really want is excitement, not 'meaning.' Don't let others interrupt your path toward personal perfection; if they start blabbering, cut them off and return to focusing on yourself.Ferriss is obsessed with his own image. He constantly reminds the reader that he is a world champion of kickboxing, the winner of a tango championship in Argentina, a polyglot, a motorcycle racer, a chef, and a weight-lifter. But he is driven only by extrinsic motivation. He does not appreciate the ""craftsmanship"" of his pastimes; that is, in the words of Richard Sennett, ""the desire to do a job well for its own sake."" For Ferriss, it's all about winning a trophy, bragging to his friends, or checking something off his to-do list. The collective, the individual, and the twilight of the elites Why has Ferriss' vision of ""the good life"" proved so appealing among my generation? Why has the perfection of the self become such a popular pursuit? I am easily persuaded by Christopher Hayes' argument that the rise of American meritocracy over the past fifty years has led to extreme, individualistic competition among ambitious elites at the expense of our concern for collective well being. In order to be successful in America today you have to focus on yourself. The idea of placing one's community (or one's work team) ahead of one's self is passé. David Brooks has written a lot about the individual versus collective world views. From China, he penned a column noting that Asian economies are challenging the assumption that a culture of individualism creates incentives for greater economic growth. Then, following President Obama's second inaugural address (which he calls ""among the best of the past half-century""), Brooks examines the pros and cons of the individualist versus collectivist society. It is the cultural debate that underlies almost all other contemporary political debates. Like Ferriss, I too am deeply individualistic. The day after I graduated from high school I packed up all my belongings and drove to Alaska to spend six months by myself. I wanted to disconnect from all institutions, responsibilities, and expectations. But unlike Ferriss, during my 20s I came to a deep appreciation of the satisfaction that can come from participating in a community that isn't defined by hierarchical structures or individual achievements. I am speaking of my time working at Global Voices, which finally gave me a productive channel to focus my energy toward the goals of a greater community. There is satisfaction that comes from individual accomplishments. But, in my experience, nothing is as satisfying as building something together as a team. I fear we are losing the ""craft of cooperation."" If there has one thing my generation has learned, it is self-promotion — and no one can out-self-promote Timothy Ferriss. I hope that one day he can take a break from perfecting his self in order to experience the pleasure of cultivating community."

This eliminated it from being used in the outhouse or camping, if you know what I mean. The raspy paper DID, however, have just the right stuff to be 'ripped and rolled' into some really effective starter wicks in the old fireplace. Went up like a charm and led to a toasty warm fire in no time. Very little smoke produced and it left a good, clean ash.The pages and binding that remained sat limply and dejected by the hearth for much of the evening before inspiration struck once again. I tore the front cover off (I am reluctant to burn colored ink in my fireplace -- call me old-fashioned) and ripped it into some smaller pieces to fold and wedge into a drafty window to help keep it closed. I made sure to have the outer cover facing outward to better repel any moisture that might attack the paper from the window seam. Again -- like it was MADE for the task!Finally, and I'm not proud of it -- I like to minimize my footprint on Mother Earth -- I had to let the binding go. No good for burning and I doubt even a hungry squirrel would find it appealing. It was dropped in the trash by the light of the crackling fire on that dark snowy night.I sat by the roaring fire as light sleet pellets tickle the window, pondering the fate of the environment. With so many copies of this book very likely suffering some form of destruction around the globe what's a species to do?"

""Just what is it about the 4-Hour Work Week that we haven't already seen?"" Having a background in a ""work-smarter-not-harder"" industry (the coaching industry), what I'd heard about 4HWW had not impressed me as anything particularly fresh and new.""Well,"" said one friend, ""It's just never all been put in a book like this before.""""Okay."" That didn't sound so compelling to me.""Well,"" attempted the other. ""It's Tim, too. His personality. The way he gets things across."" Still unimpressed.But here's the thing - two people I really believe in and trust were telling me I HAD to read this book. So I sucked it up and ordered it from Amazon (who, I believe, I single-handedly keep in business, though my scant GoodReads list may not yet reflect it).So I decided to give it a shot and ate it up in a weekend. A fun and easy read. The premise is basically this: so many of us ""follow the rules"" and strive to tolerate the best job we can get for 40 years, holding off for retirement. Tim Ferriss, the 30-year-old author of this book, posits an entirely different worldview and a straightforward plan for achieving living it - set up automatic profit centers, and take ""mini retirements"" throughout your life (which he does, and explains in fun and interesting detail. He's studied tango in Argentina, martial arts in Berlin. Cool reading). The thing I most enjoyed about this book were the practical tips. I was familiar with many of them, having an internet entrepreneur background, but still found plenty of interesting information to make it worth my while. Lots of good detail on the travel side too. He gives you not just the theory, but the web addresses and the exact plan for setting up your own online business and ""mini-retirement-lifestyle.""It's interesting to look at the negative reviews of this book. A lot of them sound like, ""Yes, that would be nice, but..."" A careful read of the book should push you out of that ""it could never work for me,"" mentality. Worth giving a shot."
37,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,5,"I found this book on a recommendation from a good friend, and if it wasn't for that I might have put it down right away, because the tone is very markety, and the author makes a lot of big claims with little substance.That being said, the author must be a smart guy because there is a lot of good stuff in this book.Big Takeaways1. Most of us have the idea that we are supposed to work until we are 60, then retire and live the good life. Tim does a great job pointing out how backwards that idea is, and gives lots of suggestions for how to change your life to accommodate. He calls those who have done so the ""New Rich"", as they are rich in life - which is not related to being rich in dollars. 2. Take 'mini-retirements' throughout your life instead of planning to retire at the end of your life (which I probably wouldn't do anyways). This means every 5 years take a year off to go on a big adventure. Tim's point is you don't need to be rich to do this, and gives a lot of advice on how to go about it. I don't think he'll convince too many people, but it does sound like he's starting to have a following.3. Be a business owner - not a business runner. One gives you lots of free time - the other consumes your life (which I can currently attest to :)4. Time is your most valuable asset. Tim gives a lot of good tips for time management - which aren't unique, but every time you read them helps you. The ones that stuck out for me were:  - only check email 3 times a day at set intervals - outsource everything you can to 3rd parties (like a virtual concierge in India who works for $5/hr) - batch activities like paying bills for max efficiency - give employees autonomous rules/guidelines - avoid meetings whenever possible - use emails instead (works wonders)5. Try to start businesses that can be completely outsourced after you've set them up, so they run on auto-pilot. The author did it with a nutrient company - I'm dubious on this one though.6. 80/20 rule. 80% of your revenue probably comes from 20% of your customers. You can save a lot of time and make more money by focusing where it matters - on the 20%. This applies to most things in life, and although I've read it before it was a good refresher.7. Reach out to important people. Don't be afraid to reach out to important/famous people for advice. They are often more accessible than you think. Tim had good tips for this - like always uses phone's and not emails.8. Avoid excessive information: too much information input can overload you, so avoid reading news on subjects that don't relate to what you do. If something important happens in the world you will hear about it - or its good conversation when you meet with a friend (""whats new in the world?"")"
38,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/566769-rasmus,2,"Although mr. Ferriss has some good ideas and goals, there is one word that describes why, I am not a fan of this book: Scumbaggery.While I totally agree with Tim Ferriss, when he says that most meetings are useless and should be avoided, I cannot agree with his recommendation of making up excuses and lies, in order to leave early or not show up. This is just one example of behavior recommended in this book, and it quite frankly disgusts me.I am all for automating the dull aspects of my life, taking on personal assistants and applying to 80/20 principle where ever it fits, but I never ever want to do so at the price of my own dignity. The book has good ideas but is ultimately written for people without scruples of any kind.The author brags about winning a martial arts contest by bending the rules. He's being a scumbag and encouraging others to follow in his footsteps. I'm sorry, but that's not me."

40,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/278544-kara,1,"I just started this book, and I can't even finish it. Aside from the author grating on my last nerve with each page turn, I find his outlook on life to be overly fantastical. This book appeals to people who are working in dead end jobs that are hellish to say the least, and offers a way out to people who have lost hope. But I'll tell you something. If making a ton of money, working a 4-hour work week, and living like a millionaire were easy, everyone would do it. The fact that he's one of FEW that do, tells you that it's not for everyone. He takes you through an exercise that makes you write down your worst-case scenario of things that would happen if you just quit your job today to live like this. I'm not sure how he can just sit there and think that losing your home, going bankrupt, having your credit ruined, etc. isn't ""the end of the world"", but it's damn near close. Something tells me he's never had to deal with anything like a mortgage or the a home foreclosure.I saw him on the Today Show once with Donny Deutsch who vehemently disagreed with everything this guy had to say. Donny, who is one of the ""living dead"" according to Timothy Ferris, is also a highly successful businessman. Just proof that life is what YOU make of it - not what someone else tells you to. Read this book if you think your life is totally in the toilet and you have no other recourse. Just make sure you realize you'll be one of about 1% of people who can actually make this work..."

But what I wasn’t expecting was a call to reevaluate my life, my work, and my direction. I read it at just the right time, when I was shifting focus on projects anyway and ready for an overhaul.

Rather than hating reality, I'll show you how to bend it to your will. It's easier than it sounds.""Timothy Ferriss promises the stars in the sky in his new-classic business/self help book, The 4-Hour Workweek. Though he gives some good productivity tips, he fails to provide a true road map to freeing yourself from the 9-to-5 grind. Partially, this is because there is no real road map to doing this.But he does detail how he found his way into a life of his dreams. Readers can take whatever lessons and information from that as they will.After Ferriss relates a timeline of his life story, he begins by detailing his ""DEAL"" plan to a four hour work week which consists of ""definition, elimination, automation and liberation"". Each step of this process, he says, helps guide the reader to a new world of free time. Though, he admits, traditional bosses may have serious problems with your new program and, perhaps, you should go more ""DELA"". Yes, understatement.""Resolve now to test the concepts as an exercise in lateral thinking. If you try it, you'll see just how deep the rabbit hole goes, and you won't ever go back.""He examines the concepts of ""busy work"" and suggests boiling your workload down to the most important tasks you complete. Then, just do those as fast as possible. Don't allow yourself to be derailed by the internet or chatty coworkers. (Not a friendly method, but Ferriss seems to have his eyes on the prize rather than concerning himself with making friends.)Out of everything he suggests in the first part of this book, I was most taken with the idea of only checking your email once a day or week. There is a definite time-suck there that maybe I have been blinding myself to.After that, Ferriss enters more conceptual territory with an idea about creating a business for yourself that essentially runs itself or can be run by someone else, cheaply. For example, a website that sells something awesome. But, what exactly that something or muse is, that's for you, the reader, to discover on your own.It reminded me of Godin's Purple Cow: Transform Your Business by Being Remarkable. You know an awesome product or ""purple cow"" when you see it, but how exactly to make one isn't a clear thing. Interesting idea, but necessarily helpful for those looking for actionable items to improve their work life.The most useful part of the book, in my opinion, is his encouragement to create a dream plan by ""dreamlining"". Write down what you want to do. Create a timeline. Crunch the numbers. It may cost less than you thought and, with it on paper, it takes on a bit of reality already. If you don't get started, how do you know what you might accomplish.""It's lonely at the top. Ninety-nine percent of people in the world are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for the mediocre. The level of competition is thus fiercest for 'realistic' goals, paradoxically making them the most time-and energy-consuming. It is easier to raise $1,000,000 than it is $100,000.""Ferriss' tone in this book has been criticized by readers and I see what they mean. Some of his ideas are alienating. Sometimes he seems to say: I've done this-this-this and this, and it's so easy that if you can't figure it out too, especially with the book I've put in your hands, then you must be either complacent or dumb.But I took this book to be written by someone who dared, a nod to Brené Brown, greatly. Ferriss believed his life could be something other than a slog and yours could too. He's written down some tips to help you along the way that he discovered through real life trial and error. Read it or not. He'll be over there, living the life of his dreams.Recommended, with reservations, to folks interested in life-hacking their work/life balance. I think we can achieve whatever dreams we set our minds to while still being friendly."
44,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3399794-naveed,1,"This book is garbage. I donated it to my local library shortly after completing it. First off - the number of plugs Ferriss puts in his book is unbelievable. He's clearly getting a small cut from each of these people who want to ""advertise"" in his book. Secondly - he talks mostly about himself throughout this book. As opposed to Guy Kawasaki who might actually give instructions, and most likely will inspire, Tim Ferriss is so insecure about himself that he has to talk about his own dance skills before he gets into the meat of the book. This is the plan that Timmy here recommends - get your company to let you work remotely. Once they say yes (because that's just SO easy for everyone apparently), then you stop actually delivering results because now you're working from home, you outsource all your tasks to do (yes he really tells you to outsource ALL your job work), you travel to countries where the dollar is quite strong, and then in your spare time on a beach lagoon you create a product that can sell. You sell this product in exclusive magazines and TV - you don't try and mass market it because then it becomes a commodity. By only advertising in select places, you control the price forever, as he says. Bear in mind - you're doing all this because your company is willing to turn a deaf ear to your lack of results. Wait - there's more. Instead of creating a product - which can be easily replicated - create something else - INFORMATION, he says. Create an instructional DVD or CD (and of course he shows you the best places to produce them for you), or perhaps write an instructional book, and then sell this book to the masses. I'm sitting there reading this book and it occurred to me - this guy just DID EXACTLY THAT to me! He created so-called information, marketed the hell out of it via a blog and a catchy title, and then I lost my $19.99 to him. So I've been made out like a fool, and it was so easy that he explains how everyone can do it. This book is so filled with garbage that Tim Ferriss actually spends several pages in his book writing a line by line SCRIPT that you can use with your boss when you persuade them to let you work from home. Save your time and your money. Guy Kawasaki is better - start a good business, claim tax benefits, and work hard, and you'll be happy. Did anyone really think you can make enough money to live and support a family when you only work four hours a week? Pure garbage."

Little did I know that reading it would feel like listening to a confessional from someone who will leave no corner uncut. If you have no qualms about out-sourcing work and under-paying people to do it, then this book may be for you. If not--and you have no anthropological interest in the delusional contours of petty bourgeois entrepreneurial capitalism at the dawn of the 21st century--then avoid at all costs. "

It's often hard to think outside the box and imagine your life as you'd really like to live it, and Ferris does a good job of shaking things up.That said, many of the tactics Ferris suggests are morally questionable. You'll get more out of the book if you have no qualms about calling in ""sick"" at work, hiring overseas assistants at below minimum wage to do your busy work, setting up fake ebay auctions and canceling them at the last minute to assess consumer interest, etc. At one point, Ferris encourages people to aggressively look up the personal email addresses/ phone numbers of famous successful people to get them to be mentors. Later on the book, Ferris gives his strategies for outsourcing his phone calls/emails and avoiding all but absolutely necessary calls. So is it okay to demand other busy people's time but not his?There are some good life hacks here that might save time, although not as much as the title claims. He claims that you can get a week's worth of work done in less than a quarter of time, but the only solid suggestions I gleaned were 1)check email less often 2) don't multitask, and 3) avoid meetings like the plague. Good tips, but they won't bring you down to a four hour work week unless you were absolutely hopeless before.So it's worth reading once for the tips, and I do intend to avoid multitasking and check email less, as he suggests. But much of Ferris' strategy relies on getting others to do your work for you. If everyone started doing it, the world economy would come to a screeching halt."

It was so nice to hear that someone else in the world doesn't understand why we spend so much time on meaningless meetings and other time-fillers when there are so many meaningful things we long to do.This book is worth reading though there are a few things you'll have to endure to finish it:-potty-mouth words-author-coined terms and antonyms that include the word “rich” (ug. is this some kind of prerequisite to publishing a business book?)-and I’m sorry to tell you there are also self-help action plans at the end of every chapterBut my friends, it is WORTH it. Ferris starts with a message that rings true right to your soul. He says working nonstop for 45 years and then retiring and doing nothing makes no sense. He says you should figure out what dreams would fulfill you and then work on making enough money to accomplish those. And then he makes other completely sane statements that few people have been bold enough to make. It is moving, it feels revolutionary. Ferris then goes on to tell you task for task how to build a business you can run with just a few hours a week from anywhere in the world. Though I admire Ferris for being so bold as to back up his promise, and for actually filling the book with some meaty details, I have to admit the book often degenerates at this point and reminds me of ""How to Get Anyone to Do Anything"" (is that the title?). And although Ferris seems to miss the point that fulfillment can come from things other than international travel adventures (he mentions serving in charities abroad, but seems to overlook being kind to and serving the people around you), I still love this book. It wakes you up, and honestly, I think it would only benefit the world if a few more adults did interesting things and had an adventure every now and then instead of reading a lot of email and watching a lot of T.V. and news.I'll end by sharing one of my favorite parts:Challenging the Status Quo vs. Being Stupid1. “Retirement Is Worst-Case Scenario Insurance…: in this case, becoming physically incapable of working and needing a reservoir of capital to survive.”2. “Interest and Energy Are Cyclical…: Alternating periods of activity and rest is necessary to survive, let alone thrive.

He spends his new free time living on his terms, which for him means traveling the world. He wants you to do the same, and provides the motivation and action steps to do so. The basic message of this book: take shortcuts.In most cases, those shortcuts involve working smarter. In a few instances, however, Ferriss promotes what I would consider questionable or unethical behavior (such as telling ""half-truths"" to your boss or others, or taking advantage of loopholes in rules). Ferriss comes across as someone I could never fully trust, and thus wouldn't want to emulate entirely.Ferriss says that “Becoming a member of the NR [New Rich] is not just about working smarter. It's about building a system to replace yourself.” Ferriss calls this system Income Autopilot. He says the path to wealth and freedom is to own, not run, a business. An owner has people and systems do the work, while someone running a business is another cog in the machine.Ferriss advocates creating a product business that you can quickly scale through delegation and automation. He discourages service businesses because they’re not as easy to scale. He says that if you have a service business, you should convert it into a product business by turning your services into information products like ebooks, webinars, audio recordings, etc. I found this an interesting point, because my web design company, OptimWise, is a service business, and I’m looking to maximize profits with the least effort.One of Ferriss’ main ideas is that rather than postponing fun activities until retirement, you should take several mini-retirements that are weeks or months long, throughout your working life. This book was part of the reason that I quit my 9-5 job to start OptimWise. I wanted the freedom of working when and where I wanted, so that work fits around life, not vice versa. I really liked The Parable of the Mexican Fisherman referenced in this book.I really liked Ferriss' advice about going on an information diet. I’ve tried to follow his advice by frequently unsubscribing from email newsletters and RSS feeds. After reading this book the first time in 2008, I stopped reading the newspaper and news sites, and replaced them with NPR’s daily 5-minute news summary podcast.Ferriss advocates effectiveness in place of efficiency. He says to eliminate all the unnecessary busyness that takes up most of our time, and focus on the tasks that actually matter.Ferriss certainly presents an extreme example of the New Rich lifestyle. What if you love your job and have no desire to leave it? This book is still worth reading for the lessons about prioritization and time-management.Notes• DEAL: Define, Eliminate, Automate, Liberate.• People don’t want to be millionaires. They want the millionaire lifestyle. You can have it without being a millionaire.• Effectiveness is more important than efficiency; doing a few things effectively is better than doing many things efficiently.• The seeming lack of time is actually a lack of prioritization. Focus on the important.• Use the Pareto Principle and Parkinson’s Law to limit the tasks you undertake.• Consume information only when the need is immediate and obvious. Use “just-in-time” learning.• Eliminate before you delegate.• Don’t let people interrupt you. Force people to define their requests before you spend time on them. Empower others to act without interrupting you.• Batch routine tasks. Check email and phone messages only at predetermined times.• If you have a service business, sell information products (ebooks, audio, video, etc.) for $50-$200 (a price high enough to increase the perception of quality)."

52,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3006762-r-b-kiernan,1,"The book should be entitled, ""Everything that's Wrong with this Country."" All you need to do is cultivate ignorance, outsource everything, and never think for yourself. If you have absolutely no ethics whatsoever and want to con the masses, then you too can Get Rich Quick. Here's how:1. Pretend you're an expert on... anything. He specifically explains that it doesn't even matter what you might or might not actually know. You do this by repackaging the works of others and selling ""your"" ideas on-line -- to the gullible masses. Seriously, he begins by admitting he first made his fortune selling (allegedly) nutritional supplements that cost almost nothing to make and weren't based on science, but were then hyped to the point the uninformed public was paying through the nose to get it. This gave him ideas on how to further hype his message to an even larger audience, without bothering to sell anything tangible. Just tell them how they, too, can get rich quick by pretending to actually know something. He then gives advice about ""paraphrasing and combining points from several books,"" borrowing from the public domain, and/or compensating some other ""expert."" This way, you don't need to be bothered to actually learn anything, which brings me to step #2.2. Stay uneducated. This is in the chapter entitled ""The Low Information Diet."" He admits he doesn't bother staying abreast on the news or any other kinds of current events -- even to the point that, during election seasons, he simply asks his more educated friends about whom will win their votes and then votes for those candidates. Not kidding. He justifies this by saying how the time it takes to, you know, LEARN THINGS, is time that could be spent running a business on autopilot or having fun. Apparently, not knowing a damn thing is a virtue he calls ""Cultivating Selective Ignorance."" I prefer to call it, ""The Suicide of Democracy."" If having an educated and well-informed populace is fundamental to having a flourishing democracy, this is how we'll end up with a plutocracy where the stupidest few prey on the desperate and stupid masses, while outsourcing all the jobs they might create. This brings me to point #3.3. Outsource everything -- including your brain -- to a 3rd World Country: He hires virtual assistants in various 3rd World Countries, especially India, who are then given fabulous access to all of his personal information to the point they can pretend to be him and make all of his personal and business decisions. They send all of his correspondence, including e-mails and anything of an official nature (which causes me to assume they wrote this book for him. They certainly wrote many of the excellent reviews on Amazon). Personal business which can be done remotely are always done by them. As he states he can't be bothered to think for himself, it shouldn't be surprising he isn't interested in working for himself, either. Hey, what could possibly go wrong by hiring complete strangers and giving them all information about you in order to think for you, do your work and run your errands? Finally, point #4:4. Avoid those who want knowledge: If you can't be bothered knowing anything, why should they? Whether it's your boss or your client, do everything in your power to avoid those people because of how they drain your time. The boss wants you to attend a meeting? Just tell him you're too busy and further kill morale by then asking those other suckers - aka, co-workers - for a quick breakdown of what happened. Clients? Don't get back to them right away, if ever. If they demand to actually know something, have those remote virtual assistants send them just enough to get them to shut up.There are a couple, minuscule, points the author makes that are reasonably valid, such as: It's good to streamline your many processes and it's good to have solid goals. Also, I could say that the book begins by being very motivational. If I were critiquing this on just the first few pages it would likely have 4 stars. As it's written, the unethical, stupid and lazy b.s. kills any chance of this even getting 2 stars.I wish I hadn't bought this on Kindle.I wish I had read the bad reviews, first."
53,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49415231-amir-tesla,4,"Wow, this book literally equipped me with a new pair of eyes. The 4 hour work week basically means automating and delegating task as much as possible. This would give you enough freedom to start a new business.Another amazing insight of the book helps you escape the 5-9 routine. How? Well, it teaches you clever tricks (which is to be played on your boss). To summarize 10-20 pages, you call in sick for 2 days. You show up on day third and show how significantly you have been productive at home, then you propose a trial of 2 weeks to remote-work 2 days a week. By proving your productivity, you will gain a full-time remote work. So you can spend your weeks where ever you want while doing and enjoying your job. I have oversimplified the whole process, but, you get the idea. I highly recommend this book if you seek more freedom and aspire to run your own business. Aside from these, the book is filled with numerous productivity hacks which constituted a remarkable journey for me a productivity addict."
54,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1120545-chip-and-katie-moore,2,"Overall, I appreciate the idea he brings up in the fact that people waste their days with nonsense (this may come from the fact that I worked in the government for years). As a computer guy, I also appreciate the fact that many people don't fully harness the power of auto-replies, faqs, macros, scripts, batching, etc. to eliminate a good 80% of their work in an office environment. That being the case, the idea of doing all of this doesn't work everywhere (only certain office/sales jobs I suspect), and no boss I've had has ever really appreciated the work I went through to be more efficient either. Even when my work propagated to others and our unit had plenty of free time, all that happened was more filler was added to our workload to make us look busy, or our staff was assigned elsewhere to places not as efficient. So, I'd recommend following the advise he offers for being more efficient and less plugged in, but not necessarily making it known you're doing so unless you're forced into a corner.The other part of the book espousing the benefits of Direct Marketing are much like the ideas of Rich Dad/Poor Dad for real estate - cute ideas, and I truly believe they will work for some, but not everyone has what it takes to get in on these 'get-rich-quick' ideas at the right time. I feel like success in these field requires a type of personality not everyone has, or wants to have (he references the 'Girls Gone Wild' videos as a good example of direct marketing)?? That may be a true example - but all the money in the world can't make taking advantage of a bunch of drunk girls appealing to me - so, for me it's not a good example.I'll end by saying the book is short enough to warrant reading. It has some interesting enough ideas peppered throughout that if you can plow through the stuff that you don't like, get it out from the library and read it or flip through it at the book store to see if you get anything from it, but don't necessarily buy thinking it will change your life."

So far, I have only two: Rich Dad Poor Dad and this one. Though Rich Dad introduced me to the concept of owning assets that pay you to free your time, 4-hour workweek dispels a lot of myths about the need to make millions to live the life that we all dream about. In actuality, its a lot closer than we all realize.Everyone should read this book. Almost every single one of my friends has gone through the book.

Well, that and it was free on a holiday promotion. There are words to describe my opinion of this book, however most of them would break the terms and conditions of this site. Suffice it to say, it's one big sales pitch for being an egomaniac, passive agressive jerk. It boils entirely down to outsource or eliminate anything you can, any way you can, handwaves at ""creating"" businesses with no actual, practical advice on how to determine a market need (which is the hardest part of any business: Figuring out what's needed in the first place!), and then spend lots of your time places where the exchange rate makes you comparatively rich.Not even worth free."

However, he has about 3 points I took away, and I can appreciate him for that: 1. Don't waste time trying to accomplish things that don't help your bottom line 2. More time given to do things makes more time to procrastinate 3. ""Batch"" activities at one time to get them done faster (i.e. check email once a day maybe). If these lessons stick, then I can see myself raising the stars. Otherwise, the messages in this book really weren't applicable to anyone in a caring, teaching, or hourly profession. This talked about marketing and selling things to make a buck, when many, many people don't do that and don't aspire to do that. There are many professions the author ignores. Maybe I wasn't the right audience? I certainly am not going to outsource all my emailing to India and hire a personal assistant just so I can effectively practice the art of delegating (that was a long chapter), because that just doesn't sit well with me. I also am not going to spend every moment of my free time traveling the world just to accomplish brag-worthy feats instead of spending time with my family and friends (that was a pretty long chapter too), because that just seems sort of empty. But again, I guess I am not the right audience."

Some of his actions mentioned in the book may make people feel not comfortable, and prone to oppose to his arguments. But the things he said make sense to me, and gosh, he is hilarious.

Most of the 'mobility' tips do not apply in my case, since I happen to live AND earn in one of those 'ridiculously cheap' countries.There was no little escaping from this book. Since I have a work/ organisation/ near burnout crisis each year in June (comes with the territory), I tend to google for tips and motivation, and The 4-Hour Work Week reached me in small, irritating snippets. 1. The principles seemed tempting, but unenforceable in my profession, as evidenced by numerous comments on the irrelevance of the Pareto Principle in education. You just have to put in the hours, even if you do that by Skype; most of the valid exams need to take place in teacher's presence; you can't tell 80% of your students to just get lost; on most levels of education, 'automation' such as peer assessment simply doesn't work (on others, it can be used, but will not replace teacher's assessment). The ugly: some issues just can't be dealt with ""intensively"" - as evidenced by joking, but telling questions on the author's on the release date of The 4-hour Baby.The good: Ferriss' elimination tips are quite inspiring even to non entrepreneurs. They're good reminders to not increase one's workload automatically and unreflexively, as teachers often do. In the words of Anne Taintor:http://s30.postimg.org/f5qt0jw5t/magn...I decided to implement some of the ideas I previously had that would make students more responsible for their learning and material preparation (with me interfering and supplementing whatever information they might have left out, that is). I also thought I might revise class rules as a set of basic rules + Frequently Asked Questions in an attempt to make them more independent. 2. Something about the approach to work this books represents seems, frankly speaking, immoral to me, and not just me. This piece by Penelope Trunk is a classic by now: http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2009/01...This piece by Jennifer Dziura https://medium.com/get-bullish/a5e5f4... is much more recent and contains a sentence that says it all:If you seem to be “getting everything you want,” you should probably examine whether you’re getting it at someone’s expense, or whether you’re just constantly, in small ways, making the world worse.3. When I was a kid, I read and anthology of science fiction stories, including a story (I can't recall the title) about a society of the future in which people removed the obstacle of the decision making process (the decisions in it are taken instantly, which results in living an equivalent of an action-packed lifetime in just one night. Tim Ferriss reminds me of the protagonist, as his aim seems to be to live as many lives as possible in one lifetime. Somewhat unsurprisingly, I remember his blog post about his panic attacks (which I can't locate now), which somehow makes sense. To be fair, he also urges the reader to slow down and savour life, but somehow hmm.The (completely unexpected) good:- 'It is vain to do with more what can be done with less."" - William of Ockham; not a a bad motto to work by.- I was surprised by his stress on do-gooding, volunteering and making donations.- Dreamlining - I was surprised by how much my dreams are time-dependent instead of money-dependent.Now, I think, time to read this, for balance: In Praise of Slowness: Challenging the Cult of Speed"
66,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1957039-patrick,4,"So in reality, The 4-Hour Workweek is lifestyle porn for me. Tim Ferriss discusses real, practical strategies for cutting loose from the traditional working world, and living a lifestyle with less work, more time for important things, and the ability to travel the world.I liked this book quite a bit. I'm not sure how useful most of it will be to me, but it sure makes me dream about what *could* be. ""If only I had an idea for a business...""Mr. Ferriss not only provides philosophical and psychological reasons for getting your employer to let you work at home, but he talks about how to set up your own business that requires minimal interaction and will be able to support you as you live in different countries.I had only two problems with this book:1) While Mr. Ferriss rightly disparages working your ass off so you can enjoy your retirement (referring to it as ""deferred life""), he does seem to make the assumption that you'll be able to alternate work and ""mini-retirements"" forever. Frankly, I'm guessing that when I'm 75, I'm not going to be terribly effective at working at all. I'm disappointed by his lack of consideration for care during my waning years. Maybe he's a proponent of ice floes?2) Tim Ferriss's biggest fan is Tim Ferriss. It was a bit unseemly how often he talked about how great he was. I understand that he's trying to convince us that if he could do it, we could too, but I'm tired of hearing about how he won a tango competition, dined at 5-star restaurants, or practices martial arts. If his personality in real life is anything like he comes across in the book, I suspect that I wouldn't get a word in edgewise if we were hanging out.Ok, bonus problem: He uses the term ""muse"" to refer to ""an automated vehicle for generating cash without consuming time"". Every time he uses it, it's jarring, because I know what the term actually means.Anyway, those faults aside, this book contained tons of great information for entrepreneurs and people who are looking to cut loose from the daily grind. Lots of great information here. Highly recommended for anyone who has ever had dreams of doing something different with their work life."
67,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28646-bryan,4,"I had been reluctant to read this as I assumed it was written by a spoiled and out-of-touch entrepreneur. Recently, however, a friend pointed out to me that an author I liked had been on Ferris' podcast. I listened and enjoyed the conversation they had. I continued listening to subsequent episodes, and decided that in spite of my irrational prejudice, I was starting to like him more and more. This book is a bit dated now, and does in places come off as brash and irritating, yet it's quite positive and an open challenge to live life on one's own terms. As a result it's inspirational, and it gives some insight into how differently people can think about risks and resources. In certain ways I wish I'd read it earlier, as it would likely have saved me a few years spent obeying societal dictates in a career to which I was not particularly suited. But I think without the good impression left by the compassionate and sometimes fascinating interviews Ferris does on his podcast, I might have been less receptive to the book's tone."

I personally know people who have basically changed their entire lifestyle after reading Tim Ferriss' book.I read it in Spanish, so I won't comment on the language.Stating the obvious, the title doesn't really deliver on its promise. However, that doesn't mean there isn't plenty of practical advice on how to question (and perhaps improve) your own lifestyle.The hardest part for me to swallow is the total inconsideration of other people that Ferriss has. Waste other people's time so you can save yours? Go for it. The world simply wouldn't work if everyone acted according to Ferriss' advise.The strongest parts of the book are 1) the focus on essentialism, and 2) the questions the author asks you to ask yourself, and the exercises he recommends.All in all, this is a modern classic packed with practical advise which is worth the read.

The first time I saw this book, it lay on the desk of a ridiculous person who somehow clearly hated working but also made his life much, much harder by attempting to do everyone else’s jobs in addition to his own. Maybe he really did need this book. But as far as I know, he continued to micromanage everyone despite this book’s best takeaway being the “art” of delegation. I decided to download the audio of this book after listening to the BY THE BOOK episodes about it. I’ve had a rough time staying on top of my work lately and hoped maybe I could get a helpful word or two about getting things done. Boy did I get a word. 4-HOUR WW is equal parts ridiculous, genius, and unintentionally entertaining. The audiobook reader’s voice stressed me out beyond belief, but I loved it. Useful aspects of this book include the discussion of Parkinson’s Law (absolutely true), the 80/20 rule, the time-suckage of email, and generally useful points about the kinds of customers that aren’t worth having. There is some wisdom here. But ultimately, most working people—whether small business owners or corporate employees like me—cannot take most of these steps and wouldn’t have the means to do so anyway. That many people take actual satisfaction in their work and that many employers view their employees as more than human drones are truths completely glossed over. And it should go without saying that if everyone approached their work life this way, then capitalism would fail faster than a speeding bullet. Wait a minute...Is capitalism a Ponzi scheme?This book also got weirdly existential in the end, but I’ll leave that one mostly alone. I didn’t really sign up to get “meaning of life” advice from Tim Ferriss, kickboxing “expert” and meditation extraordinaire; but I suppose if you’re willing to take and leave parts of this book (which I clearly am), it’s not a bad thing to be reminded that you are more than the job you do. This book has no balance whatsoever, but whatever. I laughed a lot while listening and putting together my patio furniture. And maybe I will try to check email fewer times during the day."

The thesis is simple: you can live like a millionaire, without actually being one. The 4 Hour Work Weeks touches on a variety of topics including automation, offshoring, delegation, minimalism and productivity. Key Takeaways  Definitions The New Rich have a different mindset to the typical employee or business owner. The New Rich: - have others work for them - distribute recovery periods and adventures (mini-retirements) throughout life - recognize that inactivity is not the goal and instead prioritise doing what excites them - focus on establishing a steady cash flow first, and then a big payday later.Everything popular is wrongRetirement is worst-case scenario insurance. Interest and energy are cyclical - alternate between work and rest. Doing less is not being lazy. The New Rich measure their contribution in results, not time. Laziness isn’t working less; laziness is letting circumstances define your life for you. The timing is never right. Whatever you want to do someday, just do it now. Ask for forgiveness, not permission. Emphasize your strengths, don’t fix weaknesses - this often provides a multiplier effect, while trying to fix weaknesses typically leads to only incremental improvement.Money alone is not the solution but relative income is more important than absolute income. Relative income measures both time and money. A person working 10 hours a week and making $10,000 is richer than someone working 80 hours a week and making $100,000. Embrace good stress instead of avoiding stress altogether.Most people are convinced they can only accomplish mediocre things. There is therefore more competition for mediocre goals. Elimination 80% of results come from 20% of actions. Ask yourself the following questions what 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness and what 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness?Be difficult when it matters - eg when it comes to protecting your productivity. Automation Build up a solid weekly income, independent of your day job:Step 1: Pick a reachable niche market. Find a market by defining your customers, and then designing your product around them. Preferably you must be a member of said market. Step 2: Brainstorm products whose benefit can be explained in one sentence or phrase. - The product should be expensive enough to sell fewer units, create higher profit margins, and attract lower-maintenance customers – but not so expensive that customers want to speak with you before buying. - The product should take less than 4 weeks to manufacture - The product should be fully explainable in an online FAQ. The easiest type of product to create is an information product – low-cost, fast to manufacture, and time-consuming for competitors to duplicate. If you read the top three books on a given subject, you’ll know more about the subject than 80% of the relevant population, thereby qualifying you as an expert. The person with the highest credibility will sell the most, not the person who knows the most about the subject. To establish credibility:1) Join 2 or 3 trade associations with official-sounding names.2) Read the 3 top-selling books on the topic and write a one-page summary of each.3) Go to the closest university, put up posters advertising a free seminar on the subject, and give the seminar using the summaries you’ve written.4) Call up a local branch of a well-known company and tell them you’ve done the seminars at the university and that you’re a member of the trade associations. Explain that you’re trying to gain speaking experience outside of the academic setting.5) Leverage your trade association membership and speaking experience to get an article published for a trade magazine. The only way to test if anyone actually wants your product is to ask people to buy it. Create a basic one-to-three-page website, put up a Google AdWords advertisement and use the response to test whether people will buy.  Liberation A 5 step process for getting your employer to let you work from home permanently:1. Increase investment - get your employer to first invest in you to increase their cost if you leave. For example, ask if the firm has any additional trainings available to employees and take them.2. Prove increased output offsite - call off sick for two days in the middle of the week, double your work output on both days, and make sure to demonstrate and record it with an email trail. 3. Show the business benefit - position remote working as a business benefit, not a personal perk. Bill more client time, complete more projects, or otherwise demonstrate quantified improvement. Explain the increased productivity as less time commuting and fewer distractions. 4. Propose a trial period - Informally mention to your boss how you were sick those two days and didn’t expect to get anything done, but were actually twice as productive. Ask if you could try working from home for 2 days in the next two weeks. When your boss objects, acknowledge his concerns and propose working from home only one day a week instead. 5. Expand remote time - Continue to excel on your work-from-home days and drop your in-office performance to heighten the contrast. Ask for another trial period with an extra two days at home. After your boss has gotten used to this, ask for a full-time remote trial of 2 weeks. Conclusion There are as many gems in this book as there is questionable advice. I am not too sure about Ferris' idea to essentially automate your life through offshoring daily tasks. This seems to be going too far. I was also particularly irritated by the fact that he highlights ""most countries in Africa"" as not ideal locations to travel to and work from because of the risk of kidnapping and terrorism. Seriously? Those 2 sentences near the end of the book pretty much ruined the rest of it for me, and thus 3 stars.That said, the chapters on Income Automation and productivity are well worth reading as these are the most practical I think I have read in any work. Other than that...meh."
73,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65849150-kelsey,3,"The extended edition is recommended as it updates many of the author's early ideas with more recently relevant tools and tips (original text released in 2009). Be warned, the audiobook is fine overall, but because lots of chapters list resources and websites parenthetically in the middle of a sentence or idea, you'll often find yourself repeatedly being read the ""www dot so-and-so dot com forward-slash home forward-slash news forward-slash whatever dot html"". Also, keep in mind that some of the tools the author mentions, while useful, may have been made obsolete when compared to some other things we have that we didn't commonly use in 2009 (like cloud computing versus working locally) or more efficient products have perhaps been released. Overall, good ideas and a recommended read for anyone who runs their own side hustle or fledgling business.As someone who does virtual assisting, I was disappointed about how much Ferriss underscored the perks of having a VA from India or another far off land. While differences of time zone (you can send off tasks at the end of the day and wake to find them completed) and spend (you often pay less than US standard wages for the same work) may be beneficial to an entrepreneur, I think this sort of thinking is dangerous to tout as THE way to succeed while delegating work. VAs come in all shapes, sizes, and skillsets, and opting to only hire non-domestic VAs with cost as a primary driver undermines the quality work that can be done by anyone ANYWHERE. If they're remote, why do they need to be in India? From Ferriss' telling, it seems cost is the only thing that really drives that desire, and I find that disappointing. It's like telling an artist you can buy the same thing at Walmart for $15...it undermines the craft and good work that anyone can do and comes off as a bit tone deaf and opportunistic in a world where Americans know that off-shore labor is often cheaper because it doesn't actually meet the needs of the worker being paid low wages. I'm not saying foreign VAs don't deserve pay and opportunity; I'm saying those looking for assistants should consider how best to support the HUMAN who needs the job.So, that being said, if you'd like to hire a virtual assistant, consider ALL virtual assistants, not just the ones you can pay next to nothing to do all your bitch work while you sleep. /endrant"
74,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5820202-koen-van-den-eeckhout,2,"Positive points: I strongly agree with some of the principles in this book, especially the Pareto principle and Parkinson's law, which can make your approach much more efficient.Neutral points: Ferriss uses a writing style balancing between motivational and arrogant, often crossing the line towards the latter. Nevertheless, it kinda fits the 'fuck it' theme of the book and easy to get used to. The book reads very quickly.Negative points: besides feeling outdated already (Blackberry? Yahoo shops?), Ferriss often crosses the line towards the downright unethical. Several pages on how to be widely regarded as an expert without being one, or marketing techniques which are pretty much illegal (e.g. selling items on eBay without having them)."
75,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602450-vladyslav-sitalo,3,"The style of the book is somewhat annoying but if you overcome this annoyance this book has something to share with you.--It's a fun fact that I've decided to read this book around the same time as Elon Musk's biography.And as both of the books is fresh in my mind, I can see two drastically different approaches to life from Elon and Tim.Tim is asking reader to dream big set impossible goals and than talks about buying a car or going to some nice place to live.From my perspective ""big"" is what Musk is doing - to transform car and space industries is big, to give humanity ability to travel to Mars is big, to minimize risks from superintelligent AI is big.Buying a Ferrari eh, it's kind of mediocre.I'm not saying that goal to buy Ferrari or live in constant travel or enjoying yourself in any other way is not a worthy goal, just saying that, well, it's not ""big"".It's happens to be true that my sentiments and goals is much more aligned with the Musk's vision. So this fact immediately questions the applicability of suggested techniques as THE way to achieve your goals if they are really big. (What would you set you month input goal if your actual goal is to go to the other planet (really really expensive) or achieve personal immortality (not technologically feasible right now, but it's plausible that it can be achievable in the nearest 50 years. And you can actually work on advancing scientific research/industry/public appreciation to make it feasible sooner then later)? )And so getting back to the comparison between Musk and Ferriss lifestyle - you can see big difference in them - you can probably characterize them as ""4 hour workweek"" vs ""4 hours to sleep"" or by goals ""go to Mars"" vs ""sip wine and play guitar with my amigos"".Do you have to adopt the work style similar to Musk's to achieve really big things? Well, I don't know, but Musk is succeeding and it is sensible to take him as an example at least to some extent.That said, I would admit that the lifestyle, proposed in the book is by all means more interesting and richer on life experience than your average one. Though, important thing to notice is that, unfortunately, this kind of lifestyle is not sustainable for majority of the population (you can tell this by simply looking how much people is employed as VA/outsources/etc for sustaining it for one person). Also despite described drawbacks this book contains a lot of great advice. For example - call to eliminate waste work and focus on the most efficient approaches is obviously applicable almost to everyone and everywhere (and the book provides you with recomendations and options on how to actually do that).I was always for elimination of unnecessary stuff/work/interruption. But Tim here is also talking about an information limitation. And I have to admit that I'm and informational addict in a way :). I don't read news, newspapers/magazines, I don't watch TV.But I totally into reading books, listening audiobooks/podcasts and reading interesting articles on the web. The book convinced me to limit time for email/social networks to two limited periods during the day. And i think it's a great practice. I've also become more picky regarding articles that I read.But, that said, constant learning and self education is one of the values that I practice and want to excel in. And you can't learn new things without getting info about them :).More on positive side:Facing your fears as a way to make a better decisions is really interesting technique.Tim is advocating lean approach to building business and it resonates with Lean Startup approach but applied to non-tech business which is interesting.He is questioning a lot of ""common sense"" assumptions and encouraging people to do this more often. I think that this approach can lead to better society in general.Also Tim briefly advocates ""choice-minimal"" lifestyle. Characteristic quote: ""Fast decisions preserve usable attention for what matters""I have this problem with choice anxiety - I just have to choose the best option, but I've been noticing and regarding this as a problem because I'm spending too much time focusing on minor decisions and I think there is better use for this time. The book do not address problem in depth but have a reference for ""The paradox of choice"" https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1... which I intend to read.Also I would recommend http://thewirecutter.com for people with similar problems as at least a partial solution that can eliminate/mitigate your choice anxiety for a lot of products.More on the downside besides the style:One thing that remained in my mind as bluntly stupid - house that just stays there, and guy is loosing money on it for some mysterious reason (it's not like it would take any amount of time to ask VA to rent it/find a good agency to work with).Tim is constantly overconfidently saying stuff about everything in the world. That's annoying, especially considering that what he is telling often is not entirely? True And he is almost never giving any quantifiable data to support his claims.Other thing Is confused thinking on some topics, for example thoughts on charity/service work. If you actually want to do some good (and not just feel good about yourself) look into https://80000hours.org/ project or http://www.givewell.org/."

Don’t work just for money for owning enviable things, follow your passion and do interesting things. Be unrealistic.“The future is here; It’s just not distributed yet”.-E is for elimination: Do first thing first, if you don’t have time you don’t have PRIORITIES. You have to define what you want to do with your time. Understand the Pareto principle “80 % of the outputs result from 20% of the inputs”. Be productive not just active, focus on what is important for you and neglect the tasks which do not take you closer to your goals, do not multitask, learn to propose don’t let others influence your decisions, cultivate selective ignorance “knowledge is power but knowledge without action are useless”, practice the art of nonfinishing and the art of refusal. Protect yourself from people who waste your time. “Reading, after a certain age, diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking.”-A is for automation: * HIRE AN ASSISTANT: Lingering unimportant tasks will disappear as soon as someone else is being paid to do them.

81,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16366211-ro,5,"What I like about this book is that it introduces a lot of new concepts for me - for a better (work) life, while also challenges my existing concepts on (work) life.I am particularly intrigued by the New Rich concept that defines “riches” not in having millions or billions, but more on the use of one’s time / having time freedom. “Those who abandon the deferred-life plan and create luxury lifestyles in the present using the currency of the New Rich: time and mobility.”While it would help to have millions and billions, often we are trapped in this rut of wanting more and pushing off “living in the moment” until we believe we have enough. And you guessed it, that day of having enough, never comes (unless you have a mindset shift). The most mind blowing thing is that the author shows how everyday ordinary people can & do have the means to live luxuriously but are held back by their limiting beliefs that they need to have more, work harder and join the millions and billions club.The author introduces several business models, tips tricks and tools that you can use to “eliminate” and “automate” your work - to free up your time; something you can immediately apply into your (work) life if you wish. 	i.e. 80/20 Pareto’s law According to the 80/20 rule: 80% of results are from 20% of action80% of outputs are from 20% of inputs80% of consequences are from 20% of the causes 80% of profits are from 20% of products and customers A practical use of the 80/20 rule is to ask yourself: 1. Which 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness?2. Which 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness? The book further highlights on our insistent need to “be productive"", which only leads us to fill our time with xx just to “feel productive”. If we reassess our daily to-do list and eliminate all the unnecessary time fillers, we can free up our time to do productive fulfilling things - things we truly enjoy.For example, the “mini retirement” concept talks about how instead of saving up our entire life’s savings to spend when we retire, why not use that money throughout your life and have what the author calls “mini retirements”. This way, you can truly enjoy life while you are young and in your prime, rather than wait until the time is right, which again may never happen. This definitely challenges my personal limiting belief - as I am one of those people who likes to wait until it’s the right time. The book ends by touching on some psychology and self help (my favorite topic) - that even after achieving the “4 hour work week” and have all the time in the world to do what you truly enjoy. Don’t expect all life challenges to just disappear. It is not easy to just ""wind down and enjoy”. Hence why being rich and depressed, successful and depressed are all too familiar. “Man is so made that he can only find relaxation from one kind of labor by taking up another” - Anatole FranceYou cannot just transition overnight from being a goal oriented high-performer to appreciating life in the moment. Although it is not impossible to do both, unraveling such habits take time - just like anything else in life; “leaning to replace the perception of time famine with the appreciation for time abundance is like going from triple espresso to decaf”.Recognizing this is the first step.Appreciating time abundance and living in the present doesn’t mean we should just sit on our butts and do nothing either. According to some of the most fulfilled people interviewed for the book’s case studies: 1. continual learning2. serviceare two commons factors for a fulfilled life. And I absolutely agree, I find my life the most meaningful when I’m continuously learning and can be of service to the world. I like that this book falls not only into the genre of business and entrepreneurship but also philosophy, psychology and self-help - which I think are intricately linked. In order to be well-informed, you need to be able to evaluate things from different perspective.Most of what is said in this book is no new news. I believe most of us are already familiar with the idea that we should enjoy life and live life in the moment but through seeing it from the author’s lens, the author’s way of getting things across that help sharpens my vague understanding of things - and honed down the messages for me even more. Definitely a good read on my list!Edit: I’m surprised this book receives a lot of negative reviews - mostly from people questioning Ferriss’s ego, and his “unethical” ways of doing businesses such as outsourcing help from virtual assistants in third world countries, who charge less.I did feel put off reading it because I had read these negative reviews prior to starting, but I’m glad I gave it a go anyway because I still learned a lot from the book and did not share the same negative sentiments towards Ferriss.I didn’t see this book as a guide on how to get rich quick etc, but rather more like an introduction to a lifestyle different from the accepted norm and more like a motivational tool / insights into Ferriss and others’ success stories. And not to defend Ferriss (although that is probably exactly what I am doing) - there is no need to be holier-than-thou. I don’t think the author is recommending us to take advantage of cheaper labour in poorer countries but rather how money can go further there, hence why they charge less.I am not sure if it’s fair to compare hiring virtual assistants in third world countries who charge less - to slave labors or garment workers for example. Yes, the rate is lower than developed countries but the overall expenses are lower too.Plus it's a question about the whole system we are inMoral contradiction / ethical dilemma There is a section in the book that addresses exactly this: Service for the right reasons: to save the whales or kill them and feed the children?“Service to me is simple: doing something that improves life besides your own.This is not the same as philanthropy. Philanthropy is the altruistic concern for the well-being of mankind–human life. Human life and comfort have long been focused on to the exclusion of the environment and the rest of the food chain, hence our current race to imminent extinction. Serves us right. The world does not exist solely for the betterment and multiplication of mankind.Before I start chaining myself to trees and saving the dart frogs, though, I should take my own advice: do not become a cause snob.How can you help starving children in Africa when there are starving children in Los Angeles? How can you save the whales when homeless people are freezing to death? How does doing volunteer research on coral destruction help those people who need help now?”Children, please. Everything out there needs help, so don’t get baited into “my cause can beat up your cause” arguments with no right answer. There are no qualitative or quantitative comparisons that make sense. The truth is this: those thousands of lives you save could contribute to a famine that kills millions, or that one bush in Bolivia that you protect could hold the cure for cancer. The downstream effects are unknown. Do your best and hope for the best. If you’re improving the world–however you define that–consider your job well done.Service isn’t limited to saving lives or the environment. It can also improve life. If you are a musician and put a smile on the faces of thousands or millions, I view that as service. If you are a mentor and change the life of one child for the better, the world has been improved. Improving the quality of life in the world is in no fashion inferior to adding more lives.”Service is an attitude.”"
82,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39587412-enrique-ma-as,5,"The first word that comes into my mind to tag this book is: inspiring.But let's elaborate. Timothy Ferriss comes from a different background: after selling his first company for a bunch of billions, we jump into a digital nomad lifestyle. He considers that his decisions are extendable to the middle-class and the people working 9-17, and addressing this he fails miserably. Is two different rivers with different water. But there is however a lot of important information and philosophies we can extract from this book.Timothy dedicates an important part of his book to talk about Virtual Assistants and popular places to hire them. This is a useful information to start with, but most of the rules we later on talks about are about common sense (do provide them with clear orders, leave everything written, give them freedom to expend money until certain amount...). Many of the websites and ideas about reselling are useful and not that well known.The book in general challenges you to move out from your comfort zone and take risks, which is by itself a vary valuable reason. ""The 4-hour workweek"" title is misleading, since as Tim himself recognizes is not about the money you have earned, but about the freedom you now have and the mobility worldwide. If I would be a boss with responsibility over other people, I would be worried if many of them were reading it. I actually quit my job before finishing it.As a side note: Tim writing's style is very selfish and self-centered. But that does not mean a star less for me"

For those who are in a service-oriented industry, his tactics do not seem to apply. Some of his tips do have merit however, such as keeping distractions to a minimum by only checking email and phone messages sparingly and delegating smaller tasks not absolutely necessary to other people to better utilize ones time on priorities. We will see if there is more to his book after I'm finished though before I give my final rating.After reading it, I think that I'm still in the same mindset as before. It was written seemingly for those who do not like their job. For those of us who were lucky enough to choose a profession that we actually enjoy, this is probably not the quintessential book of choice. It is packed with situations that are 99% ""not going to happen,"" such as the ""ask your boss if you can just work from home"" scenario. If I were to even try to ask my boss about that, he would just say ""I don't think so"" before 10 words were out of my mouth. The latter half of the book DID make me want to travel more, but the very end just seemed a bit preachy. All in all, I could see how this could possibly be inspiring to some, but not to most."

And a lot of prompts for trying to figure out what you'd rather be doing, and for figuring out how to get there from here.The gist of all of it is that people don't really want to be millionaires, they want to have what they assume is the millionaire lifestyle.

I like being efficient, so I especially enjoyed his chapter on Automation, and I can easily see how to apply it to my own business.Tim Ferris will teach you how to work remotely, how to cut 50% of your work load, and how to live your life to the fullest. He provides solid resources for each chapter, and his ideas are all workable. I think some of his methods are a bit sketchy though. I'm not the kind of person to 'scam a system'. That's probably why I'll never be rich like Tim Ferris. But there are definitely some good takeaways from his book.It will definitely make you think. Read it."

95,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23066833-bloodorange,3,"Disclaimers:I skipped parts of the book that dealt with product development and automation, since these do not apply to my experience. Most of the 'mobility' tips do not apply in my case, since I happen to live AND earn in one of those 'ridiculously cheap' countries.There was no little escaping from this book. Since I have a work/ organisation/ near burnout crisis each year in June (comes with the territory), I tend to google for tips and motivation, and The 4-Hour Work Week reached me in small, irritating snippets. 1. The principles seemed tempting, but unenforceable in my profession, as evidenced by numerous comments on the irrelevance of the Pareto Principle in education. You just have to put in the hours, even if you do that by Skype; most of the valid exams need to take place in teacher's presence; you can't tell 80% of your students to just get lost; on most levels of education, 'automation' such as peer assessment simply doesn't work (on others, it can be used, but will not replace teacher's assessment). The ugly: some issues just can't be dealt with ""intensively"" - as evidenced by joking, but telling questions on the author's on the release date of The 4-hour Baby.The good: Ferriss' elimination tips are quite inspiring even to non entrepreneurs. They're good reminders to not increase one's workload automatically and unreflexively, as teachers often do. In the words of Anne Taintor:http://s30.postimg.org/f5qt0jw5t/magn...I decided to implement some of the ideas I previously had that would make students more responsible for their learning and material preparation (with me interfering and supplementing whatever information they might have left out, that is). I also thought I might revise class rules as a set of basic rules + Frequently Asked Questions in an attempt to make them more independent. 2. Something about the approach to work this books represents seems, frankly speaking, immoral to me, and not just me. This piece by Penelope Trunk is a classic by now: http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2009/01...This piece by Jennifer Dziura https://medium.com/get-bullish/a5e5f4... is much more recent and contains a sentence that says it all:If you seem to be “getting everything you want,” you should probably examine whether you’re getting it at someone’s expense, or whether you’re just constantly, in small ways, making the world worse.3. When I was a kid, I read and anthology of science fiction stories, including a story (I can't recall the title) about a society of the future in which people removed the obstacle of the decision making process (the decisions in it are taken instantly, which results in living an equivalent of an action-packed lifetime in just one night. Tim Ferriss reminds me of the protagonist, as his aim seems to be to live as many lives as possible in one lifetime. Somewhat unsurprisingly, I remember his blog post about his panic attacks (which I can't locate now), which somehow makes sense. To be fair, he also urges the reader to slow down and savour life, but somehow hmm.The (completely unexpected) good:- 'It is vain to do with more what can be done with less."" - William of Ockham; not a a bad motto to work by.- I was surprised by his stress on do-gooding, volunteering and making donations.- Dreamlining - I was surprised by how much my dreams are time-dependent instead of money-dependent.Now, I think, time to read this, for balance: In Praise of Slowness: Challenging the Cult of Speed"
96,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1957039-patrick,4,"So in reality, The 4-Hour Workweek is lifestyle porn for me. Tim Ferriss discusses real, practical strategies for cutting loose from the traditional working world, and living a lifestyle with less work, more time for important things, and the ability to travel the world.I liked this book quite a bit. I'm not sure how useful most of it will be to me, but it sure makes me dream about what *could* be. ""If only I had an idea for a business...""Mr. Ferriss not only provides philosophical and psychological reasons for getting your employer to let you work at home, but he talks about how to set up your own business that requires minimal interaction and will be able to support you as you live in different countries.I had only two problems with this book:1) While Mr. Ferriss rightly disparages working your ass off so you can enjoy your retirement (referring to it as ""deferred life""), he does seem to make the assumption that you'll be able to alternate work and ""mini-retirements"" forever. Frankly, I'm guessing that when I'm 75, I'm not going to be terribly effective at working at all. I'm disappointed by his lack of consideration for care during my waning years. Maybe he's a proponent of ice floes?2) Tim Ferriss's biggest fan is Tim Ferriss. It was a bit unseemly how often he talked about how great he was. I understand that he's trying to convince us that if he could do it, we could too, but I'm tired of hearing about how he won a tango competition, dined at 5-star restaurants, or practices martial arts. If his personality in real life is anything like he comes across in the book, I suspect that I wouldn't get a word in edgewise if we were hanging out.Ok, bonus problem: He uses the term ""muse"" to refer to ""an automated vehicle for generating cash without consuming time"". Every time he uses it, it's jarring, because I know what the term actually means.Anyway, those faults aside, this book contained tons of great information for entrepreneurs and people who are looking to cut loose from the daily grind. Lots of great information here. Highly recommended for anyone who has ever had dreams of doing something different with their work life."
97,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28646-bryan,4,"I had been reluctant to read this as I assumed it was written by a spoiled and out-of-touch entrepreneur. Recently, however, a friend pointed out to me that an author I liked had been on Ferris' podcast. I listened and enjoyed the conversation they had. I continued listening to subsequent episodes, and decided that in spite of my irrational prejudice, I was starting to like him more and more. This book is a bit dated now, and does in places come off as brash and irritating, yet it's quite positive and an open challenge to live life on one's own terms. As a result it's inspirational, and it gives some insight into how differently people can think about risks and resources. In certain ways I wish I'd read it earlier, as it would likely have saved me a few years spent obeying societal dictates in a career to which I was not particularly suited. But I think without the good impression left by the compassionate and sometimes fascinating interviews Ferris does on his podcast, I might have been less receptive to the book's tone."
98,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18908489-alexander-svanevik,4,"Hard to rate.No doubt, this book has had a huge impact on many people's lives. I personally know people who have basically changed their entire lifestyle after reading Tim Ferriss' book.I read it in Spanish, so I won't comment on the language.Stating the obvious, the title doesn't really deliver on its promise. However, that doesn't mean there isn't plenty of practical advice on how to question (and perhaps improve) your own lifestyle.The hardest part for me to swallow is the total inconsideration of other people that Ferriss has. Waste other people's time so you can save yours? Go for it. The world simply wouldn't work if everyone acted according to Ferriss' advise.The strongest parts of the book are 1) the focus on essentialism, and 2) the questions the author asks you to ask yourself, and the exercises he recommends.All in all, this is a modern classic packed with practical advise which is worth the read. But please take the advise with a pinch of salt."

100,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/557179-jocelyn-bailey,3,"My bizarre love affair with business and self-help books continues! The first time I saw this book, it lay on the desk of a ridiculous person who somehow clearly hated working but also made his life much, much harder by attempting to do everyone else’s jobs in addition to his own. Maybe he really did need this book. But as far as I know, he continued to micromanage everyone despite this book’s best takeaway being the “art” of delegation. I decided to download the audio of this book after listening to the BY THE BOOK episodes about it. I’ve had a rough time staying on top of my work lately and hoped maybe I could get a helpful word or two about getting things done. Boy did I get a word. 4-HOUR WW is equal parts ridiculous, genius, and unintentionally entertaining. The audiobook reader’s voice stressed me out beyond belief, but I loved it. Useful aspects of this book include the discussion of Parkinson’s Law (absolutely true), the 80/20 rule, the time-suckage of email, and generally useful points about the kinds of customers that aren’t worth having. There is some wisdom here. But ultimately, most working people—whether small business owners or corporate employees like me—cannot take most of these steps and wouldn’t have the means to do so anyway. That many people take actual satisfaction in their work and that many employers view their employees as more than human drones are truths completely glossed over. And it should go without saying that if everyone approached their work life this way, then capitalism would fail faster than a speeding bullet. Wait a minute...Is capitalism a Ponzi scheme?This book also got weirdly existential in the end, but I’ll leave that one mostly alone. I didn’t really sign up to get “meaning of life” advice from Tim Ferriss, kickboxing “expert” and meditation extraordinaire; but I suppose if you’re willing to take and leave parts of this book (which I clearly am), it’s not a bad thing to be reminded that you are more than the job you do. This book has no balance whatsoever, but whatever. I laughed a lot while listening and putting together my patio furniture. And maybe I will try to check email fewer times during the day."
101,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41350064-juli-hoffman,5,"This book does NOT teach you how to be a millionaire. If you're looking for THAT book, keep walking. This book DOES teach that wealth isn't all about money, it's about creating time to do the things you love. There's an example of a fisherman in this book. He doesn't have much in the way of material things, but every day he gets to hang out with his friends and family. He fishes a little. He takes an afternoon nap with his wife. He plays in a band in the evening. He's living like he's retired while he's young enough to enjoy it. This man is NOT a millionaire, but he's rich in the things that matter. This is the ""New Rich."" They are everyday people who are getting out of their comfort zones in order to enjoy life NOW, rather than waiting until the end of their days.I took away a lot of good ideas from this book and it did give me the courage to try some new things in my own career. A few years ago, My husband and I took a step back from the workoholic path. We don't make as much money as before, but our quality of life is much better. For years I've been playing around with some ideas to bring a little passive income into our household. This book gave me the courage to pursue this goal. Will I succeed? I have no idea! I do know that I'd rather live for experiences, time with the people I love, rather than killing myself trying to earn enough money to buy more things.Thanks, Tm Ferriss, for sharing your journey!"
102,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42182887-sipho,3,"This contemporary classic is a manifesto for lifestyle design. The thesis is simple: you can live like a millionaire, without actually being one. The 4 Hour Work Weeks touches on a variety of topics including automation, offshoring, delegation, minimalism and productivity. Key Takeaways  Definitions The New Rich have a different mindset to the typical employee or business owner. The New Rich: - have others work for them - distribute recovery periods and adventures (mini-retirements) throughout life - recognize that inactivity is not the goal and instead prioritise doing what excites them - focus on establishing a steady cash flow first, and then a big payday later.Everything popular is wrongRetirement is worst-case scenario insurance. Interest and energy are cyclical - alternate between work and rest. Doing less is not being lazy. The New Rich measure their contribution in results, not time. Laziness isn’t working less; laziness is letting circumstances define your life for you. The timing is never right. Whatever you want to do someday, just do it now. Ask for forgiveness, not permission. Emphasize your strengths, don’t fix weaknesses - this often provides a multiplier effect, while trying to fix weaknesses typically leads to only incremental improvement.Money alone is not the solution but relative income is more important than absolute income. Relative income measures both time and money. A person working 10 hours a week and making $10,000 is richer than someone working 80 hours a week and making $100,000. Embrace good stress instead of avoiding stress altogether.Most people are convinced they can only accomplish mediocre things. There is therefore more competition for mediocre goals. Elimination 80% of results come from 20% of actions. Ask yourself the following questions what 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness and what 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness?Be difficult when it matters - eg when it comes to protecting your productivity. Automation Build up a solid weekly income, independent of your day job:Step 1: Pick a reachable niche market. Find a market by defining your customers, and then designing your product around them. Preferably you must be a member of said market. Step 2: Brainstorm products whose benefit can be explained in one sentence or phrase. - The product should be expensive enough to sell fewer units, create higher profit margins, and attract lower-maintenance customers – but not so expensive that customers want to speak with you before buying. - The product should take less than 4 weeks to manufacture - The product should be fully explainable in an online FAQ. The easiest type of product to create is an information product – low-cost, fast to manufacture, and time-consuming for competitors to duplicate. If you read the top three books on a given subject, you’ll know more about the subject than 80% of the relevant population, thereby qualifying you as an expert. The person with the highest credibility will sell the most, not the person who knows the most about the subject. To establish credibility:1) Join 2 or 3 trade associations with official-sounding names.2) Read the 3 top-selling books on the topic and write a one-page summary of each.3) Go to the closest university, put up posters advertising a free seminar on the subject, and give the seminar using the summaries you’ve written.4) Call up a local branch of a well-known company and tell them you’ve done the seminars at the university and that you’re a member of the trade associations. Explain that you’re trying to gain speaking experience outside of the academic setting.5) Leverage your trade association membership and speaking experience to get an article published for a trade magazine. The only way to test if anyone actually wants your product is to ask people to buy it. Create a basic one-to-three-page website, put up a Google AdWords advertisement and use the response to test whether people will buy.  Liberation A 5 step process for getting your employer to let you work from home permanently:1. Increase investment - get your employer to first invest in you to increase their cost if you leave. For example, ask if the firm has any additional trainings available to employees and take them.2. Prove increased output offsite - call off sick for two days in the middle of the week, double your work output on both days, and make sure to demonstrate and record it with an email trail. 3. Show the business benefit - position remote working as a business benefit, not a personal perk. Bill more client time, complete more projects, or otherwise demonstrate quantified improvement. Explain the increased productivity as less time commuting and fewer distractions. 4. Propose a trial period - Informally mention to your boss how you were sick those two days and didn’t expect to get anything done, but were actually twice as productive. Ask if you could try working from home for 2 days in the next two weeks. When your boss objects, acknowledge his concerns and propose working from home only one day a week instead. 5. Expand remote time - Continue to excel on your work-from-home days and drop your in-office performance to heighten the contrast. Ask for another trial period with an extra two days at home. After your boss has gotten used to this, ask for a full-time remote trial of 2 weeks. Conclusion There are as many gems in this book as there is questionable advice. I am not too sure about Ferris' idea to essentially automate your life through offshoring daily tasks. This seems to be going too far. I was also particularly irritated by the fact that he highlights ""most countries in Africa"" as not ideal locations to travel to and work from because of the risk of kidnapping and terrorism. Seriously? Those 2 sentences near the end of the book pretty much ruined the rest of it for me, and thus 3 stars.That said, the chapters on Income Automation and productivity are well worth reading as these are the most practical I think I have read in any work. Other than that...meh."
103,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65849150-kelsey,3,"The extended edition is recommended as it updates many of the author's early ideas with more recently relevant tools and tips (original text released in 2009). Be warned, the audiobook is fine overall, but because lots of chapters list resources and websites parenthetically in the middle of a sentence or idea, you'll often find yourself repeatedly being read the ""www dot so-and-so dot com forward-slash home forward-slash news forward-slash whatever dot html"". Also, keep in mind that some of the tools the author mentions, while useful, may have been made obsolete when compared to some other things we have that we didn't commonly use in 2009 (like cloud computing versus working locally) or more efficient products have perhaps been released. Overall, good ideas and a recommended read for anyone who runs their own side hustle or fledgling business.As someone who does virtual assisting, I was disappointed about how much Ferriss underscored the perks of having a VA from India or another far off land. While differences of time zone (you can send off tasks at the end of the day and wake to find them completed) and spend (you often pay less than US standard wages for the same work) may be beneficial to an entrepreneur, I think this sort of thinking is dangerous to tout as THE way to succeed while delegating work. VAs come in all shapes, sizes, and skillsets, and opting to only hire non-domestic VAs with cost as a primary driver undermines the quality work that can be done by anyone ANYWHERE. If they're remote, why do they need to be in India? From Ferriss' telling, it seems cost is the only thing that really drives that desire, and I find that disappointing. It's like telling an artist you can buy the same thing at Walmart for $15...it undermines the craft and good work that anyone can do and comes off as a bit tone deaf and opportunistic in a world where Americans know that off-shore labor is often cheaper because it doesn't actually meet the needs of the worker being paid low wages. I'm not saying foreign VAs don't deserve pay and opportunity; I'm saying those looking for assistants should consider how best to support the HUMAN who needs the job.So, that being said, if you'd like to hire a virtual assistant, consider ALL virtual assistants, not just the ones you can pay next to nothing to do all your bitch work while you sleep. /endrant"
104,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5820202-koen-van-den-eeckhout,2,"Positive points: I strongly agree with some of the principles in this book, especially the Pareto principle and Parkinson's law, which can make your approach much more efficient.Neutral points: Ferriss uses a writing style balancing between motivational and arrogant, often crossing the line towards the latter. Nevertheless, it kinda fits the 'fuck it' theme of the book and easy to get used to. The book reads very quickly.Negative points: besides feeling outdated already (Blackberry? Yahoo shops?), Ferriss often crosses the line towards the downright unethical. Several pages on how to be widely regarded as an expert without being one, or marketing techniques which are pretty much illegal (e.g. selling items on eBay without having them)."
105,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602450-vladyslav-sitalo,3,"The style of the book is somewhat annoying but if you overcome this annoyance this book has something to share with you.--It's a fun fact that I've decided to read this book around the same time as Elon Musk's biography.And as both of the books is fresh in my mind, I can see two drastically different approaches to life from Elon and Tim.Tim is asking reader to dream big set impossible goals and than talks about buying a car or going to some nice place to live.From my perspective ""big"" is what Musk is doing - to transform car and space industries is big, to give humanity ability to travel to Mars is big, to minimize risks from superintelligent AI is big.Buying a Ferrari eh, it's kind of mediocre.I'm not saying that goal to buy Ferrari or live in constant travel or enjoying yourself in any other way is not a worthy goal, just saying that, well, it's not ""big"".It's happens to be true that my sentiments and goals is much more aligned with the Musk's vision. So this fact immediately questions the applicability of suggested techniques as THE way to achieve your goals if they are really big. (What would you set you month input goal if your actual goal is to go to the other planet (really really expensive) or achieve personal immortality (not technologically feasible right now, but it's plausible that it can be achievable in the nearest 50 years. And you can actually work on advancing scientific research/industry/public appreciation to make it feasible sooner then later)? )And so getting back to the comparison between Musk and Ferriss lifestyle - you can see big difference in them - you can probably characterize them as ""4 hour workweek"" vs ""4 hours to sleep"" or by goals ""go to Mars"" vs ""sip wine and play guitar with my amigos"".Do you have to adopt the work style similar to Musk's to achieve really big things? Well, I don't know, but Musk is succeeding and it is sensible to take him as an example at least to some extent.That said, I would admit that the lifestyle, proposed in the book is by all means more interesting and richer on life experience than your average one. Though, important thing to notice is that, unfortunately, this kind of lifestyle is not sustainable for majority of the population (you can tell this by simply looking how much people is employed as VA/outsources/etc for sustaining it for one person). Also despite described drawbacks this book contains a lot of great advice. For example - call to eliminate waste work and focus on the most efficient approaches is obviously applicable almost to everyone and everywhere (and the book provides you with recomendations and options on how to actually do that).I was always for elimination of unnecessary stuff/work/interruption. But Tim here is also talking about an information limitation. And I have to admit that I'm and informational addict in a way :). I don't read news, newspapers/magazines, I don't watch TV.But I totally into reading books, listening audiobooks/podcasts and reading interesting articles on the web. The book convinced me to limit time for email/social networks to two limited periods during the day. And i think it's a great practice. I've also become more picky regarding articles that I read.But, that said, constant learning and self education is one of the values that I practice and want to excel in. And you can't learn new things without getting info about them :).More on positive side:Facing your fears as a way to make a better decisions is really interesting technique.Tim is advocating lean approach to building business and it resonates with Lean Startup approach but applied to non-tech business which is interesting.He is questioning a lot of ""common sense"" assumptions and encouraging people to do this more often. I think that this approach can lead to better society in general.Also Tim briefly advocates ""choice-minimal"" lifestyle. Characteristic quote: ""Fast decisions preserve usable attention for what matters""I have this problem with choice anxiety - I just have to choose the best option, but I've been noticing and regarding this as a problem because I'm spending too much time focusing on minor decisions and I think there is better use for this time. The book do not address problem in depth but have a reference for ""The paradox of choice"" https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1... which I intend to read.Also I would recommend http://thewirecutter.com for people with similar problems as at least a partial solution that can eliminate/mitigate your choice anxiety for a lot of products.More on the downside besides the style:One thing that remained in my mind as bluntly stupid - house that just stays there, and guy is loosing money on it for some mysterious reason (it's not like it would take any amount of time to ask VA to rent it/find a good agency to work with).Tim is constantly overconfidently saying stuff about everything in the world. That's annoying, especially considering that what he is telling often is not entirely? True And he is almost never giving any quantifiable data to support his claims.Other thing Is confused thinking on some topics, for example thoughts on charity/service work.

It's one thing to have an author that constantly comes across as a douchebag, but when a book like this crosses moral and ethical boundaries that I don't want get involved in it says enough. Tips and tricks on how to trick your boss into thinking that you're putting in the agreed hours while actually outsourcing it all, really?It also feels a bit outdated, but that's hardly the books fault. There were a couple of more general productivity tips in here that are useful, but they are also present in books that specifically focus on that. Tip for my Dutch friends: just read Rick Pastoor's Grip for this section.I'm not going to tell other people that they shouldn't follow the ideas of Tim Ferriss, but I won't be joining his ""new rich"" movement."

What would excite you? Happiness? Excitement is the definition of happiness and boredom is the definition of unhappiness. Don’t work just for money for owning enviable things, follow your passion and do interesting things. Be unrealistic.“The future is here; It’s just not distributed yet”.-E is for elimination: Do first thing first, if you don’t have time you don’t have PRIORITIES. You have to define what you want to do with your time. Understand the Pareto principle “80 % of the outputs result from 20% of the inputs”. Be productive not just active, focus on what is important for you and neglect the tasks which do not take you closer to your goals, do not multitask, learn to propose don’t let others influence your decisions, cultivate selective ignorance “knowledge is power but knowledge without action are useless”, practice the art of nonfinishing and the art of refusal. Protect yourself from people who waste your time. “Reading, after a certain age, diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking.”-A is for automation: * HIRE AN ASSISTANT: Lingering unimportant tasks will disappear as soon as someone else is being paid to do them. Free your time to focus on bigger and better things. “Nobody can give you freedom. Nobody can give you equality or justice or anything. If you're a man, you take it.”*FIND THE MUSE: Find a market, define your customers then find or develop a product for them.*TEST THE MUSE: Micro-testing your products involves using inexpensive advertisements to test consumer response to a product prior to manufacturing.*MBA MANAGEMENT BY ABSENCE: Once you have a product that sells, it’s time to design a self-correcting business architecture that runs itself.“The power of hiding ourselves from one another is mercifully given, for men are wild beasts, and would devour one another but for this protection.”-L is for liberation: “It is far better for a man to go wrong in freedom than to go right in chains.”* ESCAPE THE OFFICE (Create an opportunity to demonstrate remote work productivity before asking for it as a policy. This is to test your ability to work outside of an office environment and rack up some proof that you can kick ass without constant supervision).*KILL YOUR JOB: Are you more likely to find what you want in your current job or somewhere else?*MINI-RETIREMENTS: EMBRACING THE MOBILE LIFESTYLE“Before the development of tourism, travel was conceived to be like study, and its fruits were considered to be the adornment of the mind and the formation of the judgment.”*FILLING THE VOID: Adding Life After Subtracting Work“To be engrossed by something outside ourselves is a powerful antidote for the rational mind, the mind that so frequently has its head up its own ass.”"
111,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16366211-ro,5,"What I like about this book is that it introduces a lot of new concepts for me - for a better (work) life, while also challenges my existing concepts on (work) life.I am particularly intrigued by the New Rich concept that defines “riches” not in having millions or billions, but more on the use of one’s time / having time freedom. “Those who abandon the deferred-life plan and create luxury lifestyles in the present using the currency of the New Rich: time and mobility.”While it would help to have millions and billions, often we are trapped in this rut of wanting more and pushing off “living in the moment” until we believe we have enough. And you guessed it, that day of having enough, never comes (unless you have a mindset shift). The most mind blowing thing is that the author shows how everyday ordinary people can & do have the means to live luxuriously but are held back by their limiting beliefs that they need to have more, work harder and join the millions and billions club.The author introduces several business models, tips tricks and tools that you can use to “eliminate” and “automate” your work - to free up your time; something you can immediately apply into your (work) life if you wish. 	i.e. 80/20 Pareto’s law According to the 80/20 rule: 80% of results are from 20% of action80% of outputs are from 20% of inputs80% of consequences are from 20% of the causes 80% of profits are from 20% of products and customers A practical use of the 80/20 rule is to ask yourself: 1. Which 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness?2. Which 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness? The book further highlights on our insistent need to “be productive"", which only leads us to fill our time with xx just to “feel productive”. If we reassess our daily to-do list and eliminate all the unnecessary time fillers, we can free up our time to do productive fulfilling things - things we truly enjoy.For example, the “mini retirement” concept talks about how instead of saving up our entire life’s savings to spend when we retire, why not use that money throughout your life and have what the author calls “mini retirements”. This way, you can truly enjoy life while you are young and in your prime, rather than wait until the time is right, which again may never happen. This definitely challenges my personal limiting belief - as I am one of those people who likes to wait until it’s the right time. The book ends by touching on some psychology and self help (my favorite topic) - that even after achieving the “4 hour work week” and have all the time in the world to do what you truly enjoy. Don’t expect all life challenges to just disappear. It is not easy to just ""wind down and enjoy”. Hence why being rich and depressed, successful and depressed are all too familiar. “Man is so made that he can only find relaxation from one kind of labor by taking up another” - Anatole FranceYou cannot just transition overnight from being a goal oriented high-performer to appreciating life in the moment. Although it is not impossible to do both, unraveling such habits take time - just like anything else in life; “leaning to replace the perception of time famine with the appreciation for time abundance is like going from triple espresso to decaf”.Recognizing this is the first step.Appreciating time abundance and living in the present doesn’t mean we should just sit on our butts and do nothing either. According to some of the most fulfilled people interviewed for the book’s case studies: 1. continual learning2. serviceare two commons factors for a fulfilled life. And I absolutely agree, I find my life the most meaningful when I’m continuously learning and can be of service to the world. I like that this book falls not only into the genre of business and entrepreneurship but also philosophy, psychology and self-help - which I think are intricately linked. In order to be well-informed, you need to be able to evaluate things from different perspective.Most of what is said in this book is no new news. I believe most of us are already familiar with the idea that we should enjoy life and live life in the moment but through seeing it from the author’s lens, the author’s way of getting things across that help sharpens my vague understanding of things - and honed down the messages for me even more. Definitely a good read on my list!Edit: I’m surprised this book receives a lot of negative reviews - mostly from people questioning Ferriss’s ego, and his “unethical” ways of doing businesses such as outsourcing help from virtual assistants in third world countries, who charge less.I did feel put off reading it because I had read these negative reviews prior to starting, but I’m glad I gave it a go anyway because I still learned a lot from the book and did not share the same negative sentiments towards Ferriss.I didn’t see this book as a guide on how to get rich quick etc, but rather more like an introduction to a lifestyle different from the accepted norm and more like a motivational tool / insights into Ferriss and others’ success stories. And not to defend Ferriss (although that is probably exactly what I am doing) - there is no need to be holier-than-thou. I don’t think the author is recommending us to take advantage of cheaper labour in poorer countries but rather how money can go further there, hence why they charge less.I am not sure if it’s fair to compare hiring virtual assistants in third world countries who charge less - to slave labors or garment workers for example. Yes, the rate is lower than developed countries but the overall expenses are lower too.Plus it's a question about the whole system we are inMoral contradiction / ethical dilemma There is a section in the book that addresses exactly this: Service for the right reasons: to save the whales or kill them and feed the children?“Service to me is simple: doing something that improves life besides your own.This is not the same as philanthropy. Philanthropy is the altruistic concern for the well-being of mankind–human life. Human life and comfort have long been focused on to the exclusion of the environment and the rest of the food chain, hence our current race to imminent extinction. Serves us right. The world does not exist solely for the betterment and multiplication of mankind.Before I start chaining myself to trees and saving the dart frogs, though, I should take my own advice: do not become a cause snob.How can you help starving children in Africa when there are starving children in Los Angeles? How can you save the whales when homeless people are freezing to death? How does doing volunteer research on coral destruction help those people who need help now?”Children, please. Everything out there needs help, so don’t get baited into “my cause can beat up your cause” arguments with no right answer. There are no qualitative or quantitative comparisons that make sense. The truth is this: those thousands of lives you save could contribute to a famine that kills millions, or that one bush in Bolivia that you protect could hold the cure for cancer. The downstream effects are unknown. Do your best and hope for the best. If you’re improving the world–however you define that–consider your job well done.Service isn’t limited to saving lives or the environment. It can also improve life. If you are a musician and put a smile on the faces of thousands or millions, I view that as service. If you are a mentor and change the life of one child for the better, the world has been improved. Improving the quality of life in the world is in no fashion inferior to adding more lives.”Service is an attitude.”"
112,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39587412-enrique-ma-as,5,"The first word that comes into my mind to tag this book is: inspiring.But let's elaborate. Timothy Ferriss comes from a different background: after selling his first company for a bunch of billions, we jump into a digital nomad lifestyle. He considers that his decisions are extendable to the middle-class and the people working 9-17, and addressing this he fails miserably. Is two different rivers with different water. But there is however a lot of important information and philosophies we can extract from this book.Timothy dedicates an important part of his book to talk about Virtual Assistants and popular places to hire them. This is a useful information to start with, but most of the rules we later on talks about are about common sense (do provide them with clear orders, leave everything written, give them freedom to expend money until certain amount...). Many of the websites and ideas about reselling are useful and not that well known.The book in general challenges you to move out from your comfort zone and take risks, which is by itself a vary valuable reason. ""The 4-hour workweek"" title is misleading, since as Tim himself recognizes is not about the money you have earned, but about the freedom you now have and the mobility worldwide. If I would be a boss with responsibility over other people, I would be worried if many of them were reading it. I actually quit my job before finishing it.As a side note: Tim writing's style is very selfish and self-centered. But that does not mean a star less for me"
113,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/747419-jason,3,"So far, not yet having finished this book, it seems like he created it for those who are: 1. in the sales of PRODUCTS industry, and 2. of those people, for those who are in a management/ownership position. For those who are in a service-oriented industry, his tactics do not seem to apply. Some of his tips do have merit however, such as keeping distractions to a minimum by only checking email and phone messages sparingly and delegating smaller tasks not absolutely necessary to other people to better utilize ones time on priorities. We will see if there is more to his book after I'm finished though before I give my final rating.After reading it, I think that I'm still in the same mindset as before. It was written seemingly for those who do not like their job. For those of us who were lucky enough to choose a profession that we actually enjoy, this is probably not the quintessential book of choice. It is packed with situations that are 99% ""not going to happen,"" such as the ""ask your boss if you can just work from home"" scenario. If I were to even try to ask my boss about that, he would just say ""I don't think so"" before 10 words were out of my mouth. The latter half of the book DID make me want to travel more, but the very end just seemed a bit preachy. All in all, I could see how this could possibly be inspiring to some, but not to most."

I needed to be reminded of that.....Why I wanted to give it 5 stars - because I am re-entering the workforce after many years and I got caught up in the hype ""I know everything you need to be successful! This is wonderful! And this is wonderful! And you will not be fulfilled if you don't do all of these wonderful things!!"" But then I realized I am the fisherman in Ferriss's book. I have a very strong sense of community and family and I don't need to outsource my whole life to love my life. Do I want to go to the Azore Islands and reconnect with family and do family history? I do. And thanks to this book I will make it a goal. However, I will not cut corners, look for loopholes or be unethical to do so. Enter the 2 stars. Nor do I need to travel the world to live a fulfilling life. I have everything I need right here. The love of my life, a church community, a roof over my head, the sun that shines 300 days a year, dear friends, loving family, a career that reimburses me for good work, and a hobby that brings me joy.

It is not complete, definitive or anything like it.There are better books about all the finer points:— stoicism— minimalism— productivity— marketing— traveling the world.BUT.This one puts it all together. This book is what made me dare to defy what was conventional and expected.To dream about finding a job with purpose, and living life on my terms. It is a game-changer - and still has the potential to be.It is not a definitive guide of any sort. But it is an invitation to explore. An invitation to think about what are your values (is it travel? is it to spend time with your family? work with something you love?) and rehearse worst-case scenarios.And, most importantly: to dream and try and live the ""best-case"" scenarios.For me, the truth is this: this book changes lives. And that is why it is still a 5/5.P.S.: It is just appropriate to be writing these lines on a cold morning in Bratislava.

It feels like a spiritual relative of Sebastian Marshall's Ikigai --- reading this book will have you spending a lot of time pondering ""hmm, what kind of life do I really want to live?"" The answer for most people I've talked to is ""not like this,"" but the fear gets in the way.This is a good book about getting over the fear. It's got helpful little exercises for comfort zone expansion, tactics for dealing with bureaucrats, strategies for building prestige, and lots more. And a lot of prompts for trying to figure out what you'd rather be doing, and for figuring out how to get there from here.The gist of all of it is that people don't really want to be millionaires, they want to have what they assume is the millionaire lifestyle. So computer how much money per day you'd actually need in order to live how you'd like, and then work towards that number. Waiting to live until you're too old to appreciate it is a crap strategy."

Some parts (especially the last third) were really interesting to me, but other parts definitely weren't.It think it's one of those kind of books that you shouldn't read every sentence from, but jump from chapter to chapter based on what is interesting to you. I don't know if I have OCD or what, but I'm definitely incapable of doing that, I need to read every last bit, which is probably why it took me so long to finish it and I found some parts difficult to read.That being said, I totally understand how it can change life, and maybe it's going to help me get the push and the motivation to look for another way to earn income and travel around the world!

I like being efficient, so I especially enjoyed his chapter on Automation, and I can easily see how to apply it to my own business.Tim Ferris will teach you how to work remotely, how to cut 50% of your work load, and how to live your life to the fullest. He provides solid resources for each chapter, and his ideas are all workable. I think some of his methods are a bit sketchy though. I'm not the kind of person to 'scam a system'.

Most of the 'mobility' tips do not apply in my case, since I happen to live AND earn in one of those 'ridiculously cheap' countries.There was no little escaping from this book. Since I have a work/ organisation/ near burnout crisis each year in June (comes with the territory), I tend to google for tips and motivation, and The 4-Hour Work Week reached me in small, irritating snippets. 1. The principles seemed tempting, but unenforceable in my profession, as evidenced by numerous comments on the irrelevance of the Pareto Principle in education. You just have to put in the hours, even if you do that by Skype; most of the valid exams need to take place in teacher's presence; you can't tell 80% of your students to just get lost; on most levels of education, 'automation' such as peer assessment simply doesn't work (on others, it can be used, but will not replace teacher's assessment). The ugly: some issues just can't be dealt with ""intensively"" - as evidenced by joking, but telling questions on the author's on the release date of The 4-hour Baby.The good: Ferriss' elimination tips are quite inspiring even to non entrepreneurs. They're good reminders to not increase one's workload automatically and unreflexively, as teachers often do. In the words of Anne Taintor:http://s30.postimg.org/f5qt0jw5t/magn...I decided to implement some of the ideas I previously had that would make students more responsible for their learning and material preparation (with me interfering and supplementing whatever information they might have left out, that is). I also thought I might revise class rules as a set of basic rules + Frequently Asked Questions in an attempt to make them more independent. 2. Something about the approach to work this books represents seems, frankly speaking, immoral to me, and not just me. This piece by Penelope Trunk is a classic by now: http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2009/01...This piece by Jennifer Dziura https://medium.com/get-bullish/a5e5f4... is much more recent and contains a sentence that says it all:If you seem to be “getting everything you want,” you should probably examine whether you’re getting it at someone’s expense, or whether you’re just constantly, in small ways, making the world worse.3. When I was a kid, I read and anthology of science fiction stories, including a story (I can't recall the title) about a society of the future in which people removed the obstacle of the decision making process (the decisions in it are taken instantly, which results in living an equivalent of an action-packed lifetime in just one night. Tim Ferriss reminds me of the protagonist, as his aim seems to be to live as many lives as possible in one lifetime. Somewhat unsurprisingly, I remember his blog post about his panic attacks (which I can't locate now), which somehow makes sense. To be fair, he also urges the reader to slow down and savour life, but somehow hmm.The (completely unexpected) good:- 'It is vain to do with more what can be done with less."" - William of Ockham; not a a bad motto to work by.- I was surprised by his stress on do-gooding, volunteering and making donations.- Dreamlining - I was surprised by how much my dreams are time-dependent instead of money-dependent.Now, I think, time to read this, for balance: In Praise of Slowness: Challenging the Cult of Speed"

""If only I had an idea for a business...""Mr. Ferriss not only provides philosophical and psychological reasons for getting your employer to let you work at home, but he talks about how to set up your own business that requires minimal interaction and will be able to support you as you live in different countries.I had only two problems with this book:1) While Mr. Ferriss rightly disparages working your ass off so you can enjoy your retirement (referring to it as ""deferred life""), he does seem to make the assumption that you'll be able to alternate work and ""mini-retirements"" forever. Frankly, I'm guessing that when I'm 75, I'm not going to be terribly effective at working at all. I'm disappointed by his lack of consideration for care during my waning years. Maybe he's a proponent of ice floes?2) Tim Ferriss's biggest fan is Tim Ferriss. It was a bit unseemly how often he talked about how great he was. I understand that he's trying to convince us that if he could do it, we could too, but I'm tired of hearing about how he won a tango competition, dined at 5-star restaurants, or practices martial arts. If his personality in real life is anything like he comes across in the book, I suspect that I wouldn't get a word in edgewise if we were hanging out.Ok, bonus problem: He uses the term ""muse"" to refer to ""an automated vehicle for generating cash without consuming time"". Every time he uses it, it's jarring, because I know what the term actually means.Anyway, those faults aside, this book contained tons of great information for entrepreneurs and people who are looking to cut loose from the daily grind. Lots of great information here. Highly recommended for anyone who has ever had dreams of doing something different with their work life."

Recently, however, a friend pointed out to me that an author I liked had been on Ferris' podcast. I listened and enjoyed the conversation they had. I continued listening to subsequent episodes, and decided that in spite of my irrational prejudice, I was starting to like him more and more. This book is a bit dated now, and does in places come off as brash and irritating, yet it's quite positive and an open challenge to live life on one's own terms. As a result it's inspirational, and it gives some insight into how differently people can think about risks and resources. In certain ways I wish I'd read it earlier, as it would likely have saved me a few years spent obeying societal dictates in a career to which I was not particularly suited. But I think without the good impression left by the compassionate and sometimes fascinating interviews Ferris does on his podcast, I might have been less receptive to the book's tone."
128,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18908489-alexander-svanevik,4,"Hard to rate.No doubt, this book has had a huge impact on many people's lives. I personally know people who have basically changed their entire lifestyle after reading Tim Ferriss' book.I read it in Spanish, so I won't comment on the language.Stating the obvious, the title doesn't really deliver on its promise. However, that doesn't mean there isn't plenty of practical advice on how to question (and perhaps improve) your own lifestyle.The hardest part for me to swallow is the total inconsideration of other people that Ferriss has. Waste other people's time so you can save yours? Go for it. The world simply wouldn't work if everyone acted according to Ferriss' advise.The strongest parts of the book are 1) the focus on essentialism, and 2) the questions the author asks you to ask yourself, and the exercises he recommends.All in all, this is a modern classic packed with practical advise which is worth the read. But please take the advise with a pinch of salt."
129,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14858185-steven,2,"For the most part, this book is fake. There are a few decent delegation and time saving tips, but you don't succeed by working 4 hours a week or 40 but 60-80 hours a week. Otherwise, you just get left behind by those who do."
130,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/557179-jocelyn-bailey,3,"My bizarre love affair with business and self-help books continues! The first time I saw this book, it lay on the desk of a ridiculous person who somehow clearly hated working but also made his life much, much harder by attempting to do everyone else’s jobs in addition to his own. Maybe he really did need this book. But as far as I know, he continued to micromanage everyone despite this book’s best takeaway being the “art” of delegation. I decided to download the audio of this book after listening to the BY THE BOOK episodes about it. I’ve had a rough time staying on top of my work lately and hoped maybe I could get a helpful word or two about getting things done. Boy did I get a word. 4-HOUR WW is equal parts ridiculous, genius, and unintentionally entertaining. The audiobook reader’s voice stressed me out beyond belief, but I loved it. Useful aspects of this book include the discussion of Parkinson’s Law (absolutely true), the 80/20 rule, the time-suckage of email, and generally useful points about the kinds of customers that aren’t worth having. There is some wisdom here. But ultimately, most working people—whether small business owners or corporate employees like me—cannot take most of these steps and wouldn’t have the means to do so anyway. That many people take actual satisfaction in their work and that many employers view their employees as more than human drones are truths completely glossed over. And it should go without saying that if everyone approached their work life this way, then capitalism would fail faster than a speeding bullet. Wait a minute...Is capitalism a Ponzi scheme?This book also got weirdly existential in the end, but I’ll leave that one mostly alone. I didn’t really sign up to get “meaning of life” advice from Tim Ferriss, kickboxing “expert” and meditation extraordinaire; but I suppose if you’re willing to take and leave parts of this book (which I clearly am), it’s not a bad thing to be reminded that you are more than the job you do. This book has no balance whatsoever, but whatever. I laughed a lot while listening and putting together my patio furniture. And maybe I will try to check email fewer times during the day."
131,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41350064-juli-hoffman,5,"This book does NOT teach you how to be a millionaire. If you're looking for THAT book, keep walking. This book DOES teach that wealth isn't all about money, it's about creating time to do the things you love. There's an example of a fisherman in this book. He doesn't have much in the way of material things, but every day he gets to hang out with his friends and family. He fishes a little. He takes an afternoon nap with his wife. He plays in a band in the evening. He's living like he's retired while he's young enough to enjoy it. This man is NOT a millionaire, but he's rich in the things that matter. This is the ""New Rich."" They are everyday people who are getting out of their comfort zones in order to enjoy life NOW, rather than waiting until the end of their days.I took away a lot of good ideas from this book and it did give me the courage to try some new things in my own career. A few years ago, My husband and I took a step back from the workoholic path. We don't make as much money as before, but our quality of life is much better. For years I've been playing around with some ideas to bring a little passive income into our household. This book gave me the courage to pursue this goal. Will I succeed? I have no idea! I do know that I'd rather live for experiences, time with the people I love, rather than killing myself trying to earn enough money to buy more things.Thanks, Tm Ferriss, for sharing your journey!"
132,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42182887-sipho,3,"This contemporary classic is a manifesto for lifestyle design. The thesis is simple: you can live like a millionaire, without actually being one. The 4 Hour Work Weeks touches on a variety of topics including automation, offshoring, delegation, minimalism and productivity. Key Takeaways  Definitions The New Rich have a different mindset to the typical employee or business owner. The New Rich: - have others work for them - distribute recovery periods and adventures (mini-retirements) throughout life - recognize that inactivity is not the goal and instead prioritise doing what excites them - focus on establishing a steady cash flow first, and then a big payday later.Everything popular is wrongRetirement is worst-case scenario insurance. Interest and energy are cyclical - alternate between work and rest. Doing less is not being lazy. The New Rich measure their contribution in results, not time. Laziness isn’t working less; laziness is letting circumstances define your life for you. The timing is never right. Whatever you want to do someday, just do it now. Ask for forgiveness, not permission. Emphasize your strengths, don’t fix weaknesses - this often provides a multiplier effect, while trying to fix weaknesses typically leads to only incremental improvement.Money alone is not the solution but relative income is more important than absolute income. Relative income measures both time and money. A person working 10 hours a week and making $10,000 is richer than someone working 80 hours a week and making $100,000. Embrace good stress instead of avoiding stress altogether.Most people are convinced they can only accomplish mediocre things. There is therefore more competition for mediocre goals. Elimination 80% of results come from 20% of actions. Ask yourself the following questions what 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness and what 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness?Be difficult when it matters - eg when it comes to protecting your productivity. Automation Build up a solid weekly income, independent of your day job:Step 1: Pick a reachable niche market. Find a market by defining your customers, and then designing your product around them. Preferably you must be a member of said market. Step 2: Brainstorm products whose benefit can be explained in one sentence or phrase. - The product should be expensive enough to sell fewer units, create higher profit margins, and attract lower-maintenance customers – but not so expensive that customers want to speak with you before buying. - The product should take less than 4 weeks to manufacture - The product should be fully explainable in an online FAQ. The easiest type of product to create is an information product – low-cost, fast to manufacture, and time-consuming for competitors to duplicate. If you read the top three books on a given subject, you’ll know more about the subject than 80% of the relevant population, thereby qualifying you as an expert. The person with the highest credibility will sell the most, not the person who knows the most about the subject. To establish credibility:1) Join 2 or 3 trade associations with official-sounding names.2) Read the 3 top-selling books on the topic and write a one-page summary of each.3) Go to the closest university, put up posters advertising a free seminar on the subject, and give the seminar using the summaries you’ve written.4) Call up a local branch of a well-known company and tell them you’ve done the seminars at the university and that you’re a member of the trade associations. Explain that you’re trying to gain speaking experience outside of the academic setting.5) Leverage your trade association membership and speaking experience to get an article published for a trade magazine. The only way to test if anyone actually wants your product is to ask people to buy it. Create a basic one-to-three-page website, put up a Google AdWords advertisement and use the response to test whether people will buy.  Liberation A 5 step process for getting your employer to let you work from home permanently:1. Increase investment - get your employer to first invest in you to increase their cost if you leave. For example, ask if the firm has any additional trainings available to employees and take them.2. Prove increased output offsite - call off sick for two days in the middle of the week, double your work output on both days, and make sure to demonstrate and record it with an email trail. 3. Show the business benefit - position remote working as a business benefit, not a personal perk. Bill more client time, complete more projects, or otherwise demonstrate quantified improvement. Explain the increased productivity as less time commuting and fewer distractions. 4. Propose a trial period - Informally mention to your boss how you were sick those two days and didn’t expect to get anything done, but were actually twice as productive. Ask if you could try working from home for 2 days in the next two weeks. When your boss objects, acknowledge his concerns and propose working from home only one day a week instead. 5. Expand remote time - Continue to excel on your work-from-home days and drop your in-office performance to heighten the contrast. Ask for another trial period with an extra two days at home. After your boss has gotten used to this, ask for a full-time remote trial of 2 weeks. Conclusion There are as many gems in this book as there is questionable advice. I am not too sure about Ferris' idea to essentially automate your life through offshoring daily tasks. This seems to be going too far. I was also particularly irritated by the fact that he highlights ""most countries in Africa"" as not ideal locations to travel to and work from because of the risk of kidnapping and terrorism. Seriously? Those 2 sentences near the end of the book pretty much ruined the rest of it for me, and thus 3 stars.That said, the chapters on Income Automation and productivity are well worth reading as these are the most practical I think I have read in any work. Other than that...meh."
133,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65849150-kelsey,3,"The extended edition is recommended as it updates many of the author's early ideas with more recently relevant tools and tips (original text released in 2009). Be warned, the audiobook is fine overall, but because lots of chapters list resources and websites parenthetically in the middle of a sentence or idea, you'll often find yourself repeatedly being read the ""www dot so-and-so dot com forward-slash home forward-slash news forward-slash whatever dot html"". Also, keep in mind that some of the tools the author mentions, while useful, may have been made obsolete when compared to some other things we have that we didn't commonly use in 2009 (like cloud computing versus working locally) or more efficient products have perhaps been released. Overall, good ideas and a recommended read for anyone who runs their own side hustle or fledgling business.As someone who does virtual assisting, I was disappointed about how much Ferriss underscored the perks of having a VA from India or another far off land. While differences of time zone (you can send off tasks at the end of the day and wake to find them completed) and spend (you often pay less than US standard wages for the same work) may be beneficial to an entrepreneur, I think this sort of thinking is dangerous to tout as THE way to succeed while delegating work. VAs come in all shapes, sizes, and skillsets, and opting to only hire non-domestic VAs with cost as a primary driver undermines the quality work that can be done by anyone ANYWHERE. If they're remote, why do they need to be in India? From Ferriss' telling, it seems cost is the only thing that really drives that desire, and I find that disappointing. It's like telling an artist you can buy the same thing at Walmart for $15...it undermines the craft and good work that anyone can do and comes off as a bit tone deaf and opportunistic in a world where Americans know that off-shore labor is often cheaper because it doesn't actually meet the needs of the worker being paid low wages. I'm not saying foreign VAs don't deserve pay and opportunity; I'm saying those looking for assistants should consider how best to support the HUMAN who needs the job.So, that being said, if you'd like to hire a virtual assistant, consider ALL virtual assistants, not just the ones you can pay next to nothing to do all your bitch work while you sleep. /endrant"
134,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5820202-koen-van-den-eeckhout,2,"Positive points: I strongly agree with some of the principles in this book, especially the Pareto principle and Parkinson's law, which can make your approach much more efficient.Neutral points: Ferriss uses a writing style balancing between motivational and arrogant, often crossing the line towards the latter. Nevertheless, it kinda fits the 'fuck it' theme of the book and easy to get used to. The book reads very quickly.Negative points: besides feeling outdated already (Blackberry? Yahoo shops?), Ferriss often crosses the line towards the downright unethical. Several pages on how to be widely regarded as an expert without being one, or marketing techniques which are pretty much illegal (e.g. selling items on eBay without having them)."
135,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602450-vladyslav-sitalo,3,"The style of the book is somewhat annoying but if you overcome this annoyance this book has something to share with you.--It's a fun fact that I've decided to read this book around the same time as Elon Musk's biography.And as both of the books is fresh in my mind, I can see two drastically different approaches to life from Elon and Tim.Tim is asking reader to dream big set impossible goals and than talks about buying a car or going to some nice place to live.From my perspective ""big"" is what Musk is doing - to transform car and space industries is big, to give humanity ability to travel to Mars is big, to minimize risks from superintelligent AI is big.Buying a Ferrari eh, it's kind of mediocre.I'm not saying that goal to buy Ferrari or live in constant travel or enjoying yourself in any other way is not a worthy goal, just saying that, well, it's not ""big"".It's happens to be true that my sentiments and goals is much more aligned with the Musk's vision. So this fact immediately questions the applicability of suggested techniques as THE way to achieve your goals if they are really big. (What would you set you month input goal if your actual goal is to go to the other planet (really really expensive) or achieve personal immortality (not technologically feasible right now, but it's plausible that it can be achievable in the nearest 50 years. And you can actually work on advancing scientific research/industry/public appreciation to make it feasible sooner then later)? )And so getting back to the comparison between Musk and Ferriss lifestyle - you can see big difference in them - you can probably characterize them as ""4 hour workweek"" vs ""4 hours to sleep"" or by goals ""go to Mars"" vs ""sip wine and play guitar with my amigos"".Do you have to adopt the work style similar to Musk's to achieve really big things? Well, I don't know, but Musk is succeeding and it is sensible to take him as an example at least to some extent.That said, I would admit that the lifestyle, proposed in the book is by all means more interesting and richer on life experience than your average one. Though, important thing to notice is that, unfortunately, this kind of lifestyle is not sustainable for majority of the population (you can tell this by simply looking how much people is employed as VA/outsources/etc for sustaining it for one person). Also despite described drawbacks this book contains a lot of great advice. For example - call to eliminate waste work and focus on the most efficient approaches is obviously applicable almost to everyone and everywhere (and the book provides you with recomendations and options on how to actually do that).I was always for elimination of unnecessary stuff/work/interruption. But Tim here is also talking about an information limitation. And I have to admit that I'm and informational addict in a way :). I don't read news, newspapers/magazines, I don't watch TV.But I totally into reading books, listening audiobooks/podcasts and reading interesting articles on the web. The book convinced me to limit time for email/social networks to two limited periods during the day. And i think it's a great practice. I've also become more picky regarding articles that I read.But, that said, constant learning and self education is one of the values that I practice and want to excel in. And you can't learn new things without getting info about them :).More on positive side:Facing your fears as a way to make a better decisions is really interesting technique.Tim is advocating lean approach to building business and it resonates with Lean Startup approach but applied to non-tech business which is interesting.He is questioning a lot of ""common sense"" assumptions and encouraging people to do this more often. I think that this approach can lead to better society in general.Also Tim briefly advocates ""choice-minimal"" lifestyle. Characteristic quote: ""Fast decisions preserve usable attention for what matters""I have this problem with choice anxiety - I just have to choose the best option, but I've been noticing and regarding this as a problem because I'm spending too much time focusing on minor decisions and I think there is better use for this time. The book do not address problem in depth but have a reference for ""The paradox of choice"" https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1... which I intend to read.Also I would recommend http://thewirecutter.com for people with similar problems as at least a partial solution that can eliminate/mitigate your choice anxiety for a lot of products.More on the downside besides the style:One thing that remained in my mind as bluntly stupid - house that just stays there, and guy is loosing money on it for some mysterious reason (it's not like it would take any amount of time to ask VA to rent it/find a good agency to work with).Tim is constantly overconfidently saying stuff about everything in the world. That's annoying, especially considering that what he is telling often is not entirely? True And he is almost never giving any quantifiable data to support his claims.Other thing Is confused thinking on some topics, for example thoughts on charity/service work. If you actually want to do some good (and not just feel good about yourself) look into https://80000hours.org/ project or http://www.givewell.org/."

It's one thing to have an author that constantly comes across as a douchebag, but when a book like this crosses moral and ethical boundaries that I don't want get involved in it says enough. Tips and tricks on how to trick your boss into thinking that you're putting in the agreed hours while actually outsourcing it all, really?It also feels a bit outdated, but that's hardly the books fault. There were a couple of more general productivity tips in here that are useful, but they are also present in books that specifically focus on that.

You have to define what you want to do with your time. Understand the Pareto principle “80 % of the outputs result from 20% of the inputs”.

141,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16366211-ro,5,"What I like about this book is that it introduces a lot of new concepts for me - for a better (work) life, while also challenges my existing concepts on (work) life.I am particularly intrigued by the New Rich concept that defines “riches” not in having millions or billions, but more on the use of one’s time / having time freedom. “Those who abandon the deferred-life plan and create luxury lifestyles in the present using the currency of the New Rich: time and mobility.”While it would help to have millions and billions, often we are trapped in this rut of wanting more and pushing off “living in the moment” until we believe we have enough. And you guessed it, that day of having enough, never comes (unless you have a mindset shift). The most mind blowing thing is that the author shows how everyday ordinary people can & do have the means to live luxuriously but are held back by their limiting beliefs that they need to have more, work harder and join the millions and billions club.The author introduces several business models, tips tricks and tools that you can use to “eliminate” and “automate” your work - to free up your time; something you can immediately apply into your (work) life if you wish. 	i.e. 80/20 Pareto’s law According to the 80/20 rule: 80% of results are from 20% of action80% of outputs are from 20% of inputs80% of consequences are from 20% of the causes 80% of profits are from 20% of products and customers A practical use of the 80/20 rule is to ask yourself: 1. Which 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness?2. Which 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness? The book further highlights on our insistent need to “be productive"", which only leads us to fill our time with xx just to “feel productive”. If we reassess our daily to-do list and eliminate all the unnecessary time fillers, we can free up our time to do productive fulfilling things - things we truly enjoy.For example, the “mini retirement” concept talks about how instead of saving up our entire life’s savings to spend when we retire, why not use that money throughout your life and have what the author calls “mini retirements”. This way, you can truly enjoy life while you are young and in your prime, rather than wait until the time is right, which again may never happen. This definitely challenges my personal limiting belief - as I am one of those people who likes to wait until it’s the right time. The book ends by touching on some psychology and self help (my favorite topic) - that even after achieving the “4 hour work week” and have all the time in the world to do what you truly enjoy. Don’t expect all life challenges to just disappear. It is not easy to just ""wind down and enjoy”. Hence why being rich and depressed, successful and depressed are all too familiar. “Man is so made that he can only find relaxation from one kind of labor by taking up another” - Anatole FranceYou cannot just transition overnight from being a goal oriented high-performer to appreciating life in the moment. Although it is not impossible to do both, unraveling such habits take time - just like anything else in life; “leaning to replace the perception of time famine with the appreciation for time abundance is like going from triple espresso to decaf”.Recognizing this is the first step.Appreciating time abundance and living in the present doesn’t mean we should just sit on our butts and do nothing either. According to some of the most fulfilled people interviewed for the book’s case studies: 1. continual learning2. serviceare two commons factors for a fulfilled life. And I absolutely agree, I find my life the most meaningful when I’m continuously learning and can be of service to the world. I like that this book falls not only into the genre of business and entrepreneurship but also philosophy, psychology and self-help - which I think are intricately linked. In order to be well-informed, you need to be able to evaluate things from different perspective.Most of what is said in this book is no new news. I believe most of us are already familiar with the idea that we should enjoy life and live life in the moment but through seeing it from the author’s lens, the author’s way of getting things across that help sharpens my vague understanding of things - and honed down the messages for me even more. Definitely a good read on my list!Edit: I’m surprised this book receives a lot of negative reviews - mostly from people questioning Ferriss’s ego, and his “unethical” ways of doing businesses such as outsourcing help from virtual assistants in third world countries, who charge less.I did feel put off reading it because I had read these negative reviews prior to starting, but I’m glad I gave it a go anyway because I still learned a lot from the book and did not share the same negative sentiments towards Ferriss.I didn’t see this book as a guide on how to get rich quick etc, but rather more like an introduction to a lifestyle different from the accepted norm and more like a motivational tool / insights into Ferriss and others’ success stories. And not to defend Ferriss (although that is probably exactly what I am doing) - there is no need to be holier-than-thou. I don’t think the author is recommending us to take advantage of cheaper labour in poorer countries but rather how money can go further there, hence why they charge less.I am not sure if it’s fair to compare hiring virtual assistants in third world countries who charge less - to slave labors or garment workers for example. Yes, the rate is lower than developed countries but the overall expenses are lower too.Plus it's a question about the whole system we are inMoral contradiction / ethical dilemma There is a section in the book that addresses exactly this: Service for the right reasons: to save the whales or kill them and feed the children?“Service to me is simple: doing something that improves life besides your own.This is not the same as philanthropy. Philanthropy is the altruistic concern for the well-being of mankind–human life. Human life and comfort have long been focused on to the exclusion of the environment and the rest of the food chain, hence our current race to imminent extinction. Serves us right. The world does not exist solely for the betterment and multiplication of mankind.Before I start chaining myself to trees and saving the dart frogs, though, I should take my own advice: do not become a cause snob.How can you help starving children in Africa when there are starving children in Los Angeles? How can you save the whales when homeless people are freezing to death? How does doing volunteer research on coral destruction help those people who need help now?”Children, please. Everything out there needs help, so don’t get baited into “my cause can beat up your cause” arguments with no right answer. There are no qualitative or quantitative comparisons that make sense. The truth is this: those thousands of lives you save could contribute to a famine that kills millions, or that one bush in Bolivia that you protect could hold the cure for cancer. The downstream effects are unknown. Do your best and hope for the best. If you’re improving the world–however you define that–consider your job well done.Service isn’t limited to saving lives or the environment. It can also improve life. If you are a musician and put a smile on the faces of thousands or millions, I view that as service. If you are a mentor and change the life of one child for the better, the world has been improved. Improving the quality of life in the world is in no fashion inferior to adding more lives.”Service is an attitude.”"

Timothy Ferriss comes from a different background: after selling his first company for a bunch of billions, we jump into a digital nomad lifestyle. He considers that his decisions are extendable to the middle-class and the people working 9-17, and addressing this he fails miserably. Is two different rivers with different water. But there is however a lot of important information and philosophies we can extract from this book.Timothy dedicates an important part of his book to talk about Virtual Assistants and popular places to hire them. This is a useful information to start with, but most of the rules we later on talks about are about common sense (do provide them with clear orders, leave everything written, give them freedom to expend money until certain amount...). Many of the websites and ideas about reselling are useful and not that well known.The book in general challenges you to move out from your comfort zone and take risks, which is by itself a vary valuable reason. ""The 4-hour workweek"" title is misleading, since as Tim himself recognizes is not about the money you have earned, but about the freedom you now have and the mobility worldwide. If I would be a boss with responsibility over other people, I would be worried if many of them were reading it. I actually quit my job before finishing it.As a side note: Tim writing's style is very selfish and self-centered. But that does not mean a star less for me"
143,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/747419-jason,3,"So far, not yet having finished this book, it seems like he created it for those who are: 1. in the sales of PRODUCTS industry, and 2. of those people, for those who are in a management/ownership position. For those who are in a service-oriented industry, his tactics do not seem to apply. Some of his tips do have merit however, such as keeping distractions to a minimum by only checking email and phone messages sparingly and delegating smaller tasks not absolutely necessary to other people to better utilize ones time on priorities. We will see if there is more to his book after I'm finished though before I give my final rating.After reading it, I think that I'm still in the same mindset as before. It was written seemingly for those who do not like their job. For those of us who were lucky enough to choose a profession that we actually enjoy, this is probably not the quintessential book of choice. It is packed with situations that are 99% ""not going to happen,"" such as the ""ask your boss if you can just work from home"" scenario. If I were to even try to ask my boss about that, he would just say ""I don't think so"" before 10 words were out of my mouth. The latter half of the book DID make me want to travel more, but the very end just seemed a bit preachy. All in all, I could see how this could possibly be inspiring to some, but not to most."

I needed to be reminded of that.....Why I wanted to give it 5 stars - because I am re-entering the workforce after many years and I got caught up in the hype ""I know everything you need to be successful! This is wonderful! And this is wonderful! And you will not be fulfilled if you don't do all of these wonderful things!!"" But then I realized I am the fisherman in Ferriss's book. I have a very strong sense of community and family and I don't need to outsource my whole life to love my life. Do I want to go to the Azore Islands and reconnect with family and do family history? I do. And thanks to this book I will make it a goal. However, I will not cut corners, look for loopholes or be unethical to do so. Enter the 2 stars. Nor do I need to travel the world to live a fulfilling life. I have everything I need right here. The love of my life, a church community, a roof over my head, the sun that shines 300 days a year, dear friends, loving family, a career that reimburses me for good work, and a hobby that brings me joy.

It is not complete, definitive or anything like it.There are better books about all the finer points:— stoicism— minimalism— productivity— marketing— traveling the world.BUT.This one puts it all together. This book is what made me dare to defy what was conventional and expected.To dream about finding a job with purpose, and living life on my terms. It is a game-changer - and still has the potential to be.It is not a definitive guide of any sort. But it is an invitation to explore. An invitation to think about what are your values (is it travel? is it to spend time with your family? work with something you love?) and rehearse worst-case scenarios.And, most importantly: to dream and try and live the ""best-case"" scenarios.For me, the truth is this: this book changes lives. And that is why it is still a 5/5.P.S.: It is just appropriate to be writing these lines on a cold morning in Bratislava. At this moment, I am traveling with 3 friends, 2 of whom work remotely (just like me). By the end of the year, I will have spent over 100 days of 2019 traveling.

It feels like a spiritual relative of Sebastian Marshall's Ikigai --- reading this book will have you spending a lot of time pondering ""hmm, what kind of life do I really want to live?"" The answer for most people I've talked to is ""not like this,"" but the fear gets in the way.This is a good book about getting over the fear. It's got helpful little exercises for comfort zone expansion, tactics for dealing with bureaucrats, strategies for building prestige, and lots more. And a lot of prompts for trying to figure out what you'd rather be doing, and for figuring out how to get there from here.The gist of all of it is that people don't really want to be millionaires, they want to have what they assume is the millionaire lifestyle. So computer how much money per day you'd actually need in order to live how you'd like, and then work towards that number. Waiting to live until you're too old to appreciate it is a crap strategy."

Then a friend of mine recommended this book, but it took me 4 months to finish it! Some parts (especially the last third) were really interesting to me, but other parts definitely weren't.It think it's one of those kind of books that you shouldn't read every sentence from, but jump from chapter to chapter based on what is interesting to you. I don't know if I have OCD or what, but I'm definitely incapable of doing that, I need to read every last bit, which is probably why it took me so long to finish it and I found some parts difficult to read.That being said, I totally understand how it can change life, and maybe it's going to help me get the push and the motivation to look for another way to earn income and travel around the world!

I like being efficient, so I especially enjoyed his chapter on Automation, and I can easily see how to apply it to my own business.Tim Ferris will teach you how to work remotely, how to cut 50% of your work load, and how to live your life to the fullest. He provides solid resources for each chapter, and his ideas are all workable. I think some of his methods are a bit sketchy though. I'm not the kind of person to 'scam a system'. That's probably why I'll never be rich like Tim Ferris. But there are definitely some good takeaways from his book.It will definitely make you think. Read it."

155,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23066833-bloodorange,3,"Disclaimers:I skipped parts of the book that dealt with product development and automation, since these do not apply to my experience. Most of the 'mobility' tips do not apply in my case, since I happen to live AND earn in one of those 'ridiculously cheap' countries.There was no little escaping from this book. Since I have a work/ organisation/ near burnout crisis each year in June (comes with the territory), I tend to google for tips and motivation, and The 4-Hour Work Week reached me in small, irritating snippets. 1. The principles seemed tempting, but unenforceable in my profession, as evidenced by numerous comments on the irrelevance of the Pareto Principle in education. You just have to put in the hours, even if you do that by Skype; most of the valid exams need to take place in teacher's presence; you can't tell 80% of your students to just get lost; on most levels of education, 'automation' such as peer assessment simply doesn't work (on others, it can be used, but will not replace teacher's assessment). The ugly: some issues just can't be dealt with ""intensively"" - as evidenced by joking, but telling questions on the author's on the release date of The 4-hour Baby.The good: Ferriss' elimination tips are quite inspiring even to non entrepreneurs. They're good reminders to not increase one's workload automatically and unreflexively, as teachers often do. In the words of Anne Taintor:http://s30.postimg.org/f5qt0jw5t/magn...I decided to implement some of the ideas I previously had that would make students more responsible for their learning and material preparation (with me interfering and supplementing whatever information they might have left out, that is). I also thought I might revise class rules as a set of basic rules + Frequently Asked Questions in an attempt to make them more independent. 2. Something about the approach to work this books represents seems, frankly speaking, immoral to me, and not just me. This piece by Penelope Trunk is a classic by now: http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2009/01...This piece by Jennifer Dziura https://medium.com/get-bullish/a5e5f4... is much more recent and contains a sentence that says it all:If you seem to be “getting everything you want,” you should probably examine whether you’re getting it at someone’s expense, or whether you’re just constantly, in small ways, making the world worse.3. When I was a kid, I read and anthology of science fiction stories, including a story (I can't recall the title) about a society of the future in which people removed the obstacle of the decision making process (the decisions in it are taken instantly, which results in living an equivalent of an action-packed lifetime in just one night. Tim Ferriss reminds me of the protagonist, as his aim seems to be to live as many lives as possible in one lifetime. Somewhat unsurprisingly, I remember his blog post about his panic attacks (which I can't locate now), which somehow makes sense. To be fair, he also urges the reader to slow down and savour life, but somehow hmm.The (completely unexpected) good:- 'It is vain to do with more what can be done with less."" - William of Ockham; not a a bad motto to work by.- I was surprised by his stress on do-gooding, volunteering and making donations.- Dreamlining - I was surprised by how much my dreams are time-dependent instead of money-dependent.Now, I think, time to read this, for balance: In Praise of Slowness: Challenging the Cult of Speed"
156,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1957039-patrick,4,"So in reality, The 4-Hour Workweek is lifestyle porn for me. Tim Ferriss discusses real, practical strategies for cutting loose from the traditional working world, and living a lifestyle with less work, more time for important things, and the ability to travel the world.I liked this book quite a bit. I'm not sure how useful most of it will be to me, but it sure makes me dream about what *could* be. ""If only I had an idea for a business...""Mr. Ferriss not only provides philosophical and psychological reasons for getting your employer to let you work at home, but he talks about how to set up your own business that requires minimal interaction and will be able to support you as you live in different countries.I had only two problems with this book:1) While Mr. Ferriss rightly disparages working your ass off so you can enjoy your retirement (referring to it as ""deferred life""), he does seem to make the assumption that you'll be able to alternate work and ""mini-retirements"" forever. Frankly, I'm guessing that when I'm 75, I'm not going to be terribly effective at working at all. I'm disappointed by his lack of consideration for care during my waning years. Maybe he's a proponent of ice floes?2) Tim Ferriss's biggest fan is Tim Ferriss. It was a bit unseemly how often he talked about how great he was. I understand that he's trying to convince us that if he could do it, we could too, but I'm tired of hearing about how he won a tango competition, dined at 5-star restaurants, or practices martial arts. If his personality in real life is anything like he comes across in the book, I suspect that I wouldn't get a word in edgewise if we were hanging out.Ok, bonus problem: He uses the term ""muse"" to refer to ""an automated vehicle for generating cash without consuming time"". Every time he uses it, it's jarring, because I know what the term actually means.Anyway, those faults aside, this book contained tons of great information for entrepreneurs and people who are looking to cut loose from the daily grind. Lots of great information here. Highly recommended for anyone who has ever had dreams of doing something different with their work life."
157,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28646-bryan,4,"I had been reluctant to read this as I assumed it was written by a spoiled and out-of-touch entrepreneur. Recently, however, a friend pointed out to me that an author I liked had been on Ferris' podcast. I listened and enjoyed the conversation they had. I continued listening to subsequent episodes, and decided that in spite of my irrational prejudice, I was starting to like him more and more. This book is a bit dated now, and does in places come off as brash and irritating, yet it's quite positive and an open challenge to live life on one's own terms. As a result it's inspirational, and it gives some insight into how differently people can think about risks and resources. In certain ways I wish I'd read it earlier, as it would likely have saved me a few years spent obeying societal dictates in a career to which I was not particularly suited. But I think without the good impression left by the compassionate and sometimes fascinating interviews Ferris does on his podcast, I might have been less receptive to the book's tone."

I personally know people who have basically changed their entire lifestyle after reading Tim Ferriss' book.I read it in Spanish, so I won't comment on the language.Stating the obvious, the title doesn't really deliver on its promise. However, that doesn't mean there isn't plenty of practical advice on how to question (and perhaps improve) your own lifestyle.The hardest part for me to swallow is the total inconsideration of other people that Ferriss has. Waste other people's time so you can save yours? Go for it. The world simply wouldn't work if everyone acted according to Ferriss' advise.The strongest parts of the book are 1) the focus on essentialism, and 2) the questions the author asks you to ask yourself, and the exercises he recommends.All in all, this is a modern classic packed with practical advise which is worth the read. But please take the advise with a pinch of salt."

The first time I saw this book, it lay on the desk of a ridiculous person who somehow clearly hated working but also made his life much, much harder by attempting to do everyone else’s jobs in addition to his own. Maybe he really did need this book. But as far as I know, he continued to micromanage everyone despite this book’s best takeaway being the “art” of delegation. I decided to download the audio of this book after listening to the BY THE BOOK episodes about it. I’ve had a rough time staying on top of my work lately and hoped maybe I could get a helpful word or two about getting things done. Boy did I get a word. 4-HOUR WW is equal parts ridiculous, genius, and unintentionally entertaining. The audiobook reader’s voice stressed me out beyond belief, but I loved it. Useful aspects of this book include the discussion of Parkinson’s Law (absolutely true), the 80/20 rule, the time-suckage of email, and generally useful points about the kinds of customers that aren’t worth having. There is some wisdom here. But ultimately, most working people—whether small business owners or corporate employees like me—cannot take most of these steps and wouldn’t have the means to do so anyway. That many people take actual satisfaction in their work and that many employers view their employees as more than human drones are truths completely glossed over. And it should go without saying that if everyone approached their work life this way, then capitalism would fail faster than a speeding bullet. Wait a minute...Is capitalism a Ponzi scheme?This book also got weirdly existential in the end, but I’ll leave that one mostly alone. I didn’t really sign up to get “meaning of life” advice from Tim Ferriss, kickboxing “expert” and meditation extraordinaire; but I suppose if you’re willing to take and leave parts of this book (which I clearly am), it’s not a bad thing to be reminded that you are more than the job you do. This book has no balance whatsoever, but whatever. I laughed a lot while listening and putting together my patio furniture. And maybe I will try to check email fewer times during the day."

He doesn't have much in the way of material things, but every day he gets to hang out with his friends and family. He fishes a little. He takes an afternoon nap with his wife.

The thesis is simple: you can live like a millionaire, without actually being one. The 4 Hour Work Weeks touches on a variety of topics including automation, offshoring, delegation, minimalism and productivity. Key Takeaways  Definitions The New Rich have a different mindset to the typical employee or business owner. The New Rich: - have others work for them - distribute recovery periods and adventures (mini-retirements) throughout life - recognize that inactivity is not the goal and instead prioritise doing what excites them - focus on establishing a steady cash flow first, and then a big payday later.Everything popular is wrongRetirement is worst-case scenario insurance. Interest and energy are cyclical - alternate between work and rest. Doing less is not being lazy. The New Rich measure their contribution in results, not time. Laziness isn’t working less; laziness is letting circumstances define your life for you. The timing is never right. Whatever you want to do someday, just do it now. Ask for forgiveness, not permission. Emphasize your strengths, don’t fix weaknesses - this often provides a multiplier effect, while trying to fix weaknesses typically leads to only incremental improvement.Money alone is not the solution but relative income is more important than absolute income. Relative income measures both time and money. A person working 10 hours a week and making $10,000 is richer than someone working 80 hours a week and making $100,000. Embrace good stress instead of avoiding stress altogether.Most people are convinced they can only accomplish mediocre things. There is therefore more competition for mediocre goals. Elimination 80% of results come from 20% of actions. Ask yourself the following questions what 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness and what 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness?Be difficult when it matters - eg when it comes to protecting your productivity. Automation Build up a solid weekly income, independent of your day job:Step 1: Pick a reachable niche market. Find a market by defining your customers, and then designing your product around them. Preferably you must be a member of said market. Step 2: Brainstorm products whose benefit can be explained in one sentence or phrase. - The product should be expensive enough to sell fewer units, create higher profit margins, and attract lower-maintenance customers – but not so expensive that customers want to speak with you before buying. - The product should take less than 4 weeks to manufacture - The product should be fully explainable in an online FAQ. The easiest type of product to create is an information product – low-cost, fast to manufacture, and time-consuming for competitors to duplicate. If you read the top three books on a given subject, you’ll know more about the subject than 80% of the relevant population, thereby qualifying you as an expert. The person with the highest credibility will sell the most, not the person who knows the most about the subject. To establish credibility:1) Join 2 or 3 trade associations with official-sounding names.2) Read the 3 top-selling books on the topic and write a one-page summary of each.3) Go to the closest university, put up posters advertising a free seminar on the subject, and give the seminar using the summaries you’ve written.4) Call up a local branch of a well-known company and tell them you’ve done the seminars at the university and that you’re a member of the trade associations. Explain that you’re trying to gain speaking experience outside of the academic setting.5) Leverage your trade association membership and speaking experience to get an article published for a trade magazine. The only way to test if anyone actually wants your product is to ask people to buy it. Create a basic one-to-three-page website, put up a Google AdWords advertisement and use the response to test whether people will buy.  Liberation A 5 step process for getting your employer to let you work from home permanently:1. Increase investment - get your employer to first invest in you to increase their cost if you leave. For example, ask if the firm has any additional trainings available to employees and take them.2. Prove increased output offsite - call off sick for two days in the middle of the week, double your work output on both days, and make sure to demonstrate and record it with an email trail. 3. Show the business benefit - position remote working as a business benefit, not a personal perk. Bill more client time, complete more projects, or otherwise demonstrate quantified improvement. Explain the increased productivity as less time commuting and fewer distractions. 4. Propose a trial period - Informally mention to your boss how you were sick those two days and didn’t expect to get anything done, but were actually twice as productive. Ask if you could try working from home for 2 days in the next two weeks. When your boss objects, acknowledge his concerns and propose working from home only one day a week instead. 5. Expand remote time - Continue to excel on your work-from-home days and drop your in-office performance to heighten the contrast. Ask for another trial period with an extra two days at home. After your boss has gotten used to this, ask for a full-time remote trial of 2 weeks. Conclusion There are as many gems in this book as there is questionable advice. I am not too sure about Ferris' idea to essentially automate your life through offshoring daily tasks. This seems to be going too far. I was also particularly irritated by the fact that he highlights ""most countries in Africa"" as not ideal locations to travel to and work from because of the risk of kidnapping and terrorism. Seriously? Those 2 sentences near the end of the book pretty much ruined the rest of it for me, and thus 3 stars.That said, the chapters on Income Automation and productivity are well worth reading as these are the most practical I think I have read in any work. Other than that...meh."
163,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65849150-kelsey,3,"The extended edition is recommended as it updates many of the author's early ideas with more recently relevant tools and tips (original text released in 2009). Be warned, the audiobook is fine overall, but because lots of chapters list resources and websites parenthetically in the middle of a sentence or idea, you'll often find yourself repeatedly being read the ""www dot so-and-so dot com forward-slash home forward-slash news forward-slash whatever dot html"". Also, keep in mind that some of the tools the author mentions, while useful, may have been made obsolete when compared to some other things we have that we didn't commonly use in 2009 (like cloud computing versus working locally) or more efficient products have perhaps been released. Overall, good ideas and a recommended read for anyone who runs their own side hustle or fledgling business.As someone who does virtual assisting, I was disappointed about how much Ferriss underscored the perks of having a VA from India or another far off land. While differences of time zone (you can send off tasks at the end of the day and wake to find them completed) and spend (you often pay less than US standard wages for the same work) may be beneficial to an entrepreneur, I think this sort of thinking is dangerous to tout as THE way to succeed while delegating work. VAs come in all shapes, sizes, and skillsets, and opting to only hire non-domestic VAs with cost as a primary driver undermines the quality work that can be done by anyone ANYWHERE. If they're remote, why do they need to be in India? From Ferriss' telling, it seems cost is the only thing that really drives that desire, and I find that disappointing. It's like telling an artist you can buy the same thing at Walmart for $15...it undermines the craft and good work that anyone can do and comes off as a bit tone deaf and opportunistic in a world where Americans know that off-shore labor is often cheaper because it doesn't actually meet the needs of the worker being paid low wages. I'm not saying foreign VAs don't deserve pay and opportunity; I'm saying those looking for assistants should consider how best to support the HUMAN who needs the job.So, that being said, if you'd like to hire a virtual assistant, consider ALL virtual assistants, not just the ones you can pay next to nothing to do all your bitch work while you sleep. /endrant"
164,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5820202-koen-van-den-eeckhout,2,"Positive points: I strongly agree with some of the principles in this book, especially the Pareto principle and Parkinson's law, which can make your approach much more efficient.Neutral points: Ferriss uses a writing style balancing between motivational and arrogant, often crossing the line towards the latter. Nevertheless, it kinda fits the 'fuck it' theme of the book and easy to get used to. The book reads very quickly.Negative points: besides feeling outdated already (Blackberry? Yahoo shops?), Ferriss often crosses the line towards the downright unethical. Several pages on how to be widely regarded as an expert without being one, or marketing techniques which are pretty much illegal (e.g. selling items on eBay without having them)."
165,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602450-vladyslav-sitalo,3,"The style of the book is somewhat annoying but if you overcome this annoyance this book has something to share with you.--It's a fun fact that I've decided to read this book around the same time as Elon Musk's biography.And as both of the books is fresh in my mind, I can see two drastically different approaches to life from Elon and Tim.Tim is asking reader to dream big set impossible goals and than talks about buying a car or going to some nice place to live.From my perspective ""big"" is what Musk is doing - to transform car and space industries is big, to give humanity ability to travel to Mars is big, to minimize risks from superintelligent AI is big.Buying a Ferrari eh, it's kind of mediocre.I'm not saying that goal to buy Ferrari or live in constant travel or enjoying yourself in any other way is not a worthy goal, just saying that, well, it's not ""big"".It's happens to be true that my sentiments and goals is much more aligned with the Musk's vision. So this fact immediately questions the applicability of suggested techniques as THE way to achieve your goals if they are really big. (What would you set you month input goal if your actual goal is to go to the other planet (really really expensive) or achieve personal immortality (not technologically feasible right now, but it's plausible that it can be achievable in the nearest 50 years. And you can actually work on advancing scientific research/industry/public appreciation to make it feasible sooner then later)? )And so getting back to the comparison between Musk and Ferriss lifestyle - you can see big difference in them - you can probably characterize them as ""4 hour workweek"" vs ""4 hours to sleep"" or by goals ""go to Mars"" vs ""sip wine and play guitar with my amigos"".Do you have to adopt the work style similar to Musk's to achieve really big things? Well, I don't know, but Musk is succeeding and it is sensible to take him as an example at least to some extent.That said, I would admit that the lifestyle, proposed in the book is by all means more interesting and richer on life experience than your average one. Though, important thing to notice is that, unfortunately, this kind of lifestyle is not sustainable for majority of the population (you can tell this by simply looking how much people is employed as VA/outsources/etc for sustaining it for one person). Also despite described drawbacks this book contains a lot of great advice. For example - call to eliminate waste work and focus on the most efficient approaches is obviously applicable almost to everyone and everywhere (and the book provides you with recomendations and options on how to actually do that).I was always for elimination of unnecessary stuff/work/interruption. But Tim here is also talking about an information limitation. And I have to admit that I'm and informational addict in a way :). I don't read news, newspapers/magazines, I don't watch TV.But I totally into reading books, listening audiobooks/podcasts and reading interesting articles on the web. The book convinced me to limit time for email/social networks to two limited periods during the day. And i think it's a great practice. I've also become more picky regarding articles that I read.But, that said, constant learning and self education is one of the values that I practice and want to excel in. And you can't learn new things without getting info about them :).More on positive side:Facing your fears as a way to make a better decisions is really interesting technique.Tim is advocating lean approach to building business and it resonates with Lean Startup approach but applied to non-tech business which is interesting.He is questioning a lot of ""common sense"" assumptions and encouraging people to do this more often. I think that this approach can lead to better society in general.Also Tim briefly advocates ""choice-minimal"" lifestyle. Characteristic quote: ""Fast decisions preserve usable attention for what matters""I have this problem with choice anxiety - I just have to choose the best option, but I've been noticing and regarding this as a problem because I'm spending too much time focusing on minor decisions and I think there is better use for this time. The book do not address problem in depth but have a reference for ""The paradox of choice"" https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1... which I intend to read.Also I would recommend http://thewirecutter.com for people with similar problems as at least a partial solution that can eliminate/mitigate your choice anxiety for a lot of products.More on the downside besides the style:One thing that remained in my mind as bluntly stupid - house that just stays there, and guy is loosing money on it for some mysterious reason (it's not like it would take any amount of time to ask VA to rent it/find a good agency to work with).Tim is constantly overconfidently saying stuff about everything in the world. That's annoying, especially considering that what he is telling often is not entirely? True And he is almost never giving any quantifiable data to support his claims.Other thing Is confused thinking on some topics, for example thoughts on charity/service work. If you actually want to do some good (and not just feel good about yourself) look into https://80000hours.org/ project or http://www.givewell.org/."

Don’t work just for money for owning enviable things, follow your passion and do interesting things. Be unrealistic.“The future is here; It’s just not distributed yet”.-E is for elimination: Do first thing first, if you don’t have time you don’t have PRIORITIES. You have to define what you want to do with your time. Understand the Pareto principle “80 % of the outputs result from 20% of the inputs”. Be productive not just active, focus on what is important for you and neglect the tasks which do not take you closer to your goals, do not multitask, learn to propose don’t let others influence your decisions, cultivate selective ignorance “knowledge is power but knowledge without action are useless”, practice the art of nonfinishing and the art of refusal. Protect yourself from people who waste your time. “Reading, after a certain age, diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking.”-A is for automation: * HIRE AN ASSISTANT: Lingering unimportant tasks will disappear as soon as someone else is being paid to do them.

171,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16366211-ro,5,"What I like about this book is that it introduces a lot of new concepts for me - for a better (work) life, while also challenges my existing concepts on (work) life.I am particularly intrigued by the New Rich concept that defines “riches” not in having millions or billions, but more on the use of one’s time / having time freedom. “Those who abandon the deferred-life plan and create luxury lifestyles in the present using the currency of the New Rich: time and mobility.”While it would help to have millions and billions, often we are trapped in this rut of wanting more and pushing off “living in the moment” until we believe we have enough. And you guessed it, that day of having enough, never comes (unless you have a mindset shift). The most mind blowing thing is that the author shows how everyday ordinary people can & do have the means to live luxuriously but are held back by their limiting beliefs that they need to have more, work harder and join the millions and billions club.The author introduces several business models, tips tricks and tools that you can use to “eliminate” and “automate” your work - to free up your time; something you can immediately apply into your (work) life if you wish. 	i.e. 80/20 Pareto’s law According to the 80/20 rule: 80% of results are from 20% of action80% of outputs are from 20% of inputs80% of consequences are from 20% of the causes 80% of profits are from 20% of products and customers A practical use of the 80/20 rule is to ask yourself: 1. Which 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness?2. Which 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness? The book further highlights on our insistent need to “be productive"", which only leads us to fill our time with xx just to “feel productive”. If we reassess our daily to-do list and eliminate all the unnecessary time fillers, we can free up our time to do productive fulfilling things - things we truly enjoy.For example, the “mini retirement” concept talks about how instead of saving up our entire life’s savings to spend when we retire, why not use that money throughout your life and have what the author calls “mini retirements”. This way, you can truly enjoy life while you are young and in your prime, rather than wait until the time is right, which again may never happen. This definitely challenges my personal limiting belief - as I am one of those people who likes to wait until it’s the right time. The book ends by touching on some psychology and self help (my favorite topic) - that even after achieving the “4 hour work week” and have all the time in the world to do what you truly enjoy. Don’t expect all life challenges to just disappear. It is not easy to just ""wind down and enjoy”. Hence why being rich and depressed, successful and depressed are all too familiar. “Man is so made that he can only find relaxation from one kind of labor by taking up another” - Anatole FranceYou cannot just transition overnight from being a goal oriented high-performer to appreciating life in the moment. Although it is not impossible to do both, unraveling such habits take time - just like anything else in life; “leaning to replace the perception of time famine with the appreciation for time abundance is like going from triple espresso to decaf”.Recognizing this is the first step.Appreciating time abundance and living in the present doesn’t mean we should just sit on our butts and do nothing either. According to some of the most fulfilled people interviewed for the book’s case studies: 1. continual learning2. serviceare two commons factors for a fulfilled life. And I absolutely agree, I find my life the most meaningful when I’m continuously learning and can be of service to the world. I like that this book falls not only into the genre of business and entrepreneurship but also philosophy, psychology and self-help - which I think are intricately linked. In order to be well-informed, you need to be able to evaluate things from different perspective.Most of what is said in this book is no new news. I believe most of us are already familiar with the idea that we should enjoy life and live life in the moment but through seeing it from the author’s lens, the author’s way of getting things across that help sharpens my vague understanding of things - and honed down the messages for me even more. Definitely a good read on my list!Edit: I’m surprised this book receives a lot of negative reviews - mostly from people questioning Ferriss’s ego, and his “unethical” ways of doing businesses such as outsourcing help from virtual assistants in third world countries, who charge less.I did feel put off reading it because I had read these negative reviews prior to starting, but I’m glad I gave it a go anyway because I still learned a lot from the book and did not share the same negative sentiments towards Ferriss.I didn’t see this book as a guide on how to get rich quick etc, but rather more like an introduction to a lifestyle different from the accepted norm and more like a motivational tool / insights into Ferriss and others’ success stories. And not to defend Ferriss (although that is probably exactly what I am doing) - there is no need to be holier-than-thou. I don’t think the author is recommending us to take advantage of cheaper labour in poorer countries but rather how money can go further there, hence why they charge less.I am not sure if it’s fair to compare hiring virtual assistants in third world countries who charge less - to slave labors or garment workers for example. Yes, the rate is lower than developed countries but the overall expenses are lower too.Plus it's a question about the whole system we are inMoral contradiction / ethical dilemma There is a section in the book that addresses exactly this: Service for the right reasons: to save the whales or kill them and feed the children?“Service to me is simple: doing something that improves life besides your own.This is not the same as philanthropy. Philanthropy is the altruistic concern for the well-being of mankind–human life. Human life and comfort have long been focused on to the exclusion of the environment and the rest of the food chain, hence our current race to imminent extinction. Serves us right. The world does not exist solely for the betterment and multiplication of mankind.Before I start chaining myself to trees and saving the dart frogs, though, I should take my own advice: do not become a cause snob.How can you help starving children in Africa when there are starving children in Los Angeles? How can you save the whales when homeless people are freezing to death? How does doing volunteer research on coral destruction help those people who need help now?”Children, please. Everything out there needs help, so don’t get baited into “my cause can beat up your cause” arguments with no right answer. There are no qualitative or quantitative comparisons that make sense. The truth is this: those thousands of lives you save could contribute to a famine that kills millions, or that one bush in Bolivia that you protect could hold the cure for cancer. The downstream effects are unknown. Do your best and hope for the best. If you’re improving the world–however you define that–consider your job well done.Service isn’t limited to saving lives or the environment. It can also improve life. If you are a musician and put a smile on the faces of thousands or millions, I view that as service. If you are a mentor and change the life of one child for the better, the world has been improved. Improving the quality of life in the world is in no fashion inferior to adding more lives.”Service is an attitude.”"
172,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39587412-enrique-ma-as,5,"The first word that comes into my mind to tag this book is: inspiring.But let's elaborate. Timothy Ferriss comes from a different background: after selling his first company for a bunch of billions, we jump into a digital nomad lifestyle. He considers that his decisions are extendable to the middle-class and the people working 9-17, and addressing this he fails miserably. Is two different rivers with different water. But there is however a lot of important information and philosophies we can extract from this book.Timothy dedicates an important part of his book to talk about Virtual Assistants and popular places to hire them. This is a useful information to start with, but most of the rules we later on talks about are about common sense (do provide them with clear orders, leave everything written, give them freedom to expend money until certain amount...). Many of the websites and ideas about reselling are useful and not that well known.The book in general challenges you to move out from your comfort zone and take risks, which is by itself a vary valuable reason. ""The 4-hour workweek"" title is misleading, since as Tim himself recognizes is not about the money you have earned, but about the freedom you now have and the mobility worldwide. If I would be a boss with responsibility over other people, I would be worried if many of them were reading it. I actually quit my job before finishing it.As a side note: Tim writing's style is very selfish and self-centered. But that does not mean a star less for me"

For those who are in a service-oriented industry, his tactics do not seem to apply. Some of his tips do have merit however, such as keeping distractions to a minimum by only checking email and phone messages sparingly and delegating smaller tasks not absolutely necessary to other people to better utilize ones time on priorities. We will see if there is more to his book after I'm finished though before I give my final rating.After reading it, I think that I'm still in the same mindset as before. It was written seemingly for those who do not like their job. For those of us who were lucky enough to choose a profession that we actually enjoy, this is probably not the quintessential book of choice. It is packed with situations that are 99% ""not going to happen,"" such as the ""ask your boss if you can just work from home"" scenario. If I were to even try to ask my boss about that, he would just say ""I don't think so"" before 10 words were out of my mouth. The latter half of the book DID make me want to travel more, but the very end just seemed a bit preachy. All in all, I could see how this could possibly be inspiring to some, but not to most."

It's got helpful little exercises for comfort zone expansion, tactics for dealing with bureaucrats, strategies for building prestige, and lots more. And a lot of prompts for trying to figure out what you'd rather be doing, and for figuring out how to get there from here.The gist of all of it is that people don't really want to be millionaires, they want to have what they assume is the millionaire lifestyle. So computer how much money per day you'd actually need in order to live how you'd like, and then work towards that number. Waiting to live until you're too old to appreciate it is a crap strategy."

That's probably why I'll never be rich like Tim Ferris. But there are definitely some good takeaways from his book.It will definitely make you think. Read it."

I wish I had a mind capable of Tim Ferriss's meta-level overview, his ability to accurately accommodate and relate a hundred facts and a dozen theories and tamp them all down into a perfectly lucid and convincing essence. Fun to read, too. Sarcastic, jolly, digressive and irreverent and philosophical.He can probably rub his belly and tap his head at the same time, too.

185,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23066833-bloodorange,3,"Disclaimers:I skipped parts of the book that dealt with product development and automation, since these do not apply to my experience. Most of the 'mobility' tips do not apply in my case, since I happen to live AND earn in one of those 'ridiculously cheap' countries.There was no little escaping from this book. Since I have a work/ organisation/ near burnout crisis each year in June (comes with the territory), I tend to google for tips and motivation, and The 4-Hour Work Week reached me in small, irritating snippets. 1. The principles seemed tempting, but unenforceable in my profession, as evidenced by numerous comments on the irrelevance of the Pareto Principle in education. You just have to put in the hours, even if you do that by Skype; most of the valid exams need to take place in teacher's presence; you can't tell 80% of your students to just get lost; on most levels of education, 'automation' such as peer assessment simply doesn't work (on others, it can be used, but will not replace teacher's assessment). The ugly: some issues just can't be dealt with ""intensively"" - as evidenced by joking, but telling questions on the author's on the release date of The 4-hour Baby.The good: Ferriss' elimination tips are quite inspiring even to non entrepreneurs. They're good reminders to not increase one's workload automatically and unreflexively, as teachers often do. In the words of Anne Taintor:http://s30.postimg.org/f5qt0jw5t/magn...I decided to implement some of the ideas I previously had that would make students more responsible for their learning and material preparation (with me interfering and supplementing whatever information they might have left out, that is). I also thought I might revise class rules as a set of basic rules + Frequently Asked Questions in an attempt to make them more independent. 2. Something about the approach to work this books represents seems, frankly speaking, immoral to me, and not just me. This piece by Penelope Trunk is a classic by now: http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2009/01...This piece by Jennifer Dziura https://medium.com/get-bullish/a5e5f4... is much more recent and contains a sentence that says it all:If you seem to be “getting everything you want,” you should probably examine whether you’re getting it at someone’s expense, or whether you’re just constantly, in small ways, making the world worse.3. When I was a kid, I read and anthology of science fiction stories, including a story (I can't recall the title) about a society of the future in which people removed the obstacle of the decision making process (the decisions in it are taken instantly, which results in living an equivalent of an action-packed lifetime in just one night. Tim Ferriss reminds me of the protagonist, as his aim seems to be to live as many lives as possible in one lifetime. Somewhat unsurprisingly, I remember his blog post about his panic attacks (which I can't locate now), which somehow makes sense. To be fair, he also urges the reader to slow down and savour life, but somehow hmm.The (completely unexpected) good:- 'It is vain to do with more what can be done with less."" - William of Ockham; not a a bad motto to work by.- I was surprised by his stress on do-gooding, volunteering and making donations.- Dreamlining - I was surprised by how much my dreams are time-dependent instead of money-dependent.Now, I think, time to read this, for balance: In Praise of Slowness: Challenging the Cult of Speed"
186,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1957039-patrick,4,"So in reality, The 4-Hour Workweek is lifestyle porn for me. Tim Ferriss discusses real, practical strategies for cutting loose from the traditional working world, and living a lifestyle with less work, more time for important things, and the ability to travel the world.I liked this book quite a bit. I'm not sure how useful most of it will be to me, but it sure makes me dream about what *could* be. ""If only I had an idea for a business...""Mr. Ferriss not only provides philosophical and psychological reasons for getting your employer to let you work at home, but he talks about how to set up your own business that requires minimal interaction and will be able to support you as you live in different countries.I had only two problems with this book:1) While Mr. Ferriss rightly disparages working your ass off so you can enjoy your retirement (referring to it as ""deferred life""), he does seem to make the assumption that you'll be able to alternate work and ""mini-retirements"" forever. Frankly, I'm guessing that when I'm 75, I'm not going to be terribly effective at working at all. I'm disappointed by his lack of consideration for care during my waning years. Maybe he's a proponent of ice floes?2) Tim Ferriss's biggest fan is Tim Ferriss. It was a bit unseemly how often he talked about how great he was. I understand that he's trying to convince us that if he could do it, we could too, but I'm tired of hearing about how he won a tango competition, dined at 5-star restaurants, or practices martial arts. If his personality in real life is anything like he comes across in the book, I suspect that I wouldn't get a word in edgewise if we were hanging out.Ok, bonus problem: He uses the term ""muse"" to refer to ""an automated vehicle for generating cash without consuming time"". Every time he uses it, it's jarring, because I know what the term actually means.Anyway, those faults aside, this book contained tons of great information for entrepreneurs and people who are looking to cut loose from the daily grind. Lots of great information here. Highly recommended for anyone who has ever had dreams of doing something different with their work life."
187,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28646-bryan,4,"I had been reluctant to read this as I assumed it was written by a spoiled and out-of-touch entrepreneur. Recently, however, a friend pointed out to me that an author I liked had been on Ferris' podcast. I listened and enjoyed the conversation they had. I continued listening to subsequent episodes, and decided that in spite of my irrational prejudice, I was starting to like him more and more. This book is a bit dated now, and does in places come off as brash and irritating, yet it's quite positive and an open challenge to live life on one's own terms. As a result it's inspirational, and it gives some insight into how differently people can think about risks and resources. In certain ways I wish I'd read it earlier, as it would likely have saved me a few years spent obeying societal dictates in a career to which I was not particularly suited. But I think without the good impression left by the compassionate and sometimes fascinating interviews Ferris does on his podcast, I might have been less receptive to the book's tone."
188,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18908489-alexander-svanevik,4,"Hard to rate.No doubt, this book has had a huge impact on many people's lives. I personally know people who have basically changed their entire lifestyle after reading Tim Ferriss' book.I read it in Spanish, so I won't comment on the language.Stating the obvious, the title doesn't really deliver on its promise. However, that doesn't mean there isn't plenty of practical advice on how to question (and perhaps improve) your own lifestyle.The hardest part for me to swallow is the total inconsideration of other people that Ferriss has. Waste other people's time so you can save yours? Go for it. The world simply wouldn't work if everyone acted according to Ferriss' advise.The strongest parts of the book are 1) the focus on essentialism, and 2) the questions the author asks you to ask yourself, and the exercises he recommends.All in all, this is a modern classic packed with practical advise which is worth the read. But please take the advise with a pinch of salt."

190,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/557179-jocelyn-bailey,3,"My bizarre love affair with business and self-help books continues! The first time I saw this book, it lay on the desk of a ridiculous person who somehow clearly hated working but also made his life much, much harder by attempting to do everyone else’s jobs in addition to his own. Maybe he really did need this book. But as far as I know, he continued to micromanage everyone despite this book’s best takeaway being the “art” of delegation. I decided to download the audio of this book after listening to the BY THE BOOK episodes about it. I’ve had a rough time staying on top of my work lately and hoped maybe I could get a helpful word or two about getting things done. Boy did I get a word. 4-HOUR WW is equal parts ridiculous, genius, and unintentionally entertaining. The audiobook reader’s voice stressed me out beyond belief, but I loved it. Useful aspects of this book include the discussion of Parkinson’s Law (absolutely true), the 80/20 rule, the time-suckage of email, and generally useful points about the kinds of customers that aren’t worth having. There is some wisdom here. But ultimately, most working people—whether small business owners or corporate employees like me—cannot take most of these steps and wouldn’t have the means to do so anyway. That many people take actual satisfaction in their work and that many employers view their employees as more than human drones are truths completely glossed over. And it should go without saying that if everyone approached their work life this way, then capitalism would fail faster than a speeding bullet. Wait a minute...Is capitalism a Ponzi scheme?This book also got weirdly existential in the end, but I’ll leave that one mostly alone. I didn’t really sign up to get “meaning of life” advice from Tim Ferriss, kickboxing “expert” and meditation extraordinaire; but I suppose if you’re willing to take and leave parts of this book (which I clearly am), it’s not a bad thing to be reminded that you are more than the job you do. This book has no balance whatsoever, but whatever. I laughed a lot while listening and putting together my patio furniture. And maybe I will try to check email fewer times during the day."
191,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41350064-juli-hoffman,5,"This book does NOT teach you how to be a millionaire. If you're looking for THAT book, keep walking. This book DOES teach that wealth isn't all about money, it's about creating time to do the things you love. There's an example of a fisherman in this book. He doesn't have much in the way of material things, but every day he gets to hang out with his friends and family. He fishes a little. He takes an afternoon nap with his wife. He plays in a band in the evening. He's living like he's retired while he's young enough to enjoy it. This man is NOT a millionaire, but he's rich in the things that matter. This is the ""New Rich."" They are everyday people who are getting out of their comfort zones in order to enjoy life NOW, rather than waiting until the end of their days.I took away a lot of good ideas from this book and it did give me the courage to try some new things in my own career. A few years ago, My husband and I took a step back from the workoholic path. We don't make as much money as before, but our quality of life is much better. For years I've been playing around with some ideas to bring a little passive income into our household. This book gave me the courage to pursue this goal. Will I succeed? I have no idea! I do know that I'd rather live for experiences, time with the people I love, rather than killing myself trying to earn enough money to buy more things.Thanks, Tm Ferriss, for sharing your journey!"
192,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42182887-sipho,3,"This contemporary classic is a manifesto for lifestyle design. The thesis is simple: you can live like a millionaire, without actually being one. The 4 Hour Work Weeks touches on a variety of topics including automation, offshoring, delegation, minimalism and productivity. Key Takeaways  Definitions The New Rich have a different mindset to the typical employee or business owner. The New Rich: - have others work for them - distribute recovery periods and adventures (mini-retirements) throughout life - recognize that inactivity is not the goal and instead prioritise doing what excites them - focus on establishing a steady cash flow first, and then a big payday later.Everything popular is wrongRetirement is worst-case scenario insurance. Interest and energy are cyclical - alternate between work and rest. Doing less is not being lazy. The New Rich measure their contribution in results, not time. Laziness isn’t working less; laziness is letting circumstances define your life for you. The timing is never right. Whatever you want to do someday, just do it now. Ask for forgiveness, not permission. Emphasize your strengths, don’t fix weaknesses - this often provides a multiplier effect, while trying to fix weaknesses typically leads to only incremental improvement.Money alone is not the solution but relative income is more important than absolute income. Relative income measures both time and money. A person working 10 hours a week and making $10,000 is richer than someone working 80 hours a week and making $100,000. Embrace good stress instead of avoiding stress altogether.Most people are convinced they can only accomplish mediocre things. There is therefore more competition for mediocre goals. Elimination 80% of results come from 20% of actions. Ask yourself the following questions what 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness and what 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness?Be difficult when it matters - eg when it comes to protecting your productivity. Automation Build up a solid weekly income, independent of your day job:Step 1: Pick a reachable niche market. Find a market by defining your customers, and then designing your product around them. Preferably you must be a member of said market. Step 2: Brainstorm products whose benefit can be explained in one sentence or phrase. - The product should be expensive enough to sell fewer units, create higher profit margins, and attract lower-maintenance customers – but not so expensive that customers want to speak with you before buying. - The product should take less than 4 weeks to manufacture - The product should be fully explainable in an online FAQ. The easiest type of product to create is an information product – low-cost, fast to manufacture, and time-consuming for competitors to duplicate. If you read the top three books on a given subject, you’ll know more about the subject than 80% of the relevant population, thereby qualifying you as an expert. The person with the highest credibility will sell the most, not the person who knows the most about the subject. To establish credibility:1) Join 2 or 3 trade associations with official-sounding names.2) Read the 3 top-selling books on the topic and write a one-page summary of each.3) Go to the closest university, put up posters advertising a free seminar on the subject, and give the seminar using the summaries you’ve written.4) Call up a local branch of a well-known company and tell them you’ve done the seminars at the university and that you’re a member of the trade associations. Explain that you’re trying to gain speaking experience outside of the academic setting.5) Leverage your trade association membership and speaking experience to get an article published for a trade magazine. The only way to test if anyone actually wants your product is to ask people to buy it. Create a basic one-to-three-page website, put up a Google AdWords advertisement and use the response to test whether people will buy.  Liberation A 5 step process for getting your employer to let you work from home permanently:1. Increase investment - get your employer to first invest in you to increase their cost if you leave. For example, ask if the firm has any additional trainings available to employees and take them.2. Prove increased output offsite - call off sick for two days in the middle of the week, double your work output on both days, and make sure to demonstrate and record it with an email trail. 3. Show the business benefit - position remote working as a business benefit, not a personal perk. Bill more client time, complete more projects, or otherwise demonstrate quantified improvement. Explain the increased productivity as less time commuting and fewer distractions. 4. Propose a trial period - Informally mention to your boss how you were sick those two days and didn’t expect to get anything done, but were actually twice as productive. Ask if you could try working from home for 2 days in the next two weeks. When your boss objects, acknowledge his concerns and propose working from home only one day a week instead. 5. Expand remote time - Continue to excel on your work-from-home days and drop your in-office performance to heighten the contrast. Ask for another trial period with an extra two days at home. After your boss has gotten used to this, ask for a full-time remote trial of 2 weeks. Conclusion There are as many gems in this book as there is questionable advice. I am not too sure about Ferris' idea to essentially automate your life through offshoring daily tasks. This seems to be going too far. I was also particularly irritated by the fact that he highlights ""most countries in Africa"" as not ideal locations to travel to and work from because of the risk of kidnapping and terrorism. Seriously? Those 2 sentences near the end of the book pretty much ruined the rest of it for me, and thus 3 stars.That said, the chapters on Income Automation and productivity are well worth reading as these are the most practical I think I have read in any work. Other than that...meh."
193,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65849150-kelsey,3,"The extended edition is recommended as it updates many of the author's early ideas with more recently relevant tools and tips (original text released in 2009). Be warned, the audiobook is fine overall, but because lots of chapters list resources and websites parenthetically in the middle of a sentence or idea, you'll often find yourself repeatedly being read the ""www dot so-and-so dot com forward-slash home forward-slash news forward-slash whatever dot html"". Also, keep in mind that some of the tools the author mentions, while useful, may have been made obsolete when compared to some other things we have that we didn't commonly use in 2009 (like cloud computing versus working locally) or more efficient products have perhaps been released. Overall, good ideas and a recommended read for anyone who runs their own side hustle or fledgling business.As someone who does virtual assisting, I was disappointed about how much Ferriss underscored the perks of having a VA from India or another far off land. While differences of time zone (you can send off tasks at the end of the day and wake to find them completed) and spend (you often pay less than US standard wages for the same work) may be beneficial to an entrepreneur, I think this sort of thinking is dangerous to tout as THE way to succeed while delegating work. VAs come in all shapes, sizes, and skillsets, and opting to only hire non-domestic VAs with cost as a primary driver undermines the quality work that can be done by anyone ANYWHERE. If they're remote, why do they need to be in India? From Ferriss' telling, it seems cost is the only thing that really drives that desire, and I find that disappointing. It's like telling an artist you can buy the same thing at Walmart for $15...it undermines the craft and good work that anyone can do and comes off as a bit tone deaf and opportunistic in a world where Americans know that off-shore labor is often cheaper because it doesn't actually meet the needs of the worker being paid low wages. I'm not saying foreign VAs don't deserve pay and opportunity; I'm saying those looking for assistants should consider how best to support the HUMAN who needs the job.So, that being said, if you'd like to hire a virtual assistant, consider ALL virtual assistants, not just the ones you can pay next to nothing to do all your bitch work while you sleep. /endrant"
194,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5820202-koen-van-den-eeckhout,2,"Positive points: I strongly agree with some of the principles in this book, especially the Pareto principle and Parkinson's law, which can make your approach much more efficient.Neutral points: Ferriss uses a writing style balancing between motivational and arrogant, often crossing the line towards the latter. Nevertheless, it kinda fits the 'fuck it' theme of the book and easy to get used to. The book reads very quickly.Negative points: besides feeling outdated already (Blackberry? Yahoo shops?), Ferriss often crosses the line towards the downright unethical. Several pages on how to be widely regarded as an expert without being one, or marketing techniques which are pretty much illegal (e.g. selling items on eBay without having them)."
195,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602450-vladyslav-sitalo,3,"The style of the book is somewhat annoying but if you overcome this annoyance this book has something to share with you.--It's a fun fact that I've decided to read this book around the same time as Elon Musk's biography.And as both of the books is fresh in my mind, I can see two drastically different approaches to life from Elon and Tim.Tim is asking reader to dream big set impossible goals and than talks about buying a car or going to some nice place to live.From my perspective ""big"" is what Musk is doing - to transform car and space industries is big, to give humanity ability to travel to Mars is big, to minimize risks from superintelligent AI is big.Buying a Ferrari eh, it's kind of mediocre.I'm not saying that goal to buy Ferrari or live in constant travel or enjoying yourself in any other way is not a worthy goal, just saying that, well, it's not ""big"".It's happens to be true that my sentiments and goals is much more aligned with the Musk's vision. So this fact immediately questions the applicability of suggested techniques as THE way to achieve your goals if they are really big. (What would you set you month input goal if your actual goal is to go to the other planet (really really expensive) or achieve personal immortality (not technologically feasible right now, but it's plausible that it can be achievable in the nearest 50 years. And you can actually work on advancing scientific research/industry/public appreciation to make it feasible sooner then later)? )And so getting back to the comparison between Musk and Ferriss lifestyle - you can see big difference in them - you can probably characterize them as ""4 hour workweek"" vs ""4 hours to sleep"" or by goals ""go to Mars"" vs ""sip wine and play guitar with my amigos"".Do you have to adopt the work style similar to Musk's to achieve really big things? Well, I don't know, but Musk is succeeding and it is sensible to take him as an example at least to some extent.That said, I would admit that the lifestyle, proposed in the book is by all means more interesting and richer on life experience than your average one. Though, important thing to notice is that, unfortunately, this kind of lifestyle is not sustainable for majority of the population (you can tell this by simply looking how much people is employed as VA/outsources/etc for sustaining it for one person). Also despite described drawbacks this book contains a lot of great advice. For example - call to eliminate waste work and focus on the most efficient approaches is obviously applicable almost to everyone and everywhere (and the book provides you with recomendations and options on how to actually do that).I was always for elimination of unnecessary stuff/work/interruption. But Tim here is also talking about an information limitation. And I have to admit that I'm and informational addict in a way :). I don't read news, newspapers/magazines, I don't watch TV.But I totally into reading books, listening audiobooks/podcasts and reading interesting articles on the web. The book convinced me to limit time for email/social networks to two limited periods during the day. And i think it's a great practice. I've also become more picky regarding articles that I read.But, that said, constant learning and self education is one of the values that I practice and want to excel in. And you can't learn new things without getting info about them :).More on positive side:Facing your fears as a way to make a better decisions is really interesting technique.Tim is advocating lean approach to building business and it resonates with Lean Startup approach but applied to non-tech business which is interesting.He is questioning a lot of ""common sense"" assumptions and encouraging people to do this more often. I think that this approach can lead to better society in general.Also Tim briefly advocates ""choice-minimal"" lifestyle. Characteristic quote: ""Fast decisions preserve usable attention for what matters""I have this problem with choice anxiety - I just have to choose the best option, but I've been noticing and regarding this as a problem because I'm spending too much time focusing on minor decisions and I think there is better use for this time. The book do not address problem in depth but have a reference for ""The paradox of choice"" https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1... which I intend to read.Also I would recommend http://thewirecutter.com for people with similar problems as at least a partial solution that can eliminate/mitigate your choice anxiety for a lot of products.More on the downside besides the style:One thing that remained in my mind as bluntly stupid - house that just stays there, and guy is loosing money on it for some mysterious reason (it's not like it would take any amount of time to ask VA to rent it/find a good agency to work with).Tim is constantly overconfidently saying stuff about everything in the world. That's annoying, especially considering that what he is telling often is not entirely? True And he is almost never giving any quantifiable data to support his claims.Other thing Is confused thinking on some topics, for example thoughts on charity/service work. If you actually want to do some good (and not just feel good about yourself) look into https://80000hours.org/ project or http://www.givewell.org/."

Tips and tricks on how to trick your boss into thinking that you're putting in the agreed hours while actually outsourcing it all, really?It also feels a bit outdated, but that's hardly the books fault. There were a couple of more general productivity tips in here that are useful, but they are also present in books that specifically focus on that. Tip for my Dutch friends: just read Rick Pastoor's Grip for this section.I'm not going to tell other people that they shouldn't follow the ideas of Tim Ferriss, but I won't be joining his ""new rich"" movement."

What would excite you? Happiness? Excitement is the definition of happiness and boredom is the definition of unhappiness. Don’t work just for money for owning enviable things, follow your passion and do interesting things. Be unrealistic.“The future is here; It’s just not distributed yet”.-E is for elimination: Do first thing first, if you don’t have time you don’t have PRIORITIES. You have to define what you want to do with your time. Understand the Pareto principle “80 % of the outputs result from 20% of the inputs”. Be productive not just active, focus on what is important for you and neglect the tasks which do not take you closer to your goals, do not multitask, learn to propose don’t let others influence your decisions, cultivate selective ignorance “knowledge is power but knowledge without action are useless”, practice the art of nonfinishing and the art of refusal. Protect yourself from people who waste your time. “Reading, after a certain age, diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking.”-A is for automation: * HIRE AN ASSISTANT: Lingering unimportant tasks will disappear as soon as someone else is being paid to do them. Free your time to focus on bigger and better things. “Nobody can give you freedom. Nobody can give you equality or justice or anything. If you're a man, you take it.”*FIND THE MUSE: Find a market, define your customers then find or develop a product for them.*TEST THE MUSE: Micro-testing your products involves using inexpensive advertisements to test consumer response to a product prior to manufacturing.*MBA MANAGEMENT BY ABSENCE: Once you have a product that sells, it’s time to design a self-correcting business architecture that runs itself.“The power of hiding ourselves from one another is mercifully given, for men are wild beasts, and would devour one another but for this protection.”-L is for liberation: “It is far better for a man to go wrong in freedom than to go right in chains.”* ESCAPE THE OFFICE (Create an opportunity to demonstrate remote work productivity before asking for it as a policy. This is to test your ability to work outside of an office environment and rack up some proof that you can kick ass without constant supervision).*KILL YOUR JOB: Are you more likely to find what you want in your current job or somewhere else?*MINI-RETIREMENTS: EMBRACING THE MOBILE LIFESTYLE“Before the development of tourism, travel was conceived to be like study, and its fruits were considered to be the adornment of the mind and the formation of the judgment.”*FILLING THE VOID: Adding Life After Subtracting Work“To be engrossed by something outside ourselves is a powerful antidote for the rational mind, the mind that so frequently has its head up its own ass.”"
201,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16366211-ro,5,"What I like about this book is that it introduces a lot of new concepts for me - for a better (work) life, while also challenges my existing concepts on (work) life.I am particularly intrigued by the New Rich concept that defines “riches” not in having millions or billions, but more on the use of one’s time / having time freedom. “Those who abandon the deferred-life plan and create luxury lifestyles in the present using the currency of the New Rich: time and mobility.”While it would help to have millions and billions, often we are trapped in this rut of wanting more and pushing off “living in the moment” until we believe we have enough. And you guessed it, that day of having enough, never comes (unless you have a mindset shift). The most mind blowing thing is that the author shows how everyday ordinary people can & do have the means to live luxuriously but are held back by their limiting beliefs that they need to have more, work harder and join the millions and billions club.The author introduces several business models, tips tricks and tools that you can use to “eliminate” and “automate” your work - to free up your time; something you can immediately apply into your (work) life if you wish. 	i.e. 80/20 Pareto’s law According to the 80/20 rule: 80% of results are from 20% of action80% of outputs are from 20% of inputs80% of consequences are from 20% of the causes 80% of profits are from 20% of products and customers A practical use of the 80/20 rule is to ask yourself: 1. Which 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness?2. Which 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness? The book further highlights on our insistent need to “be productive"", which only leads us to fill our time with xx just to “feel productive”. If we reassess our daily to-do list and eliminate all the unnecessary time fillers, we can free up our time to do productive fulfilling things - things we truly enjoy.For example, the “mini retirement” concept talks about how instead of saving up our entire life’s savings to spend when we retire, why not use that money throughout your life and have what the author calls “mini retirements”. This way, you can truly enjoy life while you are young and in your prime, rather than wait until the time is right, which again may never happen. This definitely challenges my personal limiting belief - as I am one of those people who likes to wait until it’s the right time. The book ends by touching on some psychology and self help (my favorite topic) - that even after achieving the “4 hour work week” and have all the time in the world to do what you truly enjoy. Don’t expect all life challenges to just disappear. It is not easy to just ""wind down and enjoy”. Hence why being rich and depressed, successful and depressed are all too familiar. “Man is so made that he can only find relaxation from one kind of labor by taking up another” - Anatole FranceYou cannot just transition overnight from being a goal oriented high-performer to appreciating life in the moment. Although it is not impossible to do both, unraveling such habits take time - just like anything else in life; “leaning to replace the perception of time famine with the appreciation for time abundance is like going from triple espresso to decaf”.Recognizing this is the first step.Appreciating time abundance and living in the present doesn’t mean we should just sit on our butts and do nothing either. According to some of the most fulfilled people interviewed for the book’s case studies: 1. continual learning2. serviceare two commons factors for a fulfilled life. And I absolutely agree, I find my life the most meaningful when I’m continuously learning and can be of service to the world. I like that this book falls not only into the genre of business and entrepreneurship but also philosophy, psychology and self-help - which I think are intricately linked. In order to be well-informed, you need to be able to evaluate things from different perspective.Most of what is said in this book is no new news. I believe most of us are already familiar with the idea that we should enjoy life and live life in the moment but through seeing it from the author’s lens, the author’s way of getting things across that help sharpens my vague understanding of things - and honed down the messages for me even more. Definitely a good read on my list!Edit: I’m surprised this book receives a lot of negative reviews - mostly from people questioning Ferriss’s ego, and his “unethical” ways of doing businesses such as outsourcing help from virtual assistants in third world countries, who charge less.I did feel put off reading it because I had read these negative reviews prior to starting, but I’m glad I gave it a go anyway because I still learned a lot from the book and did not share the same negative sentiments towards Ferriss.I didn’t see this book as a guide on how to get rich quick etc, but rather more like an introduction to a lifestyle different from the accepted norm and more like a motivational tool / insights into Ferriss and others’ success stories. And not to defend Ferriss (although that is probably exactly what I am doing) - there is no need to be holier-than-thou. I don’t think the author is recommending us to take advantage of cheaper labour in poorer countries but rather how money can go further there, hence why they charge less.I am not sure if it’s fair to compare hiring virtual assistants in third world countries who charge less - to slave labors or garment workers for example. Yes, the rate is lower than developed countries but the overall expenses are lower too.Plus it's a question about the whole system we are inMoral contradiction / ethical dilemma There is a section in the book that addresses exactly this: Service for the right reasons: to save the whales or kill them and feed the children?“Service to me is simple: doing something that improves life besides your own.This is not the same as philanthropy. Philanthropy is the altruistic concern for the well-being of mankind–human life. Human life and comfort have long been focused on to the exclusion of the environment and the rest of the food chain, hence our current race to imminent extinction. Serves us right. The world does not exist solely for the betterment and multiplication of mankind.Before I start chaining myself to trees and saving the dart frogs, though, I should take my own advice: do not become a cause snob.How can you help starving children in Africa when there are starving children in Los Angeles? How can you save the whales when homeless people are freezing to death? How does doing volunteer research on coral destruction help those people who need help now?”Children, please. Everything out there needs help, so don’t get baited into “my cause can beat up your cause” arguments with no right answer. There are no qualitative or quantitative comparisons that make sense. The truth is this: those thousands of lives you save could contribute to a famine that kills millions, or that one bush in Bolivia that you protect could hold the cure for cancer. The downstream effects are unknown. Do your best and hope for the best. If you’re improving the world–however you define that–consider your job well done.Service isn’t limited to saving lives or the environment. It can also improve life. If you are a musician and put a smile on the faces of thousands or millions, I view that as service. If you are a mentor and change the life of one child for the better, the world has been improved. Improving the quality of life in the world is in no fashion inferior to adding more lives.”Service is an attitude.”"
202,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39587412-enrique-ma-as,5,"The first word that comes into my mind to tag this book is: inspiring.But let's elaborate. Timothy Ferriss comes from a different background: after selling his first company for a bunch of billions, we jump into a digital nomad lifestyle. He considers that his decisions are extendable to the middle-class and the people working 9-17, and addressing this he fails miserably. Is two different rivers with different water. But there is however a lot of important information and philosophies we can extract from this book.Timothy dedicates an important part of his book to talk about Virtual Assistants and popular places to hire them. This is a useful information to start with, but most of the rules we later on talks about are about common sense (do provide them with clear orders, leave everything written, give them freedom to expend money until certain amount...). Many of the websites and ideas about reselling are useful and not that well known.The book in general challenges you to move out from your comfort zone and take risks, which is by itself a vary valuable reason. ""The 4-hour workweek"" title is misleading, since as Tim himself recognizes is not about the money you have earned, but about the freedom you now have and the mobility worldwide. If I would be a boss with responsibility over other people, I would be worried if many of them were reading it. I actually quit my job before finishing it.As a side note: Tim writing's style is very selfish and self-centered. But that does not mean a star less for me"
203,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/747419-jason,3,"So far, not yet having finished this book, it seems like he created it for those who are: 1. in the sales of PRODUCTS industry, and 2. of those people, for those who are in a management/ownership position. For those who are in a service-oriented industry, his tactics do not seem to apply. Some of his tips do have merit however, such as keeping distractions to a minimum by only checking email and phone messages sparingly and delegating smaller tasks not absolutely necessary to other people to better utilize ones time on priorities. We will see if there is more to his book after I'm finished though before I give my final rating.After reading it, I think that I'm still in the same mindset as before. It was written seemingly for those who do not like their job. For those of us who were lucky enough to choose a profession that we actually enjoy, this is probably not the quintessential book of choice. It is packed with situations that are 99% ""not going to happen,"" such as the ""ask your boss if you can just work from home"" scenario. If I were to even try to ask my boss about that, he would just say ""I don't think so"" before 10 words were out of my mouth. The latter half of the book DID make me want to travel more, but the very end just seemed a bit preachy. All in all, I could see how this could possibly be inspiring to some, but not to most."

I needed to be reminded of that.....Why I wanted to give it 5 stars - because I am re-entering the workforce after many years and I got caught up in the hype ""I know everything you need to be successful! This is wonderful! And this is wonderful! And you will not be fulfilled if you don't do all of these wonderful things!!"" But then I realized I am the fisherman in Ferriss's book. I have a very strong sense of community and family and I don't need to outsource my whole life to love my life. Do I want to go to the Azore Islands and reconnect with family and do family history? I do. And thanks to this book I will make it a goal. However, I will not cut corners, look for loopholes or be unethical to do so. Enter the 2 stars. Nor do I need to travel the world to live a fulfilling life. I have everything I need right here. The love of my life, a church community, a roof over my head, the sun that shines 300 days a year, dear friends, loving family, a career that reimburses me for good work, and a hobby that brings me joy.

This book is what made me dare to defy what was conventional and expected.To dream about finding a job with purpose, and living life on my terms. It is a game-changer - and still has the potential to be.It is not a definitive guide of any sort. But it is an invitation to explore. An invitation to think about what are your values (is it travel? is it to spend time with your family? work with something you love?) and rehearse worst-case scenarios.And, most importantly: to dream and try and live the ""best-case"" scenarios.For me, the truth is this: this book changes lives.

It feels like a spiritual relative of Sebastian Marshall's Ikigai --- reading this book will have you spending a lot of time pondering ""hmm, what kind of life do I really want to live?"" The answer for most people I've talked to is ""not like this,"" but the fear gets in the way.This is a good book about getting over the fear. It's got helpful little exercises for comfort zone expansion, tactics for dealing with bureaucrats, strategies for building prestige, and lots more. And a lot of prompts for trying to figure out what you'd rather be doing, and for figuring out how to get there from here.The gist of all of it is that people don't really want to be millionaires, they want to have what they assume is the millionaire lifestyle. So computer how much money per day you'd actually need in order to live how you'd like, and then work towards that number. Waiting to live until you're too old to appreciate it is a crap strategy."

Some parts (especially the last third) were really interesting to me, but other parts definitely weren't.It think it's one of those kind of books that you shouldn't read every sentence from, but jump from chapter to chapter based on what is interesting to you. I don't know if I have OCD or what, but I'm definitely incapable of doing that, I need to read every last bit, which is probably why it took me so long to finish it and I found some parts difficult to read.That being said, I totally understand how it can change life, and maybe it's going to help me get the push and the motivation to look for another way to earn income and travel around the world!

I like being efficient, so I especially enjoyed his chapter on Automation, and I can easily see how to apply it to my own business.Tim Ferris will teach you how to work remotely, how to cut 50% of your work load, and how to live your life to the fullest. He provides solid resources for each chapter, and his ideas are all workable. I think some of his methods are a bit sketchy though. I'm not the kind of person to 'scam a system'.

Most of the 'mobility' tips do not apply in my case, since I happen to live AND earn in one of those 'ridiculously cheap' countries.There was no little escaping from this book. Since I have a work/ organisation/ near burnout crisis each year in June (comes with the territory), I tend to google for tips and motivation, and The 4-Hour Work Week reached me in small, irritating snippets. 1. The principles seemed tempting, but unenforceable in my profession, as evidenced by numerous comments on the irrelevance of the Pareto Principle in education. You just have to put in the hours, even if you do that by Skype; most of the valid exams need to take place in teacher's presence; you can't tell 80% of your students to just get lost; on most levels of education, 'automation' such as peer assessment simply doesn't work (on others, it can be used, but will not replace teacher's assessment). The ugly: some issues just can't be dealt with ""intensively"" - as evidenced by joking, but telling questions on the author's on the release date of The 4-hour Baby.The good: Ferriss' elimination tips are quite inspiring even to non entrepreneurs. They're good reminders to not increase one's workload automatically and unreflexively, as teachers often do. In the words of Anne Taintor:http://s30.postimg.org/f5qt0jw5t/magn...I decided to implement some of the ideas I previously had that would make students more responsible for their learning and material preparation (with me interfering and supplementing whatever information they might have left out, that is). I also thought I might revise class rules as a set of basic rules + Frequently Asked Questions in an attempt to make them more independent. 2. Something about the approach to work this books represents seems, frankly speaking, immoral to me, and not just me. This piece by Penelope Trunk is a classic by now: http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2009/01...This piece by Jennifer Dziura https://medium.com/get-bullish/a5e5f4... is much more recent and contains a sentence that says it all:If you seem to be “getting everything you want,” you should probably examine whether you’re getting it at someone’s expense, or whether you’re just constantly, in small ways, making the world worse.3. When I was a kid, I read and anthology of science fiction stories, including a story (I can't recall the title) about a society of the future in which people removed the obstacle of the decision making process (the decisions in it are taken instantly, which results in living an equivalent of an action-packed lifetime in just one night. Tim Ferriss reminds me of the protagonist, as his aim seems to be to live as many lives as possible in one lifetime. Somewhat unsurprisingly, I remember his blog post about his panic attacks (which I can't locate now), which somehow makes sense. To be fair, he also urges the reader to slow down and savour life, but somehow hmm.The (completely unexpected) good:- 'It is vain to do with more what can be done with less."" - William of Ockham; not a a bad motto to work by.- I was surprised by his stress on do-gooding, volunteering and making donations.- Dreamlining - I was surprised by how much my dreams are time-dependent instead of money-dependent.Now, I think, time to read this, for balance: In Praise of Slowness: Challenging the Cult of Speed"

I'm not sure how useful most of it will be to me, but it sure makes me dream about what *could* be. ""If only I had an idea for a business...""Mr. Ferriss not only provides philosophical and psychological reasons for getting your employer to let you work at home, but he talks about how to set up your own business that requires minimal interaction and will be able to support you as you live in different countries.I had only two problems with this book:1) While Mr. Ferriss rightly disparages working your ass off so you can enjoy your retirement (referring to it as ""deferred life""), he does seem to make the assumption that you'll be able to alternate work and ""mini-retirements"" forever. Frankly, I'm guessing that when I'm 75, I'm not going to be terribly effective at working at all. I'm disappointed by his lack of consideration for care during my waning years. Maybe he's a proponent of ice floes?2) Tim Ferriss's biggest fan is Tim Ferriss. It was a bit unseemly how often he talked about how great he was. I understand that he's trying to convince us that if he could do it, we could too, but I'm tired of hearing about how he won a tango competition, dined at 5-star restaurants, or practices martial arts. If his personality in real life is anything like he comes across in the book, I suspect that I wouldn't get a word in edgewise if we were hanging out.Ok, bonus problem: He uses the term ""muse"" to refer to ""an automated vehicle for generating cash without consuming time"". Every time he uses it, it's jarring, because I know what the term actually means.Anyway, those faults aside, this book contained tons of great information for entrepreneurs and people who are looking to cut loose from the daily grind. Lots of great information here. Highly recommended for anyone who has ever had dreams of doing something different with their work life."
217,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28646-bryan,4,"I had been reluctant to read this as I assumed it was written by a spoiled and out-of-touch entrepreneur. Recently, however, a friend pointed out to me that an author I liked had been on Ferris' podcast. I listened and enjoyed the conversation they had. I continued listening to subsequent episodes, and decided that in spite of my irrational prejudice, I was starting to like him more and more. This book is a bit dated now, and does in places come off as brash and irritating, yet it's quite positive and an open challenge to live life on one's own terms. As a result it's inspirational, and it gives some insight into how differently people can think about risks and resources. In certain ways I wish I'd read it earlier, as it would likely have saved me a few years spent obeying societal dictates in a career to which I was not particularly suited. But I think without the good impression left by the compassionate and sometimes fascinating interviews Ferris does on his podcast, I might have been less receptive to the book's tone."
218,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18908489-alexander-svanevik,4,"Hard to rate.No doubt, this book has had a huge impact on many people's lives. I personally know people who have basically changed their entire lifestyle after reading Tim Ferriss' book.I read it in Spanish, so I won't comment on the language.Stating the obvious, the title doesn't really deliver on its promise. However, that doesn't mean there isn't plenty of practical advice on how to question (and perhaps improve) your own lifestyle.The hardest part for me to swallow is the total inconsideration of other people that Ferriss has. Waste other people's time so you can save yours? Go for it. The world simply wouldn't work if everyone acted according to Ferriss' advise.The strongest parts of the book are 1) the focus on essentialism, and 2) the questions the author asks you to ask yourself, and the exercises he recommends.All in all, this is a modern classic packed with practical advise which is worth the read. But please take the advise with a pinch of salt."

220,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/557179-jocelyn-bailey,3,"My bizarre love affair with business and self-help books continues! The first time I saw this book, it lay on the desk of a ridiculous person who somehow clearly hated working but also made his life much, much harder by attempting to do everyone else’s jobs in addition to his own. Maybe he really did need this book. But as far as I know, he continued to micromanage everyone despite this book’s best takeaway being the “art” of delegation. I decided to download the audio of this book after listening to the BY THE BOOK episodes about it. I’ve had a rough time staying on top of my work lately and hoped maybe I could get a helpful word or two about getting things done. Boy did I get a word. 4-HOUR WW is equal parts ridiculous, genius, and unintentionally entertaining. The audiobook reader’s voice stressed me out beyond belief, but I loved it. Useful aspects of this book include the discussion of Parkinson’s Law (absolutely true), the 80/20 rule, the time-suckage of email, and generally useful points about the kinds of customers that aren’t worth having. There is some wisdom here. But ultimately, most working people—whether small business owners or corporate employees like me—cannot take most of these steps and wouldn’t have the means to do so anyway. That many people take actual satisfaction in their work and that many employers view their employees as more than human drones are truths completely glossed over. And it should go without saying that if everyone approached their work life this way, then capitalism would fail faster than a speeding bullet. Wait a minute...Is capitalism a Ponzi scheme?This book also got weirdly existential in the end, but I’ll leave that one mostly alone. I didn’t really sign up to get “meaning of life” advice from Tim Ferriss, kickboxing “expert” and meditation extraordinaire; but I suppose if you’re willing to take and leave parts of this book (which I clearly am), it’s not a bad thing to be reminded that you are more than the job you do. This book has no balance whatsoever, but whatever. I laughed a lot while listening and putting together my patio furniture. And maybe I will try to check email fewer times during the day."
221,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41350064-juli-hoffman,5,"This book does NOT teach you how to be a millionaire. If you're looking for THAT book, keep walking. This book DOES teach that wealth isn't all about money, it's about creating time to do the things you love. There's an example of a fisherman in this book. He doesn't have much in the way of material things, but every day he gets to hang out with his friends and family. He fishes a little. He takes an afternoon nap with his wife. He plays in a band in the evening. He's living like he's retired while he's young enough to enjoy it. This man is NOT a millionaire, but he's rich in the things that matter. This is the ""New Rich."" They are everyday people who are getting out of their comfort zones in order to enjoy life NOW, rather than waiting until the end of their days.I took away a lot of good ideas from this book and it did give me the courage to try some new things in my own career. A few years ago, My husband and I took a step back from the workoholic path. We don't make as much money as before, but our quality of life is much better. For years I've been playing around with some ideas to bring a little passive income into our household. This book gave me the courage to pursue this goal. Will I succeed? I have no idea! I do know that I'd rather live for experiences, time with the people I love, rather than killing myself trying to earn enough money to buy more things.Thanks, Tm Ferriss, for sharing your journey!"
222,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42182887-sipho,3,"This contemporary classic is a manifesto for lifestyle design. The thesis is simple: you can live like a millionaire, without actually being one. The 4 Hour Work Weeks touches on a variety of topics including automation, offshoring, delegation, minimalism and productivity. Key Takeaways  Definitions The New Rich have a different mindset to the typical employee or business owner. The New Rich: - have others work for them - distribute recovery periods and adventures (mini-retirements) throughout life - recognize that inactivity is not the goal and instead prioritise doing what excites them - focus on establishing a steady cash flow first, and then a big payday later.Everything popular is wrongRetirement is worst-case scenario insurance. Interest and energy are cyclical - alternate between work and rest. Doing less is not being lazy. The New Rich measure their contribution in results, not time. Laziness isn’t working less; laziness is letting circumstances define your life for you. The timing is never right. Whatever you want to do someday, just do it now. Ask for forgiveness, not permission. Emphasize your strengths, don’t fix weaknesses - this often provides a multiplier effect, while trying to fix weaknesses typically leads to only incremental improvement.Money alone is not the solution but relative income is more important than absolute income. Relative income measures both time and money. A person working 10 hours a week and making $10,000 is richer than someone working 80 hours a week and making $100,000. Embrace good stress instead of avoiding stress altogether.Most people are convinced they can only accomplish mediocre things. There is therefore more competition for mediocre goals. Elimination 80% of results come from 20% of actions. Ask yourself the following questions what 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness and what 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness?Be difficult when it matters - eg when it comes to protecting your productivity. Automation Build up a solid weekly income, independent of your day job:Step 1: Pick a reachable niche market. Find a market by defining your customers, and then designing your product around them. Preferably you must be a member of said market. Step 2: Brainstorm products whose benefit can be explained in one sentence or phrase. - The product should be expensive enough to sell fewer units, create higher profit margins, and attract lower-maintenance customers – but not so expensive that customers want to speak with you before buying. - The product should take less than 4 weeks to manufacture - The product should be fully explainable in an online FAQ. The easiest type of product to create is an information product – low-cost, fast to manufacture, and time-consuming for competitors to duplicate. If you read the top three books on a given subject, you’ll know more about the subject than 80% of the relevant population, thereby qualifying you as an expert. The person with the highest credibility will sell the most, not the person who knows the most about the subject. To establish credibility:1) Join 2 or 3 trade associations with official-sounding names.2) Read the 3 top-selling books on the topic and write a one-page summary of each.3) Go to the closest university, put up posters advertising a free seminar on the subject, and give the seminar using the summaries you’ve written.4) Call up a local branch of a well-known company and tell them you’ve done the seminars at the university and that you’re a member of the trade associations. Explain that you’re trying to gain speaking experience outside of the academic setting.5) Leverage your trade association membership and speaking experience to get an article published for a trade magazine. The only way to test if anyone actually wants your product is to ask people to buy it. Create a basic one-to-three-page website, put up a Google AdWords advertisement and use the response to test whether people will buy.  Liberation A 5 step process for getting your employer to let you work from home permanently:1. Increase investment - get your employer to first invest in you to increase their cost if you leave. For example, ask if the firm has any additional trainings available to employees and take them.2. Prove increased output offsite - call off sick for two days in the middle of the week, double your work output on both days, and make sure to demonstrate and record it with an email trail. 3. Show the business benefit - position remote working as a business benefit, not a personal perk. Bill more client time, complete more projects, or otherwise demonstrate quantified improvement. Explain the increased productivity as less time commuting and fewer distractions. 4. Propose a trial period - Informally mention to your boss how you were sick those two days and didn’t expect to get anything done, but were actually twice as productive. Ask if you could try working from home for 2 days in the next two weeks. When your boss objects, acknowledge his concerns and propose working from home only one day a week instead. 5. Expand remote time - Continue to excel on your work-from-home days and drop your in-office performance to heighten the contrast. Ask for another trial period with an extra two days at home. After your boss has gotten used to this, ask for a full-time remote trial of 2 weeks. Conclusion There are as many gems in this book as there is questionable advice. I am not too sure about Ferris' idea to essentially automate your life through offshoring daily tasks. This seems to be going too far. I was also particularly irritated by the fact that he highlights ""most countries in Africa"" as not ideal locations to travel to and work from because of the risk of kidnapping and terrorism. Seriously? Those 2 sentences near the end of the book pretty much ruined the rest of it for me, and thus 3 stars.That said, the chapters on Income Automation and productivity are well worth reading as these are the most practical I think I have read in any work. Other than that...meh."
223,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65849150-kelsey,3,"The extended edition is recommended as it updates many of the author's early ideas with more recently relevant tools and tips (original text released in 2009). Be warned, the audiobook is fine overall, but because lots of chapters list resources and websites parenthetically in the middle of a sentence or idea, you'll often find yourself repeatedly being read the ""www dot so-and-so dot com forward-slash home forward-slash news forward-slash whatever dot html"". Also, keep in mind that some of the tools the author mentions, while useful, may have been made obsolete when compared to some other things we have that we didn't commonly use in 2009 (like cloud computing versus working locally) or more efficient products have perhaps been released. Overall, good ideas and a recommended read for anyone who runs their own side hustle or fledgling business.As someone who does virtual assisting, I was disappointed about how much Ferriss underscored the perks of having a VA from India or another far off land. While differences of time zone (you can send off tasks at the end of the day and wake to find them completed) and spend (you often pay less than US standard wages for the same work) may be beneficial to an entrepreneur, I think this sort of thinking is dangerous to tout as THE way to succeed while delegating work. VAs come in all shapes, sizes, and skillsets, and opting to only hire non-domestic VAs with cost as a primary driver undermines the quality work that can be done by anyone ANYWHERE. If they're remote, why do they need to be in India? From Ferriss' telling, it seems cost is the only thing that really drives that desire, and I find that disappointing. It's like telling an artist you can buy the same thing at Walmart for $15...it undermines the craft and good work that anyone can do and comes off as a bit tone deaf and opportunistic in a world where Americans know that off-shore labor is often cheaper because it doesn't actually meet the needs of the worker being paid low wages. I'm not saying foreign VAs don't deserve pay and opportunity; I'm saying those looking for assistants should consider how best to support the HUMAN who needs the job.So, that being said, if you'd like to hire a virtual assistant, consider ALL virtual assistants, not just the ones you can pay next to nothing to do all your bitch work while you sleep. /endrant"
224,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5820202-koen-van-den-eeckhout,2,"Positive points: I strongly agree with some of the principles in this book, especially the Pareto principle and Parkinson's law, which can make your approach much more efficient.Neutral points: Ferriss uses a writing style balancing between motivational and arrogant, often crossing the line towards the latter. Nevertheless, it kinda fits the 'fuck it' theme of the book and easy to get used to. The book reads very quickly.Negative points: besides feeling outdated already (Blackberry? Yahoo shops?), Ferriss often crosses the line towards the downright unethical. Several pages on how to be widely regarded as an expert without being one, or marketing techniques which are pretty much illegal (e.g. selling items on eBay without having them)."
225,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602450-vladyslav-sitalo,3,"The style of the book is somewhat annoying but if you overcome this annoyance this book has something to share with you.--It's a fun fact that I've decided to read this book around the same time as Elon Musk's biography.And as both of the books is fresh in my mind, I can see two drastically different approaches to life from Elon and Tim.Tim is asking reader to dream big set impossible goals and than talks about buying a car or going to some nice place to live.From my perspective ""big"" is what Musk is doing - to transform car and space industries is big, to give humanity ability to travel to Mars is big, to minimize risks from superintelligent AI is big.Buying a Ferrari eh, it's kind of mediocre.I'm not saying that goal to buy Ferrari or live in constant travel or enjoying yourself in any other way is not a worthy goal, just saying that, well, it's not ""big"".It's happens to be true that my sentiments and goals is much more aligned with the Musk's vision. So this fact immediately questions the applicability of suggested techniques as THE way to achieve your goals if they are really big. (What would you set you month input goal if your actual goal is to go to the other planet (really really expensive) or achieve personal immortality (not technologically feasible right now, but it's plausible that it can be achievable in the nearest 50 years. And you can actually work on advancing scientific research/industry/public appreciation to make it feasible sooner then later)? )And so getting back to the comparison between Musk and Ferriss lifestyle - you can see big difference in them - you can probably characterize them as ""4 hour workweek"" vs ""4 hours to sleep"" or by goals ""go to Mars"" vs ""sip wine and play guitar with my amigos"".Do you have to adopt the work style similar to Musk's to achieve really big things? Well, I don't know, but Musk is succeeding and it is sensible to take him as an example at least to some extent.That said, I would admit that the lifestyle, proposed in the book is by all means more interesting and richer on life experience than your average one. Though, important thing to notice is that, unfortunately, this kind of lifestyle is not sustainable for majority of the population (you can tell this by simply looking how much people is employed as VA/outsources/etc for sustaining it for one person). Also despite described drawbacks this book contains a lot of great advice. For example - call to eliminate waste work and focus on the most efficient approaches is obviously applicable almost to everyone and everywhere (and the book provides you with recomendations and options on how to actually do that).I was always for elimination of unnecessary stuff/work/interruption. But Tim here is also talking about an information limitation. And I have to admit that I'm and informational addict in a way :). I don't read news, newspapers/magazines, I don't watch TV.But I totally into reading books, listening audiobooks/podcasts and reading interesting articles on the web. The book convinced me to limit time for email/social networks to two limited periods during the day. And i think it's a great practice. I've also become more picky regarding articles that I read.But, that said, constant learning and self education is one of the values that I practice and want to excel in. And you can't learn new things without getting info about them :).More on positive side:Facing your fears as a way to make a better decisions is really interesting technique.Tim is advocating lean approach to building business and it resonates with Lean Startup approach but applied to non-tech business which is interesting.He is questioning a lot of ""common sense"" assumptions and encouraging people to do this more often. I think that this approach can lead to better society in general.Also Tim briefly advocates ""choice-minimal"" lifestyle. Characteristic quote: ""Fast decisions preserve usable attention for what matters""I have this problem with choice anxiety - I just have to choose the best option, but I've been noticing and regarding this as a problem because I'm spending too much time focusing on minor decisions and I think there is better use for this time. The book do not address problem in depth but have a reference for ""The paradox of choice"" https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1... which I intend to read.Also I would recommend http://thewirecutter.com for people with similar problems as at least a partial solution that can eliminate/mitigate your choice anxiety for a lot of products.More on the downside besides the style:One thing that remained in my mind as bluntly stupid - house that just stays there, and guy is loosing money on it for some mysterious reason (it's not like it would take any amount of time to ask VA to rent it/find a good agency to work with).Tim is constantly overconfidently saying stuff about everything in the world. That's annoying, especially considering that what he is telling often is not entirely? True And he is almost never giving any quantifiable data to support his claims.Other thing Is confused thinking on some topics, for example thoughts on charity/service work. If you actually want to do some good (and not just feel good about yourself) look into https://80000hours.org/ project or http://www.givewell.org/."

231,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16366211-ro,5,"What I like about this book is that it introduces a lot of new concepts for me - for a better (work) life, while also challenges my existing concepts on (work) life.I am particularly intrigued by the New Rich concept that defines “riches” not in having millions or billions, but more on the use of one’s time / having time freedom. “Those who abandon the deferred-life plan and create luxury lifestyles in the present using the currency of the New Rich: time and mobility.”While it would help to have millions and billions, often we are trapped in this rut of wanting more and pushing off “living in the moment” until we believe we have enough. And you guessed it, that day of having enough, never comes (unless you have a mindset shift). The most mind blowing thing is that the author shows how everyday ordinary people can & do have the means to live luxuriously but are held back by their limiting beliefs that they need to have more, work harder and join the millions and billions club.The author introduces several business models, tips tricks and tools that you can use to “eliminate” and “automate” your work - to free up your time; something you can immediately apply into your (work) life if you wish. 	i.e. 80/20 Pareto’s law According to the 80/20 rule: 80% of results are from 20% of action80% of outputs are from 20% of inputs80% of consequences are from 20% of the causes 80% of profits are from 20% of products and customers A practical use of the 80/20 rule is to ask yourself: 1. Which 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness?2. Which 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness? The book further highlights on our insistent need to “be productive"", which only leads us to fill our time with xx just to “feel productive”. If we reassess our daily to-do list and eliminate all the unnecessary time fillers, we can free up our time to do productive fulfilling things - things we truly enjoy.For example, the “mini retirement” concept talks about how instead of saving up our entire life’s savings to spend when we retire, why not use that money throughout your life and have what the author calls “mini retirements”. This way, you can truly enjoy life while you are young and in your prime, rather than wait until the time is right, which again may never happen. This definitely challenges my personal limiting belief - as I am one of those people who likes to wait until it’s the right time. The book ends by touching on some psychology and self help (my favorite topic) - that even after achieving the “4 hour work week” and have all the time in the world to do what you truly enjoy. Don’t expect all life challenges to just disappear. It is not easy to just ""wind down and enjoy”. Hence why being rich and depressed, successful and depressed are all too familiar. “Man is so made that he can only find relaxation from one kind of labor by taking up another” - Anatole FranceYou cannot just transition overnight from being a goal oriented high-performer to appreciating life in the moment. Although it is not impossible to do both, unraveling such habits take time - just like anything else in life; “leaning to replace the perception of time famine with the appreciation for time abundance is like going from triple espresso to decaf”.Recognizing this is the first step.Appreciating time abundance and living in the present doesn’t mean we should just sit on our butts and do nothing either. According to some of the most fulfilled people interviewed for the book’s case studies: 1. continual learning2. serviceare two commons factors for a fulfilled life. And I absolutely agree, I find my life the most meaningful when I’m continuously learning and can be of service to the world. I like that this book falls not only into the genre of business and entrepreneurship but also philosophy, psychology and self-help - which I think are intricately linked. In order to be well-informed, you need to be able to evaluate things from different perspective.Most of what is said in this book is no new news. I believe most of us are already familiar with the idea that we should enjoy life and live life in the moment but through seeing it from the author’s lens, the author’s way of getting things across that help sharpens my vague understanding of things - and honed down the messages for me even more. Definitely a good read on my list!Edit: I’m surprised this book receives a lot of negative reviews - mostly from people questioning Ferriss’s ego, and his “unethical” ways of doing businesses such as outsourcing help from virtual assistants in third world countries, who charge less.I did feel put off reading it because I had read these negative reviews prior to starting, but I’m glad I gave it a go anyway because I still learned a lot from the book and did not share the same negative sentiments towards Ferriss.I didn’t see this book as a guide on how to get rich quick etc, but rather more like an introduction to a lifestyle different from the accepted norm and more like a motivational tool / insights into Ferriss and others’ success stories. And not to defend Ferriss (although that is probably exactly what I am doing) - there is no need to be holier-than-thou. I don’t think the author is recommending us to take advantage of cheaper labour in poorer countries but rather how money can go further there, hence why they charge less.I am not sure if it’s fair to compare hiring virtual assistants in third world countries who charge less - to slave labors or garment workers for example. Yes, the rate is lower than developed countries but the overall expenses are lower too.Plus it's a question about the whole system we are inMoral contradiction / ethical dilemma There is a section in the book that addresses exactly this: Service for the right reasons: to save the whales or kill them and feed the children?“Service to me is simple: doing something that improves life besides your own.This is not the same as philanthropy. Philanthropy is the altruistic concern for the well-being of mankind–human life. Human life and comfort have long been focused on to the exclusion of the environment and the rest of the food chain, hence our current race to imminent extinction. Serves us right. The world does not exist solely for the betterment and multiplication of mankind.Before I start chaining myself to trees and saving the dart frogs, though, I should take my own advice: do not become a cause snob.How can you help starving children in Africa when there are starving children in Los Angeles? How can you save the whales when homeless people are freezing to death? How does doing volunteer research on coral destruction help those people who need help now?”Children, please. Everything out there needs help, so don’t get baited into “my cause can beat up your cause” arguments with no right answer. There are no qualitative or quantitative comparisons that make sense. The truth is this: those thousands of lives you save could contribute to a famine that kills millions, or that one bush in Bolivia that you protect could hold the cure for cancer. The downstream effects are unknown. Do your best and hope for the best. If you’re improving the world–however you define that–consider your job well done.Service isn’t limited to saving lives or the environment. It can also improve life. If you are a musician and put a smile on the faces of thousands or millions, I view that as service. If you are a mentor and change the life of one child for the better, the world has been improved. Improving the quality of life in the world is in no fashion inferior to adding more lives.”Service is an attitude.”"
232,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39587412-enrique-ma-as,5,"The first word that comes into my mind to tag this book is: inspiring.But let's elaborate. Timothy Ferriss comes from a different background: after selling his first company for a bunch of billions, we jump into a digital nomad lifestyle. He considers that his decisions are extendable to the middle-class and the people working 9-17, and addressing this he fails miserably. Is two different rivers with different water. But there is however a lot of important information and philosophies we can extract from this book.Timothy dedicates an important part of his book to talk about Virtual Assistants and popular places to hire them. This is a useful information to start with, but most of the rules we later on talks about are about common sense (do provide them with clear orders, leave everything written, give them freedom to expend money until certain amount...). Many of the websites and ideas about reselling are useful and not that well known.The book in general challenges you to move out from your comfort zone and take risks, which is by itself a vary valuable reason. ""The 4-hour workweek"" title is misleading, since as Tim himself recognizes is not about the money you have earned, but about the freedom you now have and the mobility worldwide. If I would be a boss with responsibility over other people, I would be worried if many of them were reading it. I actually quit my job before finishing it.As a side note: Tim writing's style is very selfish and self-centered. But that does not mean a star less for me"
233,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/747419-jason,3,"So far, not yet having finished this book, it seems like he created it for those who are: 1. in the sales of PRODUCTS industry, and 2. of those people, for those who are in a management/ownership position. For those who are in a service-oriented industry, his tactics do not seem to apply. Some of his tips do have merit however, such as keeping distractions to a minimum by only checking email and phone messages sparingly and delegating smaller tasks not absolutely necessary to other people to better utilize ones time on priorities. We will see if there is more to his book after I'm finished though before I give my final rating.After reading it, I think that I'm still in the same mindset as before. It was written seemingly for those who do not like their job. For those of us who were lucky enough to choose a profession that we actually enjoy, this is probably not the quintessential book of choice. It is packed with situations that are 99% ""not going to happen,"" such as the ""ask your boss if you can just work from home"" scenario. If I were to even try to ask my boss about that, he would just say ""I don't think so"" before 10 words were out of my mouth. The latter half of the book DID make me want to travel more, but the very end just seemed a bit preachy. All in all, I could see how this could possibly be inspiring to some, but not to most."

I needed to be reminded of that.....Why I wanted to give it 5 stars - because I am re-entering the workforce after many years and I got caught up in the hype ""I know everything you need to be successful! This is wonderful! And this is wonderful! And you will not be fulfilled if you don't do all of these wonderful things!!"" But then I realized I am the fisherman in Ferriss's book. I have a very strong sense of community and family and I don't need to outsource my whole life to love my life. Do I want to go to the Azore Islands and reconnect with family and do family history? I do. And thanks to this book I will make it a goal. However, I will not cut corners, look for loopholes or be unethical to do so. Enter the 2 stars. Nor do I need to travel the world to live a fulfilling life. I have everything I need right here. The love of my life, a church community, a roof over my head, the sun that shines 300 days a year, dear friends, loving family, a career that reimburses me for good work, and a hobby that brings me joy.

It is not complete, definitive or anything like it.There are better books about all the finer points:— stoicism— minimalism— productivity— marketing— traveling the world.BUT.This one puts it all together. This book is what made me dare to defy what was conventional and expected.To dream about finding a job with purpose, and living life on my terms. It is a game-changer - and still has the potential to be.It is not a definitive guide of any sort. But it is an invitation to explore. An invitation to think about what are your values (is it travel? is it to spend time with your family? work with something you love?) and rehearse worst-case scenarios.And, most importantly: to dream and try and live the ""best-case"" scenarios.For me, the truth is this: this book changes lives. And that is why it is still a 5/5.P.S.: It is just appropriate to be writing these lines on a cold morning in Bratislava. At this moment, I am traveling with 3 friends, 2 of whom work remotely (just like me). By the end of the year, I will have spent over 100 days of 2019 traveling.

It feels like a spiritual relative of Sebastian Marshall's Ikigai --- reading this book will have you spending a lot of time pondering ""hmm, what kind of life do I really want to live?"" The answer for most people I've talked to is ""not like this,"" but the fear gets in the way.This is a good book about getting over the fear. It's got helpful little exercises for comfort zone expansion, tactics for dealing with bureaucrats, strategies for building prestige, and lots more. And a lot of prompts for trying to figure out what you'd rather be doing, and for figuring out how to get there from here.The gist of all of it is that people don't really want to be millionaires, they want to have what they assume is the millionaire lifestyle. So computer how much money per day you'd actually need in order to live how you'd like, and then work towards that number. Waiting to live until you're too old to appreciate it is a crap strategy."

Then a friend of mine recommended this book, but it took me 4 months to finish it! Some parts (especially the last third) were really interesting to me, but other parts definitely weren't.It think it's one of those kind of books that you shouldn't read every sentence from, but jump from chapter to chapter based on what is interesting to you. I don't know if I have OCD or what, but I'm definitely incapable of doing that, I need to read every last bit, which is probably why it took me so long to finish it and I found some parts difficult to read.That being said, I totally understand how it can change life, and maybe it's going to help me get the push and the motivation to look for another way to earn income and travel around the world!

I like being efficient, so I especially enjoyed his chapter on Automation, and I can easily see how to apply it to my own business.Tim Ferris will teach you how to work remotely, how to cut 50% of your work load, and how to live your life to the fullest. He provides solid resources for each chapter, and his ideas are all workable. I think some of his methods are a bit sketchy though. I'm not the kind of person to 'scam a system'. That's probably why I'll never be rich like Tim Ferris. But there are definitely some good takeaways from his book.It will definitely make you think. Read it."

245,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23066833-bloodorange,3,"Disclaimers:I skipped parts of the book that dealt with product development and automation, since these do not apply to my experience. Most of the 'mobility' tips do not apply in my case, since I happen to live AND earn in one of those 'ridiculously cheap' countries.There was no little escaping from this book. Since I have a work/ organisation/ near burnout crisis each year in June (comes with the territory), I tend to google for tips and motivation, and The 4-Hour Work Week reached me in small, irritating snippets. 1. The principles seemed tempting, but unenforceable in my profession, as evidenced by numerous comments on the irrelevance of the Pareto Principle in education. You just have to put in the hours, even if you do that by Skype; most of the valid exams need to take place in teacher's presence; you can't tell 80% of your students to just get lost; on most levels of education, 'automation' such as peer assessment simply doesn't work (on others, it can be used, but will not replace teacher's assessment). The ugly: some issues just can't be dealt with ""intensively"" - as evidenced by joking, but telling questions on the author's on the release date of The 4-hour Baby.The good: Ferriss' elimination tips are quite inspiring even to non entrepreneurs. They're good reminders to not increase one's workload automatically and unreflexively, as teachers often do. In the words of Anne Taintor:http://s30.postimg.org/f5qt0jw5t/magn...I decided to implement some of the ideas I previously had that would make students more responsible for their learning and material preparation (with me interfering and supplementing whatever information they might have left out, that is). I also thought I might revise class rules as a set of basic rules + Frequently Asked Questions in an attempt to make them more independent. 2. Something about the approach to work this books represents seems, frankly speaking, immoral to me, and not just me. This piece by Penelope Trunk is a classic by now: http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2009/01...This piece by Jennifer Dziura https://medium.com/get-bullish/a5e5f4... is much more recent and contains a sentence that says it all:If you seem to be “getting everything you want,” you should probably examine whether you’re getting it at someone’s expense, or whether you’re just constantly, in small ways, making the world worse.3. When I was a kid, I read and anthology of science fiction stories, including a story (I can't recall the title) about a society of the future in which people removed the obstacle of the decision making process (the decisions in it are taken instantly, which results in living an equivalent of an action-packed lifetime in just one night. Tim Ferriss reminds me of the protagonist, as his aim seems to be to live as many lives as possible in one lifetime. Somewhat unsurprisingly, I remember his blog post about his panic attacks (which I can't locate now), which somehow makes sense. To be fair, he also urges the reader to slow down and savour life, but somehow hmm.The (completely unexpected) good:- 'It is vain to do with more what can be done with less."" - William of Ockham; not a a bad motto to work by.- I was surprised by his stress on do-gooding, volunteering and making donations.- Dreamlining - I was surprised by how much my dreams are time-dependent instead of money-dependent.Now, I think, time to read this, for balance: In Praise of Slowness: Challenging the Cult of Speed"
246,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1957039-patrick,4,"So in reality, The 4-Hour Workweek is lifestyle porn for me. Tim Ferriss discusses real, practical strategies for cutting loose from the traditional working world, and living a lifestyle with less work, more time for important things, and the ability to travel the world.I liked this book quite a bit. I'm not sure how useful most of it will be to me, but it sure makes me dream about what *could* be. ""If only I had an idea for a business...""Mr. Ferriss not only provides philosophical and psychological reasons for getting your employer to let you work at home, but he talks about how to set up your own business that requires minimal interaction and will be able to support you as you live in different countries.I had only two problems with this book:1) While Mr. Ferriss rightly disparages working your ass off so you can enjoy your retirement (referring to it as ""deferred life""), he does seem to make the assumption that you'll be able to alternate work and ""mini-retirements"" forever. Frankly, I'm guessing that when I'm 75, I'm not going to be terribly effective at working at all. I'm disappointed by his lack of consideration for care during my waning years. Maybe he's a proponent of ice floes?2) Tim Ferriss's biggest fan is Tim Ferriss. It was a bit unseemly how often he talked about how great he was. I understand that he's trying to convince us that if he could do it, we could too, but I'm tired of hearing about how he won a tango competition, dined at 5-star restaurants, or practices martial arts. If his personality in real life is anything like he comes across in the book, I suspect that I wouldn't get a word in edgewise if we were hanging out.Ok, bonus problem: He uses the term ""muse"" to refer to ""an automated vehicle for generating cash without consuming time"". Every time he uses it, it's jarring, because I know what the term actually means.Anyway, those faults aside, this book contained tons of great information for entrepreneurs and people who are looking to cut loose from the daily grind. Lots of great information here. Highly recommended for anyone who has ever had dreams of doing something different with their work life."
247,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28646-bryan,4,"I had been reluctant to read this as I assumed it was written by a spoiled and out-of-touch entrepreneur. Recently, however, a friend pointed out to me that an author I liked had been on Ferris' podcast. I listened and enjoyed the conversation they had. I continued listening to subsequent episodes, and decided that in spite of my irrational prejudice, I was starting to like him more and more. This book is a bit dated now, and does in places come off as brash and irritating, yet it's quite positive and an open challenge to live life on one's own terms. As a result it's inspirational, and it gives some insight into how differently people can think about risks and resources. In certain ways I wish I'd read it earlier, as it would likely have saved me a few years spent obeying societal dictates in a career to which I was not particularly suited. But I think without the good impression left by the compassionate and sometimes fascinating interviews Ferris does on his podcast, I might have been less receptive to the book's tone."

I personally know people who have basically changed their entire lifestyle after reading Tim Ferriss' book.I read it in Spanish, so I won't comment on the language.Stating the obvious, the title doesn't really deliver on its promise. However, that doesn't mean there isn't plenty of practical advice on how to question (and perhaps improve) your own lifestyle.The hardest part for me to swallow is the total inconsideration of other people that Ferriss has. Waste other people's time so you can save yours? Go for it. The world simply wouldn't work if everyone acted according to Ferriss' advise.The strongest parts of the book are 1) the focus on essentialism, and 2) the questions the author asks you to ask yourself, and the exercises he recommends.All in all, this is a modern classic packed with practical advise which is worth the read. But please take the advise with a pinch of salt."

The first time I saw this book, it lay on the desk of a ridiculous person who somehow clearly hated working but also made his life much, much harder by attempting to do everyone else’s jobs in addition to his own. Maybe he really did need this book. But as far as I know, he continued to micromanage everyone despite this book’s best takeaway being the “art” of delegation. I decided to download the audio of this book after listening to the BY THE BOOK episodes about it. I’ve had a rough time staying on top of my work lately and hoped maybe I could get a helpful word or two about getting things done. Boy did I get a word. 4-HOUR WW is equal parts ridiculous, genius, and unintentionally entertaining. The audiobook reader’s voice stressed me out beyond belief, but I loved it. Useful aspects of this book include the discussion of Parkinson’s Law (absolutely true), the 80/20 rule, the time-suckage of email, and generally useful points about the kinds of customers that aren’t worth having. There is some wisdom here. But ultimately, most working people—whether small business owners or corporate employees like me—cannot take most of these steps and wouldn’t have the means to do so anyway. That many people take actual satisfaction in their work and that many employers view their employees as more than human drones are truths completely glossed over. And it should go without saying that if everyone approached their work life this way, then capitalism would fail faster than a speeding bullet. Wait a minute...Is capitalism a Ponzi scheme?This book also got weirdly existential in the end, but I’ll leave that one mostly alone. I didn’t really sign up to get “meaning of life” advice from Tim Ferriss, kickboxing “expert” and meditation extraordinaire; but I suppose if you’re willing to take and leave parts of this book (which I clearly am), it’s not a bad thing to be reminded that you are more than the job you do. This book has no balance whatsoever, but whatever. I laughed a lot while listening and putting together my patio furniture. And maybe I will try to check email fewer times during the day."

He doesn't have much in the way of material things, but every day he gets to hang out with his friends and family. He fishes a little. He takes an afternoon nap with his wife.

The thesis is simple: you can live like a millionaire, without actually being one. The 4 Hour Work Weeks touches on a variety of topics including automation, offshoring, delegation, minimalism and productivity. Key Takeaways  Definitions The New Rich have a different mindset to the typical employee or business owner. The New Rich: - have others work for them - distribute recovery periods and adventures (mini-retirements) throughout life - recognize that inactivity is not the goal and instead prioritise doing what excites them - focus on establishing a steady cash flow first, and then a big payday later.Everything popular is wrongRetirement is worst-case scenario insurance. Interest and energy are cyclical - alternate between work and rest. Doing less is not being lazy. The New Rich measure their contribution in results, not time. Laziness isn’t working less; laziness is letting circumstances define your life for you. The timing is never right. Whatever you want to do someday, just do it now. Ask for forgiveness, not permission. Emphasize your strengths, don’t fix weaknesses - this often provides a multiplier effect, while trying to fix weaknesses typically leads to only incremental improvement.Money alone is not the solution but relative income is more important than absolute income. Relative income measures both time and money. A person working 10 hours a week and making $10,000 is richer than someone working 80 hours a week and making $100,000. Embrace good stress instead of avoiding stress altogether.Most people are convinced they can only accomplish mediocre things. There is therefore more competition for mediocre goals. Elimination 80% of results come from 20% of actions. Ask yourself the following questions what 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness and what 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness?Be difficult when it matters - eg when it comes to protecting your productivity. Automation Build up a solid weekly income, independent of your day job:Step 1: Pick a reachable niche market. Find a market by defining your customers, and then designing your product around them. Preferably you must be a member of said market. Step 2: Brainstorm products whose benefit can be explained in one sentence or phrase. - The product should be expensive enough to sell fewer units, create higher profit margins, and attract lower-maintenance customers – but not so expensive that customers want to speak with you before buying. - The product should take less than 4 weeks to manufacture - The product should be fully explainable in an online FAQ. The easiest type of product to create is an information product – low-cost, fast to manufacture, and time-consuming for competitors to duplicate. If you read the top three books on a given subject, you’ll know more about the subject than 80% of the relevant population, thereby qualifying you as an expert. The person with the highest credibility will sell the most, not the person who knows the most about the subject. To establish credibility:1) Join 2 or 3 trade associations with official-sounding names.2) Read the 3 top-selling books on the topic and write a one-page summary of each.3) Go to the closest university, put up posters advertising a free seminar on the subject, and give the seminar using the summaries you’ve written.4) Call up a local branch of a well-known company and tell them you’ve done the seminars at the university and that you’re a member of the trade associations. Explain that you’re trying to gain speaking experience outside of the academic setting.5) Leverage your trade association membership and speaking experience to get an article published for a trade magazine. The only way to test if anyone actually wants your product is to ask people to buy it. Create a basic one-to-three-page website, put up a Google AdWords advertisement and use the response to test whether people will buy.  Liberation A 5 step process for getting your employer to let you work from home permanently:1. Increase investment - get your employer to first invest in you to increase their cost if you leave. For example, ask if the firm has any additional trainings available to employees and take them.2. Prove increased output offsite - call off sick for two days in the middle of the week, double your work output on both days, and make sure to demonstrate and record it with an email trail. 3. Show the business benefit - position remote working as a business benefit, not a personal perk. Bill more client time, complete more projects, or otherwise demonstrate quantified improvement. Explain the increased productivity as less time commuting and fewer distractions. 4. Propose a trial period - Informally mention to your boss how you were sick those two days and didn’t expect to get anything done, but were actually twice as productive. Ask if you could try working from home for 2 days in the next two weeks. When your boss objects, acknowledge his concerns and propose working from home only one day a week instead. 5. Expand remote time - Continue to excel on your work-from-home days and drop your in-office performance to heighten the contrast. Ask for another trial period with an extra two days at home. After your boss has gotten used to this, ask for a full-time remote trial of 2 weeks. Conclusion There are as many gems in this book as there is questionable advice. I am not too sure about Ferris' idea to essentially automate your life through offshoring daily tasks. This seems to be going too far. I was also particularly irritated by the fact that he highlights ""most countries in Africa"" as not ideal locations to travel to and work from because of the risk of kidnapping and terrorism. Seriously? Those 2 sentences near the end of the book pretty much ruined the rest of it for me, and thus 3 stars.That said, the chapters on Income Automation and productivity are well worth reading as these are the most practical I think I have read in any work. Other than that...meh."
253,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65849150-kelsey,3,"The extended edition is recommended as it updates many of the author's early ideas with more recently relevant tools and tips (original text released in 2009). Be warned, the audiobook is fine overall, but because lots of chapters list resources and websites parenthetically in the middle of a sentence or idea, you'll often find yourself repeatedly being read the ""www dot so-and-so dot com forward-slash home forward-slash news forward-slash whatever dot html"". Also, keep in mind that some of the tools the author mentions, while useful, may have been made obsolete when compared to some other things we have that we didn't commonly use in 2009 (like cloud computing versus working locally) or more efficient products have perhaps been released. Overall, good ideas and a recommended read for anyone who runs their own side hustle or fledgling business.As someone who does virtual assisting, I was disappointed about how much Ferriss underscored the perks of having a VA from India or another far off land. While differences of time zone (you can send off tasks at the end of the day and wake to find them completed) and spend (you often pay less than US standard wages for the same work) may be beneficial to an entrepreneur, I think this sort of thinking is dangerous to tout as THE way to succeed while delegating work. VAs come in all shapes, sizes, and skillsets, and opting to only hire non-domestic VAs with cost as a primary driver undermines the quality work that can be done by anyone ANYWHERE. If they're remote, why do they need to be in India? From Ferriss' telling, it seems cost is the only thing that really drives that desire, and I find that disappointing. It's like telling an artist you can buy the same thing at Walmart for $15...it undermines the craft and good work that anyone can do and comes off as a bit tone deaf and opportunistic in a world where Americans know that off-shore labor is often cheaper because it doesn't actually meet the needs of the worker being paid low wages. I'm not saying foreign VAs don't deserve pay and opportunity; I'm saying those looking for assistants should consider how best to support the HUMAN who needs the job.So, that being said, if you'd like to hire a virtual assistant, consider ALL virtual assistants, not just the ones you can pay next to nothing to do all your bitch work while you sleep. /endrant"
254,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5820202-koen-van-den-eeckhout,2,"Positive points: I strongly agree with some of the principles in this book, especially the Pareto principle and Parkinson's law, which can make your approach much more efficient.Neutral points: Ferriss uses a writing style balancing between motivational and arrogant, often crossing the line towards the latter. Nevertheless, it kinda fits the 'fuck it' theme of the book and easy to get used to. The book reads very quickly.Negative points: besides feeling outdated already (Blackberry? Yahoo shops?), Ferriss often crosses the line towards the downright unethical. Several pages on how to be widely regarded as an expert without being one, or marketing techniques which are pretty much illegal (e.g. selling items on eBay without having them)."
255,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602450-vladyslav-sitalo,3,"The style of the book is somewhat annoying but if you overcome this annoyance this book has something to share with you.--It's a fun fact that I've decided to read this book around the same time as Elon Musk's biography.And as both of the books is fresh in my mind, I can see two drastically different approaches to life from Elon and Tim.Tim is asking reader to dream big set impossible goals and than talks about buying a car or going to some nice place to live.From my perspective ""big"" is what Musk is doing - to transform car and space industries is big, to give humanity ability to travel to Mars is big, to minimize risks from superintelligent AI is big.Buying a Ferrari eh, it's kind of mediocre.I'm not saying that goal to buy Ferrari or live in constant travel or enjoying yourself in any other way is not a worthy goal, just saying that, well, it's not ""big"".It's happens to be true that my sentiments and goals is much more aligned with the Musk's vision. So this fact immediately questions the applicability of suggested techniques as THE way to achieve your goals if they are really big. (What would you set you month input goal if your actual goal is to go to the other planet (really really expensive) or achieve personal immortality (not technologically feasible right now, but it's plausible that it can be achievable in the nearest 50 years. And you can actually work on advancing scientific research/industry/public appreciation to make it feasible sooner then later)? )And so getting back to the comparison between Musk and Ferriss lifestyle - you can see big difference in them - you can probably characterize them as ""4 hour workweek"" vs ""4 hours to sleep"" or by goals ""go to Mars"" vs ""sip wine and play guitar with my amigos"".Do you have to adopt the work style similar to Musk's to achieve really big things? Well, I don't know, but Musk is succeeding and it is sensible to take him as an example at least to some extent.That said, I would admit that the lifestyle, proposed in the book is by all means more interesting and richer on life experience than your average one. Though, important thing to notice is that, unfortunately, this kind of lifestyle is not sustainable for majority of the population (you can tell this by simply looking how much people is employed as VA/outsources/etc for sustaining it for one person). Also despite described drawbacks this book contains a lot of great advice. For example - call to eliminate waste work and focus on the most efficient approaches is obviously applicable almost to everyone and everywhere (and the book provides you with recomendations and options on how to actually do that).I was always for elimination of unnecessary stuff/work/interruption. But Tim here is also talking about an information limitation. And I have to admit that I'm and informational addict in a way :). I don't read news, newspapers/magazines, I don't watch TV.But I totally into reading books, listening audiobooks/podcasts and reading interesting articles on the web. The book convinced me to limit time for email/social networks to two limited periods during the day. And i think it's a great practice. I've also become more picky regarding articles that I read.But, that said, constant learning and self education is one of the values that I practice and want to excel in. And you can't learn new things without getting info about them :).More on positive side:Facing your fears as a way to make a better decisions is really interesting technique.Tim is advocating lean approach to building business and it resonates with Lean Startup approach but applied to non-tech business which is interesting.He is questioning a lot of ""common sense"" assumptions and encouraging people to do this more often. I think that this approach can lead to better society in general.Also Tim briefly advocates ""choice-minimal"" lifestyle. Characteristic quote: ""Fast decisions preserve usable attention for what matters""I have this problem with choice anxiety - I just have to choose the best option, but I've been noticing and regarding this as a problem because I'm spending too much time focusing on minor decisions and I think there is better use for this time. The book do not address problem in depth but have a reference for ""The paradox of choice"" https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1... which I intend to read.Also I would recommend http://thewirecutter.com for people with similar problems as at least a partial solution that can eliminate/mitigate your choice anxiety for a lot of products.More on the downside besides the style:One thing that remained in my mind as bluntly stupid - house that just stays there, and guy is loosing money on it for some mysterious reason (it's not like it would take any amount of time to ask VA to rent it/find a good agency to work with).Tim is constantly overconfidently saying stuff about everything in the world. That's annoying, especially considering that what he is telling often is not entirely? True And he is almost never giving any quantifiable data to support his claims.Other thing Is confused thinking on some topics, for example thoughts on charity/service work. If you actually want to do some good (and not just feel good about yourself) look into https://80000hours.org/ project or http://www.givewell.org/."

Don’t work just for money for owning enviable things, follow your passion and do interesting things. Be unrealistic.“The future is here; It’s just not distributed yet”.-E is for elimination: Do first thing first, if you don’t have time you don’t have PRIORITIES. You have to define what you want to do with your time. Understand the Pareto principle “80 % of the outputs result from 20% of the inputs”. Be productive not just active, focus on what is important for you and neglect the tasks which do not take you closer to your goals, do not multitask, learn to propose don’t let others influence your decisions, cultivate selective ignorance “knowledge is power but knowledge without action are useless”, practice the art of nonfinishing and the art of refusal. Protect yourself from people who waste your time. “Reading, after a certain age, diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking.”-A is for automation: * HIRE AN ASSISTANT: Lingering unimportant tasks will disappear as soon as someone else is being paid to do them.

261,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16366211-ro,5,"What I like about this book is that it introduces a lot of new concepts for me - for a better (work) life, while also challenges my existing concepts on (work) life.I am particularly intrigued by the New Rich concept that defines “riches” not in having millions or billions, but more on the use of one’s time / having time freedom. “Those who abandon the deferred-life plan and create luxury lifestyles in the present using the currency of the New Rich: time and mobility.”While it would help to have millions and billions, often we are trapped in this rut of wanting more and pushing off “living in the moment” until we believe we have enough. And you guessed it, that day of having enough, never comes (unless you have a mindset shift). The most mind blowing thing is that the author shows how everyday ordinary people can & do have the means to live luxuriously but are held back by their limiting beliefs that they need to have more, work harder and join the millions and billions club.The author introduces several business models, tips tricks and tools that you can use to “eliminate” and “automate” your work - to free up your time; something you can immediately apply into your (work) life if you wish. 	i.e. 80/20 Pareto’s law According to the 80/20 rule: 80% of results are from 20% of action80% of outputs are from 20% of inputs80% of consequences are from 20% of the causes 80% of profits are from 20% of products and customers A practical use of the 80/20 rule is to ask yourself: 1. Which 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness?2. Which 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness? The book further highlights on our insistent need to “be productive"", which only leads us to fill our time with xx just to “feel productive”. If we reassess our daily to-do list and eliminate all the unnecessary time fillers, we can free up our time to do productive fulfilling things - things we truly enjoy.For example, the “mini retirement” concept talks about how instead of saving up our entire life’s savings to spend when we retire, why not use that money throughout your life and have what the author calls “mini retirements”. This way, you can truly enjoy life while you are young and in your prime, rather than wait until the time is right, which again may never happen. This definitely challenges my personal limiting belief - as I am one of those people who likes to wait until it’s the right time. The book ends by touching on some psychology and self help (my favorite topic) - that even after achieving the “4 hour work week” and have all the time in the world to do what you truly enjoy. Don’t expect all life challenges to just disappear. It is not easy to just ""wind down and enjoy”. Hence why being rich and depressed, successful and depressed are all too familiar. “Man is so made that he can only find relaxation from one kind of labor by taking up another” - Anatole FranceYou cannot just transition overnight from being a goal oriented high-performer to appreciating life in the moment. Although it is not impossible to do both, unraveling such habits take time - just like anything else in life; “leaning to replace the perception of time famine with the appreciation for time abundance is like going from triple espresso to decaf”.Recognizing this is the first step.Appreciating time abundance and living in the present doesn’t mean we should just sit on our butts and do nothing either. According to some of the most fulfilled people interviewed for the book’s case studies: 1. continual learning2. serviceare two commons factors for a fulfilled life. And I absolutely agree, I find my life the most meaningful when I’m continuously learning and can be of service to the world. I like that this book falls not only into the genre of business and entrepreneurship but also philosophy, psychology and self-help - which I think are intricately linked. In order to be well-informed, you need to be able to evaluate things from different perspective.Most of what is said in this book is no new news. I believe most of us are already familiar with the idea that we should enjoy life and live life in the moment but through seeing it from the author’s lens, the author’s way of getting things across that help sharpens my vague understanding of things - and honed down the messages for me even more. Definitely a good read on my list!Edit: I’m surprised this book receives a lot of negative reviews - mostly from people questioning Ferriss’s ego, and his “unethical” ways of doing businesses such as outsourcing help from virtual assistants in third world countries, who charge less.I did feel put off reading it because I had read these negative reviews prior to starting, but I’m glad I gave it a go anyway because I still learned a lot from the book and did not share the same negative sentiments towards Ferriss.I didn’t see this book as a guide on how to get rich quick etc, but rather more like an introduction to a lifestyle different from the accepted norm and more like a motivational tool / insights into Ferriss and others’ success stories. And not to defend Ferriss (although that is probably exactly what I am doing) - there is no need to be holier-than-thou. I don’t think the author is recommending us to take advantage of cheaper labour in poorer countries but rather how money can go further there, hence why they charge less.I am not sure if it’s fair to compare hiring virtual assistants in third world countries who charge less - to slave labors or garment workers for example. Yes, the rate is lower than developed countries but the overall expenses are lower too.Plus it's a question about the whole system we are inMoral contradiction / ethical dilemma There is a section in the book that addresses exactly this: Service for the right reasons: to save the whales or kill them and feed the children?“Service to me is simple: doing something that improves life besides your own.This is not the same as philanthropy. Philanthropy is the altruistic concern for the well-being of mankind–human life. Human life and comfort have long been focused on to the exclusion of the environment and the rest of the food chain, hence our current race to imminent extinction. Serves us right. The world does not exist solely for the betterment and multiplication of mankind.Before I start chaining myself to trees and saving the dart frogs, though, I should take my own advice: do not become a cause snob.How can you help starving children in Africa when there are starving children in Los Angeles? How can you save the whales when homeless people are freezing to death? How does doing volunteer research on coral destruction help those people who need help now?”Children, please. Everything out there needs help, so don’t get baited into “my cause can beat up your cause” arguments with no right answer. There are no qualitative or quantitative comparisons that make sense. The truth is this: those thousands of lives you save could contribute to a famine that kills millions, or that one bush in Bolivia that you protect could hold the cure for cancer. The downstream effects are unknown. Do your best and hope for the best. If you’re improving the world–however you define that–consider your job well done.Service isn’t limited to saving lives or the environment. It can also improve life. If you are a musician and put a smile on the faces of thousands or millions, I view that as service. If you are a mentor and change the life of one child for the better, the world has been improved. Improving the quality of life in the world is in no fashion inferior to adding more lives.”Service is an attitude.”"
262,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39587412-enrique-ma-as,5,"The first word that comes into my mind to tag this book is: inspiring.But let's elaborate. Timothy Ferriss comes from a different background: after selling his first company for a bunch of billions, we jump into a digital nomad lifestyle. He considers that his decisions are extendable to the middle-class and the people working 9-17, and addressing this he fails miserably. Is two different rivers with different water. But there is however a lot of important information and philosophies we can extract from this book.Timothy dedicates an important part of his book to talk about Virtual Assistants and popular places to hire them. This is a useful information to start with, but most of the rules we later on talks about are about common sense (do provide them with clear orders, leave everything written, give them freedom to expend money until certain amount...). Many of the websites and ideas about reselling are useful and not that well known.The book in general challenges you to move out from your comfort zone and take risks, which is by itself a vary valuable reason. ""The 4-hour workweek"" title is misleading, since as Tim himself recognizes is not about the money you have earned, but about the freedom you now have and the mobility worldwide. If I would be a boss with responsibility over other people, I would be worried if many of them were reading it. I actually quit my job before finishing it.As a side note: Tim writing's style is very selfish and self-centered. But that does not mean a star less for me"

For those who are in a service-oriented industry, his tactics do not seem to apply. Some of his tips do have merit however, such as keeping distractions to a minimum by only checking email and phone messages sparingly and delegating smaller tasks not absolutely necessary to other people to better utilize ones time on priorities. We will see if there is more to his book after I'm finished though before I give my final rating.After reading it, I think that I'm still in the same mindset as before. It was written seemingly for those who do not like their job. For those of us who were lucky enough to choose a profession that we actually enjoy, this is probably not the quintessential book of choice. It is packed with situations that are 99% ""not going to happen,"" such as the ""ask your boss if you can just work from home"" scenario. If I were to even try to ask my boss about that, he would just say ""I don't think so"" before 10 words were out of my mouth. The latter half of the book DID make me want to travel more, but the very end just seemed a bit preachy. All in all, I could see how this could possibly be inspiring to some, but not to most."

It's got helpful little exercises for comfort zone expansion, tactics for dealing with bureaucrats, strategies for building prestige, and lots more. And a lot of prompts for trying to figure out what you'd rather be doing, and for figuring out how to get there from here.The gist of all of it is that people don't really want to be millionaires, they want to have what they assume is the millionaire lifestyle. So computer how much money per day you'd actually need in order to live how you'd like, and then work towards that number. Waiting to live until you're too old to appreciate it is a crap strategy."

I wish I had a mind capable of Tim Ferriss's meta-level overview, his ability to accurately accommodate and relate a hundred facts and a dozen theories and tamp them all down into a perfectly lucid and convincing essence. Fun to read, too. Sarcastic, jolly, digressive and irreverent and philosophical.He can probably rub his belly and tap his head at the same time, too.

275,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23066833-bloodorange,3,"Disclaimers:I skipped parts of the book that dealt with product development and automation, since these do not apply to my experience. Most of the 'mobility' tips do not apply in my case, since I happen to live AND earn in one of those 'ridiculously cheap' countries.There was no little escaping from this book. Since I have a work/ organisation/ near burnout crisis each year in June (comes with the territory), I tend to google for tips and motivation, and The 4-Hour Work Week reached me in small, irritating snippets. 1. The principles seemed tempting, but unenforceable in my profession, as evidenced by numerous comments on the irrelevance of the Pareto Principle in education. You just have to put in the hours, even if you do that by Skype; most of the valid exams need to take place in teacher's presence; you can't tell 80% of your students to just get lost; on most levels of education, 'automation' such as peer assessment simply doesn't work (on others, it can be used, but will not replace teacher's assessment). The ugly: some issues just can't be dealt with ""intensively"" - as evidenced by joking, but telling questions on the author's on the release date of The 4-hour Baby.The good: Ferriss' elimination tips are quite inspiring even to non entrepreneurs. They're good reminders to not increase one's workload automatically and unreflexively, as teachers often do. In the words of Anne Taintor:http://s30.postimg.org/f5qt0jw5t/magn...I decided to implement some of the ideas I previously had that would make students more responsible for their learning and material preparation (with me interfering and supplementing whatever information they might have left out, that is). I also thought I might revise class rules as a set of basic rules + Frequently Asked Questions in an attempt to make them more independent. 2. Something about the approach to work this books represents seems, frankly speaking, immoral to me, and not just me. This piece by Penelope Trunk is a classic by now: http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2009/01...This piece by Jennifer Dziura https://medium.com/get-bullish/a5e5f4... is much more recent and contains a sentence that says it all:If you seem to be “getting everything you want,” you should probably examine whether you’re getting it at someone’s expense, or whether you’re just constantly, in small ways, making the world worse.3. When I was a kid, I read and anthology of science fiction stories, including a story (I can't recall the title) about a society of the future in which people removed the obstacle of the decision making process (the decisions in it are taken instantly, which results in living an equivalent of an action-packed lifetime in just one night. Tim Ferriss reminds me of the protagonist, as his aim seems to be to live as many lives as possible in one lifetime. Somewhat unsurprisingly, I remember his blog post about his panic attacks (which I can't locate now), which somehow makes sense. To be fair, he also urges the reader to slow down and savour life, but somehow hmm.The (completely unexpected) good:- 'It is vain to do with more what can be done with less."" - William of Ockham; not a a bad motto to work by.- I was surprised by his stress on do-gooding, volunteering and making donations.- Dreamlining - I was surprised by how much my dreams are time-dependent instead of money-dependent.Now, I think, time to read this, for balance: In Praise of Slowness: Challenging the Cult of Speed"
276,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1957039-patrick,4,"So in reality, The 4-Hour Workweek is lifestyle porn for me. Tim Ferriss discusses real, practical strategies for cutting loose from the traditional working world, and living a lifestyle with less work, more time for important things, and the ability to travel the world.I liked this book quite a bit. I'm not sure how useful most of it will be to me, but it sure makes me dream about what *could* be. ""If only I had an idea for a business...""Mr. Ferriss not only provides philosophical and psychological reasons for getting your employer to let you work at home, but he talks about how to set up your own business that requires minimal interaction and will be able to support you as you live in different countries.I had only two problems with this book:1) While Mr. Ferriss rightly disparages working your ass off so you can enjoy your retirement (referring to it as ""deferred life""), he does seem to make the assumption that you'll be able to alternate work and ""mini-retirements"" forever. Frankly, I'm guessing that when I'm 75, I'm not going to be terribly effective at working at all. I'm disappointed by his lack of consideration for care during my waning years. Maybe he's a proponent of ice floes?2) Tim Ferriss's biggest fan is Tim Ferriss. It was a bit unseemly how often he talked about how great he was. I understand that he's trying to convince us that if he could do it, we could too, but I'm tired of hearing about how he won a tango competition, dined at 5-star restaurants, or practices martial arts. If his personality in real life is anything like he comes across in the book, I suspect that I wouldn't get a word in edgewise if we were hanging out.Ok, bonus problem: He uses the term ""muse"" to refer to ""an automated vehicle for generating cash without consuming time"". Every time he uses it, it's jarring, because I know what the term actually means.Anyway, those faults aside, this book contained tons of great information for entrepreneurs and people who are looking to cut loose from the daily grind. Lots of great information here. Highly recommended for anyone who has ever had dreams of doing something different with their work life."
277,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28646-bryan,4,"I had been reluctant to read this as I assumed it was written by a spoiled and out-of-touch entrepreneur. Recently, however, a friend pointed out to me that an author I liked had been on Ferris' podcast. I listened and enjoyed the conversation they had. I continued listening to subsequent episodes, and decided that in spite of my irrational prejudice, I was starting to like him more and more. This book is a bit dated now, and does in places come off as brash and irritating, yet it's quite positive and an open challenge to live life on one's own terms. As a result it's inspirational, and it gives some insight into how differently people can think about risks and resources. In certain ways I wish I'd read it earlier, as it would likely have saved me a few years spent obeying societal dictates in a career to which I was not particularly suited. But I think without the good impression left by the compassionate and sometimes fascinating interviews Ferris does on his podcast, I might have been less receptive to the book's tone."
278,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18908489-alexander-svanevik,4,"Hard to rate.No doubt, this book has had a huge impact on many people's lives. I personally know people who have basically changed their entire lifestyle after reading Tim Ferriss' book.I read it in Spanish, so I won't comment on the language.Stating the obvious, the title doesn't really deliver on its promise. However, that doesn't mean there isn't plenty of practical advice on how to question (and perhaps improve) your own lifestyle.The hardest part for me to swallow is the total inconsideration of other people that Ferriss has. Waste other people's time so you can save yours? Go for it. The world simply wouldn't work if everyone acted according to Ferriss' advise.The strongest parts of the book are 1) the focus on essentialism, and 2) the questions the author asks you to ask yourself, and the exercises he recommends.All in all, this is a modern classic packed with practical advise which is worth the read. But please take the advise with a pinch of salt."

280,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/557179-jocelyn-bailey,3,"My bizarre love affair with business and self-help books continues! The first time I saw this book, it lay on the desk of a ridiculous person who somehow clearly hated working but also made his life much, much harder by attempting to do everyone else’s jobs in addition to his own. Maybe he really did need this book. But as far as I know, he continued to micromanage everyone despite this book’s best takeaway being the “art” of delegation. I decided to download the audio of this book after listening to the BY THE BOOK episodes about it. I’ve had a rough time staying on top of my work lately and hoped maybe I could get a helpful word or two about getting things done. Boy did I get a word. 4-HOUR WW is equal parts ridiculous, genius, and unintentionally entertaining. The audiobook reader’s voice stressed me out beyond belief, but I loved it. Useful aspects of this book include the discussion of Parkinson’s Law (absolutely true), the 80/20 rule, the time-suckage of email, and generally useful points about the kinds of customers that aren’t worth having. There is some wisdom here. But ultimately, most working people—whether small business owners or corporate employees like me—cannot take most of these steps and wouldn’t have the means to do so anyway. That many people take actual satisfaction in their work and that many employers view their employees as more than human drones are truths completely glossed over. And it should go without saying that if everyone approached their work life this way, then capitalism would fail faster than a speeding bullet. Wait a minute...Is capitalism a Ponzi scheme?This book also got weirdly existential in the end, but I’ll leave that one mostly alone. I didn’t really sign up to get “meaning of life” advice from Tim Ferriss, kickboxing “expert” and meditation extraordinaire; but I suppose if you’re willing to take and leave parts of this book (which I clearly am), it’s not a bad thing to be reminded that you are more than the job you do. This book has no balance whatsoever, but whatever. I laughed a lot while listening and putting together my patio furniture. And maybe I will try to check email fewer times during the day."
281,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41350064-juli-hoffman,5,"This book does NOT teach you how to be a millionaire. If you're looking for THAT book, keep walking. This book DOES teach that wealth isn't all about money, it's about creating time to do the things you love. There's an example of a fisherman in this book. He doesn't have much in the way of material things, but every day he gets to hang out with his friends and family. He fishes a little. He takes an afternoon nap with his wife. He plays in a band in the evening. He's living like he's retired while he's young enough to enjoy it. This man is NOT a millionaire, but he's rich in the things that matter. This is the ""New Rich."" They are everyday people who are getting out of their comfort zones in order to enjoy life NOW, rather than waiting until the end of their days.I took away a lot of good ideas from this book and it did give me the courage to try some new things in my own career. A few years ago, My husband and I took a step back from the workoholic path. We don't make as much money as before, but our quality of life is much better. For years I've been playing around with some ideas to bring a little passive income into our household. This book gave me the courage to pursue this goal. Will I succeed? I have no idea! I do know that I'd rather live for experiences, time with the people I love, rather than killing myself trying to earn enough money to buy more things.Thanks, Tm Ferriss, for sharing your journey!"
282,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42182887-sipho,3,"This contemporary classic is a manifesto for lifestyle design. The thesis is simple: you can live like a millionaire, without actually being one. The 4 Hour Work Weeks touches on a variety of topics including automation, offshoring, delegation, minimalism and productivity. Key Takeaways  Definitions The New Rich have a different mindset to the typical employee or business owner. The New Rich: - have others work for them - distribute recovery periods and adventures (mini-retirements) throughout life - recognize that inactivity is not the goal and instead prioritise doing what excites them - focus on establishing a steady cash flow first, and then a big payday later.Everything popular is wrongRetirement is worst-case scenario insurance. Interest and energy are cyclical - alternate between work and rest. Doing less is not being lazy. The New Rich measure their contribution in results, not time. Laziness isn’t working less; laziness is letting circumstances define your life for you. The timing is never right. Whatever you want to do someday, just do it now. Ask for forgiveness, not permission. Emphasize your strengths, don’t fix weaknesses - this often provides a multiplier effect, while trying to fix weaknesses typically leads to only incremental improvement.Money alone is not the solution but relative income is more important than absolute income. Relative income measures both time and money. A person working 10 hours a week and making $10,000 is richer than someone working 80 hours a week and making $100,000. Embrace good stress instead of avoiding stress altogether.Most people are convinced they can only accomplish mediocre things. There is therefore more competition for mediocre goals. Elimination 80% of results come from 20% of actions. Ask yourself the following questions what 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness and what 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness?Be difficult when it matters - eg when it comes to protecting your productivity. Automation Build up a solid weekly income, independent of your day job:Step 1: Pick a reachable niche market. Find a market by defining your customers, and then designing your product around them. Preferably you must be a member of said market. Step 2: Brainstorm products whose benefit can be explained in one sentence or phrase. - The product should be expensive enough to sell fewer units, create higher profit margins, and attract lower-maintenance customers – but not so expensive that customers want to speak with you before buying. - The product should take less than 4 weeks to manufacture - The product should be fully explainable in an online FAQ. The easiest type of product to create is an information product – low-cost, fast to manufacture, and time-consuming for competitors to duplicate. If you read the top three books on a given subject, you’ll know more about the subject than 80% of the relevant population, thereby qualifying you as an expert. The person with the highest credibility will sell the most, not the person who knows the most about the subject. To establish credibility:1) Join 2 or 3 trade associations with official-sounding names.2) Read the 3 top-selling books on the topic and write a one-page summary of each.3) Go to the closest university, put up posters advertising a free seminar on the subject, and give the seminar using the summaries you’ve written.4) Call up a local branch of a well-known company and tell them you’ve done the seminars at the university and that you’re a member of the trade associations. Explain that you’re trying to gain speaking experience outside of the academic setting.5) Leverage your trade association membership and speaking experience to get an article published for a trade magazine. The only way to test if anyone actually wants your product is to ask people to buy it. Create a basic one-to-three-page website, put up a Google AdWords advertisement and use the response to test whether people will buy.  Liberation A 5 step process for getting your employer to let you work from home permanently:1. Increase investment - get your employer to first invest in you to increase their cost if you leave. For example, ask if the firm has any additional trainings available to employees and take them.2. Prove increased output offsite - call off sick for two days in the middle of the week, double your work output on both days, and make sure to demonstrate and record it with an email trail. 3. Show the business benefit - position remote working as a business benefit, not a personal perk. Bill more client time, complete more projects, or otherwise demonstrate quantified improvement. Explain the increased productivity as less time commuting and fewer distractions. 4. Propose a trial period - Informally mention to your boss how you were sick those two days and didn’t expect to get anything done, but were actually twice as productive. Ask if you could try working from home for 2 days in the next two weeks. When your boss objects, acknowledge his concerns and propose working from home only one day a week instead. 5. Expand remote time - Continue to excel on your work-from-home days and drop your in-office performance to heighten the contrast. Ask for another trial period with an extra two days at home. After your boss has gotten used to this, ask for a full-time remote trial of 2 weeks. Conclusion There are as many gems in this book as there is questionable advice. I am not too sure about Ferris' idea to essentially automate your life through offshoring daily tasks. This seems to be going too far. I was also particularly irritated by the fact that he highlights ""most countries in Africa"" as not ideal locations to travel to and work from because of the risk of kidnapping and terrorism. Seriously? Those 2 sentences near the end of the book pretty much ruined the rest of it for me, and thus 3 stars.That said, the chapters on Income Automation and productivity are well worth reading as these are the most practical I think I have read in any work. Other than that...meh."
283,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65849150-kelsey,3,"The extended edition is recommended as it updates many of the author's early ideas with more recently relevant tools and tips (original text released in 2009). Be warned, the audiobook is fine overall, but because lots of chapters list resources and websites parenthetically in the middle of a sentence or idea, you'll often find yourself repeatedly being read the ""www dot so-and-so dot com forward-slash home forward-slash news forward-slash whatever dot html"". Also, keep in mind that some of the tools the author mentions, while useful, may have been made obsolete when compared to some other things we have that we didn't commonly use in 2009 (like cloud computing versus working locally) or more efficient products have perhaps been released. Overall, good ideas and a recommended read for anyone who runs their own side hustle or fledgling business.As someone who does virtual assisting, I was disappointed about how much Ferriss underscored the perks of having a VA from India or another far off land. While differences of time zone (you can send off tasks at the end of the day and wake to find them completed) and spend (you often pay less than US standard wages for the same work) may be beneficial to an entrepreneur, I think this sort of thinking is dangerous to tout as THE way to succeed while delegating work. VAs come in all shapes, sizes, and skillsets, and opting to only hire non-domestic VAs with cost as a primary driver undermines the quality work that can be done by anyone ANYWHERE. If they're remote, why do they need to be in India? From Ferriss' telling, it seems cost is the only thing that really drives that desire, and I find that disappointing. It's like telling an artist you can buy the same thing at Walmart for $15...it undermines the craft and good work that anyone can do and comes off as a bit tone deaf and opportunistic in a world where Americans know that off-shore labor is often cheaper because it doesn't actually meet the needs of the worker being paid low wages. I'm not saying foreign VAs don't deserve pay and opportunity; I'm saying those looking for assistants should consider how best to support the HUMAN who needs the job.So, that being said, if you'd like to hire a virtual assistant, consider ALL virtual assistants, not just the ones you can pay next to nothing to do all your bitch work while you sleep. /endrant"
284,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5820202-koen-van-den-eeckhout,2,"Positive points: I strongly agree with some of the principles in this book, especially the Pareto principle and Parkinson's law, which can make your approach much more efficient.Neutral points: Ferriss uses a writing style balancing between motivational and arrogant, often crossing the line towards the latter. Nevertheless, it kinda fits the 'fuck it' theme of the book and easy to get used to. The book reads very quickly.Negative points: besides feeling outdated already (Blackberry? Yahoo shops?), Ferriss often crosses the line towards the downright unethical. Several pages on how to be widely regarded as an expert without being one, or marketing techniques which are pretty much illegal (e.g. selling items on eBay without having them)."
285,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602450-vladyslav-sitalo,3,"The style of the book is somewhat annoying but if you overcome this annoyance this book has something to share with you.--It's a fun fact that I've decided to read this book around the same time as Elon Musk's biography.And as both of the books is fresh in my mind, I can see two drastically different approaches to life from Elon and Tim.Tim is asking reader to dream big set impossible goals and than talks about buying a car or going to some nice place to live.From my perspective ""big"" is what Musk is doing - to transform car and space industries is big, to give humanity ability to travel to Mars is big, to minimize risks from superintelligent AI is big.Buying a Ferrari eh, it's kind of mediocre.I'm not saying that goal to buy Ferrari or live in constant travel or enjoying yourself in any other way is not a worthy goal, just saying that, well, it's not ""big"".It's happens to be true that my sentiments and goals is much more aligned with the Musk's vision. So this fact immediately questions the applicability of suggested techniques as THE way to achieve your goals if they are really big. (What would you set you month input goal if your actual goal is to go to the other planet (really really expensive) or achieve personal immortality (not technologically feasible right now, but it's plausible that it can be achievable in the nearest 50 years. And you can actually work on advancing scientific research/industry/public appreciation to make it feasible sooner then later)? )And so getting back to the comparison between Musk and Ferriss lifestyle - you can see big difference in them - you can probably characterize them as ""4 hour workweek"" vs ""4 hours to sleep"" or by goals ""go to Mars"" vs ""sip wine and play guitar with my amigos"".Do you have to adopt the work style similar to Musk's to achieve really big things? Well, I don't know, but Musk is succeeding and it is sensible to take him as an example at least to some extent.That said, I would admit that the lifestyle, proposed in the book is by all means more interesting and richer on life experience than your average one. Though, important thing to notice is that, unfortunately, this kind of lifestyle is not sustainable for majority of the population (you can tell this by simply looking how much people is employed as VA/outsources/etc for sustaining it for one person). Also despite described drawbacks this book contains a lot of great advice. For example - call to eliminate waste work and focus on the most efficient approaches is obviously applicable almost to everyone and everywhere (and the book provides you with recomendations and options on how to actually do that).I was always for elimination of unnecessary stuff/work/interruption. But Tim here is also talking about an information limitation. And I have to admit that I'm and informational addict in a way :). I don't read news, newspapers/magazines, I don't watch TV.But I totally into reading books, listening audiobooks/podcasts and reading interesting articles on the web. The book convinced me to limit time for email/social networks to two limited periods during the day. And i think it's a great practice. I've also become more picky regarding articles that I read.But, that said, constant learning and self education is one of the values that I practice and want to excel in. And you can't learn new things without getting info about them :).More on positive side:Facing your fears as a way to make a better decisions is really interesting technique.Tim is advocating lean approach to building business and it resonates with Lean Startup approach but applied to non-tech business which is interesting.He is questioning a lot of ""common sense"" assumptions and encouraging people to do this more often. I think that this approach can lead to better society in general.Also Tim briefly advocates ""choice-minimal"" lifestyle. Characteristic quote: ""Fast decisions preserve usable attention for what matters""I have this problem with choice anxiety - I just have to choose the best option, but I've been noticing and regarding this as a problem because I'm spending too much time focusing on minor decisions and I think there is better use for this time. The book do not address problem in depth but have a reference for ""The paradox of choice"" https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1... which I intend to read.Also I would recommend http://thewirecutter.com for people with similar problems as at least a partial solution that can eliminate/mitigate your choice anxiety for a lot of products.More on the downside besides the style:One thing that remained in my mind as bluntly stupid - house that just stays there, and guy is loosing money on it for some mysterious reason (it's not like it would take any amount of time to ask VA to rent it/find a good agency to work with).Tim is constantly overconfidently saying stuff about everything in the world. That's annoying, especially considering that what he is telling often is not entirely? True And he is almost never giving any quantifiable data to support his claims.Other thing Is confused thinking on some topics, for example thoughts on charity/service work. If you actually want to do some good (and not just feel good about yourself) look into https://80000hours.org/ project or http://www.givewell.org/."

Tip for my Dutch friends: just read Rick Pastoor's Grip for this section.I'm not going to tell other people that they shouldn't follow the ideas of Tim Ferriss, but I won't be joining his ""new rich"" movement."

289,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100403956-peter-morgan,0,"Despicable, zany, and, when treated ironically, hilarious. Ferriss is in deep, and he doesn’t know it. All the more delicious for it: self-help can’t do hysterical realism, but it can do hysterical pragmatism. Audio."
290,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58826982-imane,5,"The general process of joining the New Rich is D-E-A-L:-D is for definition: What are your goals? What do you want? What would excite you? Happiness? Excitement is the definition of happiness and boredom is the definition of unhappiness. Don’t work just for money for owning enviable things, follow your passion and do interesting things. Be unrealistic.“The future is here; It’s just not distributed yet”.-E is for elimination: Do first thing first, if you don’t have time you don’t have PRIORITIES. You have to define what you want to do with your time. Understand the Pareto principle “80 % of the outputs result from 20% of the inputs”. Be productive not just active, focus on what is important for you and neglect the tasks which do not take you closer to your goals, do not multitask, learn to propose don’t let others influence your decisions, cultivate selective ignorance “knowledge is power but knowledge without action are useless”, practice the art of nonfinishing and the art of refusal. Protect yourself from people who waste your time. “Reading, after a certain age, diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking.”-A is for automation: * HIRE AN ASSISTANT: Lingering unimportant tasks will disappear as soon as someone else is being paid to do them. Free your time to focus on bigger and better things. “Nobody can give you freedom. Nobody can give you equality or justice or anything. If you're a man, you take it.”*FIND THE MUSE: Find a market, define your customers then find or develop a product for them.*TEST THE MUSE: Micro-testing your products involves using inexpensive advertisements to test consumer response to a product prior to manufacturing.*MBA MANAGEMENT BY ABSENCE: Once you have a product that sells, it’s time to design a self-correcting business architecture that runs itself.“The power of hiding ourselves from one another is mercifully given, for men are wild beasts, and would devour one another but for this protection.”-L is for liberation: “It is far better for a man to go wrong in freedom than to go right in chains.”* ESCAPE THE OFFICE (Create an opportunity to demonstrate remote work productivity before asking for it as a policy. This is to test your ability to work outside of an office environment and rack up some proof that you can kick ass without constant supervision).*KILL YOUR JOB: Are you more likely to find what you want in your current job or somewhere else?*MINI-RETIREMENTS: EMBRACING THE MOBILE LIFESTYLE“Before the development of tourism, travel was conceived to be like study, and its fruits were considered to be the adornment of the mind and the formation of the judgment.”*FILLING THE VOID: Adding Life After Subtracting Work“To be engrossed by something outside ourselves is a powerful antidote for the rational mind, the mind that so frequently has its head up its own ass.”"
291,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16366211-ro,5,"What I like about this book is that it introduces a lot of new concepts for me - for a better (work) life, while also challenges my existing concepts on (work) life.I am particularly intrigued by the New Rich concept that defines “riches” not in having millions or billions, but more on the use of one’s time / having time freedom. “Those who abandon the deferred-life plan and create luxury lifestyles in the present using the currency of the New Rich: time and mobility.”While it would help to have millions and billions, often we are trapped in this rut of wanting more and pushing off “living in the moment” until we believe we have enough. And you guessed it, that day of having enough, never comes (unless you have a mindset shift). The most mind blowing thing is that the author shows how everyday ordinary people can & do have the means to live luxuriously but are held back by their limiting beliefs that they need to have more, work harder and join the millions and billions club.The author introduces several business models, tips tricks and tools that you can use to “eliminate” and “automate” your work - to free up your time; something you can immediately apply into your (work) life if you wish. 	i.e. 80/20 Pareto’s law According to the 80/20 rule: 80% of results are from 20% of action80% of outputs are from 20% of inputs80% of consequences are from 20% of the causes 80% of profits are from 20% of products and customers A practical use of the 80/20 rule is to ask yourself: 1. Which 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness?2. Which 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness? The book further highlights on our insistent need to “be productive"", which only leads us to fill our time with xx just to “feel productive”. If we reassess our daily to-do list and eliminate all the unnecessary time fillers, we can free up our time to do productive fulfilling things - things we truly enjoy.For example, the “mini retirement” concept talks about how instead of saving up our entire life’s savings to spend when we retire, why not use that money throughout your life and have what the author calls “mini retirements”. This way, you can truly enjoy life while you are young and in your prime, rather than wait until the time is right, which again may never happen. This definitely challenges my personal limiting belief - as I am one of those people who likes to wait until it’s the right time. The book ends by touching on some psychology and self help (my favorite topic) - that even after achieving the “4 hour work week” and have all the time in the world to do what you truly enjoy. Don’t expect all life challenges to just disappear. It is not easy to just ""wind down and enjoy”. Hence why being rich and depressed, successful and depressed are all too familiar. “Man is so made that he can only find relaxation from one kind of labor by taking up another” - Anatole FranceYou cannot just transition overnight from being a goal oriented high-performer to appreciating life in the moment. Although it is not impossible to do both, unraveling such habits take time - just like anything else in life; “leaning to replace the perception of time famine with the appreciation for time abundance is like going from triple espresso to decaf”.Recognizing this is the first step.Appreciating time abundance and living in the present doesn’t mean we should just sit on our butts and do nothing either. According to some of the most fulfilled people interviewed for the book’s case studies: 1. continual learning2. serviceare two commons factors for a fulfilled life. And I absolutely agree, I find my life the most meaningful when I’m continuously learning and can be of service to the world. I like that this book falls not only into the genre of business and entrepreneurship but also philosophy, psychology and self-help - which I think are intricately linked. In order to be well-informed, you need to be able to evaluate things from different perspective.Most of what is said in this book is no new news. I believe most of us are already familiar with the idea that we should enjoy life and live life in the moment but through seeing it from the author’s lens, the author’s way of getting things across that help sharpens my vague understanding of things - and honed down the messages for me even more. Definitely a good read on my list!Edit: I’m surprised this book receives a lot of negative reviews - mostly from people questioning Ferriss’s ego, and his “unethical” ways of doing businesses such as outsourcing help from virtual assistants in third world countries, who charge less.I did feel put off reading it because I had read these negative reviews prior to starting, but I’m glad I gave it a go anyway because I still learned a lot from the book and did not share the same negative sentiments towards Ferriss.I didn’t see this book as a guide on how to get rich quick etc, but rather more like an introduction to a lifestyle different from the accepted norm and more like a motivational tool / insights into Ferriss and others’ success stories. And not to defend Ferriss (although that is probably exactly what I am doing) - there is no need to be holier-than-thou. I don’t think the author is recommending us to take advantage of cheaper labour in poorer countries but rather how money can go further there, hence why they charge less.I am not sure if it’s fair to compare hiring virtual assistants in third world countries who charge less - to slave labors or garment workers for example. Yes, the rate is lower than developed countries but the overall expenses are lower too.Plus it's a question about the whole system we are inMoral contradiction / ethical dilemma There is a section in the book that addresses exactly this: Service for the right reasons: to save the whales or kill them and feed the children?“Service to me is simple: doing something that improves life besides your own.This is not the same as philanthropy. Philanthropy is the altruistic concern for the well-being of mankind–human life. Human life and comfort have long been focused on to the exclusion of the environment and the rest of the food chain, hence our current race to imminent extinction. Serves us right. The world does not exist solely for the betterment and multiplication of mankind.Before I start chaining myself to trees and saving the dart frogs, though, I should take my own advice: do not become a cause snob.How can you help starving children in Africa when there are starving children in Los Angeles? How can you save the whales when homeless people are freezing to death? How does doing volunteer research on coral destruction help those people who need help now?”Children, please. Everything out there needs help, so don’t get baited into “my cause can beat up your cause” arguments with no right answer. There are no qualitative or quantitative comparisons that make sense. The truth is this: those thousands of lives you save could contribute to a famine that kills millions, or that one bush in Bolivia that you protect could hold the cure for cancer. The downstream effects are unknown. Do your best and hope for the best. If you’re improving the world–however you define that–consider your job well done.Service isn’t limited to saving lives or the environment. It can also improve life. If you are a musician and put a smile on the faces of thousands or millions, I view that as service. If you are a mentor and change the life of one child for the better, the world has been improved. Improving the quality of life in the world is in no fashion inferior to adding more lives.”Service is an attitude.”"
292,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39587412-enrique-ma-as,5,"The first word that comes into my mind to tag this book is: inspiring.But let's elaborate. Timothy Ferriss comes from a different background: after selling his first company for a bunch of billions, we jump into a digital nomad lifestyle. He considers that his decisions are extendable to the middle-class and the people working 9-17, and addressing this he fails miserably. Is two different rivers with different water. But there is however a lot of important information and philosophies we can extract from this book.Timothy dedicates an important part of his book to talk about Virtual Assistants and popular places to hire them. This is a useful information to start with, but most of the rules we later on talks about are about common sense (do provide them with clear orders, leave everything written, give them freedom to expend money until certain amount...). Many of the websites and ideas about reselling are useful and not that well known.The book in general challenges you to move out from your comfort zone and take risks, which is by itself a vary valuable reason. ""The 4-hour workweek"" title is misleading, since as Tim himself recognizes is not about the money you have earned, but about the freedom you now have and the mobility worldwide. If I would be a boss with responsibility over other people, I would be worried if many of them were reading it. I actually quit my job before finishing it.As a side note: Tim writing's style is very selfish and self-centered. But that does not mean a star less for me"
293,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/747419-jason,3,"So far, not yet having finished this book, it seems like he created it for those who are: 1. in the sales of PRODUCTS industry, and 2. of those people, for those who are in a management/ownership position. For those who are in a service-oriented industry, his tactics do not seem to apply. Some of his tips do have merit however, such as keeping distractions to a minimum by only checking email and phone messages sparingly and delegating smaller tasks not absolutely necessary to other people to better utilize ones time on priorities. We will see if there is more to his book after I'm finished though before I give my final rating.After reading it, I think that I'm still in the same mindset as before. It was written seemingly for those who do not like their job. For those of us who were lucky enough to choose a profession that we actually enjoy, this is probably not the quintessential book of choice. It is packed with situations that are 99% ""not going to happen,"" such as the ""ask your boss if you can just work from home"" scenario. If I were to even try to ask my boss about that, he would just say ""I don't think so"" before 10 words were out of my mouth. The latter half of the book DID make me want to travel more, but the very end just seemed a bit preachy. All in all, I could see how this could possibly be inspiring to some, but not to most."
294,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/779063-mary-wescott,2,"At first I rated this book 5 stars - but then after reading reviews of this book I gave it 2 stars and this is why: When people give their life to a career they love and never leave their hometown - it does not mean they are a failure. I needed to be reminded of that.....Why I wanted to give it 5 stars - because I am re-entering the workforce after many years and I got caught up in the hype ""I know everything you need to be successful! This is wonderful! And this is wonderful! And you will not be fulfilled if you don't do all of these wonderful things!!"" But then I realized I am the fisherman in Ferriss's book. I have a very strong sense of community and family and I don't need to outsource my whole life to love my life. Do I want to go to the Azore Islands and reconnect with family and do family history? I do. And thanks to this book I will make it a goal. However, I will not cut corners, look for loopholes or be unethical to do so. Enter the 2 stars. Nor do I need to travel the world to live a fulfilling life. I have everything I need right here. The love of my life, a church community, a roof over my head, the sun that shines 300 days a year, dear friends, loving family, a career that reimburses me for good work, and a hobby that brings me joy. And that Tim Ferris is more than any result a 4 hour work week could bring me."

It is not complete, definitive or anything like it.There are better books about all the finer points:— stoicism— minimalism— productivity— marketing— traveling the world.BUT.This one puts it all together. This book is what made me dare to defy what was conventional and expected.To dream about finding a job with purpose, and living life on my terms. It is a game-changer - and still has the potential to be.It is not a definitive guide of any sort. But it is an invitation to explore. An invitation to think about what are your values (is it travel? is it to spend time with your family? work with something you love?) and rehearse worst-case scenarios.And, most importantly: to dream and try and live the ""best-case"" scenarios.For me, the truth is this: this book changes lives. And that is why it is still a 5/5.P.S.: It is just appropriate to be writing these lines on a cold morning in Bratislava. At this moment, I am traveling with 3 friends, 2 of whom work remotely (just like me). By the end of the year, I will have spent over 100 days of 2019 traveling. And this is the book that started all this. Thank you, Tim."
296,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974110-wendi-lau,3,"This book is most helpful to people who:* Do a large variety of tasks on the computer* Do not handle sensitive information, e.g. client financials* Want to travel* Not location-bound due to family, preference, or health* Comfortable outsourcing tasks and decisions* Want to spend more time on anything besides work* Are willing to spend the upfront time to research their market, audience, technologies, and online marketing options for a specific nicheThis book is less helpful to people who: * Do direct, in-person, people-based jobs, e.g., nurse, teacher, health care worker, construction (can you covert your expertise into an online product?)* Uncomfortable with technology* Like the everyday nature and interactions of workWhether you want to reduce work time or not, apply any of Ferriss' savvy work tips on training your co-workers and customers about your availability, reducing emails, and conducting focused, intentional meetings. A big takeaway is the idea that the traditional workplace paradigm can be shifted to increase efficiency and use available technology. Uncomfortable, unpopular, mind-blowing...and possible.If the government would apply these principles, taxpayers would save so much money!"

It feels like a spiritual relative of Sebastian Marshall's Ikigai --- reading this book will have you spending a lot of time pondering ""hmm, what kind of life do I really want to live?"" The answer for most people I've talked to is ""not like this,"" but the fear gets in the way.This is a good book about getting over the fear. It's got helpful little exercises for comfort zone expansion, tactics for dealing with bureaucrats, strategies for building prestige, and lots more. And a lot of prompts for trying to figure out what you'd rather be doing, and for figuring out how to get there from here.The gist of all of it is that people don't really want to be millionaires, they want to have what they assume is the millionaire lifestyle. So computer how much money per day you'd actually need in order to live how you'd like, and then work towards that number. Waiting to live until you're too old to appreciate it is a crap strategy."

Then a friend of mine recommended this book, but it took me 4 months to finish it! Some parts (especially the last third) were really interesting to me, but other parts definitely weren't.It think it's one of those kind of books that you shouldn't read every sentence from, but jump from chapter to chapter based on what is interesting to you. I don't know if I have OCD or what, but I'm definitely incapable of doing that, I need to read every last bit, which is probably why it took me so long to finish it and I found some parts difficult to read.That being said, I totally understand how it can change life, and maybe it's going to help me get the push and the motivation to look for another way to earn income and travel around the world! I've already moved to the other side of the world so the first bit is done ;)"
299,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2048986-carrie-kellenberger,4,"The 4 Hour Workweek is full of great advice for anyone who wants a non conventional lifestyle in business. If you want time to live your life instead of being in cubicle day in and day out, this is the book for you. I like being efficient, so I especially enjoyed his chapter on Automation, and I can easily see how to apply it to my own business.Tim Ferris will teach you how to work remotely, how to cut 50% of your work load, and how to live your life to the fullest. He provides solid resources for each chapter, and his ideas are all workable. I think some of his methods are a bit sketchy though. I'm not the kind of person to 'scam a system'. That's probably why I'll never be rich like Tim Ferris. But there are definitely some good takeaways from his book.It will definitely make you think. Read it."
