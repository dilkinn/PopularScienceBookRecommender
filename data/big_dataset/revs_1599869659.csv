'You can have lots of heat, even more heat, super-heat, mega-heat, unlimited heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat, but we don't have anything called 'cold'. We can hit down to 458 degrees below zero, which is no heat, but we can't go any further after that. There is no such thing as cold; otherwise we would be able to go colder than the lowest -458 degrees. Every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy, and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy. Absolute zero (-458 F) is the total absence of heat. You see, sir, cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat. We cannot measure cold. Heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy. Cold is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it.'Silence across the room. A pen drops somewhere in the classroom, sounding like a hammer.'What about darkness, professor.. Is there such a thing as darkness?''Yes,' the professor replies without hesitation. 'What is night if it isn't darkness?''You're wrong again, sir. Darkness is not something; it is the absence of something. You can have low light, normal light, bright light, flashing light, but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and it's called darkness, isn't it? That's the meaning we use to define the word. In reality, darkness isn't. If it were, you would be able to make darkness darker, wouldn't you?'The professor begins to smile at the student in front of him. This will be a good semester. 'So what point are you making, young man?''Yes, professor. My point is, your philosophical premise is flawed to start with, and so your conclusion must also be flawed.'The professor's face cannot hide his surprise this time. 'Flawed? Can you explain how?''You are working on the premise of duality,' the student explains.. 'You argue that there is life and then there's death; a good God and a bad God. You are viewing the concept of God as something finite, something we can measure. Sir, science can't even explain a thought.' 'It uses electricity and magnetism, but has never seen, much less fully understood either one. To view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing. Death is not the opposite of life, just the absence of it.' 'Now tell me, professor... Do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey?''If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process, young man, yes, of course I do.''Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, sir?'The professor begins to shake his head, still smiling, as he realizes where the argument is going. A very good semester, indeed.'Since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavor, are you not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you now not a scientist, but a preacher?'The class is in uproar. The student remains silent until the commotion has subsided. 'To continue the point you were making earlier to the other student, let me give you an example of what I mean.' The student looks around the room. 'Is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professor's brain?' The class breaks out into laughter. 'Is there anyone here who has ever heard the professor's brain, felt the professor's brain, touched or smelt the professor's brain? No one appears to have done so. So, according to the established rules of empirical, stable, demonstrable protocol, science says that you have no brain, with all due respect, sir.' 'So if science says you have no brain, how can we trust your lectures, sir?' Now the room is silent.... The professor just stares at the student, his face unreadable. Finally, after what seems an eternity, the old man answers. 'I Guess you'll have to take them on faith.''Now, you accept that there is faith, and, in fact, faith exists with life,' the student continues. 'Now, sir, is there such a thing as evil?' Now uncertain, the professor responds, 'Of course, there is. We see it Everyday. It is in the daily example of man's inhumanity to man.. It is in The multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world. These manifestations are nothing else but evil.'To this the student replied, 'Evil does not exist sir, or at least it does not exist unto itself. Evil is simply the absence of God. It is just like darkness and cold, a word that man has created to describe the absence of God. God did not create evil. Evil is the result of what happens when man does not have God's love present in his heart. It's like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light.'The professor sat down. If you read it all the way through and had a smile on your face when you finished, mail to your friends and family with the title 'God vs Science'PS: the student was Albert EinsteinAlbert Einstein wrote a book titled God vs Science in 1921....."
1,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/382694-sarah-vanwagenen,4,"ok, don't laugh, but I've been trying to formulate my own ""personal statement"" these last months. You know, what I believe, what I value, what I aspire to... that kind of thing. ""The World As I See It"" is exactly what I'd like to write for myself, for those I love. Of course, it would help if I were Albert Einstein... I certainly don't expect to publish mine. But I want to take the time to think through and articulate ""the world as I see it."" Einstein is a good man-- yeah, he's pretty smart, I guess, but he's also GOOD. And that comes through here. I especially appreciated his conception of religion and its relationship to science: awe and wonder, awe and wonder."
2,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"This is a miscellaneous collection of Einstein's thoughts about life and religion, and war and peace. In this book,an interesting picture of Einstein, as man, emerges.Einstein sees reason manifesting itself in nature and that an appreciation of this reality is to experience the mysterious. It is this experience that ""stands at the cradle of true art and true science"" he writes. While this, along with fear, gave rise to religion, Einstein's religious attitude is all about mystery and not, as he writes, ""the fears of an absurd egoism of feeble souls."" While the scientist ""is possessed by the sense of universal causation,"" Einstein nevertheless taps into a religious feeling that ""takes the form of a rapturous amazement at the harmony of natural law, which reveals an intelligence of such superiority"" that ""...succeeds in keeping [the scientist] from the shackles of selfish desire.""Everything we have done as a human, Einstein writes, ""is concerned with satisfaction of felt needs and the assuagement of pain."" While, with primitive man, fear (avoidance of pain) is the primary religious force, more civilized religions move from fear to a ""moral religion"" that relies on and develops social feelings, and loves and cherishes the life of the tribe or the human race, or even life as such."" In the reference to life itself, Einstein elsewhere seems to value not the tribe or humans per se, but the ""life of all creation."" Beyond fear- and moral-based religions, Einstein sees a ""third state of religious experience"" where science and religion are not opposed. Science feeds into and supports ""a cosmic religious feeling"" that is seen in Buddhism, ""as we have learnt from the wonderful writings of Schopenhauer.""Philosophically, Einstein is focused on the freedom of individuals to develop as creative personalities. Fitting into this picture of life is his recognition of the variability of human nature. ""Nature distributes her gifts variously among her children,"" he states. Accordingly, he is skeptical of state power that interferes with individual freedom. Einstein sees the world from the perspective of the whole where all forms of egoism and its social cousins of tribalism, classicism and nationalism are kept in check. Happiness in a social context comes, he says, ""through renunciation and self-limitation everywhere."" Although only vaguely stated, this need to check the power of the part in deference to the good of the whole appears to be for Einstein a law of reason.Reflecting on this philosophical position, Einstein is also fairly clear that he divides life up between the forces of evil (money, greed, egoism) and the forces of good where ""great and pure characters"" produce ""fine ideas."" Money appeals to selfishness and abuse. On this latter point, he asks, ""can anyone imagine Moses, Jesus or Gandhi armed with the money-bags of Carnegie?"" Also scattered throughout these writings are Einstein's negative comments about war-like attitudes of state power and what he saw occurring in Germany. The exchanges he had with the Prussian Academy of Science regarding his resignation is particularly striking. Here and there, Einstein also makes practical suggestions to counter the abuses of state power. In these writings, Einstein is not particularly systematic. However, there is a comprehensive religious and philosophical worldview that is presented here and there in this book. That worldview is admirable and appealing. "

Our actions and desires are bound up with the existence of other human beings - ""We eat food that others have grown, wear clothes that others have made, live in houses that others have built.

There is too much education all together... the only rational way of educating is to be an example."" A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties; no religious basis is necessary. "

5,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41289357-maica,2,"First, I can say that Einstein was a man of ideals and conviction; nevertheless, his opinions and his views are not to be spared from criticism. I respect Einstein as far as his contributions to science are concerned; but with regards to some of his views political, gender-wise and economic matters stated on this book, I disagree. Initially, his optimistic attitude towards humanity and the individual, the mystery and corresponding beauty of nature and the universe, and spirituality are admirable. But later on, his exchange of letters with his previous associates on Science Academies, his unfailing praise of American culture, took on a different turn. Eventually, I found myself in complete and utter disagreement with his views on Zionism and his praise of its founders (where he says that it is not a political movement, rather as a ‘cultural and social one’). Whereas Einstein criticized the nationalism of the German people, he falls on the other pitfall of promoting Zionist nationalism. No amount of praise will eradicate the fact that Zionism with its occupation of Palestine is established on bloodshed, oppression and massacre of Palestinian people which continues to this day. The praise and justification of Zionism cannot be sugarcoated on idealistic or good-sounding words. If reconciliation was voiced out by Einstein on this book, it was more of the promotion of the Jews and not of the Palestinians. How can reconciliation be possible between peoples where the oppressor derives its existence on its oppression and occupation of the land of the other? "
6,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21985381-len-lira,4,"An Intellectual Giant in many DisciplinesI must admit that the only think I had read of Einstein was, E=mc2. Nonetheless, this collection of his essays and letters demonstrates that he was brilliant in fields afar from physics. His discussion of politics (both domestic and international), economics of nations, the moral decay of pre-WWII Germany, and the interrelationships of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam were all acute for his era when the internet did not exist (meaning he had to be very well read), and prescient for our modern day issues. The one disheartening thing I found in his letters was that he openly despised men who served in the military. Einstein asserts that such a man is despicable because rather than resort to tools of the mind to resolve conflict, they resort to the violence and the baser nature of man as animal. Being a long serving professional soldier and scholar, I was crestfallen that man I so admired, would demonstrate his despise for me from his grave. Regardless, acknowledging Einsteins pacifism and the German military ethic of the era in which Einstein was familiar, I at least understood his sentiment. The book remains a good read which I recommend to others. It's analysis of all the topics discussed above are short. It serves as a book that one can read in one setting, pick up and put down for later reading, or return to again and again for future reference. "

His mentality, opinions, ideas are clearly seen in this collection of articles regarding every kind of topics. A little dull at some places, due to the fact that the articles were written along the years, and some ideas and opinions are being repeated in more articles. Still the effort to gather all the articles is considerable and yet the book is great. You will get to know a genius' opinions on topics as physics of course, but also on philosophy, history, politics, religion, economics or education. 3\4 rating."
9,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22591633-zanna,3,"This abridged edition of letters, speeches and thoughts aims to paint a picture of Einstein as a humanistic and political commentator, philosopher and activist.I felt that the extracts should have been dated; I find the de-contextualisation very annoying and patronising. I was surprised by Einstein's conservatism on issues of education, culture and sexism, matching his scientific conservatism. He is particularly luminous and impressive in his addresses to and about Jews and Jewishness, and the visionary project to build a centre for Jews in Palestine.'I regard it as the chief duty of the State to protect the individual and give him the opportunity to develop into a creative personality''It is for us to solve the problem of living side by side with our brother the Arab in an open, generous, and worthy manner. We have here an opportunity of showing what we have learnt in the thousands of years of our martyrdom. If we choose the right path we shall succeed and give the rest of the world a fine example'"

Although Einstein was not religious he was very committed to Jewishness as a culture. He was clearly antiwar and opposed to any standing armies. I thought the book would've been much more interesting if his writings would've been more clearly placed in their historic context and at least consistently dated."

What I knew of the man behind that iconic frizzy haired picture prior to reading this came from scattered quotes of his I read somewhere or heard from friends. There was eccentricity that drew me in first and then the refreshingly grounded feel one sensed about him that spurred on my fascination about this scientist.This book is a collection of his essays, letters and speeches - minus anything scientific, which I was told was present in the previous edition.I'm not sure about the other editions but mine has no timeline to it that, while I believe them to be chronological, it would have been better if there had been a context of what was going on with the world. Halfway through, however, Einstein spoke about pacifism and later, Disarmament Conference in 1932 so at least the succeeding texts have a firmer setting to them.Personal thoughtsIn this book Einstein talked about a number of things, one I find the most pleasing is curiosity. Einstein placed a lot of importance on curiosity and I like how you can find a lot of quotes where he emphasized this. My favorite:He who [...] can no longer wonder, no longer feel amazement, is as good as dead, a snuffed out candle.There was talk about science and art and how they stemmed from the same root; comments on painting and music, expression of admiration toward people who he had come to know. Einstein talked about religion and how people see God; he advocate against war and valiantly promote pacifism.Initially I thought the book would be fascinating because I wondered how exactly a scientist saw this world, especially a scientist like Einstein. It turned out to be much more than that because it was about how a curious person with a capable intellect and an open mind filled with wonder saw the world."

Mind numbingly repetitive aswell. The few interesting ideas are told over and over again in various letters with only slight variation until they lose all meaning.Only the minor traces of sexism or racism doing anything to break the boredom. This collection takes place entirely in the 30's so missing a rather large event in Einstein's (and everyone elses) life. I don't know if Einstein ever had any interesting opinions but if he did they must be in a different book :P ."

15,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14483017-attila-szabo,4,"I really enjoyed the book. It has a good curve with the following topics* ethics* pacifism* personal letters* religion* physicsThe content was selected by the author. The most interesting take away from this book is Einstein's humbleness. He describes how his work is built upon others and how physics evolved building one concept on the top of the other.My favorite essay is ""Society and Personality"" .""When we survey our lives and endeavors we soon observe that almost the whole of our actions and desires are bound up with the existence of other human beings. We see that our whole nature resembles that of the social animals. We eat food that others have grown, wear clothes that others have made, live in houses that others have built. The greater part of our knowledge and beliefs has been communicated to us by other people through the medium of a language which others have created. Without language our mental capacities would be poor indeed, comparable to those of the higher animals; we have, therefore, to admit that we owe our principal advantage over the beasts to the fact of living in human society. The individual, if left alone from birth would remain primitive and beast-like in his thoughts and feelings to a degree that we can hardly conceive. The individual is what he is and has the significance that he has not so much in virtue of his individuality, but rather as a member of a great human society, which directs his material and spiritual existence from the cradle to the grave""""A man's value to the community depends primarily on how far his feelings, thoughts, and actions are directed towards promoting the good of his fellows. We call him good or bad according to how he stands in this matter. It looks at first sight as if our estimate of a man depended entirely on his social qualities.And yet such an attitude would be wrong. It is clear that all the valuable things, material, spiritual, and moral, which we receive from society can be traced back through countless generations to certain creative individuals. The use of fire, the cultivation of edible plants, the steam engine — each was discovered by one man.Only the individual can think, and thereby create new values for society — nay, even set up new moral standards to which the life of the community conforms. Without creative, independently thinking and judging personalities the upward development of society is as unthinkable as the development of the individual personality without the nourishing soil of the community.The health of society thus depends quite as much on the independence of the individuals composing it as on their close political cohesion."""

Maybe the way that I perceive the world is somehow different from other people.When it comes to describe our ways of seeing the world, we think about many concepts that determine how we really perceive it. Happiness is the objective that many people want to fulfill. However, they forget that to be happy is linked not only with making a big fortune, but happiness is when you see your parents ‘smile. This means the world for me. I will not be joyful, if one my parents is suffering either from a disease, or he is in a dilemma. If at least everyone takes care of his parents , and try to do his best only for the sake of his parent’s smile, I can guarantee that all the world will live in harmony.The world for me is to see people live in peace, without wars or conflicts. Peace, love, respect, solidarity, tolerance and other concepts are what built humanity. When you are peaceful, you can tolerate others even if they hurt you. Moreover, when you respect people, either those who share with you the same culture, religion, values, or those who belong to other cultures, we make the world the best place to live in. Most of the problems that occur every day in our life are due to the inability of people to tolerate each other. We should learn to love without conditions and to tolerate without limitations.Our perceptions about the world differ from one person to the other because we see the world from different angles."

Though he was then fifty years old, the Einstein we find here brims with youthful hope and enthusiasm. Of Jewish linage, he was an agnostic, socialist pacifist (those labels seem inadequate). Of particular interest to readers today is how some of his ideals seem current while others are so out-of-date as to seem quaint. “The man who regards his own life and that of his fellow-creatures as meaningless is not merely unfortunate but almost disqualified for life.” “We exist for our fellow men.” He didn’t believe in God, but admitted to a “cosmic religious feeling” which maintained was “the strongest and noblest incitement to scientific research.” He opposed nationalism but was a Zionist. He hoped that reasonable men could step beyond nationalism and achieve world peace. He renounced his German citizenship in 1933 upon Adolf Hitler’s rise to power.This small volume contains many nuggets of wisdom and not a few chuckles for the reader with the benefit of eighty years of hindsight.Unfortunately, this volume omits “essays by Einstein on relativity and cognate subject” because the editors fear readers unable to understand them.Some of his views changed a lot in the following decade. World War Two did that to lots of folks.Worth reading."
18,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4900149,1,"The preface provides scattered contexts for the essays to follow, but that was no way to inform the reader. By the time I reached the end of the book, I forgot all the information that was condensed in the preface.The book should have organized essays/letters by theme in a chronological fashion, and offered an introduction for each one of them.Some letters could easily be disregarded. For instance, I don't see any interest in reading the exchange that took place between Einstein and the Academy.I find it paradoxical that Einstein ""played a key role in America's development of atomic weapons"", and was a pacifist who strongly advocated disarmament. Were these two different phases that didn't overlap?I do not see any insight in his religious/spiritual views. It's just a single man's personal stand on faith. Einstein was understandably a strong devotee of Zionism as a social and cultural idea. What shocked me is that he referred to Palestine as a ""colonial enterprise"" and mentioned ""the scheme of colonizing Palestine"".The only thing I liked in this book was the pictures at the end."
19,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9500888-italo,2,"The book repeats itself all the time. It's a collection of essays, letters and speeches, and was no supposed to be a book from the beginning. Because of that, it doesn't work well as a book, and most of the essays say something that a previous one has said. The chapter about pacifism is utterly redundant, because he keeps showing his solution to war all the time.A nice book, tells us that one of the greatest minds of the twentieth century was a humanist, a pacifist, and his views about his scientific work and his life. Except for the fact that it wasn't supposed to be a book and wasn't organized as such."

Later he started writing about Jew and their rights, Which I strongly disagree with him at this point specially in their right in Palestine ""the Jew have no right in a nanometer of a land in this pure land"". Clearly Einstein ignored the existence of two very important religion Islam and Christianity and he always refer to Judaism only.I liked the philosophical way that Einstein adapted about individuals rights and freedom. However, what he built on me when I first read the first 50 pages. He destroyed it by the last 62 pages. As I can see some of his ideas or believes are contradicting each other specially about disarmament and freedom and what Zionism did in Palestine. I can't see freedom and individual right either.I believe that Einstein was a scientific genius. However politically, he was very stupid.I think now I have to agree with Stephen hawking when he wrote that brief description about how Einstein fail politically and in trying to be popular.

Much of the pieces here though were written in his later stages, would've loved to read more of his reflections as a young man. Nothing beats the ramblings of a teenager.

45,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105194626-diana,4,"""Failure is success in progress"" Einstein on processI acquired this and many books about the man while creating a theater performance about Albert. Out of all the books I researched this one included some origin stories that made an impression on me. When I was little I was diagnosed dyslexic after writing some letters backwards at school. An SLD teacher intervened and sent me to be tested. I did not get bad grades. It was not that I was incapable, or less intelligent than other students. Even if I was it may not have mattered. What I learned was simple: There are different ways to learn and there are different ways to study. Being the youngest in a big family I learned a lot from just having siblings. I did not have much one on one time with an adult but I did have a built in process of observation and socializing.My IQ was tested when I was seven. I was nervous. I was already acutely aware of the stigma attached to the feedback I was getting. 90 percent of the adults around me did not understand what learning ""disabilities"" actually were. I think young people are often not diagnosed correctly or taught accordingly. From a very young age I had a hyper awareness of everything I did because in a big group of older siblings I was told what and how to do things several times over. When I wanted to do something on my own I dragged it under the table. That was crucial to learning. One of the things I did a lot of was listening. By the time it was my turn to read I had heard my sisters sounding out words at the kitchen table for a few years so I put together words fast and I loved stories. That was fortunate. I.Q. may be able to tell us about how some people reason but it is not the only factor in determining intelligence. The Dr. was very excited and she told my mom a bit about what area my reasoning skill set fell into and my ""percentile"". Suddenly the way I was being viewed before completely changed. Why? The high number meant I was ok? She told my Mom I should be a brain surgeon. No kidding. She also made a point to tell me Einstein had trouble counting pocket change. This was a revelation to me. I could count pocket change! The very act of her lifting that burden from my tender mind grounded me in a very important reality. We have so much depth as people. You no sooner could scoop up a handful of ocean and say ""nope, there are no whales in the ocean"", than you can limit people. I can see why she felt I could be a brain surgeon because of how my mind ""worked"" not because I was a horizon child who was bored with how easy math was.  I may be average or genius or both at once. Practice certainly improves our ability in any field but I am more interested on Einsteins take on developing our imagination and ingenuity. Because most of us will not be gifted a career, a business,or a home. Many highly skilled and intelligent people in the world are trying to have clean water, electricity, a way to get a loan to finance the means to survive. Even looking at the toys children refugees create from old cartons and recycled tin, the systems of purifying water, harnessing wind power. Most of these people have never been tested for intelligence and their skill sets may never be, but the intelligence is obvious if you look and listen. So when it comes to the USA and our classroom doctrine and systems of importance I urge anyone struggling to not be discouraged.  A very big part of who we become is who we desire to be and who molds us what we are exposed to and how. The brain is coded so uniquely for each individual person it truly is a fascinating subject. It also occured to me that being told I was smart and capable of great things instead of the opposite, made me identify with that aspect of myself. Whereas before at that age, I could have very easily identified with not being capable.Being shamed, putting all my energy into something else so I could feel accepted. It may be a popular opinion that ""participating"" doesn't deserve a ribbon, and that standardized testing, SAT's , ACT's will sort everything out for the best and the brightest but how can we know that? If Albert had stayed in Nazi era Germany as a failing patent clerk he may have died. Without this immigrants contributions where would we be? There are other seemingly ordinary or below average people in the world like Einstein who suffer mockery for being slow or different or innovative. People who do not even imagine the depth of their own potential. Illarion Merculief in a Native Alaskan teacher who wrote at length about when he was a child. When his particular education began he was rarely spoken to at all, or directed by adults. He shadowed his elders in everything they did. So he developed his ability, attention span, interpersonal skill, and the ability to be a free thinker.  Working with musicians from Mali I noted how advanced little toddlers were at their instruments. They too had a unique education yielding uncommon skill levels. Some ancient cultures were forced to assimilate and in converting their style of education the wealth of wisdom and education they had already developed was sadly overlooked, forgotten or forbidden.  The greatest minds throughout the ages seem to have realized this. It is radical to re-imagine ones place. To not need the best diploma or any at all, the right looks, the correct car,the perfect community. Einsteins letters to his college friends were endearing and exhillerating, witty and wonderful. None of them were considered genius or important in status. I value deeply the great teachers I have had in my life. I am not saying I think education is not amazing. It is. I am also saying teachers are everywhere. Einstein spoke often about the power of imagination. A typical assignment for kids is to draw a line from one object to the other object that it matches. I never liked those. Then I learned that there was a canned answer. That firemen matched fire hoses, and cement mixers matched streets! So simple! I realized I was looking at the questions and seeing multiple possibilities. I found that more interesting. I would enjoy finding the similarities between fireman and piggy bank, or fireman and baby. It is funny to some people that I had to learn that the questions were written with a projected answer. If I learned what they projected I got the questions right. I stopped questioning and was rewarded for it.  As I matured I found the flaws in that style of education. I understand of course there is only a given amount of time to cover a certain amount of selected material. I learned the formulas that got the answers the quickest way. But my interest was not ignited. The dates and locations of wars centuries old were memorized over hours and hours the first 18 years of my life, while current policy and social and economic problems were never part of school. There were segregated learning groups based on how fast students were. Some kids with debilitating fear of reading out loud were forced to. Some that would have panic attacks playing basketball were forced to. Thats part of learning right?  There were those wonderful teachers that would carve out a lesson in the Earth Science curriculum to bring in an abandoned bee hive or to dissect owl pellets! The petition to our parents for a car wash so we could get the money to go to a waterfall and draw native plants, or to see Shindler's list at a movie house, or to see African masks at an art museum, or to visit a court house or a high power telescope. They knew that interest is essential.  Reading Einsteins book would make anyone re-think our traditional education system. Einstein teaches that knowing is not the same as understanding. More importantly, that with imagination we can solve the problems that do not have canned answers. This is who Einstein was at a fundamental level. It is hard to impart complicated theories. Even when we have learned them and passed a test we forget them. Thankfully if we recall our process of how we learned, the wisdom will never be lost. The theater piece I created began inside a card board box. I was only intending to crawl into the box while I thought. It originally was just going to be me playing in a laundry hamper as a kid (I use to do that) and the prop box would become other things throughout the story. But as I rehearsed and kept going back into the box I realized it became quite symbolic of my mind. I had a great clown teacher helping me with some physical comedy so the first scene was trying to get out of the box in every manner of way. It took a ton of practice to look true and be funny. We used an Animal Collective song. A box could be a black hole, a brain, a desk, a ship, it could be the cubicle of a poor young patent clerk named Albert. It had no rules.... yet. It was limitless. As I stripped away the limits so too did the people on the journey with me. When I put them back the reality was new. If you have ever been taught Einsteins theories on gravity, time, space and relativity, we use props to make the abstract more tangible. We show its circumstance changing, factors changing, actions changing. How else could we understand a collapsed star, mass volume, gravity , and the speed of light. Understanding what is beyond what we can see is made possible through imagination. We do it in spite of ourselves. Any number of factors can change a thing in time and space. There is something in that nothing there. Somthing that may lead to a white hole, or another universe. That great mystery just keeps unfolding and giving us more uses for our intelligence. That is made possible through our imagination. The book is personal. He was thought by many to be slow or useless in the beginning. He went through failures and through job after job. He experienced all the anxiety and stress that comes of feeling out of place and out of step and misunderstood. This is what I wanted to use to tell the story I found interesting. When Einstein finds his path he triumphantly edifies our lives with his unprecedented discoveries. Moreover his humility and generosity of spirit is so devoid of ego he offers evolved insights on life with signature humility and grace. His story inspires us to be generous in our assessment of the ability of anyone struggling. Wether it be in training another person at work, or learning a new life skill or subject, or going through hardship. When we feel superior because of what we know rather than what we understand we miss the opportunity to teach, to evolve, and most importantly to discover. Many people who are ashamed of what they dont know, or didn't learn, or learned differently, may not ever realize that they have an elegant mind and many gifts unique to them.Some of us have been taught to be afraid to be wrong so we never learn. Albert taught me to ask questions, to not assume I know the most, to not let others dictate my worth based on a spelling error or lack of information or solid teacher. Einstein's story reminds us to never underestimate anyone.I think anxiety and stress are blocks produced by outdated attitudes that can be changed. We all must fail so we can learn. That does not mean we should try to make misstakes. That would be a pretty pittiful assesment of this lesson. It means you can perfect a 3 point shot if you try and fail many times and learn from that failure. It means that you can be a great math teacher if math was a difficult subject for you, It means to create somthing transcendent the work that leads up to it might not be understood or might get put down, it means when you work at a sandwich shop, or as a surgeon, as an actor or a musician all of your success came from your process of getting things wrong until you got it right. Einstein lived this truth, that is why his quote is so crucial for us to remember. He said, ""Failure is success in progress."" Failure is as important to ones work as success is. The world may not want us to realize that but it is true. People with less patience might like you to think they do everything right the first time but that isnt true. We often hear make it ""look effortless"". That does not mean it was. I also think if we heeded Einstein's statement we would find a great deal of people whose hard work was never given credit, so that someone else could say it was ""effortless"", or could say it was their own idea so they could profit from it. Throughout time whole cultures of people were deemed ""ignorant"", ""insignificant"", ""barbaric"", 'useless to educate"" by people who swindled them and feared them. We know better than that. Thankfully Einstein had the courage and was motivated by his love of the world to continue his work.Reading his own words in this book is a treasure."

It’s all--academics, religion, the economy and socioeconomic class, politics, war, discrimination, national and international relations, humanity and the human condition--really quite simple. And yet, here humanity is, 86 years later, still allowing and even endorsing those in power to ignore the insightful, educated words of our scientists, philosophers, historians, and humanitarians and to continue making horrifying, short-sighted decisions that solely benefit the greedy cullions who don’t give a flip about humanity (or anyone other than themselves, really). Rant over--but seriously--”baaaaaa.”Back to the review: The World As I See It is an accessible portal into the brilliant mind of a man who has a great deal of insight on world issues and solutions that are incredibly relevant today (isn’t that interesting). I will say that there were moments when a few of Einstein’s solutions seemed idealized, but I cannot help but question whether or not mine is a slightly tainted, cynical perspective of someone who lives in a world where the greedy, powerful few have spread propaganda against the success of these types of solutions. There were also a few sections of the book that felt repetitive but, to Einstein’s credit, there are only so many ways that one can tactfully say “stop being a stupid, short-sighted cur and stop believing stupid, short-sighted curs ‘cause that’s why the world is going to hell.” Side note - I particularly enjoyed what Einstein had to say about science and religion in chapter 1 as well as his praise of the arts and their relevant significance throughout the entirety of this book (particularly fiction writers). Potential quotations and excerpts to come."

Some are interesting, others are rather less interesting.Regardless of his own thoughts, what mostly drew my attention was how Einstein (and many of the scientists he corresponded with) was such a public figure; he held correspondences and had influence over political figures (he was offered, and turned down, the presidency of Israel after all), and yet he thought that men of science and literature were not participating enough in ruling the world. I wonder what he would say if he saw the world today.Anyhow, the articles I highlighted and underlined the most are:The World As I See ItGood and EvilSociety and PersonalityTo the Schoolchildren of JapanReligion and ScienceSome Notes on My American ImpressionTo Sigmund FreudThe International of ScienceThe Institute for Intellectual Co-operationThe Question of DisarmamentThoughts on the World Economic CrisisCulture and ProsperityGermany and the Prussian Academy of ScienceLetter to an Arab"

While I knew he was a pacifist, I didn't realize how outspoken Einstein was on the subject of anti-war. In many letters and essays dating from pre-WW2, he felt that mandatory service in any country's military should be outlawed and that Christians, Jews, and Muslims could live peacefully in the Middle East, giving very specific recommendations for his ideas of how to achieve a mutual understanding. "
49,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2855257-christine,4,"Albert Einstein had thoughts about just about everything. He had a fine sense of social justice and he was a keen observer of his world....which sounds suspiciously like our world today. The thing that struck me most about this book, only 112 pages long and chock full of wisdom, was how much Einstein's thoughts seemed to be written for the worried 21st century citizen. He talked about the dangers of nationalism and how he felt that the American government was in a position to be the needed global leader, but that the people of America had some trouble with that idea, how nationalism disguised as patriotism is dangerous. He spoke of the need for world leaders to stick together to inspire and protect each other' s homelands.He had ideas about labor, wages, and the need for free markets, but with regulations in place in industries which become monopolies or cartels. He talked about culture, unemployment, and the best, healthy relationship of individuals within a state. Einstein was a globalist, and he made his case very well. I have had this book since I was a teen long ago but I just read it. It fits right into today's world."

I say ""essays"" because they're more like scattered thoughts without much structure or depth. Very random too. One might argue they are interesting, and they can be, some more than others. But for the most part, it's a pass. One thing I took away from reading it is that his mind was not so sophisticated in the humanities side of the spectrum; it was clear that he was too busy becoming a genius of physics and mathematics to worry about studying political science, sociology, international relations and other human science subjects before discussing it. Yet he shared his opinions. And don't get me wrong, they are valid. If you are curious, go ahead. But in most cases you won't find it much different from talking to an ordinary person next to you in the bus stop."

56,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/558933-aditi,4,"My scattered thoughts: As far as Science is concerned, I liked that he conveyed the fact that Science is work, not magic. The more you work, the more magical your mind seems to others, but it is all a result of work, work and more work. The popular narratives for most famous scientists almost always make them out to be superhumans - they usually made their discoveries by simply dreaming or staring into fires or taking a walk. Einstein corrects that view. I also liked his address on Lorentz, where I learnt for the first time, the role played by Lorentz in ""unifying"" scientists. As far as politics is concerned, Einstein's world as he saw it, consisted primarily of Germany and the USA. To a lesser extent other parts of Europe. The book should have been titled ""Germany and the awesome USA as I see it"". Yes, he was dazzled by the riches of America and didn't bother wondering where they came from. He was also fascinated by privatisation. Although, I guess when he visited, not everything was privatised (banks, prisons, wars etc), so his fascination may be justified. The collection is a bit repetitive - especially the parts concerning pacifism/disarmament. A few speeches/letters would have been sufficient. Also, the language is a bit weird. Overall, it was somewhat fun knowing his ideas, although I do not completely agree with him and he seems to not like women much. "

The writings represented another side of Einstein's personality, beside the fact about his genius as well known. They revealed his views on some aspects of life and international issues. You can find his point of view about life, science, education, liberty, world economic crisis, war, disarmament, military, politic, nationalism, American, European, Jewish, etc.Reading this book, I see Einstein's great attention in the development of science and education. I was interested on his view about the relation between science and religion. He was quite wise on the thought. Toward the international progress on the time, he also showed his attention and comments, his agreement and disagreement. And as I noticed, he put the psychological aspect and humanity in a high place.Well, overall, he was cool in some part of his wisdom on seeing the life and its components.But, as a Jewish, he appreciated the formation and the progress of Zionism too high. His point of view about Zionism and the foundation of Jewish nation at Palestine wasn't in agreement with the facts. Yeah... we've already seen..."

Maybe because most of the essays in the book are translated ! However I found the few ideas I grasped interesting. The one related to mandatory army service is new to me. Haven't thought about the issue like that before and I don't think it is too simple like that. 'To stop war around the world we need to fight the narrow nationalism and prevent the countries from having compulsory service in the army' This really simplifies the case. However it still needs to be considered in further readings. One more idea that really hooked me was about the economy; Real and apparent over-production. I always thought about that ! To have all the people work and unemployment to reach zero, for sure there will be an over production of goods which means that consumption increase and people will be busy consuming goods. High consumption rate will degrade humanity into materialistic society. The question I always asked; How to make everyone work in a society while producing enough good for everyone ?! I am still searching for a book that can answer that question !"

He was no doubt a wise man and a seeker of truth and peace. The political ideals in which he believed in are to be admired, especially when considering the hard times he lived in. The book shows a great variety of letters in which Albert Einstein expresses his views on matters of war and peace, economics and education all around the world.I was going to give it 4 stars, but the last 10 pages of the book were somehow disappointing. Being a Jew, Einstein was standing, of course, in the favour of anything in interest of the Jew community. He absolutely supported the Zionist project in Palestine and saw that the Jews had every right for that movement. Understandable, if he hadn't been such an enthusiast about peace and the ending of all the violence in this world. Those letters being written in 1933, I wonder what his opinion was after witnessing the masaccers of 1948.."

75,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105194626-diana,4,"""Failure is success in progress"" Einstein on processI acquired this and many books about the man while creating a theater performance about Albert. Out of all the books I researched this one included some origin stories that made an impression on me. When I was little I was diagnosed dyslexic after writing some letters backwards at school. An SLD teacher intervened and sent me to be tested. I did not get bad grades. It was not that I was incapable, or less intelligent than other students. Even if I was it may not have mattered. What I learned was simple: There are different ways to learn and there are different ways to study. Being the youngest in a big family I learned a lot from just having siblings. I did not have much one on one time with an adult but I did have a built in process of observation and socializing.My IQ was tested when I was seven. I was nervous. I was already acutely aware of the stigma attached to the feedback I was getting. 90 percent of the adults around me did not understand what learning ""disabilities"" actually were. I think young people are often not diagnosed correctly or taught accordingly. From a very young age I had a hyper awareness of everything I did because in a big group of older siblings I was told what and how to do things several times over. When I wanted to do something on my own I dragged it under the table. That was crucial to learning. One of the things I did a lot of was listening. By the time it was my turn to read I had heard my sisters sounding out words at the kitchen table for a few years so I put together words fast and I loved stories. That was fortunate. I.Q. may be able to tell us about how some people reason but it is not the only factor in determining intelligence. The Dr. was very excited and she told my mom a bit about what area my reasoning skill set fell into and my ""percentile"". Suddenly the way I was being viewed before completely changed. Why? The high number meant I was ok? She told my Mom I should be a brain surgeon. No kidding. She also made a point to tell me Einstein had trouble counting pocket change. This was a revelation to me. I could count pocket change! The very act of her lifting that burden from my tender mind grounded me in a very important reality. We have so much depth as people. You no sooner could scoop up a handful of ocean and say ""nope, there are no whales in the ocean"", than you can limit people. I can see why she felt I could be a brain surgeon because of how my mind ""worked"" not because I was a horizon child who was bored with how easy math was.  I may be average or genius or both at once. Practice certainly improves our ability in any field but I am more interested on Einsteins take on developing our imagination and ingenuity. Because most of us will not be gifted a career, a business,or a home. Many highly skilled and intelligent people in the world are trying to have clean water, electricity, a way to get a loan to finance the means to survive. Even looking at the toys children refugees create from old cartons and recycled tin, the systems of purifying water, harnessing wind power. Most of these people have never been tested for intelligence and their skill sets may never be, but the intelligence is obvious if you look and listen. So when it comes to the USA and our classroom doctrine and systems of importance I urge anyone struggling to not be discouraged.  A very big part of who we become is who we desire to be and who molds us what we are exposed to and how. The brain is coded so uniquely for each individual person it truly is a fascinating subject. It also occured to me that being told I was smart and capable of great things instead of the opposite, made me identify with that aspect of myself. Whereas before at that age, I could have very easily identified with not being capable.Being shamed, putting all my energy into something else so I could feel accepted. It may be a popular opinion that ""participating"" doesn't deserve a ribbon, and that standardized testing, SAT's , ACT's will sort everything out for the best and the brightest but how can we know that? If Albert had stayed in Nazi era Germany as a failing patent clerk he may have died. Without this immigrants contributions where would we be? There are other seemingly ordinary or below average people in the world like Einstein who suffer mockery for being slow or different or innovative. People who do not even imagine the depth of their own potential. Illarion Merculief in a Native Alaskan teacher who wrote at length about when he was a child. When his particular education began he was rarely spoken to at all, or directed by adults. He shadowed his elders in everything they did. So he developed his ability, attention span, interpersonal skill, and the ability to be a free thinker.  Working with musicians from Mali I noted how advanced little toddlers were at their instruments. They too had a unique education yielding uncommon skill levels. Some ancient cultures were forced to assimilate and in converting their style of education the wealth of wisdom and education they had already developed was sadly overlooked, forgotten or forbidden.  The greatest minds throughout the ages seem to have realized this. It is radical to re-imagine ones place. To not need the best diploma or any at all, the right looks, the correct car,the perfect community. Einsteins letters to his college friends were endearing and exhillerating, witty and wonderful. None of them were considered genius or important in status. I value deeply the great teachers I have had in my life. I am not saying I think education is not amazing. It is. I am also saying teachers are everywhere. Einstein spoke often about the power of imagination. A typical assignment for kids is to draw a line from one object to the other object that it matches. I never liked those. Then I learned that there was a canned answer. That firemen matched fire hoses, and cement mixers matched streets! So simple! I realized I was looking at the questions and seeing multiple possibilities. I found that more interesting. I would enjoy finding the similarities between fireman and piggy bank, or fireman and baby. It is funny to some people that I had to learn that the questions were written with a projected answer. If I learned what they projected I got the questions right. I stopped questioning and was rewarded for it.  As I matured I found the flaws in that style of education. I understand of course there is only a given amount of time to cover a certain amount of selected material. I learned the formulas that got the answers the quickest way. But my interest was not ignited. The dates and locations of wars centuries old were memorized over hours and hours the first 18 years of my life, while current policy and social and economic problems were never part of school. There were segregated learning groups based on how fast students were. Some kids with debilitating fear of reading out loud were forced to. Some that would have panic attacks playing basketball were forced to. Thats part of learning right?  There were those wonderful teachers that would carve out a lesson in the Earth Science curriculum to bring in an abandoned bee hive or to dissect owl pellets! The petition to our parents for a car wash so we could get the money to go to a waterfall and draw native plants, or to see Shindler's list at a movie house, or to see African masks at an art museum, or to visit a court house or a high power telescope. They knew that interest is essential.  Reading Einsteins book would make anyone re-think our traditional education system. Einstein teaches that knowing is not the same as understanding. More importantly, that with imagination we can solve the problems that do not have canned answers. This is who Einstein was at a fundamental level. It is hard to impart complicated theories. Even when we have learned them and passed a test we forget them. Thankfully if we recall our process of how we learned, the wisdom will never be lost. The theater piece I created began inside a card board box. I was only intending to crawl into the box while I thought. It originally was just going to be me playing in a laundry hamper as a kid (I use to do that) and the prop box would become other things throughout the story. But as I rehearsed and kept going back into the box I realized it became quite symbolic of my mind. I had a great clown teacher helping me with some physical comedy so the first scene was trying to get out of the box in every manner of way. It took a ton of practice to look true and be funny. We used an Animal Collective song. A box could be a black hole, a brain, a desk, a ship, it could be the cubicle of a poor young patent clerk named Albert. It had no rules.... yet. It was limitless. As I stripped away the limits so too did the people on the journey with me. When I put them back the reality was new. If you have ever been taught Einsteins theories on gravity, time, space and relativity, we use props to make the abstract more tangible. We show its circumstance changing, factors changing, actions changing. How else could we understand a collapsed star, mass volume, gravity , and the speed of light. Understanding what is beyond what we can see is made possible through imagination. We do it in spite of ourselves. Any number of factors can change a thing in time and space. There is something in that nothing there. Somthing that may lead to a white hole, or another universe. That great mystery just keeps unfolding and giving us more uses for our intelligence. That is made possible through our imagination. The book is personal. He was thought by many to be slow or useless in the beginning. He went through failures and through job after job. He experienced all the anxiety and stress that comes of feeling out of place and out of step and misunderstood. This is what I wanted to use to tell the story I found interesting. When Einstein finds his path he triumphantly edifies our lives with his unprecedented discoveries. Moreover his humility and generosity of spirit is so devoid of ego he offers evolved insights on life with signature humility and grace. His story inspires us to be generous in our assessment of the ability of anyone struggling. Wether it be in training another person at work, or learning a new life skill or subject, or going through hardship. When we feel superior because of what we know rather than what we understand we miss the opportunity to teach, to evolve, and most importantly to discover. Many people who are ashamed of what they dont know, or didn't learn, or learned differently, may not ever realize that they have an elegant mind and many gifts unique to them.Some of us have been taught to be afraid to be wrong so we never learn. Albert taught me to ask questions, to not assume I know the most, to not let others dictate my worth based on a spelling error or lack of information or solid teacher. Einstein's story reminds us to never underestimate anyone.I think anxiety and stress are blocks produced by outdated attitudes that can be changed. We all must fail so we can learn. That does not mean we should try to make misstakes. That would be a pretty pittiful assesment of this lesson. It means you can perfect a 3 point shot if you try and fail many times and learn from that failure. It means that you can be a great math teacher if math was a difficult subject for you, It means to create somthing transcendent the work that leads up to it might not be understood or might get put down, it means when you work at a sandwich shop, or as a surgeon, as an actor or a musician all of your success came from your process of getting things wrong until you got it right. Einstein lived this truth, that is why his quote is so crucial for us to remember. He said, ""Failure is success in progress."" Failure is as important to ones work as success is. The world may not want us to realize that but it is true. People with less patience might like you to think they do everything right the first time but that isnt true. We often hear make it ""look effortless"". That does not mean it was. I also think if we heeded Einstein's statement we would find a great deal of people whose hard work was never given credit, so that someone else could say it was ""effortless"", or could say it was their own idea so they could profit from it. Throughout time whole cultures of people were deemed ""ignorant"", ""insignificant"", ""barbaric"", 'useless to educate"" by people who swindled them and feared them. We know better than that. Thankfully Einstein had the courage and was motivated by his love of the world to continue his work.Reading his own words in this book is a treasure."

It’s all--academics, religion, the economy and socioeconomic class, politics, war, discrimination, national and international relations, humanity and the human condition--really quite simple. And yet, here humanity is, 86 years later, still allowing and even endorsing those in power to ignore the insightful, educated words of our scientists, philosophers, historians, and humanitarians and to continue making horrifying, short-sighted decisions that solely benefit the greedy cullions who don’t give a flip about humanity (or anyone other than themselves, really). Rant over--but seriously--”baaaaaa.”Back to the review: The World As I See It is an accessible portal into the brilliant mind of a man who has a great deal of insight on world issues and solutions that are incredibly relevant today (isn’t that interesting). I will say that there were moments when a few of Einstein’s solutions seemed idealized, but I cannot help but question whether or not mine is a slightly tainted, cynical perspective of someone who lives in a world where the greedy, powerful few have spread propaganda against the success of these types of solutions. There were also a few sections of the book that felt repetitive but, to Einstein’s credit, there are only so many ways that one can tactfully say “stop being a stupid, short-sighted cur and stop believing stupid, short-sighted curs ‘cause that’s why the world is going to hell.” Side note - I particularly enjoyed what Einstein had to say about science and religion in chapter 1 as well as his praise of the arts and their relevant significance throughout the entirety of this book (particularly fiction writers). Potential quotations and excerpts to come."
77,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22761811-zainab-ali,3,"This is a collection of Albert Einstein's letters and articles discussing different matters, including science, religion, education and politics. Some are interesting, others are rather less interesting.Regardless of his own thoughts, what mostly drew my attention was how Einstein (and many of the scientists he corresponded with) was such a public figure; he held correspondences and had influence over political figures (he was offered, and turned down, the presidency of Israel after all), and yet he thought that men of science and literature were not participating enough in ruling the world. I wonder what he would say if he saw the world today.Anyhow, the articles I highlighted and underlined the most are:The World As I See ItGood and EvilSociety and PersonalityTo the Schoolchildren of JapanReligion and ScienceSome Notes on My American ImpressionTo Sigmund FreudThe International of ScienceThe Institute for Intellectual Co-operationThe Question of DisarmamentThoughts on the World Economic CrisisCulture and ProsperityGermany and the Prussian Academy of ScienceLetter to an Arab"
78,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36886417-kelly-r,4,"Sometimes a challenge to read because of its wordy translation from German, but some very interesting ideas. While I knew he was a pacifist, I didn't realize how outspoken Einstein was on the subject of anti-war. In many letters and essays dating from pre-WW2, he felt that mandatory service in any country's military should be outlawed and that Christians, Jews, and Muslims could live peacefully in the Middle East, giving very specific recommendations for his ideas of how to achieve a mutual understanding. "
79,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2855257-christine,4,"Albert Einstein had thoughts about just about everything. He had a fine sense of social justice and he was a keen observer of his world....which sounds suspiciously like our world today. The thing that struck me most about this book, only 112 pages long and chock full of wisdom, was how much Einstein's thoughts seemed to be written for the worried 21st century citizen. He talked about the dangers of nationalism and how he felt that the American government was in a position to be the needed global leader, but that the people of America had some trouble with that idea, how nationalism disguised as patriotism is dangerous. He spoke of the need for world leaders to stick together to inspire and protect each other' s homelands.He had ideas about labor, wages, and the need for free markets, but with regulations in place in industries which become monopolies or cartels. He talked about culture, unemployment, and the best, healthy relationship of individuals within a state. Einstein was a globalist, and he made his case very well. I have had this book since I was a teen long ago but I just read it. It fits right into today's world."
80,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19761789-joshua-k-b-mayr,4,"What struck me the most about this book is Albert’s attitude: his modesty, his grateful appreciation for those who came before him, his love for peace and, at the same time, the awareness to have brought to the world something historical and beautiful. Needless to say, a true genius of modern times. "

82,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102854177-lucas-cavalcanti,1,"Really boring, annoying even. It's a collection of a bunch of short ""essays"" on various topics. I say ""essays"" because they're more like scattered thoughts without much structure or depth. Very random too. One might argue they are interesting, and they can be, some more than others. But for the most part, it's a pass. One thing I took away from reading it is that his mind was not so sophisticated in the humanities side of the spectrum; it was clear that he was too busy becoming a genius of physics and mathematics to worry about studying political science, sociology, international relations and other human science subjects before discussing it. Yet he shared his opinions. And don't get me wrong, they are valid. If you are curious, go ahead. But in most cases you won't find it much different from talking to an ordinary person next to you in the bus stop."

86,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/558933-aditi,4,"My scattered thoughts: As far as Science is concerned, I liked that he conveyed the fact that Science is work, not magic. The more you work, the more magical your mind seems to others, but it is all a result of work, work and more work. The popular narratives for most famous scientists almost always make them out to be superhumans - they usually made their discoveries by simply dreaming or staring into fires or taking a walk. Einstein corrects that view. I also liked his address on Lorentz, where I learnt for the first time, the role played by Lorentz in ""unifying"" scientists. As far as politics is concerned, Einstein's world as he saw it, consisted primarily of Germany and the USA. To a lesser extent other parts of Europe. The book should have been titled ""Germany and the awesome USA as I see it"". Yes, he was dazzled by the riches of America and didn't bother wondering where they came from. He was also fascinated by privatisation. Although, I guess when he visited, not everything was privatised (banks, prisons, wars etc), so his fascination may be justified. The collection is a bit repetitive - especially the parts concerning pacifism/disarmament. A few speeches/letters would have been sufficient. Also, the language is a bit weird. Overall, it was somewhat fun knowing his ideas, although I do not completely agree with him and he seems to not like women much. "
87,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/563102-euisry-noor,3,"This book contains the collection of some Einstein's essays, include his thoughts taken from his articles, letters, pronouncements, and addresses. The writings represented another side of Einstein's personality, beside the fact about his genius as well known. They revealed his views on some aspects of life and international issues. You can find his point of view about life, science, education, liberty, world economic crisis, war, disarmament, military, politic, nationalism, American, European, Jewish, etc.Reading this book, I see Einstein's great attention in the development of science and education. I was interested on his view about the relation between science and religion. He was quite wise on the thought. Toward the international progress on the time, he also showed his attention and comments, his agreement and disagreement. And as I noticed, he put the psychological aspect and humanity in a high place.Well, overall, he was cool in some part of his wisdom on seeing the life and its components.But, as a Jewish, he appreciated the formation and the progress of Zionism too high. His point of view about Zionism and the foundation of Jewish nation at Palestine wasn't in agreement with the facts. Yeah... we've already seen..."
88,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361765-mohamed,3,"Couldn't really understand everything in the book. The language structure is little bit complicated. Maybe because most of the essays in the book are translated ! However I found the few ideas I grasped interesting. The one related to mandatory army service is new to me. Haven't thought about the issue like that before and I don't think it is too simple like that. 'To stop war around the world we need to fight the narrow nationalism and prevent the countries from having compulsory service in the army' This really simplifies the case. However it still needs to be considered in further readings. One more idea that really hooked me was about the economy; Real and apparent over-production. I always thought about that ! To have all the people work and unemployment to reach zero, for sure there will be an over production of goods which means that consumption increase and people will be busy consuming goods. High consumption rate will degrade humanity into materialistic society. The question I always asked; How to make everyone work in a society while producing enough good for everyone ?! I am still searching for a book that can answer that question !"
89,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13783461-hamzah-taha,3,"It was a pleasent experience to get to know Einstein from a different side, the non-physician in this case. He was no doubt a wise man and a seeker of truth and peace. The political ideals in which he believed in are to be admired, especially when considering the hard times he lived in. The book shows a great variety of letters in which Albert Einstein expresses his views on matters of war and peace, economics and education all around the world.I was going to give it 4 stars, but the last 10 pages of the book were somehow disappointing. Being a Jew, Einstein was standing, of course, in the favour of anything in interest of the Jew community. He absolutely supported the Zionist project in Palestine and saw that the Jews had every right for that movement. Understandable, if he hadn't been such an enthusiast about peace and the ending of all the violence in this world. Those letters being written in 1933, I wonder what his opinion was after witnessing the masaccers of 1948.."

Not just because you are reading the words of a genius which makes it difficult to keep up anyway! But also because the writing style is in a very old English format, so I had to read some paragraphs twice or three times just to catch exactly what he was saying. Most of it was very boring, but some parts are interesting to see his views on things. Like his take on Nazi Germany, and his view on the Israel & Palestine conflict.

The one negative comment is that some of these letters and speeches reiterate each other and made some parts of this book drag a bit. A good read nevertheless.
99,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/356756-jeff,2,It's annoying to read all these speeches and letters without context or even a year mentioned.

105,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105194626-diana,4,"""Failure is success in progress"" Einstein on processI acquired this and many books about the man while creating a theater performance about Albert. Out of all the books I researched this one included some origin stories that made an impression on me. When I was little I was diagnosed dyslexic after writing some letters backwards at school. An SLD teacher intervened and sent me to be tested. I did not get bad grades. It was not that I was incapable, or less intelligent than other students. Even if I was it may not have mattered. What I learned was simple: There are different ways to learn and there are different ways to study. Being the youngest in a big family I learned a lot from just having siblings. I did not have much one on one time with an adult but I did have a built in process of observation and socializing.My IQ was tested when I was seven. I was nervous. I was already acutely aware of the stigma attached to the feedback I was getting. 90 percent of the adults around me did not understand what learning ""disabilities"" actually were. I think young people are often not diagnosed correctly or taught accordingly. From a very young age I had a hyper awareness of everything I did because in a big group of older siblings I was told what and how to do things several times over. When I wanted to do something on my own I dragged it under the table. That was crucial to learning. One of the things I did a lot of was listening. By the time it was my turn to read I had heard my sisters sounding out words at the kitchen table for a few years so I put together words fast and I loved stories. That was fortunate. I.Q. may be able to tell us about how some people reason but it is not the only factor in determining intelligence. The Dr. was very excited and she told my mom a bit about what area my reasoning skill set fell into and my ""percentile"". Suddenly the way I was being viewed before completely changed. Why? The high number meant I was ok? She told my Mom I should be a brain surgeon. No kidding. She also made a point to tell me Einstein had trouble counting pocket change. This was a revelation to me. I could count pocket change! The very act of her lifting that burden from my tender mind grounded me in a very important reality. We have so much depth as people. You no sooner could scoop up a handful of ocean and say ""nope, there are no whales in the ocean"", than you can limit people. I can see why she felt I could be a brain surgeon because of how my mind ""worked"" not because I was a horizon child who was bored with how easy math was.  I may be average or genius or both at once. Practice certainly improves our ability in any field but I am more interested on Einsteins take on developing our imagination and ingenuity. Because most of us will not be gifted a career, a business,or a home. Many highly skilled and intelligent people in the world are trying to have clean water, electricity, a way to get a loan to finance the means to survive. Even looking at the toys children refugees create from old cartons and recycled tin, the systems of purifying water, harnessing wind power. Most of these people have never been tested for intelligence and their skill sets may never be, but the intelligence is obvious if you look and listen. So when it comes to the USA and our classroom doctrine and systems of importance I urge anyone struggling to not be discouraged.  A very big part of who we become is who we desire to be and who molds us what we are exposed to and how. The brain is coded so uniquely for each individual person it truly is a fascinating subject. It also occured to me that being told I was smart and capable of great things instead of the opposite, made me identify with that aspect of myself. Whereas before at that age, I could have very easily identified with not being capable.Being shamed, putting all my energy into something else so I could feel accepted. It may be a popular opinion that ""participating"" doesn't deserve a ribbon, and that standardized testing, SAT's , ACT's will sort everything out for the best and the brightest but how can we know that? If Albert had stayed in Nazi era Germany as a failing patent clerk he may have died. Without this immigrants contributions where would we be? There are other seemingly ordinary or below average people in the world like Einstein who suffer mockery for being slow or different or innovative. People who do not even imagine the depth of their own potential. Illarion Merculief in a Native Alaskan teacher who wrote at length about when he was a child. When his particular education began he was rarely spoken to at all, or directed by adults. He shadowed his elders in everything they did. So he developed his ability, attention span, interpersonal skill, and the ability to be a free thinker.  Working with musicians from Mali I noted how advanced little toddlers were at their instruments. They too had a unique education yielding uncommon skill levels. Some ancient cultures were forced to assimilate and in converting their style of education the wealth of wisdom and education they had already developed was sadly overlooked, forgotten or forbidden.  The greatest minds throughout the ages seem to have realized this. It is radical to re-imagine ones place. To not need the best diploma or any at all, the right looks, the correct car,the perfect community. Einsteins letters to his college friends were endearing and exhillerating, witty and wonderful. None of them were considered genius or important in status. I value deeply the great teachers I have had in my life. I am not saying I think education is not amazing. It is. I am also saying teachers are everywhere. Einstein spoke often about the power of imagination. A typical assignment for kids is to draw a line from one object to the other object that it matches. I never liked those. Then I learned that there was a canned answer. That firemen matched fire hoses, and cement mixers matched streets! So simple! I realized I was looking at the questions and seeing multiple possibilities. I found that more interesting. I would enjoy finding the similarities between fireman and piggy bank, or fireman and baby. It is funny to some people that I had to learn that the questions were written with a projected answer. If I learned what they projected I got the questions right. I stopped questioning and was rewarded for it.  As I matured I found the flaws in that style of education. I understand of course there is only a given amount of time to cover a certain amount of selected material. I learned the formulas that got the answers the quickest way. But my interest was not ignited. The dates and locations of wars centuries old were memorized over hours and hours the first 18 years of my life, while current policy and social and economic problems were never part of school. There were segregated learning groups based on how fast students were. Some kids with debilitating fear of reading out loud were forced to. Some that would have panic attacks playing basketball were forced to. Thats part of learning right?  There were those wonderful teachers that would carve out a lesson in the Earth Science curriculum to bring in an abandoned bee hive or to dissect owl pellets! The petition to our parents for a car wash so we could get the money to go to a waterfall and draw native plants, or to see Shindler's list at a movie house, or to see African masks at an art museum, or to visit a court house or a high power telescope. They knew that interest is essential.  Reading Einsteins book would make anyone re-think our traditional education system. Einstein teaches that knowing is not the same as understanding. More importantly, that with imagination we can solve the problems that do not have canned answers. This is who Einstein was at a fundamental level. It is hard to impart complicated theories. Even when we have learned them and passed a test we forget them. Thankfully if we recall our process of how we learned, the wisdom will never be lost. The theater piece I created began inside a card board box. I was only intending to crawl into the box while I thought. It originally was just going to be me playing in a laundry hamper as a kid (I use to do that) and the prop box would become other things throughout the story. But as I rehearsed and kept going back into the box I realized it became quite symbolic of my mind. I had a great clown teacher helping me with some physical comedy so the first scene was trying to get out of the box in every manner of way. It took a ton of practice to look true and be funny. We used an Animal Collective song. A box could be a black hole, a brain, a desk, a ship, it could be the cubicle of a poor young patent clerk named Albert. It had no rules.... yet. It was limitless. As I stripped away the limits so too did the people on the journey with me. When I put them back the reality was new. If you have ever been taught Einsteins theories on gravity, time, space and relativity, we use props to make the abstract more tangible. We show its circumstance changing, factors changing, actions changing. How else could we understand a collapsed star, mass volume, gravity , and the speed of light. Understanding what is beyond what we can see is made possible through imagination. We do it in spite of ourselves. Any number of factors can change a thing in time and space. There is something in that nothing there. Somthing that may lead to a white hole, or another universe. That great mystery just keeps unfolding and giving us more uses for our intelligence. That is made possible through our imagination. The book is personal. He was thought by many to be slow or useless in the beginning. He went through failures and through job after job. He experienced all the anxiety and stress that comes of feeling out of place and out of step and misunderstood. This is what I wanted to use to tell the story I found interesting. When Einstein finds his path he triumphantly edifies our lives with his unprecedented discoveries. Moreover his humility and generosity of spirit is so devoid of ego he offers evolved insights on life with signature humility and grace. His story inspires us to be generous in our assessment of the ability of anyone struggling. Wether it be in training another person at work, or learning a new life skill or subject, or going through hardship. When we feel superior because of what we know rather than what we understand we miss the opportunity to teach, to evolve, and most importantly to discover. Many people who are ashamed of what they dont know, or didn't learn, or learned differently, may not ever realize that they have an elegant mind and many gifts unique to them.Some of us have been taught to be afraid to be wrong so we never learn. Albert taught me to ask questions, to not assume I know the most, to not let others dictate my worth based on a spelling error or lack of information or solid teacher. Einstein's story reminds us to never underestimate anyone.I think anxiety and stress are blocks produced by outdated attitudes that can be changed. We all must fail so we can learn. That does not mean we should try to make misstakes. That would be a pretty pittiful assesment of this lesson. It means you can perfect a 3 point shot if you try and fail many times and learn from that failure. It means that you can be a great math teacher if math was a difficult subject for you, It means to create somthing transcendent the work that leads up to it might not be understood or might get put down, it means when you work at a sandwich shop, or as a surgeon, as an actor or a musician all of your success came from your process of getting things wrong until you got it right. Einstein lived this truth, that is why his quote is so crucial for us to remember. He said, ""Failure is success in progress."" Failure is as important to ones work as success is. The world may not want us to realize that but it is true. People with less patience might like you to think they do everything right the first time but that isnt true. We often hear make it ""look effortless"". That does not mean it was. I also think if we heeded Einstein's statement we would find a great deal of people whose hard work was never given credit, so that someone else could say it was ""effortless"", or could say it was their own idea so they could profit from it. Throughout time whole cultures of people were deemed ""ignorant"", ""insignificant"", ""barbaric"", 'useless to educate"" by people who swindled them and feared them. We know better than that. Thankfully Einstein had the courage and was motivated by his love of the world to continue his work.Reading his own words in this book is a treasure."

It’s all--academics, religion, the economy and socioeconomic class, politics, war, discrimination, national and international relations, humanity and the human condition--really quite simple. And yet, here humanity is, 86 years later, still allowing and even endorsing those in power to ignore the insightful, educated words of our scientists, philosophers, historians, and humanitarians and to continue making horrifying, short-sighted decisions that solely benefit the greedy cullions who don’t give a flip about humanity (or anyone other than themselves, really). Rant over--but seriously--”baaaaaa.”Back to the review: The World As I See It is an accessible portal into the brilliant mind of a man who has a great deal of insight on world issues and solutions that are incredibly relevant today (isn’t that interesting). I will say that there were moments when a few of Einstein’s solutions seemed idealized, but I cannot help but question whether or not mine is a slightly tainted, cynical perspective of someone who lives in a world where the greedy, powerful few have spread propaganda against the success of these types of solutions. There were also a few sections of the book that felt repetitive but, to Einstein’s credit, there are only so many ways that one can tactfully say “stop being a stupid, short-sighted cur and stop believing stupid, short-sighted curs ‘cause that’s why the world is going to hell.” Side note - I particularly enjoyed what Einstein had to say about science and religion in chapter 1 as well as his praise of the arts and their relevant significance throughout the entirety of this book (particularly fiction writers). Potential quotations and excerpts to come."

Some are interesting, others are rather less interesting.Regardless of his own thoughts, what mostly drew my attention was how Einstein (and many of the scientists he corresponded with) was such a public figure; he held correspondences and had influence over political figures (he was offered, and turned down, the presidency of Israel after all), and yet he thought that men of science and literature were not participating enough in ruling the world. I wonder what he would say if he saw the world today.Anyhow, the articles I highlighted and underlined the most are:The World As I See ItGood and EvilSociety and PersonalityTo the Schoolchildren of JapanReligion and ScienceSome Notes on My American ImpressionTo Sigmund FreudThe International of ScienceThe Institute for Intellectual Co-operationThe Question of DisarmamentThoughts on the World Economic CrisisCulture and ProsperityGermany and the Prussian Academy of ScienceLetter to an Arab"

While I knew he was a pacifist, I didn't realize how outspoken Einstein was on the subject of anti-war. In many letters and essays dating from pre-WW2, he felt that mandatory service in any country's military should be outlawed and that Christians, Jews, and Muslims could live peacefully in the Middle East, giving very specific recommendations for his ideas of how to achieve a mutual understanding. "
109,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2855257-christine,4,"Albert Einstein had thoughts about just about everything. He had a fine sense of social justice and he was a keen observer of his world....which sounds suspiciously like our world today. The thing that struck me most about this book, only 112 pages long and chock full of wisdom, was how much Einstein's thoughts seemed to be written for the worried 21st century citizen. He talked about the dangers of nationalism and how he felt that the American government was in a position to be the needed global leader, but that the people of America had some trouble with that idea, how nationalism disguised as patriotism is dangerous. He spoke of the need for world leaders to stick together to inspire and protect each other' s homelands.He had ideas about labor, wages, and the need for free markets, but with regulations in place in industries which become monopolies or cartels. He talked about culture, unemployment, and the best, healthy relationship of individuals within a state. Einstein was a globalist, and he made his case very well. I have had this book since I was a teen long ago but I just read it. It fits right into today's world."

I say ""essays"" because they're more like scattered thoughts without much structure or depth. Very random too. One might argue they are interesting, and they can be, some more than others. But for the most part, it's a pass. One thing I took away from reading it is that his mind was not so sophisticated in the humanities side of the spectrum; it was clear that he was too busy becoming a genius of physics and mathematics to worry about studying political science, sociology, international relations and other human science subjects before discussing it. Yet he shared his opinions. And don't get me wrong, they are valid. If you are curious, go ahead. But in most cases you won't find it much different from talking to an ordinary person next to you in the bus stop."

116,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/558933-aditi,4,"My scattered thoughts: As far as Science is concerned, I liked that he conveyed the fact that Science is work, not magic. The more you work, the more magical your mind seems to others, but it is all a result of work, work and more work. The popular narratives for most famous scientists almost always make them out to be superhumans - they usually made their discoveries by simply dreaming or staring into fires or taking a walk. Einstein corrects that view. I also liked his address on Lorentz, where I learnt for the first time, the role played by Lorentz in ""unifying"" scientists. As far as politics is concerned, Einstein's world as he saw it, consisted primarily of Germany and the USA. To a lesser extent other parts of Europe. The book should have been titled ""Germany and the awesome USA as I see it"". Yes, he was dazzled by the riches of America and didn't bother wondering where they came from. He was also fascinated by privatisation. Although, I guess when he visited, not everything was privatised (banks, prisons, wars etc), so his fascination may be justified. The collection is a bit repetitive - especially the parts concerning pacifism/disarmament. A few speeches/letters would have been sufficient. Also, the language is a bit weird. Overall, it was somewhat fun knowing his ideas, although I do not completely agree with him and he seems to not like women much. "

The writings represented another side of Einstein's personality, beside the fact about his genius as well known. They revealed his views on some aspects of life and international issues. You can find his point of view about life, science, education, liberty, world economic crisis, war, disarmament, military, politic, nationalism, American, European, Jewish, etc.Reading this book, I see Einstein's great attention in the development of science and education. I was interested on his view about the relation between science and religion. He was quite wise on the thought. Toward the international progress on the time, he also showed his attention and comments, his agreement and disagreement. And as I noticed, he put the psychological aspect and humanity in a high place.Well, overall, he was cool in some part of his wisdom on seeing the life and its components.But, as a Jewish, he appreciated the formation and the progress of Zionism too high. His point of view about Zionism and the foundation of Jewish nation at Palestine wasn't in agreement with the facts. Yeah... we've already seen..."

Maybe because most of the essays in the book are translated ! However I found the few ideas I grasped interesting. The one related to mandatory army service is new to me. Haven't thought about the issue like that before and I don't think it is too simple like that. 'To stop war around the world we need to fight the narrow nationalism and prevent the countries from having compulsory service in the army' This really simplifies the case. However it still needs to be considered in further readings. One more idea that really hooked me was about the economy; Real and apparent over-production. I always thought about that ! To have all the people work and unemployment to reach zero, for sure there will be an over production of goods which means that consumption increase and people will be busy consuming goods. High consumption rate will degrade humanity into materialistic society. The question I always asked; How to make everyone work in a society while producing enough good for everyone ?! I am still searching for a book that can answer that question !"

He was no doubt a wise man and a seeker of truth and peace. The political ideals in which he believed in are to be admired, especially when considering the hard times he lived in. The book shows a great variety of letters in which Albert Einstein expresses his views on matters of war and peace, economics and education all around the world.I was going to give it 4 stars, but the last 10 pages of the book were somehow disappointing. Being a Jew, Einstein was standing, of course, in the favour of anything in interest of the Jew community. He absolutely supported the Zionist project in Palestine and saw that the Jews had every right for that movement. Understandable, if he hadn't been such an enthusiast about peace and the ending of all the violence in this world.

135,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105194626-diana,4,"""Failure is success in progress"" Einstein on processI acquired this and many books about the man while creating a theater performance about Albert. Out of all the books I researched this one included some origin stories that made an impression on me. When I was little I was diagnosed dyslexic after writing some letters backwards at school. An SLD teacher intervened and sent me to be tested. I did not get bad grades. It was not that I was incapable, or less intelligent than other students. Even if I was it may not have mattered. What I learned was simple: There are different ways to learn and there are different ways to study. Being the youngest in a big family I learned a lot from just having siblings. I did not have much one on one time with an adult but I did have a built in process of observation and socializing.My IQ was tested when I was seven. I was nervous. I was already acutely aware of the stigma attached to the feedback I was getting. 90 percent of the adults around me did not understand what learning ""disabilities"" actually were. I think young people are often not diagnosed correctly or taught accordingly. From a very young age I had a hyper awareness of everything I did because in a big group of older siblings I was told what and how to do things several times over. When I wanted to do something on my own I dragged it under the table. That was crucial to learning. One of the things I did a lot of was listening. By the time it was my turn to read I had heard my sisters sounding out words at the kitchen table for a few years so I put together words fast and I loved stories. That was fortunate. I.Q. may be able to tell us about how some people reason but it is not the only factor in determining intelligence. The Dr. was very excited and she told my mom a bit about what area my reasoning skill set fell into and my ""percentile"". Suddenly the way I was being viewed before completely changed. Why? The high number meant I was ok? She told my Mom I should be a brain surgeon. No kidding. She also made a point to tell me Einstein had trouble counting pocket change. This was a revelation to me. I could count pocket change! The very act of her lifting that burden from my tender mind grounded me in a very important reality. We have so much depth as people. You no sooner could scoop up a handful of ocean and say ""nope, there are no whales in the ocean"", than you can limit people. I can see why she felt I could be a brain surgeon because of how my mind ""worked"" not because I was a horizon child who was bored with how easy math was.  I may be average or genius or both at once. Practice certainly improves our ability in any field but I am more interested on Einsteins take on developing our imagination and ingenuity. Because most of us will not be gifted a career, a business,or a home. Many highly skilled and intelligent people in the world are trying to have clean water, electricity, a way to get a loan to finance the means to survive. Even looking at the toys children refugees create from old cartons and recycled tin, the systems of purifying water, harnessing wind power. Most of these people have never been tested for intelligence and their skill sets may never be, but the intelligence is obvious if you look and listen. So when it comes to the USA and our classroom doctrine and systems of importance I urge anyone struggling to not be discouraged.  A very big part of who we become is who we desire to be and who molds us what we are exposed to and how. The brain is coded so uniquely for each individual person it truly is a fascinating subject. It also occured to me that being told I was smart and capable of great things instead of the opposite, made me identify with that aspect of myself. Whereas before at that age, I could have very easily identified with not being capable.Being shamed, putting all my energy into something else so I could feel accepted. It may be a popular opinion that ""participating"" doesn't deserve a ribbon, and that standardized testing, SAT's , ACT's will sort everything out for the best and the brightest but how can we know that? If Albert had stayed in Nazi era Germany as a failing patent clerk he may have died. Without this immigrants contributions where would we be? There are other seemingly ordinary or below average people in the world like Einstein who suffer mockery for being slow or different or innovative. People who do not even imagine the depth of their own potential. Illarion Merculief in a Native Alaskan teacher who wrote at length about when he was a child. When his particular education began he was rarely spoken to at all, or directed by adults. He shadowed his elders in everything they did. So he developed his ability, attention span, interpersonal skill, and the ability to be a free thinker.  Working with musicians from Mali I noted how advanced little toddlers were at their instruments. They too had a unique education yielding uncommon skill levels. Some ancient cultures were forced to assimilate and in converting their style of education the wealth of wisdom and education they had already developed was sadly overlooked, forgotten or forbidden.  The greatest minds throughout the ages seem to have realized this. It is radical to re-imagine ones place. To not need the best diploma or any at all, the right looks, the correct car,the perfect community. Einsteins letters to his college friends were endearing and exhillerating, witty and wonderful. None of them were considered genius or important in status. I value deeply the great teachers I have had in my life. I am not saying I think education is not amazing. It is. I am also saying teachers are everywhere. Einstein spoke often about the power of imagination. A typical assignment for kids is to draw a line from one object to the other object that it matches. I never liked those. Then I learned that there was a canned answer. That firemen matched fire hoses, and cement mixers matched streets! So simple! I realized I was looking at the questions and seeing multiple possibilities. I found that more interesting. I would enjoy finding the similarities between fireman and piggy bank, or fireman and baby. It is funny to some people that I had to learn that the questions were written with a projected answer. If I learned what they projected I got the questions right. I stopped questioning and was rewarded for it.  As I matured I found the flaws in that style of education. I understand of course there is only a given amount of time to cover a certain amount of selected material. I learned the formulas that got the answers the quickest way. But my interest was not ignited. The dates and locations of wars centuries old were memorized over hours and hours the first 18 years of my life, while current policy and social and economic problems were never part of school. There were segregated learning groups based on how fast students were. Some kids with debilitating fear of reading out loud were forced to. Some that would have panic attacks playing basketball were forced to. Thats part of learning right?  There were those wonderful teachers that would carve out a lesson in the Earth Science curriculum to bring in an abandoned bee hive or to dissect owl pellets! The petition to our parents for a car wash so we could get the money to go to a waterfall and draw native plants, or to see Shindler's list at a movie house, or to see African masks at an art museum, or to visit a court house or a high power telescope. They knew that interest is essential.  Reading Einsteins book would make anyone re-think our traditional education system. Einstein teaches that knowing is not the same as understanding. More importantly, that with imagination we can solve the problems that do not have canned answers. This is who Einstein was at a fundamental level. It is hard to impart complicated theories. Even when we have learned them and passed a test we forget them. Thankfully if we recall our process of how we learned, the wisdom will never be lost. The theater piece I created began inside a card board box. I was only intending to crawl into the box while I thought. It originally was just going to be me playing in a laundry hamper as a kid (I use to do that) and the prop box would become other things throughout the story. But as I rehearsed and kept going back into the box I realized it became quite symbolic of my mind. I had a great clown teacher helping me with some physical comedy so the first scene was trying to get out of the box in every manner of way. It took a ton of practice to look true and be funny. We used an Animal Collective song. A box could be a black hole, a brain, a desk, a ship, it could be the cubicle of a poor young patent clerk named Albert. It had no rules.... yet. It was limitless. As I stripped away the limits so too did the people on the journey with me. When I put them back the reality was new. If you have ever been taught Einsteins theories on gravity, time, space and relativity, we use props to make the abstract more tangible. We show its circumstance changing, factors changing, actions changing. How else could we understand a collapsed star, mass volume, gravity , and the speed of light. Understanding what is beyond what we can see is made possible through imagination. We do it in spite of ourselves. Any number of factors can change a thing in time and space. There is something in that nothing there. Somthing that may lead to a white hole, or another universe. That great mystery just keeps unfolding and giving us more uses for our intelligence. That is made possible through our imagination. The book is personal. He was thought by many to be slow or useless in the beginning. He went through failures and through job after job. He experienced all the anxiety and stress that comes of feeling out of place and out of step and misunderstood. This is what I wanted to use to tell the story I found interesting. When Einstein finds his path he triumphantly edifies our lives with his unprecedented discoveries. Moreover his humility and generosity of spirit is so devoid of ego he offers evolved insights on life with signature humility and grace. His story inspires us to be generous in our assessment of the ability of anyone struggling. Wether it be in training another person at work, or learning a new life skill or subject, or going through hardship. When we feel superior because of what we know rather than what we understand we miss the opportunity to teach, to evolve, and most importantly to discover. Many people who are ashamed of what they dont know, or didn't learn, or learned differently, may not ever realize that they have an elegant mind and many gifts unique to them.Some of us have been taught to be afraid to be wrong so we never learn. Albert taught me to ask questions, to not assume I know the most, to not let others dictate my worth based on a spelling error or lack of information or solid teacher. Einstein's story reminds us to never underestimate anyone.I think anxiety and stress are blocks produced by outdated attitudes that can be changed. We all must fail so we can learn. That does not mean we should try to make misstakes. That would be a pretty pittiful assesment of this lesson. It means you can perfect a 3 point shot if you try and fail many times and learn from that failure. It means that you can be a great math teacher if math was a difficult subject for you, It means to create somthing transcendent the work that leads up to it might not be understood or might get put down, it means when you work at a sandwich shop, or as a surgeon, as an actor or a musician all of your success came from your process of getting things wrong until you got it right. Einstein lived this truth, that is why his quote is so crucial for us to remember. He said, ""Failure is success in progress."" Failure is as important to ones work as success is. The world may not want us to realize that but it is true. People with less patience might like you to think they do everything right the first time but that isnt true. We often hear make it ""look effortless"". That does not mean it was. I also think if we heeded Einstein's statement we would find a great deal of people whose hard work was never given credit, so that someone else could say it was ""effortless"", or could say it was their own idea so they could profit from it. Throughout time whole cultures of people were deemed ""ignorant"", ""insignificant"", ""barbaric"", 'useless to educate"" by people who swindled them and feared them. We know better than that. Thankfully Einstein had the courage and was motivated by his love of the world to continue his work.Reading his own words in this book is a treasure."

It’s all--academics, religion, the economy and socioeconomic class, politics, war, discrimination, national and international relations, humanity and the human condition--really quite simple. And yet, here humanity is, 86 years later, still allowing and even endorsing those in power to ignore the insightful, educated words of our scientists, philosophers, historians, and humanitarians and to continue making horrifying, short-sighted decisions that solely benefit the greedy cullions who don’t give a flip about humanity (or anyone other than themselves, really). Rant over--but seriously--”baaaaaa.”Back to the review: The World As I See It is an accessible portal into the brilliant mind of a man who has a great deal of insight on world issues and solutions that are incredibly relevant today (isn’t that interesting). I will say that there were moments when a few of Einstein’s solutions seemed idealized, but I cannot help but question whether or not mine is a slightly tainted, cynical perspective of someone who lives in a world where the greedy, powerful few have spread propaganda against the success of these types of solutions. There were also a few sections of the book that felt repetitive but, to Einstein’s credit, there are only so many ways that one can tactfully say “stop being a stupid, short-sighted cur and stop believing stupid, short-sighted curs ‘cause that’s why the world is going to hell.” Side note - I particularly enjoyed what Einstein had to say about science and religion in chapter 1 as well as his praise of the arts and their relevant significance throughout the entirety of this book (particularly fiction writers). Potential quotations and excerpts to come."

Some are interesting, others are rather less interesting.Regardless of his own thoughts, what mostly drew my attention was how Einstein (and many of the scientists he corresponded with) was such a public figure; he held correspondences and had influence over political figures (he was offered, and turned down, the presidency of Israel after all), and yet he thought that men of science and literature were not participating enough in ruling the world. I wonder what he would say if he saw the world today.Anyhow, the articles I highlighted and underlined the most are:The World As I See ItGood and EvilSociety and PersonalityTo the Schoolchildren of JapanReligion and ScienceSome Notes on My American ImpressionTo Sigmund FreudThe International of ScienceThe Institute for Intellectual Co-operationThe Question of DisarmamentThoughts on the World Economic CrisisCulture and ProsperityGermany and the Prussian Academy of ScienceLetter to an Arab"

While I knew he was a pacifist, I didn't realize how outspoken Einstein was on the subject of anti-war. In many letters and essays dating from pre-WW2, he felt that mandatory service in any country's military should be outlawed and that Christians, Jews, and Muslims could live peacefully in the Middle East, giving very specific recommendations for his ideas of how to achieve a mutual understanding. "
139,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2855257-christine,4,"Albert Einstein had thoughts about just about everything. He had a fine sense of social justice and he was a keen observer of his world....which sounds suspiciously like our world today. The thing that struck me most about this book, only 112 pages long and chock full of wisdom, was how much Einstein's thoughts seemed to be written for the worried 21st century citizen. He talked about the dangers of nationalism and how he felt that the American government was in a position to be the needed global leader, but that the people of America had some trouble with that idea, how nationalism disguised as patriotism is dangerous. He spoke of the need for world leaders to stick together to inspire and protect each other' s homelands.He had ideas about labor, wages, and the need for free markets, but with regulations in place in industries which become monopolies or cartels. He talked about culture, unemployment, and the best, healthy relationship of individuals within a state. Einstein was a globalist, and he made his case very well. I have had this book since I was a teen long ago but I just read it. It fits right into today's world."

I say ""essays"" because they're more like scattered thoughts without much structure or depth. Very random too. One might argue they are interesting, and they can be, some more than others. But for the most part, it's a pass. One thing I took away from reading it is that his mind was not so sophisticated in the humanities side of the spectrum; it was clear that he was too busy becoming a genius of physics and mathematics to worry about studying political science, sociology, international relations and other human science subjects before discussing it. Yet he shared his opinions. And don't get me wrong, they are valid. If you are curious, go ahead. But in most cases you won't find it much different from talking to an ordinary person next to you in the bus stop."

146,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/558933-aditi,4,"My scattered thoughts: As far as Science is concerned, I liked that he conveyed the fact that Science is work, not magic. The more you work, the more magical your mind seems to others, but it is all a result of work, work and more work. The popular narratives for most famous scientists almost always make them out to be superhumans - they usually made their discoveries by simply dreaming or staring into fires or taking a walk. Einstein corrects that view. I also liked his address on Lorentz, where I learnt for the first time, the role played by Lorentz in ""unifying"" scientists. As far as politics is concerned, Einstein's world as he saw it, consisted primarily of Germany and the USA. To a lesser extent other parts of Europe. The book should have been titled ""Germany and the awesome USA as I see it"". Yes, he was dazzled by the riches of America and didn't bother wondering where they came from. He was also fascinated by privatisation. Although, I guess when he visited, not everything was privatised (banks, prisons, wars etc), so his fascination may be justified. The collection is a bit repetitive - especially the parts concerning pacifism/disarmament. A few speeches/letters would have been sufficient. Also, the language is a bit weird. Overall, it was somewhat fun knowing his ideas, although I do not completely agree with him and he seems to not like women much. "

The writings represented another side of Einstein's personality, beside the fact about his genius as well known. They revealed his views on some aspects of life and international issues. You can find his point of view about life, science, education, liberty, world economic crisis, war, disarmament, military, politic, nationalism, American, European, Jewish, etc.Reading this book, I see Einstein's great attention in the development of science and education. I was interested on his view about the relation between science and religion. He was quite wise on the thought. Toward the international progress on the time, he also showed his attention and comments, his agreement and disagreement. And as I noticed, he put the psychological aspect and humanity in a high place.Well, overall, he was cool in some part of his wisdom on seeing the life and its components.But, as a Jewish, he appreciated the formation and the progress of Zionism too high. His point of view about Zionism and the foundation of Jewish nation at Palestine wasn't in agreement with the facts. Yeah... we've already seen..."

Maybe because most of the essays in the book are translated ! However I found the few ideas I grasped interesting. The one related to mandatory army service is new to me. Haven't thought about the issue like that before and I don't think it is too simple like that. 'To stop war around the world we need to fight the narrow nationalism and prevent the countries from having compulsory service in the army' This really simplifies the case. However it still needs to be considered in further readings. One more idea that really hooked me was about the economy; Real and apparent over-production. I always thought about that ! To have all the people work and unemployment to reach zero, for sure there will be an over production of goods which means that consumption increase and people will be busy consuming goods. High consumption rate will degrade humanity into materialistic society. The question I always asked; How to make everyone work in a society while producing enough good for everyone ?! I am still searching for a book that can answer that question !"

He was no doubt a wise man and a seeker of truth and peace. The political ideals in which he believed in are to be admired, especially when considering the hard times he lived in. The book shows a great variety of letters in which Albert Einstein expresses his views on matters of war and peace, economics and education all around the world.I was going to give it 4 stars, but the last 10 pages of the book were somehow disappointing. Being a Jew, Einstein was standing, of course, in the favour of anything in interest of the Jew community. He absolutely supported the Zionist project in Palestine and saw that the Jews had every right for that movement. Understandable, if he hadn't been such an enthusiast about peace and the ending of all the violence in this world. Those letters being written in 1933, I wonder what his opinion was after witnessing the masaccers of 1948.."

165,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105194626-diana,4,"""Failure is success in progress"" Einstein on processI acquired this and many books about the man while creating a theater performance about Albert. Out of all the books I researched this one included some origin stories that made an impression on me. When I was little I was diagnosed dyslexic after writing some letters backwards at school. An SLD teacher intervened and sent me to be tested. I did not get bad grades. It was not that I was incapable, or less intelligent than other students. Even if I was it may not have mattered. What I learned was simple: There are different ways to learn and there are different ways to study. Being the youngest in a big family I learned a lot from just having siblings. I did not have much one on one time with an adult but I did have a built in process of observation and socializing.My IQ was tested when I was seven. I was nervous. I was already acutely aware of the stigma attached to the feedback I was getting. 90 percent of the adults around me did not understand what learning ""disabilities"" actually were. I think young people are often not diagnosed correctly or taught accordingly. From a very young age I had a hyper awareness of everything I did because in a big group of older siblings I was told what and how to do things several times over. When I wanted to do something on my own I dragged it under the table. That was crucial to learning. One of the things I did a lot of was listening. By the time it was my turn to read I had heard my sisters sounding out words at the kitchen table for a few years so I put together words fast and I loved stories. That was fortunate. I.Q. may be able to tell us about how some people reason but it is not the only factor in determining intelligence. The Dr. was very excited and she told my mom a bit about what area my reasoning skill set fell into and my ""percentile"". Suddenly the way I was being viewed before completely changed. Why? The high number meant I was ok? She told my Mom I should be a brain surgeon. No kidding. She also made a point to tell me Einstein had trouble counting pocket change. This was a revelation to me. I could count pocket change! The very act of her lifting that burden from my tender mind grounded me in a very important reality. We have so much depth as people. You no sooner could scoop up a handful of ocean and say ""nope, there are no whales in the ocean"", than you can limit people. I can see why she felt I could be a brain surgeon because of how my mind ""worked"" not because I was a horizon child who was bored with how easy math was.  I may be average or genius or both at once. Practice certainly improves our ability in any field but I am more interested on Einsteins take on developing our imagination and ingenuity. Because most of us will not be gifted a career, a business,or a home. Many highly skilled and intelligent people in the world are trying to have clean water, electricity, a way to get a loan to finance the means to survive. Even looking at the toys children refugees create from old cartons and recycled tin, the systems of purifying water, harnessing wind power. Most of these people have never been tested for intelligence and their skill sets may never be, but the intelligence is obvious if you look and listen. So when it comes to the USA and our classroom doctrine and systems of importance I urge anyone struggling to not be discouraged.  A very big part of who we become is who we desire to be and who molds us what we are exposed to and how. The brain is coded so uniquely for each individual person it truly is a fascinating subject. It also occured to me that being told I was smart and capable of great things instead of the opposite, made me identify with that aspect of myself. Whereas before at that age, I could have very easily identified with not being capable.Being shamed, putting all my energy into something else so I could feel accepted. It may be a popular opinion that ""participating"" doesn't deserve a ribbon, and that standardized testing, SAT's , ACT's will sort everything out for the best and the brightest but how can we know that? If Albert had stayed in Nazi era Germany as a failing patent clerk he may have died. Without this immigrants contributions where would we be? There are other seemingly ordinary or below average people in the world like Einstein who suffer mockery for being slow or different or innovative. People who do not even imagine the depth of their own potential. Illarion Merculief in a Native Alaskan teacher who wrote at length about when he was a child. When his particular education began he was rarely spoken to at all, or directed by adults. He shadowed his elders in everything they did. So he developed his ability, attention span, interpersonal skill, and the ability to be a free thinker.  Working with musicians from Mali I noted how advanced little toddlers were at their instruments. They too had a unique education yielding uncommon skill levels. Some ancient cultures were forced to assimilate and in converting their style of education the wealth of wisdom and education they had already developed was sadly overlooked, forgotten or forbidden.  The greatest minds throughout the ages seem to have realized this. It is radical to re-imagine ones place. To not need the best diploma or any at all, the right looks, the correct car,the perfect community. Einsteins letters to his college friends were endearing and exhillerating, witty and wonderful. None of them were considered genius or important in status. I value deeply the great teachers I have had in my life. I am not saying I think education is not amazing. It is. I am also saying teachers are everywhere. Einstein spoke often about the power of imagination. A typical assignment for kids is to draw a line from one object to the other object that it matches. I never liked those. Then I learned that there was a canned answer. That firemen matched fire hoses, and cement mixers matched streets! So simple! I realized I was looking at the questions and seeing multiple possibilities. I found that more interesting. I would enjoy finding the similarities between fireman and piggy bank, or fireman and baby. It is funny to some people that I had to learn that the questions were written with a projected answer. If I learned what they projected I got the questions right. I stopped questioning and was rewarded for it.  As I matured I found the flaws in that style of education. I understand of course there is only a given amount of time to cover a certain amount of selected material. I learned the formulas that got the answers the quickest way. But my interest was not ignited. The dates and locations of wars centuries old were memorized over hours and hours the first 18 years of my life, while current policy and social and economic problems were never part of school. There were segregated learning groups based on how fast students were. Some kids with debilitating fear of reading out loud were forced to. Some that would have panic attacks playing basketball were forced to. Thats part of learning right?  There were those wonderful teachers that would carve out a lesson in the Earth Science curriculum to bring in an abandoned bee hive or to dissect owl pellets! The petition to our parents for a car wash so we could get the money to go to a waterfall and draw native plants, or to see Shindler's list at a movie house, or to see African masks at an art museum, or to visit a court house or a high power telescope. They knew that interest is essential.  Reading Einsteins book would make anyone re-think our traditional education system. Einstein teaches that knowing is not the same as understanding. More importantly, that with imagination we can solve the problems that do not have canned answers. This is who Einstein was at a fundamental level. It is hard to impart complicated theories. Even when we have learned them and passed a test we forget them. Thankfully if we recall our process of how we learned, the wisdom will never be lost. The theater piece I created began inside a card board box. I was only intending to crawl into the box while I thought. It originally was just going to be me playing in a laundry hamper as a kid (I use to do that) and the prop box would become other things throughout the story. But as I rehearsed and kept going back into the box I realized it became quite symbolic of my mind. I had a great clown teacher helping me with some physical comedy so the first scene was trying to get out of the box in every manner of way. It took a ton of practice to look true and be funny. We used an Animal Collective song. A box could be a black hole, a brain, a desk, a ship, it could be the cubicle of a poor young patent clerk named Albert. It had no rules.... yet. It was limitless. As I stripped away the limits so too did the people on the journey with me. When I put them back the reality was new. If you have ever been taught Einsteins theories on gravity, time, space and relativity, we use props to make the abstract more tangible. We show its circumstance changing, factors changing, actions changing. How else could we understand a collapsed star, mass volume, gravity , and the speed of light. Understanding what is beyond what we can see is made possible through imagination. We do it in spite of ourselves. Any number of factors can change a thing in time and space. There is something in that nothing there. Somthing that may lead to a white hole, or another universe. That great mystery just keeps unfolding and giving us more uses for our intelligence. That is made possible through our imagination. The book is personal. He was thought by many to be slow or useless in the beginning. He went through failures and through job after job. He experienced all the anxiety and stress that comes of feeling out of place and out of step and misunderstood. This is what I wanted to use to tell the story I found interesting. When Einstein finds his path he triumphantly edifies our lives with his unprecedented discoveries. Moreover his humility and generosity of spirit is so devoid of ego he offers evolved insights on life with signature humility and grace. His story inspires us to be generous in our assessment of the ability of anyone struggling. Wether it be in training another person at work, or learning a new life skill or subject, or going through hardship. When we feel superior because of what we know rather than what we understand we miss the opportunity to teach, to evolve, and most importantly to discover. Many people who are ashamed of what they dont know, or didn't learn, or learned differently, may not ever realize that they have an elegant mind and many gifts unique to them.Some of us have been taught to be afraid to be wrong so we never learn. Albert taught me to ask questions, to not assume I know the most, to not let others dictate my worth based on a spelling error or lack of information or solid teacher. Einstein's story reminds us to never underestimate anyone.I think anxiety and stress are blocks produced by outdated attitudes that can be changed. We all must fail so we can learn. That does not mean we should try to make misstakes. That would be a pretty pittiful assesment of this lesson. It means you can perfect a 3 point shot if you try and fail many times and learn from that failure. It means that you can be a great math teacher if math was a difficult subject for you, It means to create somthing transcendent the work that leads up to it might not be understood or might get put down, it means when you work at a sandwich shop, or as a surgeon, as an actor or a musician all of your success came from your process of getting things wrong until you got it right. Einstein lived this truth, that is why his quote is so crucial for us to remember. He said, ""Failure is success in progress."" Failure is as important to ones work as success is. The world may not want us to realize that but it is true. People with less patience might like you to think they do everything right the first time but that isnt true. We often hear make it ""look effortless"". That does not mean it was. I also think if we heeded Einstein's statement we would find a great deal of people whose hard work was never given credit, so that someone else could say it was ""effortless"", or could say it was their own idea so they could profit from it. Throughout time whole cultures of people were deemed ""ignorant"", ""insignificant"", ""barbaric"", 'useless to educate"" by people who swindled them and feared them. We know better than that. Thankfully Einstein had the courage and was motivated by his love of the world to continue his work.Reading his own words in this book is a treasure."

It’s all--academics, religion, the economy and socioeconomic class, politics, war, discrimination, national and international relations, humanity and the human condition--really quite simple. And yet, here humanity is, 86 years later, still allowing and even endorsing those in power to ignore the insightful, educated words of our scientists, philosophers, historians, and humanitarians and to continue making horrifying, short-sighted decisions that solely benefit the greedy cullions who don’t give a flip about humanity (or anyone other than themselves, really). Rant over--but seriously--”baaaaaa.”Back to the review: The World As I See It is an accessible portal into the brilliant mind of a man who has a great deal of insight on world issues and solutions that are incredibly relevant today (isn’t that interesting). I will say that there were moments when a few of Einstein’s solutions seemed idealized, but I cannot help but question whether or not mine is a slightly tainted, cynical perspective of someone who lives in a world where the greedy, powerful few have spread propaganda against the success of these types of solutions. There were also a few sections of the book that felt repetitive but, to Einstein’s credit, there are only so many ways that one can tactfully say “stop being a stupid, short-sighted cur and stop believing stupid, short-sighted curs ‘cause that’s why the world is going to hell.” Side note - I particularly enjoyed what Einstein had to say about science and religion in chapter 1 as well as his praise of the arts and their relevant significance throughout the entirety of this book (particularly fiction writers). Potential quotations and excerpts to come."
167,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22761811-zainab-ali,3,"This is a collection of Albert Einstein's letters and articles discussing different matters, including science, religion, education and politics. Some are interesting, others are rather less interesting.Regardless of his own thoughts, what mostly drew my attention was how Einstein (and many of the scientists he corresponded with) was such a public figure; he held correspondences and had influence over political figures (he was offered, and turned down, the presidency of Israel after all), and yet he thought that men of science and literature were not participating enough in ruling the world. I wonder what he would say if he saw the world today.Anyhow, the articles I highlighted and underlined the most are:The World As I See ItGood and EvilSociety and PersonalityTo the Schoolchildren of JapanReligion and ScienceSome Notes on My American ImpressionTo Sigmund FreudThe International of ScienceThe Institute for Intellectual Co-operationThe Question of DisarmamentThoughts on the World Economic CrisisCulture and ProsperityGermany and the Prussian Academy of ScienceLetter to an Arab"
168,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36886417-kelly-r,4,"Sometimes a challenge to read because of its wordy translation from German, but some very interesting ideas. While I knew he was a pacifist, I didn't realize how outspoken Einstein was on the subject of anti-war. In many letters and essays dating from pre-WW2, he felt that mandatory service in any country's military should be outlawed and that Christians, Jews, and Muslims could live peacefully in the Middle East, giving very specific recommendations for his ideas of how to achieve a mutual understanding. "
169,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2855257-christine,4,"Albert Einstein had thoughts about just about everything. He had a fine sense of social justice and he was a keen observer of his world....which sounds suspiciously like our world today. The thing that struck me most about this book, only 112 pages long and chock full of wisdom, was how much Einstein's thoughts seemed to be written for the worried 21st century citizen. He talked about the dangers of nationalism and how he felt that the American government was in a position to be the needed global leader, but that the people of America had some trouble with that idea, how nationalism disguised as patriotism is dangerous. He spoke of the need for world leaders to stick together to inspire and protect each other' s homelands.He had ideas about labor, wages, and the need for free markets, but with regulations in place in industries which become monopolies or cartels. He talked about culture, unemployment, and the best, healthy relationship of individuals within a state. Einstein was a globalist, and he made his case very well. I have had this book since I was a teen long ago but I just read it. It fits right into today's world."

Needless to say, a true genius of modern times. "

I say ""essays"" because they're more like scattered thoughts without much structure or depth. Very random too. One might argue they are interesting, and they can be, some more than others. But for the most part, it's a pass. One thing I took away from reading it is that his mind was not so sophisticated in the humanities side of the spectrum; it was clear that he was too busy becoming a genius of physics and mathematics to worry about studying political science, sociology, international relations and other human science subjects before discussing it. Yet he shared his opinions. And don't get me wrong, they are valid. If you are curious, go ahead. But in most cases you won't find it much different from talking to an ordinary person next to you in the bus stop."

176,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/558933-aditi,4,"My scattered thoughts: As far as Science is concerned, I liked that he conveyed the fact that Science is work, not magic. The more you work, the more magical your mind seems to others, but it is all a result of work, work and more work. The popular narratives for most famous scientists almost always make them out to be superhumans - they usually made their discoveries by simply dreaming or staring into fires or taking a walk. Einstein corrects that view. I also liked his address on Lorentz, where I learnt for the first time, the role played by Lorentz in ""unifying"" scientists. As far as politics is concerned, Einstein's world as he saw it, consisted primarily of Germany and the USA. To a lesser extent other parts of Europe. The book should have been titled ""Germany and the awesome USA as I see it"". Yes, he was dazzled by the riches of America and didn't bother wondering where they came from. He was also fascinated by privatisation. Although, I guess when he visited, not everything was privatised (banks, prisons, wars etc), so his fascination may be justified. The collection is a bit repetitive - especially the parts concerning pacifism/disarmament. A few speeches/letters would have been sufficient. Also, the language is a bit weird. Overall, it was somewhat fun knowing his ideas, although I do not completely agree with him and he seems to not like women much. "

The writings represented another side of Einstein's personality, beside the fact about his genius as well known. They revealed his views on some aspects of life and international issues. You can find his point of view about life, science, education, liberty, world economic crisis, war, disarmament, military, politic, nationalism, American, European, Jewish, etc.Reading this book, I see Einstein's great attention in the development of science and education. I was interested on his view about the relation between science and religion. He was quite wise on the thought. Toward the international progress on the time, he also showed his attention and comments, his agreement and disagreement. And as I noticed, he put the psychological aspect and humanity in a high place.Well, overall, he was cool in some part of his wisdom on seeing the life and its components.But, as a Jewish, he appreciated the formation and the progress of Zionism too high. His point of view about Zionism and the foundation of Jewish nation at Palestine wasn't in agreement with the facts. Yeah... we've already seen..."

Maybe because most of the essays in the book are translated ! However I found the few ideas I grasped interesting. The one related to mandatory army service is new to me. Haven't thought about the issue like that before and I don't think it is too simple like that. 'To stop war around the world we need to fight the narrow nationalism and prevent the countries from having compulsory service in the army' This really simplifies the case. However it still needs to be considered in further readings. One more idea that really hooked me was about the economy; Real and apparent over-production. I always thought about that ! To have all the people work and unemployment to reach zero, for sure there will be an over production of goods which means that consumption increase and people will be busy consuming goods. High consumption rate will degrade humanity into materialistic society. The question I always asked; How to make everyone work in a society while producing enough good for everyone ?! I am still searching for a book that can answer that question !"

He was no doubt a wise man and a seeker of truth and peace. The political ideals in which he believed in are to be admired, especially when considering the hard times he lived in. The book shows a great variety of letters in which Albert Einstein expresses his views on matters of war and peace, economics and education all around the world.I was going to give it 4 stars, but the last 10 pages of the book were somehow disappointing. Being a Jew, Einstein was standing, of course, in the favour of anything in interest of the Jew community. He absolutely supported the Zionist project in Palestine and saw that the Jews had every right for that movement. Understandable, if he hadn't been such an enthusiast about peace and the ending of all the violence in this world. Those letters being written in 1933, I wonder what his opinion was after witnessing the masaccers of 1948.."

195,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105194626-diana,4,"""Failure is success in progress"" Einstein on processI acquired this and many books about the man while creating a theater performance about Albert. Out of all the books I researched this one included some origin stories that made an impression on me. When I was little I was diagnosed dyslexic after writing some letters backwards at school. An SLD teacher intervened and sent me to be tested. I did not get bad grades. It was not that I was incapable, or less intelligent than other students. Even if I was it may not have mattered. What I learned was simple: There are different ways to learn and there are different ways to study. Being the youngest in a big family I learned a lot from just having siblings. I did not have much one on one time with an adult but I did have a built in process of observation and socializing.My IQ was tested when I was seven. I was nervous. I was already acutely aware of the stigma attached to the feedback I was getting. 90 percent of the adults around me did not understand what learning ""disabilities"" actually were. I think young people are often not diagnosed correctly or taught accordingly. From a very young age I had a hyper awareness of everything I did because in a big group of older siblings I was told what and how to do things several times over. When I wanted to do something on my own I dragged it under the table. That was crucial to learning. One of the things I did a lot of was listening. By the time it was my turn to read I had heard my sisters sounding out words at the kitchen table for a few years so I put together words fast and I loved stories. That was fortunate. I.Q. may be able to tell us about how some people reason but it is not the only factor in determining intelligence. The Dr. was very excited and she told my mom a bit about what area my reasoning skill set fell into and my ""percentile"". Suddenly the way I was being viewed before completely changed. Why? The high number meant I was ok? She told my Mom I should be a brain surgeon. No kidding. She also made a point to tell me Einstein had trouble counting pocket change. This was a revelation to me. I could count pocket change! The very act of her lifting that burden from my tender mind grounded me in a very important reality. We have so much depth as people. You no sooner could scoop up a handful of ocean and say ""nope, there are no whales in the ocean"", than you can limit people. I can see why she felt I could be a brain surgeon because of how my mind ""worked"" not because I was a horizon child who was bored with how easy math was.  I may be average or genius or both at once. Practice certainly improves our ability in any field but I am more interested on Einsteins take on developing our imagination and ingenuity. Because most of us will not be gifted a career, a business,or a home. Many highly skilled and intelligent people in the world are trying to have clean water, electricity, a way to get a loan to finance the means to survive. Even looking at the toys children refugees create from old cartons and recycled tin, the systems of purifying water, harnessing wind power. Most of these people have never been tested for intelligence and their skill sets may never be, but the intelligence is obvious if you look and listen. So when it comes to the USA and our classroom doctrine and systems of importance I urge anyone struggling to not be discouraged.  A very big part of who we become is who we desire to be and who molds us what we are exposed to and how. The brain is coded so uniquely for each individual person it truly is a fascinating subject. It also occured to me that being told I was smart and capable of great things instead of the opposite, made me identify with that aspect of myself. Whereas before at that age, I could have very easily identified with not being capable.Being shamed, putting all my energy into something else so I could feel accepted. It may be a popular opinion that ""participating"" doesn't deserve a ribbon, and that standardized testing, SAT's , ACT's will sort everything out for the best and the brightest but how can we know that? If Albert had stayed in Nazi era Germany as a failing patent clerk he may have died. Without this immigrants contributions where would we be? There are other seemingly ordinary or below average people in the world like Einstein who suffer mockery for being slow or different or innovative. People who do not even imagine the depth of their own potential. Illarion Merculief in a Native Alaskan teacher who wrote at length about when he was a child. When his particular education began he was rarely spoken to at all, or directed by adults. He shadowed his elders in everything they did. So he developed his ability, attention span, interpersonal skill, and the ability to be a free thinker.  Working with musicians from Mali I noted how advanced little toddlers were at their instruments. They too had a unique education yielding uncommon skill levels. Some ancient cultures were forced to assimilate and in converting their style of education the wealth of wisdom and education they had already developed was sadly overlooked, forgotten or forbidden.  The greatest minds throughout the ages seem to have realized this. It is radical to re-imagine ones place. To not need the best diploma or any at all, the right looks, the correct car,the perfect community. Einsteins letters to his college friends were endearing and exhillerating, witty and wonderful. None of them were considered genius or important in status. I value deeply the great teachers I have had in my life. I am not saying I think education is not amazing. It is. I am also saying teachers are everywhere. Einstein spoke often about the power of imagination. A typical assignment for kids is to draw a line from one object to the other object that it matches. I never liked those. Then I learned that there was a canned answer. That firemen matched fire hoses, and cement mixers matched streets! So simple! I realized I was looking at the questions and seeing multiple possibilities. I found that more interesting. I would enjoy finding the similarities between fireman and piggy bank, or fireman and baby. It is funny to some people that I had to learn that the questions were written with a projected answer. If I learned what they projected I got the questions right. I stopped questioning and was rewarded for it.  As I matured I found the flaws in that style of education. I understand of course there is only a given amount of time to cover a certain amount of selected material. I learned the formulas that got the answers the quickest way. But my interest was not ignited. The dates and locations of wars centuries old were memorized over hours and hours the first 18 years of my life, while current policy and social and economic problems were never part of school. There were segregated learning groups based on how fast students were. Some kids with debilitating fear of reading out loud were forced to. Some that would have panic attacks playing basketball were forced to. Thats part of learning right?  There were those wonderful teachers that would carve out a lesson in the Earth Science curriculum to bring in an abandoned bee hive or to dissect owl pellets! The petition to our parents for a car wash so we could get the money to go to a waterfall and draw native plants, or to see Shindler's list at a movie house, or to see African masks at an art museum, or to visit a court house or a high power telescope. They knew that interest is essential.  Reading Einsteins book would make anyone re-think our traditional education system. Einstein teaches that knowing is not the same as understanding. More importantly, that with imagination we can solve the problems that do not have canned answers. This is who Einstein was at a fundamental level. It is hard to impart complicated theories. Even when we have learned them and passed a test we forget them. Thankfully if we recall our process of how we learned, the wisdom will never be lost. The theater piece I created began inside a card board box. I was only intending to crawl into the box while I thought. It originally was just going to be me playing in a laundry hamper as a kid (I use to do that) and the prop box would become other things throughout the story. But as I rehearsed and kept going back into the box I realized it became quite symbolic of my mind. I had a great clown teacher helping me with some physical comedy so the first scene was trying to get out of the box in every manner of way. It took a ton of practice to look true and be funny. We used an Animal Collective song. A box could be a black hole, a brain, a desk, a ship, it could be the cubicle of a poor young patent clerk named Albert. It had no rules.... yet. It was limitless. As I stripped away the limits so too did the people on the journey with me. When I put them back the reality was new. If you have ever been taught Einsteins theories on gravity, time, space and relativity, we use props to make the abstract more tangible. We show its circumstance changing, factors changing, actions changing. How else could we understand a collapsed star, mass volume, gravity , and the speed of light. Understanding what is beyond what we can see is made possible through imagination. We do it in spite of ourselves. Any number of factors can change a thing in time and space. There is something in that nothing there. Somthing that may lead to a white hole, or another universe. That great mystery just keeps unfolding and giving us more uses for our intelligence. That is made possible through our imagination. The book is personal. He was thought by many to be slow or useless in the beginning. He went through failures and through job after job. He experienced all the anxiety and stress that comes of feeling out of place and out of step and misunderstood. This is what I wanted to use to tell the story I found interesting. When Einstein finds his path he triumphantly edifies our lives with his unprecedented discoveries. Moreover his humility and generosity of spirit is so devoid of ego he offers evolved insights on life with signature humility and grace. His story inspires us to be generous in our assessment of the ability of anyone struggling. Wether it be in training another person at work, or learning a new life skill or subject, or going through hardship. When we feel superior because of what we know rather than what we understand we miss the opportunity to teach, to evolve, and most importantly to discover. Many people who are ashamed of what they dont know, or didn't learn, or learned differently, may not ever realize that they have an elegant mind and many gifts unique to them.Some of us have been taught to be afraid to be wrong so we never learn. Albert taught me to ask questions, to not assume I know the most, to not let others dictate my worth based on a spelling error or lack of information or solid teacher. Einstein's story reminds us to never underestimate anyone.I think anxiety and stress are blocks produced by outdated attitudes that can be changed. We all must fail so we can learn. That does not mean we should try to make misstakes. That would be a pretty pittiful assesment of this lesson. It means you can perfect a 3 point shot if you try and fail many times and learn from that failure. It means that you can be a great math teacher if math was a difficult subject for you, It means to create somthing transcendent the work that leads up to it might not be understood or might get put down, it means when you work at a sandwich shop, or as a surgeon, as an actor or a musician all of your success came from your process of getting things wrong until you got it right. Einstein lived this truth, that is why his quote is so crucial for us to remember. He said, ""Failure is success in progress."" Failure is as important to ones work as success is. The world may not want us to realize that but it is true. People with less patience might like you to think they do everything right the first time but that isnt true. We often hear make it ""look effortless"". That does not mean it was. I also think if we heeded Einstein's statement we would find a great deal of people whose hard work was never given credit, so that someone else could say it was ""effortless"", or could say it was their own idea so they could profit from it. Throughout time whole cultures of people were deemed ""ignorant"", ""insignificant"", ""barbaric"", 'useless to educate"" by people who swindled them and feared them. We know better than that.

It’s all--academics, religion, the economy and socioeconomic class, politics, war, discrimination, national and international relations, humanity and the human condition--really quite simple. And yet, here humanity is, 86 years later, still allowing and even endorsing those in power to ignore the insightful, educated words of our scientists, philosophers, historians, and humanitarians and to continue making horrifying, short-sighted decisions that solely benefit the greedy cullions who don’t give a flip about humanity (or anyone other than themselves, really). Rant over--but seriously--”baaaaaa.”Back to the review: The World As I See It is an accessible portal into the brilliant mind of a man who has a great deal of insight on world issues and solutions that are incredibly relevant today (isn’t that interesting). I will say that there were moments when a few of Einstein’s solutions seemed idealized, but I cannot help but question whether or not mine is a slightly tainted, cynical perspective of someone who lives in a world where the greedy, powerful few have spread propaganda against the success of these types of solutions. There were also a few sections of the book that felt repetitive but, to Einstein’s credit, there are only so many ways that one can tactfully say “stop being a stupid, short-sighted cur and stop believing stupid, short-sighted curs ‘cause that’s why the world is going to hell.” Side note - I particularly enjoyed what Einstein had to say about science and religion in chapter 1 as well as his praise of the arts and their relevant significance throughout the entirety of this book (particularly fiction writers).

While I knew he was a pacifist, I didn't realize how outspoken Einstein was on the subject of anti-war. In many letters and essays dating from pre-WW2, he felt that mandatory service in any country's military should be outlawed and that Christians, Jews, and Muslims could live peacefully in the Middle East, giving very specific recommendations for his ideas of how to achieve a mutual understanding.

199,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2855257-christine,4,"Albert Einstein had thoughts about just about everything. He had a fine sense of social justice and he was a keen observer of his world....which sounds suspiciously like our world today. The thing that struck me most about this book, only 112 pages long and chock full of wisdom, was how much Einstein's thoughts seemed to be written for the worried 21st century citizen. He talked about the dangers of nationalism and how he felt that the American government was in a position to be the needed global leader, but that the people of America had some trouble with that idea, how nationalism disguised as patriotism is dangerous. He spoke of the need for world leaders to stick together to inspire and protect each other' s homelands.He had ideas about labor, wages, and the need for free markets, but with regulations in place in industries which become monopolies or cartels. He talked about culture, unemployment, and the best, healthy relationship of individuals within a state. Einstein was a globalist, and he made his case very well. I have had this book since I was a teen long ago but I just read it. It fits right into today's world."

I say ""essays"" because they're more like scattered thoughts without much structure or depth. Very random too. One might argue they are interesting, and they can be, some more than others. But for the most part, it's a pass. One thing I took away from reading it is that his mind was not so sophisticated in the humanities side of the spectrum; it was clear that he was too busy becoming a genius of physics and mathematics to worry about studying political science, sociology, international relations and other human science subjects before discussing it. Yet he shared his opinions. And don't get me wrong, they are valid. If you are curious, go ahead. But in most cases you won't find it much different from talking to an ordinary person next to you in the bus stop."

206,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/558933-aditi,4,"My scattered thoughts: As far as Science is concerned, I liked that he conveyed the fact that Science is work, not magic. The more you work, the more magical your mind seems to others, but it is all a result of work, work and more work. The popular narratives for most famous scientists almost always make them out to be superhumans - they usually made their discoveries by simply dreaming or staring into fires or taking a walk. Einstein corrects that view. I also liked his address on Lorentz, where I learnt for the first time, the role played by Lorentz in ""unifying"" scientists. As far as politics is concerned, Einstein's world as he saw it, consisted primarily of Germany and the USA. To a lesser extent other parts of Europe. The book should have been titled ""Germany and the awesome USA as I see it"". Yes, he was dazzled by the riches of America and didn't bother wondering where they came from. He was also fascinated by privatisation. Although, I guess when he visited, not everything was privatised (banks, prisons, wars etc), so his fascination may be justified. The collection is a bit repetitive - especially the parts concerning pacifism/disarmament. A few speeches/letters would have been sufficient. Also, the language is a bit weird. Overall, it was somewhat fun knowing his ideas, although I do not completely agree with him and he seems to not like women much. "

The writings represented another side of Einstein's personality, beside the fact about his genius as well known. They revealed his views on some aspects of life and international issues. You can find his point of view about life, science, education, liberty, world economic crisis, war, disarmament, military, politic, nationalism, American, European, Jewish, etc.Reading this book, I see Einstein's great attention in the development of science and education. I was interested on his view about the relation between science and religion. He was quite wise on the thought. Toward the international progress on the time, he also showed his attention and comments, his agreement and disagreement. And as I noticed, he put the psychological aspect and humanity in a high place.Well, overall, he was cool in some part of his wisdom on seeing the life and its components.But, as a Jewish, he appreciated the formation and the progress of Zionism too high. His point of view about Zionism and the foundation of Jewish nation at Palestine wasn't in agreement with the facts. Yeah... we've already seen..."

Maybe because most of the essays in the book are translated ! However I found the few ideas I grasped interesting. The one related to mandatory army service is new to me. Haven't thought about the issue like that before and I don't think it is too simple like that. 'To stop war around the world we need to fight the narrow nationalism and prevent the countries from having compulsory service in the army' This really simplifies the case. However it still needs to be considered in further readings. One more idea that really hooked me was about the economy; Real and apparent over-production. I always thought about that ! To have all the people work and unemployment to reach zero, for sure there will be an over production of goods which means that consumption increase and people will be busy consuming goods. High consumption rate will degrade humanity into materialistic society. The question I always asked; How to make everyone work in a society while producing enough good for everyone ?! I am still searching for a book that can answer that question !"

He was no doubt a wise man and a seeker of truth and peace. The political ideals in which he believed in are to be admired, especially when considering the hard times he lived in. The book shows a great variety of letters in which Albert Einstein expresses his views on matters of war and peace, economics and education all around the world.I was going to give it 4 stars, but the last 10 pages of the book were somehow disappointing. Being a Jew, Einstein was standing, of course, in the favour of anything in interest of the Jew community. He absolutely supported the Zionist project in Palestine and saw that the Jews had every right for that movement. Understandable, if he hadn't been such an enthusiast about peace and the ending of all the violence in this world. Those letters being written in 1933, I wonder what his opinion was after witnessing the masaccers of 1948.."

225,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105194626-diana,4,"""Failure is success in progress"" Einstein on processI acquired this and many books about the man while creating a theater performance about Albert. Out of all the books I researched this one included some origin stories that made an impression on me. When I was little I was diagnosed dyslexic after writing some letters backwards at school. An SLD teacher intervened and sent me to be tested. I did not get bad grades. It was not that I was incapable, or less intelligent than other students. Even if I was it may not have mattered. What I learned was simple: There are different ways to learn and there are different ways to study. Being the youngest in a big family I learned a lot from just having siblings. I did not have much one on one time with an adult but I did have a built in process of observation and socializing.My IQ was tested when I was seven. I was nervous. I was already acutely aware of the stigma attached to the feedback I was getting. 90 percent of the adults around me did not understand what learning ""disabilities"" actually were. I think young people are often not diagnosed correctly or taught accordingly. From a very young age I had a hyper awareness of everything I did because in a big group of older siblings I was told what and how to do things several times over. When I wanted to do something on my own I dragged it under the table. That was crucial to learning. One of the things I did a lot of was listening. By the time it was my turn to read I had heard my sisters sounding out words at the kitchen table for a few years so I put together words fast and I loved stories. That was fortunate. I.Q. may be able to tell us about how some people reason but it is not the only factor in determining intelligence. The Dr. was very excited and she told my mom a bit about what area my reasoning skill set fell into and my ""percentile"". Suddenly the way I was being viewed before completely changed. Why? The high number meant I was ok? She told my Mom I should be a brain surgeon. No kidding. She also made a point to tell me Einstein had trouble counting pocket change. This was a revelation to me. I could count pocket change! The very act of her lifting that burden from my tender mind grounded me in a very important reality. We have so much depth as people. You no sooner could scoop up a handful of ocean and say ""nope, there are no whales in the ocean"", than you can limit people. I can see why she felt I could be a brain surgeon because of how my mind ""worked"" not because I was a horizon child who was bored with how easy math was.  I may be average or genius or both at once. Practice certainly improves our ability in any field but I am more interested on Einsteins take on developing our imagination and ingenuity. Because most of us will not be gifted a career, a business,or a home. Many highly skilled and intelligent people in the world are trying to have clean water, electricity, a way to get a loan to finance the means to survive. Even looking at the toys children refugees create from old cartons and recycled tin, the systems of purifying water, harnessing wind power. Most of these people have never been tested for intelligence and their skill sets may never be, but the intelligence is obvious if you look and listen. So when it comes to the USA and our classroom doctrine and systems of importance I urge anyone struggling to not be discouraged.  A very big part of who we become is who we desire to be and who molds us what we are exposed to and how. The brain is coded so uniquely for each individual person it truly is a fascinating subject. It also occured to me that being told I was smart and capable of great things instead of the opposite, made me identify with that aspect of myself. Whereas before at that age, I could have very easily identified with not being capable.Being shamed, putting all my energy into something else so I could feel accepted. It may be a popular opinion that ""participating"" doesn't deserve a ribbon, and that standardized testing, SAT's , ACT's will sort everything out for the best and the brightest but how can we know that? If Albert had stayed in Nazi era Germany as a failing patent clerk he may have died. Without this immigrants contributions where would we be? There are other seemingly ordinary or below average people in the world like Einstein who suffer mockery for being slow or different or innovative. People who do not even imagine the depth of their own potential. Illarion Merculief in a Native Alaskan teacher who wrote at length about when he was a child. When his particular education began he was rarely spoken to at all, or directed by adults. He shadowed his elders in everything they did. So he developed his ability, attention span, interpersonal skill, and the ability to be a free thinker.  Working with musicians from Mali I noted how advanced little toddlers were at their instruments. They too had a unique education yielding uncommon skill levels. Some ancient cultures were forced to assimilate and in converting their style of education the wealth of wisdom and education they had already developed was sadly overlooked, forgotten or forbidden.  The greatest minds throughout the ages seem to have realized this. It is radical to re-imagine ones place. To not need the best diploma or any at all, the right looks, the correct car,the perfect community. Einsteins letters to his college friends were endearing and exhillerating, witty and wonderful. None of them were considered genius or important in status. I value deeply the great teachers I have had in my life. I am not saying I think education is not amazing. It is. I am also saying teachers are everywhere. Einstein spoke often about the power of imagination. A typical assignment for kids is to draw a line from one object to the other object that it matches. I never liked those. Then I learned that there was a canned answer. That firemen matched fire hoses, and cement mixers matched streets! So simple! I realized I was looking at the questions and seeing multiple possibilities. I found that more interesting. I would enjoy finding the similarities between fireman and piggy bank, or fireman and baby. It is funny to some people that I had to learn that the questions were written with a projected answer. If I learned what they projected I got the questions right. I stopped questioning and was rewarded for it.  As I matured I found the flaws in that style of education. I understand of course there is only a given amount of time to cover a certain amount of selected material. I learned the formulas that got the answers the quickest way. But my interest was not ignited. The dates and locations of wars centuries old were memorized over hours and hours the first 18 years of my life, while current policy and social and economic problems were never part of school. There were segregated learning groups based on how fast students were. Some kids with debilitating fear of reading out loud were forced to. Some that would have panic attacks playing basketball were forced to. Thats part of learning right?  There were those wonderful teachers that would carve out a lesson in the Earth Science curriculum to bring in an abandoned bee hive or to dissect owl pellets! The petition to our parents for a car wash so we could get the money to go to a waterfall and draw native plants, or to see Shindler's list at a movie house, or to see African masks at an art museum, or to visit a court house or a high power telescope. They knew that interest is essential.  Reading Einsteins book would make anyone re-think our traditional education system. Einstein teaches that knowing is not the same as understanding. More importantly, that with imagination we can solve the problems that do not have canned answers. This is who Einstein was at a fundamental level. It is hard to impart complicated theories. Even when we have learned them and passed a test we forget them. Thankfully if we recall our process of how we learned, the wisdom will never be lost. The theater piece I created began inside a card board box. I was only intending to crawl into the box while I thought. It originally was just going to be me playing in a laundry hamper as a kid (I use to do that) and the prop box would become other things throughout the story. But as I rehearsed and kept going back into the box I realized it became quite symbolic of my mind. I had a great clown teacher helping me with some physical comedy so the first scene was trying to get out of the box in every manner of way. It took a ton of practice to look true and be funny. We used an Animal Collective song. A box could be a black hole, a brain, a desk, a ship, it could be the cubicle of a poor young patent clerk named Albert. It had no rules.... yet. It was limitless. As I stripped away the limits so too did the people on the journey with me. When I put them back the reality was new. If you have ever been taught Einsteins theories on gravity, time, space and relativity, we use props to make the abstract more tangible. We show its circumstance changing, factors changing, actions changing. How else could we understand a collapsed star, mass volume, gravity , and the speed of light. Understanding what is beyond what we can see is made possible through imagination. We do it in spite of ourselves. Any number of factors can change a thing in time and space. There is something in that nothing there. Somthing that may lead to a white hole, or another universe. That great mystery just keeps unfolding and giving us more uses for our intelligence. That is made possible through our imagination. The book is personal. He was thought by many to be slow or useless in the beginning. He went through failures and through job after job. He experienced all the anxiety and stress that comes of feeling out of place and out of step and misunderstood. This is what I wanted to use to tell the story I found interesting. When Einstein finds his path he triumphantly edifies our lives with his unprecedented discoveries. Moreover his humility and generosity of spirit is so devoid of ego he offers evolved insights on life with signature humility and grace. His story inspires us to be generous in our assessment of the ability of anyone struggling. Wether it be in training another person at work, or learning a new life skill or subject, or going through hardship. When we feel superior because of what we know rather than what we understand we miss the opportunity to teach, to evolve, and most importantly to discover. Many people who are ashamed of what they dont know, or didn't learn, or learned differently, may not ever realize that they have an elegant mind and many gifts unique to them.Some of us have been taught to be afraid to be wrong so we never learn. Albert taught me to ask questions, to not assume I know the most, to not let others dictate my worth based on a spelling error or lack of information or solid teacher. Einstein's story reminds us to never underestimate anyone.I think anxiety and stress are blocks produced by outdated attitudes that can be changed. We all must fail so we can learn. That does not mean we should try to make misstakes. That would be a pretty pittiful assesment of this lesson. It means you can perfect a 3 point shot if you try and fail many times and learn from that failure. It means that you can be a great math teacher if math was a difficult subject for you, It means to create somthing transcendent the work that leads up to it might not be understood or might get put down, it means when you work at a sandwich shop, or as a surgeon, as an actor or a musician all of your success came from your process of getting things wrong until you got it right. Einstein lived this truth, that is why his quote is so crucial for us to remember. He said, ""Failure is success in progress."" Failure is as important to ones work as success is. The world may not want us to realize that but it is true. People with less patience might like you to think they do everything right the first time but that isnt true. We often hear make it ""look effortless"". That does not mean it was. I also think if we heeded Einstein's statement we would find a great deal of people whose hard work was never given credit, so that someone else could say it was ""effortless"", or could say it was their own idea so they could profit from it. Throughout time whole cultures of people were deemed ""ignorant"", ""insignificant"", ""barbaric"", 'useless to educate"" by people who swindled them and feared them. We know better than that. Thankfully Einstein had the courage and was motivated by his love of the world to continue his work.Reading his own words in this book is a treasure."

He had a fine sense of social justice and he was a keen observer of his world....which sounds suspiciously like our world today. The thing that struck me most about this book, only 112 pages long and chock full of wisdom, was how much Einstein's thoughts seemed to be written for the worried 21st century citizen. He talked about the dangers of nationalism and how he felt that the American government was in a position to be the needed global leader, but that the people of America had some trouble with that idea, how nationalism disguised as patriotism is dangerous. He spoke of the need for world leaders to stick together to inspire and protect each other' s homelands.He had ideas about labor, wages, and the need for free markets, but with regulations in place in industries which become monopolies or cartels. He talked about culture, unemployment, and the best, healthy relationship of individuals within a state. Einstein was a globalist, and he made his case very well. I have had this book since I was a teen long ago but I just read it. It fits right into today's world."

I say ""essays"" because they're more like scattered thoughts without much structure or depth. Very random too. One might argue they are interesting, and they can be, some more than others. But for the most part, it's a pass. One thing I took away from reading it is that his mind was not so sophisticated in the humanities side of the spectrum; it was clear that he was too busy becoming a genius of physics and mathematics to worry about studying political science, sociology, international relations and other human science subjects before discussing it. Yet he shared his opinions. And don't get me wrong, they are valid. If you are curious, go ahead.

236,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/558933-aditi,4,"My scattered thoughts: As far as Science is concerned, I liked that he conveyed the fact that Science is work, not magic. The more you work, the more magical your mind seems to others, but it is all a result of work, work and more work. The popular narratives for most famous scientists almost always make them out to be superhumans - they usually made their discoveries by simply dreaming or staring into fires or taking a walk. Einstein corrects that view. I also liked his address on Lorentz, where I learnt for the first time, the role played by Lorentz in ""unifying"" scientists. As far as politics is concerned, Einstein's world as he saw it, consisted primarily of Germany and the USA. To a lesser extent other parts of Europe. The book should have been titled ""Germany and the awesome USA as I see it"". Yes, he was dazzled by the riches of America and didn't bother wondering where they came from. He was also fascinated by privatisation. Although, I guess when he visited, not everything was privatised (banks, prisons, wars etc), so his fascination may be justified. The collection is a bit repetitive - especially the parts concerning pacifism/disarmament. A few speeches/letters would have been sufficient. Also, the language is a bit weird. Overall, it was somewhat fun knowing his ideas, although I do not completely agree with him and he seems to not like women much. "

The writings represented another side of Einstein's personality, beside the fact about his genius as well known. They revealed his views on some aspects of life and international issues. You can find his point of view about life, science, education, liberty, world economic crisis, war, disarmament, military, politic, nationalism, American, European, Jewish, etc.Reading this book, I see Einstein's great attention in the development of science and education. I was interested on his view about the relation between science and religion. He was quite wise on the thought. Toward the international progress on the time, he also showed his attention and comments, his agreement and disagreement. And as I noticed, he put the psychological aspect and humanity in a high place.Well, overall, he was cool in some part of his wisdom on seeing the life and its components.But, as a Jewish, he appreciated the formation and the progress of Zionism too high. His point of view about Zionism and the foundation of Jewish nation at Palestine wasn't in agreement with the facts. Yeah... we've already seen..."

Maybe because most of the essays in the book are translated ! However I found the few ideas I grasped interesting. The one related to mandatory army service is new to me. Haven't thought about the issue like that before and I don't think it is too simple like that. 'To stop war around the world we need to fight the narrow nationalism and prevent the countries from having compulsory service in the army' This really simplifies the case. However it still needs to be considered in further readings. One more idea that really hooked me was about the economy; Real and apparent over-production. I always thought about that ! To have all the people work and unemployment to reach zero, for sure there will be an over production of goods which means that consumption increase and people will be busy consuming goods. High consumption rate will degrade humanity into materialistic society. The question I always asked; How to make everyone work in a society while producing enough good for everyone ?! I am still searching for a book that can answer that question !"

He was no doubt a wise man and a seeker of truth and peace. The political ideals in which he believed in are to be admired, especially when considering the hard times he lived in. The book shows a great variety of letters in which Albert Einstein expresses his views on matters of war and peace, economics and education all around the world.I was going to give it 4 stars, but the last 10 pages of the book were somehow disappointing. Being a Jew, Einstein was standing, of course, in the favour of anything in interest of the Jew community. He absolutely supported the Zionist project in Palestine and saw that the Jews had every right for that movement. Understandable, if he hadn't been such an enthusiast about peace and the ending of all the violence in this world. Those letters being written in 1933, I wonder what his opinion was after witnessing the masaccers of 1948.."

255,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105194626-diana,4,"""Failure is success in progress"" Einstein on processI acquired this and many books about the man while creating a theater performance about Albert. Out of all the books I researched this one included some origin stories that made an impression on me. When I was little I was diagnosed dyslexic after writing some letters backwards at school. An SLD teacher intervened and sent me to be tested. I did not get bad grades. It was not that I was incapable, or less intelligent than other students. Even if I was it may not have mattered. What I learned was simple: There are different ways to learn and there are different ways to study. Being the youngest in a big family I learned a lot from just having siblings. I did not have much one on one time with an adult but I did have a built in process of observation and socializing.My IQ was tested when I was seven. I was nervous. I was already acutely aware of the stigma attached to the feedback I was getting. 90 percent of the adults around me did not understand what learning ""disabilities"" actually were. I think young people are often not diagnosed correctly or taught accordingly. From a very young age I had a hyper awareness of everything I did because in a big group of older siblings I was told what and how to do things several times over. When I wanted to do something on my own I dragged it under the table. That was crucial to learning. One of the things I did a lot of was listening. By the time it was my turn to read I had heard my sisters sounding out words at the kitchen table for a few years so I put together words fast and I loved stories. That was fortunate. I.Q. may be able to tell us about how some people reason but it is not the only factor in determining intelligence. The Dr. was very excited and she told my mom a bit about what area my reasoning skill set fell into and my ""percentile"". Suddenly the way I was being viewed before completely changed. Why? The high number meant I was ok? She told my Mom I should be a brain surgeon. No kidding. She also made a point to tell me Einstein had trouble counting pocket change. This was a revelation to me. I could count pocket change! The very act of her lifting that burden from my tender mind grounded me in a very important reality. We have so much depth as people. You no sooner could scoop up a handful of ocean and say ""nope, there are no whales in the ocean"", than you can limit people. I can see why she felt I could be a brain surgeon because of how my mind ""worked"" not because I was a horizon child who was bored with how easy math was.  I may be average or genius or both at once. Practice certainly improves our ability in any field but I am more interested on Einsteins take on developing our imagination and ingenuity. Because most of us will not be gifted a career, a business,or a home. Many highly skilled and intelligent people in the world are trying to have clean water, electricity, a way to get a loan to finance the means to survive. Even looking at the toys children refugees create from old cartons and recycled tin, the systems of purifying water, harnessing wind power. Most of these people have never been tested for intelligence and their skill sets may never be, but the intelligence is obvious if you look and listen. So when it comes to the USA and our classroom doctrine and systems of importance I urge anyone struggling to not be discouraged.  A very big part of who we become is who we desire to be and who molds us what we are exposed to and how. The brain is coded so uniquely for each individual person it truly is a fascinating subject. It also occured to me that being told I was smart and capable of great things instead of the opposite, made me identify with that aspect of myself. Whereas before at that age, I could have very easily identified with not being capable.Being shamed, putting all my energy into something else so I could feel accepted. It may be a popular opinion that ""participating"" doesn't deserve a ribbon, and that standardized testing, SAT's , ACT's will sort everything out for the best and the brightest but how can we know that? If Albert had stayed in Nazi era Germany as a failing patent clerk he may have died. Without this immigrants contributions where would we be? There are other seemingly ordinary or below average people in the world like Einstein who suffer mockery for being slow or different or innovative. People who do not even imagine the depth of their own potential. Illarion Merculief in a Native Alaskan teacher who wrote at length about when he was a child. When his particular education began he was rarely spoken to at all, or directed by adults. He shadowed his elders in everything they did. So he developed his ability, attention span, interpersonal skill, and the ability to be a free thinker.  Working with musicians from Mali I noted how advanced little toddlers were at their instruments. They too had a unique education yielding uncommon skill levels. Some ancient cultures were forced to assimilate and in converting their style of education the wealth of wisdom and education they had already developed was sadly overlooked, forgotten or forbidden.  The greatest minds throughout the ages seem to have realized this. It is radical to re-imagine ones place. To not need the best diploma or any at all, the right looks, the correct car,the perfect community. Einsteins letters to his college friends were endearing and exhillerating, witty and wonderful. None of them were considered genius or important in status. I value deeply the great teachers I have had in my life. I am not saying I think education is not amazing. It is. I am also saying teachers are everywhere. Einstein spoke often about the power of imagination. A typical assignment for kids is to draw a line from one object to the other object that it matches. I never liked those. Then I learned that there was a canned answer. That firemen matched fire hoses, and cement mixers matched streets! So simple! I realized I was looking at the questions and seeing multiple possibilities. I found that more interesting. I would enjoy finding the similarities between fireman and piggy bank, or fireman and baby. It is funny to some people that I had to learn that the questions were written with a projected answer. If I learned what they projected I got the questions right. I stopped questioning and was rewarded for it.  As I matured I found the flaws in that style of education. I understand of course there is only a given amount of time to cover a certain amount of selected material. I learned the formulas that got the answers the quickest way. But my interest was not ignited. The dates and locations of wars centuries old were memorized over hours and hours the first 18 years of my life, while current policy and social and economic problems were never part of school. There were segregated learning groups based on how fast students were. Some kids with debilitating fear of reading out loud were forced to. Some that would have panic attacks playing basketball were forced to. Thats part of learning right?  There were those wonderful teachers that would carve out a lesson in the Earth Science curriculum to bring in an abandoned bee hive or to dissect owl pellets! The petition to our parents for a car wash so we could get the money to go to a waterfall and draw native plants, or to see Shindler's list at a movie house, or to see African masks at an art museum, or to visit a court house or a high power telescope. They knew that interest is essential.  Reading Einsteins book would make anyone re-think our traditional education system. Einstein teaches that knowing is not the same as understanding. More importantly, that with imagination we can solve the problems that do not have canned answers. This is who Einstein was at a fundamental level. It is hard to impart complicated theories. Even when we have learned them and passed a test we forget them. Thankfully if we recall our process of how we learned, the wisdom will never be lost. The theater piece I created began inside a card board box. I was only intending to crawl into the box while I thought. It originally was just going to be me playing in a laundry hamper as a kid (I use to do that) and the prop box would become other things throughout the story. But as I rehearsed and kept going back into the box I realized it became quite symbolic of my mind. I had a great clown teacher helping me with some physical comedy so the first scene was trying to get out of the box in every manner of way. It took a ton of practice to look true and be funny. We used an Animal Collective song. A box could be a black hole, a brain, a desk, a ship, it could be the cubicle of a poor young patent clerk named Albert. It had no rules.... yet. It was limitless. As I stripped away the limits so too did the people on the journey with me. When I put them back the reality was new. If you have ever been taught Einsteins theories on gravity, time, space and relativity, we use props to make the abstract more tangible. We show its circumstance changing, factors changing, actions changing. How else could we understand a collapsed star, mass volume, gravity , and the speed of light. Understanding what is beyond what we can see is made possible through imagination. We do it in spite of ourselves. Any number of factors can change a thing in time and space. There is something in that nothing there. Somthing that may lead to a white hole, or another universe. That great mystery just keeps unfolding and giving us more uses for our intelligence. That is made possible through our imagination. The book is personal. He was thought by many to be slow or useless in the beginning. He went through failures and through job after job. He experienced all the anxiety and stress that comes of feeling out of place and out of step and misunderstood. This is what I wanted to use to tell the story I found interesting. When Einstein finds his path he triumphantly edifies our lives with his unprecedented discoveries. Moreover his humility and generosity of spirit is so devoid of ego he offers evolved insights on life with signature humility and grace. His story inspires us to be generous in our assessment of the ability of anyone struggling. Wether it be in training another person at work, or learning a new life skill or subject, or going through hardship. When we feel superior because of what we know rather than what we understand we miss the opportunity to teach, to evolve, and most importantly to discover. Many people who are ashamed of what they dont know, or didn't learn, or learned differently, may not ever realize that they have an elegant mind and many gifts unique to them.Some of us have been taught to be afraid to be wrong so we never learn. Albert taught me to ask questions, to not assume I know the most, to not let others dictate my worth based on a spelling error or lack of information or solid teacher. Einstein's story reminds us to never underestimate anyone.I think anxiety and stress are blocks produced by outdated attitudes that can be changed. We all must fail so we can learn. That does not mean we should try to make misstakes. That would be a pretty pittiful assesment of this lesson. It means you can perfect a 3 point shot if you try and fail many times and learn from that failure. It means that you can be a great math teacher if math was a difficult subject for you, It means to create somthing transcendent the work that leads up to it might not be understood or might get put down, it means when you work at a sandwich shop, or as a surgeon, as an actor or a musician all of your success came from your process of getting things wrong until you got it right. Einstein lived this truth, that is why his quote is so crucial for us to remember. He said, ""Failure is success in progress."" Failure is as important to ones work as success is. The world may not want us to realize that but it is true. People with less patience might like you to think they do everything right the first time but that isnt true. We often hear make it ""look effortless"". That does not mean it was. I also think if we heeded Einstein's statement we would find a great deal of people whose hard work was never given credit, so that someone else could say it was ""effortless"", or could say it was their own idea so they could profit from it. Throughout time whole cultures of people were deemed ""ignorant"", ""insignificant"", ""barbaric"", 'useless to educate"" by people who swindled them and feared them. We know better than that. Thankfully Einstein had the courage and was motivated by his love of the world to continue his work.Reading his own words in this book is a treasure."

It’s all--academics, religion, the economy and socioeconomic class, politics, war, discrimination, national and international relations, humanity and the human condition--really quite simple. And yet, here humanity is, 86 years later, still allowing and even endorsing those in power to ignore the insightful, educated words of our scientists, philosophers, historians, and humanitarians and to continue making horrifying, short-sighted decisions that solely benefit the greedy cullions who don’t give a flip about humanity (or anyone other than themselves, really). Rant over--but seriously--”baaaaaa.”Back to the review: The World As I See It is an accessible portal into the brilliant mind of a man who has a great deal of insight on world issues and solutions that are incredibly relevant today (isn’t that interesting). I will say that there were moments when a few of Einstein’s solutions seemed idealized, but I cannot help but question whether or not mine is a slightly tainted, cynical perspective of someone who lives in a world where the greedy, powerful few have spread propaganda against the success of these types of solutions. There were also a few sections of the book that felt repetitive but, to Einstein’s credit, there are only so many ways that one can tactfully say “stop being a stupid, short-sighted cur and stop believing stupid, short-sighted curs ‘cause that’s why the world is going to hell.” Side note - I particularly enjoyed what Einstein had to say about science and religion in chapter 1 as well as his praise of the arts and their relevant significance throughout the entirety of this book (particularly fiction writers).

The more you work, the more magical your mind seems to others, but it is all a result of work, work and more work. The popular narratives for most famous scientists almost always make them out to be superhumans - they usually made their discoveries by simply dreaming or staring into fires or taking a walk. Einstein corrects that view. I also liked his address on Lorentz, where I learnt for the first time, the role played by Lorentz in ""unifying"" scientists. As far as politics is concerned, Einstein's world as he saw it, consisted primarily of Germany and the USA. To a lesser extent other parts of Europe. The book should have been titled ""Germany and the awesome USA as I see it"". Yes, he was dazzled by the riches of America and didn't bother wondering where they came from. He was also fascinated by privatisation. Although, I guess when he visited, not everything was privatised (banks, prisons, wars etc), so his fascination may be justified. The collection is a bit repetitive - especially the parts concerning pacifism/disarmament. A few speeches/letters would have been sufficient. Also, the language is a bit weird. Overall, it was somewhat fun knowing his ideas, although I do not completely agree with him and he seems to not like women much. "

You can find his point of view about life, science, education, liberty, world economic crisis, war, disarmament, military, politic, nationalism, American, European, Jewish, etc.Reading this book, I see Einstein's great attention in the development of science and education. I was interested on his view about the relation between science and religion. He was quite wise on the thought. Toward the international progress on the time, he also showed his attention and comments, his agreement and disagreement. And as I noticed, he put the psychological aspect and humanity in a high place.Well, overall, he was cool in some part of his wisdom on seeing the life and its components.But, as a Jewish, he appreciated the formation and the progress of Zionism too high.

Maybe because most of the essays in the book are translated ! However I found the few ideas I grasped interesting. The one related to mandatory army service is new to me. Haven't thought about the issue like that before and I don't think it is too simple like that. 'To stop war around the world we need to fight the narrow nationalism and prevent the countries from having compulsory service in the army' This really simplifies the case. However it still needs to be considered in further readings. One more idea that really hooked me was about the economy; Real and apparent over-production. I always thought about that ! To have all the people work and unemployment to reach zero, for sure there will be an over production of goods which means that consumption increase and people will be busy consuming goods. High consumption rate will degrade humanity into materialistic society. The question I always asked; How to make everyone work in a society while producing enough good for everyone ?! I am still searching for a book that can answer that question !"

The book shows a great variety of letters in which Albert Einstein expresses his views on matters of war and peace, economics and education all around the world.I was going to give it 4 stars, but the last 10 pages of the book were somehow disappointing. Being a Jew, Einstein was standing, of course, in the favour of anything in interest of the Jew community. He absolutely supported the Zionist project in Palestine and saw that the Jews had every right for that movement. Understandable, if he hadn't been such an enthusiast about peace and the ending of all the violence in this world.

285,1599869659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105194626-diana,4,"""Failure is success in progress"" Einstein on processI acquired this and many books about the man while creating a theater performance about Albert. Out of all the books I researched this one included some origin stories that made an impression on me. When I was little I was diagnosed dyslexic after writing some letters backwards at school. An SLD teacher intervened and sent me to be tested. I did not get bad grades. It was not that I was incapable, or less intelligent than other students. Even if I was it may not have mattered. What I learned was simple: There are different ways to learn and there are different ways to study. Being the youngest in a big family I learned a lot from just having siblings. I did not have much one on one time with an adult but I did have a built in process of observation and socializing.My IQ was tested when I was seven. I was nervous. I was already acutely aware of the stigma attached to the feedback I was getting. 90 percent of the adults around me did not understand what learning ""disabilities"" actually were. I think young people are often not diagnosed correctly or taught accordingly. From a very young age I had a hyper awareness of everything I did because in a big group of older siblings I was told what and how to do things several times over. When I wanted to do something on my own I dragged it under the table. That was crucial to learning. One of the things I did a lot of was listening. By the time it was my turn to read I had heard my sisters sounding out words at the kitchen table for a few years so I put together words fast and I loved stories. That was fortunate. I.Q. may be able to tell us about how some people reason but it is not the only factor in determining intelligence. The Dr. was very excited and she told my mom a bit about what area my reasoning skill set fell into and my ""percentile"". Suddenly the way I was being viewed before completely changed. Why? The high number meant I was ok? She told my Mom I should be a brain surgeon. No kidding. She also made a point to tell me Einstein had trouble counting pocket change. This was a revelation to me. I could count pocket change! The very act of her lifting that burden from my tender mind grounded me in a very important reality. We have so much depth as people. You no sooner could scoop up a handful of ocean and say ""nope, there are no whales in the ocean"", than you can limit people. I can see why she felt I could be a brain surgeon because of how my mind ""worked"" not because I was a horizon child who was bored with how easy math was.  I may be average or genius or both at once. Practice certainly improves our ability in any field but I am more interested on Einsteins take on developing our imagination and ingenuity. Because most of us will not be gifted a career, a business,or a home. Many highly skilled and intelligent people in the world are trying to have clean water, electricity, a way to get a loan to finance the means to survive. Even looking at the toys children refugees create from old cartons and recycled tin, the systems of purifying water, harnessing wind power. Most of these people have never been tested for intelligence and their skill sets may never be, but the intelligence is obvious if you look and listen. So when it comes to the USA and our classroom doctrine and systems of importance I urge anyone struggling to not be discouraged.  A very big part of who we become is who we desire to be and who molds us what we are exposed to and how. The brain is coded so uniquely for each individual person it truly is a fascinating subject. It also occured to me that being told I was smart and capable of great things instead of the opposite, made me identify with that aspect of myself. Whereas before at that age, I could have very easily identified with not being capable.Being shamed, putting all my energy into something else so I could feel accepted. It may be a popular opinion that ""participating"" doesn't deserve a ribbon, and that standardized testing, SAT's , ACT's will sort everything out for the best and the brightest but how can we know that? If Albert had stayed in Nazi era Germany as a failing patent clerk he may have died. Without this immigrants contributions where would we be? There are other seemingly ordinary or below average people in the world like Einstein who suffer mockery for being slow or different or innovative. People who do not even imagine the depth of their own potential. Illarion Merculief in a Native Alaskan teacher who wrote at length about when he was a child. When his particular education began he was rarely spoken to at all, or directed by adults. He shadowed his elders in everything they did. So he developed his ability, attention span, interpersonal skill, and the ability to be a free thinker.  Working with musicians from Mali I noted how advanced little toddlers were at their instruments. They too had a unique education yielding uncommon skill levels. Some ancient cultures were forced to assimilate and in converting their style of education the wealth of wisdom and education they had already developed was sadly overlooked, forgotten or forbidden.  The greatest minds throughout the ages seem to have realized this. It is radical to re-imagine ones place. To not need the best diploma or any at all, the right looks, the correct car,the perfect community. Einsteins letters to his college friends were endearing and exhillerating, witty and wonderful. None of them were considered genius or important in status. I value deeply the great teachers I have had in my life. I am not saying I think education is not amazing. It is. I am also saying teachers are everywhere. Einstein spoke often about the power of imagination. A typical assignment for kids is to draw a line from one object to the other object that it matches. I never liked those. Then I learned that there was a canned answer. That firemen matched fire hoses, and cement mixers matched streets! So simple! I realized I was looking at the questions and seeing multiple possibilities. I found that more interesting. I would enjoy finding the similarities between fireman and piggy bank, or fireman and baby. It is funny to some people that I had to learn that the questions were written with a projected answer. If I learned what they projected I got the questions right. I stopped questioning and was rewarded for it.  As I matured I found the flaws in that style of education. I understand of course there is only a given amount of time to cover a certain amount of selected material. I learned the formulas that got the answers the quickest way. But my interest was not ignited. The dates and locations of wars centuries old were memorized over hours and hours the first 18 years of my life, while current policy and social and economic problems were never part of school. There were segregated learning groups based on how fast students were. Some kids with debilitating fear of reading out loud were forced to. Some that would have panic attacks playing basketball were forced to. Thats part of learning right?  There were those wonderful teachers that would carve out a lesson in the Earth Science curriculum to bring in an abandoned bee hive or to dissect owl pellets! The petition to our parents for a car wash so we could get the money to go to a waterfall and draw native plants, or to see Shindler's list at a movie house, or to see African masks at an art museum, or to visit a court house or a high power telescope. They knew that interest is essential.  Reading Einsteins book would make anyone re-think our traditional education system. Einstein teaches that knowing is not the same as understanding. More importantly, that with imagination we can solve the problems that do not have canned answers. This is who Einstein was at a fundamental level. It is hard to impart complicated theories. Even when we have learned them and passed a test we forget them. Thankfully if we recall our process of how we learned, the wisdom will never be lost. The theater piece I created began inside a card board box. I was only intending to crawl into the box while I thought. It originally was just going to be me playing in a laundry hamper as a kid (I use to do that) and the prop box would become other things throughout the story. But as I rehearsed and kept going back into the box I realized it became quite symbolic of my mind. I had a great clown teacher helping me with some physical comedy so the first scene was trying to get out of the box in every manner of way. It took a ton of practice to look true and be funny. We used an Animal Collective song. A box could be a black hole, a brain, a desk, a ship, it could be the cubicle of a poor young patent clerk named Albert. It had no rules.... yet. It was limitless. As I stripped away the limits so too did the people on the journey with me. When I put them back the reality was new. If you have ever been taught Einsteins theories on gravity, time, space and relativity, we use props to make the abstract more tangible. We show its circumstance changing, factors changing, actions changing. How else could we understand a collapsed star, mass volume, gravity , and the speed of light. Understanding what is beyond what we can see is made possible through imagination. We do it in spite of ourselves. Any number of factors can change a thing in time and space. There is something in that nothing there. Somthing that may lead to a white hole, or another universe. That great mystery just keeps unfolding and giving us more uses for our intelligence. That is made possible through our imagination. The book is personal. He was thought by many to be slow or useless in the beginning. He went through failures and through job after job. He experienced all the anxiety and stress that comes of feeling out of place and out of step and misunderstood. This is what I wanted to use to tell the story I found interesting. When Einstein finds his path he triumphantly edifies our lives with his unprecedented discoveries. Moreover his humility and generosity of spirit is so devoid of ego he offers evolved insights on life with signature humility and grace. His story inspires us to be generous in our assessment of the ability of anyone struggling. Wether it be in training another person at work, or learning a new life skill or subject, or going through hardship. When we feel superior because of what we know rather than what we understand we miss the opportunity to teach, to evolve, and most importantly to discover. Many people who are ashamed of what they dont know, or didn't learn, or learned differently, may not ever realize that they have an elegant mind and many gifts unique to them.Some of us have been taught to be afraid to be wrong so we never learn. Albert taught me to ask questions, to not assume I know the most, to not let others dictate my worth based on a spelling error or lack of information or solid teacher. Einstein's story reminds us to never underestimate anyone.I think anxiety and stress are blocks produced by outdated attitudes that can be changed. We all must fail so we can learn. That does not mean we should try to make misstakes. That would be a pretty pittiful assesment of this lesson. It means you can perfect a 3 point shot if you try and fail many times and learn from that failure. It means that you can be a great math teacher if math was a difficult subject for you, It means to create somthing transcendent the work that leads up to it might not be understood or might get put down, it means when you work at a sandwich shop, or as a surgeon, as an actor or a musician all of your success came from your process of getting things wrong until you got it right. Einstein lived this truth, that is why his quote is so crucial for us to remember. He said, ""Failure is success in progress."" Failure is as important to ones work as success is. The world may not want us to realize that but it is true. People with less patience might like you to think they do everything right the first time but that isnt true. We often hear make it ""look effortless"". That does not mean it was. I also think if we heeded Einstein's statement we would find a great deal of people whose hard work was never given credit, so that someone else could say it was ""effortless"", or could say it was their own idea so they could profit from it. Throughout time whole cultures of people were deemed ""ignorant"", ""insignificant"", ""barbaric"", 'useless to educate"" by people who swindled them and feared them. We know better than that. Thankfully Einstein had the courage and was motivated by his love of the world to continue his work.Reading his own words in this book is a treasure."

It’s all--academics, religion, the economy and socioeconomic class, politics, war, discrimination, national and international relations, humanity and the human condition--really quite simple. And yet, here humanity is, 86 years later, still allowing and even endorsing those in power to ignore the insightful, educated words of our scientists, philosophers, historians, and humanitarians and to continue making horrifying, short-sighted decisions that solely benefit the greedy cullions who don’t give a flip about humanity (or anyone other than themselves, really). Rant over--but seriously--”baaaaaa.”Back to the review: The World As I See It is an accessible portal into the brilliant mind of a man who has a great deal of insight on world issues and solutions that are incredibly relevant today (isn’t that interesting). I will say that there were moments when a few of Einstein’s solutions seemed idealized, but I cannot help but question whether or not mine is a slightly tainted, cynical perspective of someone who lives in a world where the greedy, powerful few have spread propaganda against the success of these types of solutions. There were also a few sections of the book that felt repetitive but, to Einstein’s credit, there are only so many ways that one can tactfully say “stop being a stupid, short-sighted cur and stop believing stupid, short-sighted curs ‘cause that’s why the world is going to hell.” Side note - I particularly enjoyed what Einstein had to say about science and religion in chapter 1 as well as his praise of the arts and their relevant significance throughout the entirety of this book (particularly fiction writers).

I wonder what he would say if he saw the world today.Anyhow, the articles I highlighted and underlined the most are:The World As I See ItGood and EvilSociety and PersonalityTo the Schoolchildren of JapanReligion and ScienceSome Notes on My American ImpressionTo Sigmund FreudThe International of ScienceThe Institute for Intellectual Co-operationThe Question of DisarmamentThoughts on the World Economic CrisisCulture and ProsperityGermany and the Prussian Academy of ScienceLetter to an Arab"

The thing that struck me most about this book, only 112 pages long and chock full of wisdom, was how much Einstein's thoughts seemed to be written for the worried 21st century citizen. He talked about the dangers of nationalism and how he felt that the American government was in a position to be the needed global leader, but that the people of America had some trouble with that idea, how nationalism disguised as patriotism is dangerous. He spoke of the need for world leaders to stick together to inspire and protect each other' s homelands.He had ideas about labor, wages, and the need for free markets, but with regulations in place in industries which become monopolies or cartels. He talked about culture, unemployment, and the best, healthy relationship of individuals within a state. Einstein was a globalist, and he made his case very well. I have had this book since I was a teen long ago but I just read it. It fits right into today's world."

The popular narratives for most famous scientists almost always make them out to be superhumans - they usually made their discoveries by simply dreaming or staring into fires or taking a walk. Einstein corrects that view. I also liked his address on Lorentz, where I learnt for the first time, the role played by Lorentz in ""unifying"" scientists. As far as politics is concerned, Einstein's world as he saw it, consisted primarily of Germany and the USA. To a lesser extent other parts of Europe. The book should have been titled ""Germany and the awesome USA as I see it"". Yes, he was dazzled by the riches of America and didn't bother wondering where they came from. He was also fascinated by privatisation. Although, I guess when he visited, not everything was privatised (banks, prisons, wars etc), so his fascination may be justified. The collection is a bit repetitive - especially the parts concerning pacifism/disarmament. A few speeches/letters would have been sufficient. Also, the language is a bit weird. Overall, it was somewhat fun knowing his ideas, although I do not completely agree with him and he seems to not like women much. "

The writings represented another side of Einstein's personality, beside the fact about his genius as well known. They revealed his views on some aspects of life and international issues. You can find his point of view about life, science, education, liberty, world economic crisis, war, disarmament, military, politic, nationalism, American, European, Jewish, etc.Reading this book, I see Einstein's great attention in the development of science and education. I was interested on his view about the relation between science and religion. He was quite wise on the thought. Toward the international progress on the time, he also showed his attention and comments, his agreement and disagreement. And as I noticed, he put the psychological aspect and humanity in a high place.Well, overall, he was cool in some part of his wisdom on seeing the life and its components.But, as a Jewish, he appreciated the formation and the progress of Zionism too high. His point of view about Zionism and the foundation of Jewish nation at Palestine wasn't in agreement with the facts. Yeah... we've already seen..."

Maybe because most of the essays in the book are translated ! However I found the few ideas I grasped interesting. The one related to mandatory army service is new to me. Haven't thought about the issue like that before and I don't think it is too simple like that. 'To stop war around the world we need to fight the narrow nationalism and prevent the countries from having compulsory service in the army' This really simplifies the case. However it still needs to be considered in further readings. One more idea that really hooked me was about the economy; Real and apparent over-production. I always thought about that ! To have all the people work and unemployment to reach zero, for sure there will be an over production of goods which means that consumption increase and people will be busy consuming goods. High consumption rate will degrade humanity into materialistic society. The question I always asked; How to make everyone work in a society while producing enough good for everyone ?! I am still searching for a book that can answer that question !"

He was no doubt a wise man and a seeker of truth and peace. The political ideals in which he believed in are to be admired, especially when considering the hard times he lived in. The book shows a great variety of letters in which Albert Einstein expresses his views on matters of war and peace, economics and education all around the world.I was going to give it 4 stars, but the last 10 pages of the book were somehow disappointing. Being a Jew, Einstein was standing, of course, in the favour of anything in interest of the Jew community. He absolutely supported the Zionist project in Palestine and saw that the Jews had every right for that movement. Understandable, if he hadn't been such an enthusiast about peace and the ending of all the violence in this world. Those letters being written in 1933, I wonder what his opinion was after witnessing the masaccers of 1948.."
