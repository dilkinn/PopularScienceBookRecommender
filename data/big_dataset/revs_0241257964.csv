I was a little sceptical, having already seen a couple of unsuccessful attempts, but now that I've read it I'm convinced. It does what it says on the box.If loop quantum gravity (LQG) hasn't been on your radar, let me give you some background and explain why this is a big deal. Physics has for the last century rested on two basic theories, quantum mechanics and general relativity. Each of these is very successful at what it sets out to do (roughly, quantum mechanics explains atoms and relativity explains galaxies), but, embarrassingly, the two theories are incompatible. This hardly ever matters, which is why physicists have been able to get away with it. But when you're dealing with extreme situations - black holes, and the beginning of the universe - it matters a great deal. As you probably gathered if you watched Interstellar, physicists don't really understand what goes on inside black holes. They are even less certain about what happened right at the beginning of the universe.The current situation is, to say the least, unsatisfactory, and physicists have been trying to find a way to stick the two theories together for nearly a century: that's what ""quantum gravity"" is. The leading contender over the last few decades has been string theory, which has achieved a high enough profile that almost everyone at least recognises the name. For a good while, string theorists tried to make out that they were the only approach worth mentioning. When Lee Smolin wrote Three Roads to Quantum Gravity at the end of the last century and gave equal billing to the alternative approach of LQG, there was angry muttering from some string theorists that he was being unrealistically partial to his pet idea.Since then, however, LQG has made steady progress while string theory has run into problems. Most worryingly for the string theorists, none of the supersymmetric particles essential to the theory have been found by the LHC, our friendly local particle accelerator. That doesn't necessarily mean they aren't there; maybe they don't quite have the predicted properties and are harder to find than expected. But the old Feynman crack about string theorists making excuses rather than predictions is starting to sound unpleasantly apposite. Now LQG has taken another step forward in making itself respectable. This book does a great job of describing the ideas in simple, straightforward language and explaining their appeal. Non-experts - including, one assumes, some who control funding - will soon think that there's a real choice available. If I were a string theorist, I'd be feeling that someone had better start writing a reply.I won't try and explain here how LQG works. As noted, the book does that very well, and is also fun to read. If you know a little quantum mechanics, my guess is that you'll find it surprisingly simple and intuitive: basically, it's just the way you'd expect to be able to combine quantum mechanics and gravity. I'm sure that there's a huge amount of complexity not visible under the surface, and if I'm suspicious it's because it seems just a bit too good to be true. But deep learning, a subject I know more about, was like this. The idea is super-simple, but it took ages to fix some annoying technical problems that held up progress; once they were solved, the whole field took off. It sounds like LQG could be headed in the same good direction.Okay, I can't deny it: I'm interested. Where do I find a level 2 treatment with a few more equations, so I can look under the hood and kick the tires? I'm seriously thinking of buying._________________________(I also have a frivolous review here)._________________________Update: the level 2 treatment is

1,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford,3,"Making SpaceQuantum Gravity is the closest thing in Physics to a coherent explanation of the origin and fate of the universe - how it began, how it works, how it evolves. Quantum Gravity also has a pretty fair shot to reconcile the apparent paradoxes and contradictions involved in and between the theories of General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. Most recent scientific observations favour it over alternative theories as the way forward for Physics. But Quantum Gravity does fail to explain one important thing: meaning, including the meaning of the idea of Quantum Gravity.According to the latest findings of empirical research in Quantum Mechanics, the fundamental constituents of the cosmos are fourteen or so 'quantum fields', the behaviour of which produces, more precisely constitutes, discrete particles of energy and matter. Despite the unintuitive character, and sometimes apparently paradoxical implications of Quantum Mechanics, every scientific test conceived and executed has confirmed its predictions. It is the biggest single scientific truth available at the moment.Einstein's Theory of General Relativity states that Space and Time are not separate categories of existence but part of a composite Space-time. This may be tough to visualise but Quantum Mechanics makes the picture even less imaginable by portraying Space-time itself as a Quantum Field. Like other fields in Quantum Mechanics, it too is 'quantised', that is, composed of quanta, small indivisible bits. There is thus a smallest Space-time component which sets a definite lower limit not just on how small anything can be but also how densely compacted any material or energy can be. One implication, therefore, is that the mathematical horrors of General Relativity don't occur: the universe did not start as an infinitely dense 'point' at the Big Bang; nor do black holes consist of infinitely dense material.At this point theoretical Physics starts to get properly spooky. Quantum Gravity considers Space, on its own, as a field. This field is theorised as composed of discrete 'threads', analogous to electromagnetic lines of force, which form 'nodes' when the threads intersect. The threads are conceived as 'loops' which then 'interweave' at the nodes. These nodes are the small, discrete bits of Quantum Space.The most that can be said at this stage in scientific thought is that Space is somehow 'woven' by these discrete 'threads'. These are effectively, then, atoms of Space, upon which other quantum fields are somehow layered. Perhaps the most astounding aspect of the theory of Quantum Gravity is that Time disappears entirely as a basic component of the universe. Rather, Time is merely a manifestation of the underlying quantum gravitational field. Simple really!In the world of Quantum Gravity, the principle of cause and effect no longer holds. Space, particles, quanta only exist when they interact. And they only interact probabilistically. Processes have starting points and end points. But a determinate connection between these points does not exist. Particles, quanta, fields interact but they do not cause 'future' states of particles, quanta, and fields because there is no determinate universal 'future'. Therefore, there can be no sequence involving time. Time simply doesn't exist at the quantum level (happily perhaps because Special Relativity had already shown that time wasn't something anyone wanted to touch with a scientific barge pole). When the tortuously complex detail is put aside, it turns out the entire world is made of one 'Covariant Quantum Field', which includes Space as well as all the other fields of matter and energy layered onto it. Everything that happens in the universe emerges from this unified field.Well not quite everything. The problem that Rovelli stays as far away from as he can is this: What the Covariant Quantum Field might not produce is Carlo Rovelli contemplating the Covariant Quantum Field. That is, nowhere in the theory is there an indication that anything like an idea, which is immaterial, can be produced. The only products of the field are material: space, energy or matter. None of these constitutes an idea. Nor do they collectively constitute the emotion that Rovelli clearly has about the Covariant Quantum Field. The issue is important to keep science from slipping into ideology, a pattern typical in modern science from Millsian economics to Darwinian biology to Nietzschean philosophy. Rovelli implies that the Covariant Quantum Field does indeed generate ideas and emotions, at least indirectly, because it is the ultimate foundation of all that exists, including his brain and the readers'. There may be many rungs up the ladder from the field, to fundamental particle interactions, to non-quantum events, and ultimately to life, both human and otherwise. But the field, inevitably, is the ultimate source for all human behaviour, including human thought. This argument would then include the thoughts of, say, Purpose and Success. Rovelli makes no attempt to explain the precise connections up the great chain of being from the 'sea foam' of the quantum fields to the grey matter of the human brain. But his implication is clear: We, our ideas, our actions, including the writing of a book about the Covariant Quantum Field are generated by the Covariant Quantum Field.Although Rovelli's presentation is couched in terms of Quantum Gravity, it is precisely the same stand (and the same hubris) taken by generations of classical physicists who believed that the world ran exclusively on Newtonian laws - from atoms right up to professors of physics. It is called Reductionism: the claim that all of existence can be reduced to the laws, rules and observations of a single discipline. Judging by his incidental comments about the harmful effects of religion on science throughout the ages, it is immateriality that is his intended reductionist target. But this gets him into a bit of trouble. Ideas, in particular, don't fit easily into the theory. Any theory that claims universality ultimately has to deal with them.Rovelli has his own intentions which are stated or implied in the book: to communicate facts and theories, to contribute to the prestige of his discipline, to express his poetic take on science, to establish science's superiority over other modes of inquiry. Finally, he is making a case that science is beneficial for the world; it is successful; it has value. None of these intentions are pure description. They are all ideas and they all involve what we commonly call purpose. And they all clearly have great emotional significance for Rovelli.Where did these ideas, these purposes, and implicit criteria of success or value along with their emotional baggage come from? Who or what is responsible for them? How are they to be assimilated into political and social life? This book, according to the title, has a claim to defining reality. Any such claim needs more than mere disciplinary or even scientific justification. Physics cannot claim a privileged position. This is Scientism, the presumption the superiority of scientific authority in the description of the world.One possibility is that Rovelli is being manipulated by Quantum Gravity to investigate itself, and the field is providing him the criteria for successful investigation at the same time. Unlikely as it is that the author would like such an interpretation, it's a logical possibility. Is there an alternative?Could it be that purpose, intention, emotions are not a properties or implications of the field at all? Could it be that the Covariant Quantum Field has absolutely nothing to say about what is a criterion of better or worse, or of what constitutes success? To admit this possibility would mean that purpose and other ideas, like Quantum Gravity itself, are independent of the field. Such a possibility would require Rovelli's inclusion in the theory not merely as an observer who affects quantum results, but as an evaluator, a judge of the reasons for his inquiry in the first place, one who defines what a result is. Purpose, for example, could well be what is called in Systems Theory an 'emergent property.' Such a property would not be a simple consequence of the behaviour of the field, neither logically nor physically. Emergent properties can't be predicted on the basis of the interactions in the field. Such an emergent property would fit with the random character of field interactions. But it would also 'transcend' these interactions. That is, some relations and interactions, like Purpose and Success, have the field as a necessary condition, but not as sufficient condition for their existence. Something else has to contribute.Rovelli accepts the relativity involved in modern physics. But he doesn't like the relativity implied by differences in Purpose and Success, what might conveniently, if somewhat loosely, be called Politics, the process of the establishment of value. He considers particles but not people to be defined by their relationships. On the one hand he clearly detests religion for its dogmatic stance on truth and about what's important. On the other hand, he dislikes modern philosophy for its challenge to dogmatic claims to truth and about what's important. Only physical scientists, it seems for Rovelli, have the imaginative skill to understand the world and to express it adequately. This is not just a cosmology, it is a cosmological ideology.*He is therefore ambiguous about what Quantum Gravity really means. He can only state rather tired cliches about the superiority of scientific method - science as exploring new ways of thinking; tireless scientific genius; religion, particularly monotheism, as an enemy to thought; philosophy as misleading nonsense. What he means by scientific method are the procedures and criteria he and his colleagues employ at the moment, whatever they are. But he doesn't want the philosophical arguments that justify his freedom applied generally. This he sees as 'relativism.' He wants the theory Quantum Gravity accepted by the public. But he doesn't want current theories to be taken literally, that is to be interpreted by non-scientists, as a description of the world. He wants us to rely on the experts to know what Quantum Gravity implies and to leave what it means alone. In short, he wants power to realise his intentions. Ideologies are ideas that justify power. In this case, the power of physicists to establish the definition and boundaries of reality. Ideologies work by limiting the scope of what can be considered real and important, by prescribing what's valuable. The ideological import of the book is apparent in the title, and subtly confirmed in its content. Is there space in Quantum Gravity for something else?-----------------------------------------------* An important clue to Rovelli's ideological intent is his inclusion of Shannon's Theory of Information to support the conjectures of Quantum Gravity. Written in 1948, this theory is hardly state of the art. However it does have a compatibility with Rovelli's point of view. It 'reduces' all of reality to bits of digital information. It is this theory which inspired the Beam Me Up Scottie of Star Trek as well as Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon. It is also an idealised description of the totalitarian state in which all individuals are the information stored about them. Theories of this sort are not simply descriptions of the world. They transform easily and almost invisibly from method to ideology. Shannon's theory for example played a large part in the influence of Cybernetics in the 20 years following WWII. Cybernetics as an ideology deflected public and scientific attention away fro the discussion of ends, purpose, to the discussion of means, mainly the technology of industrial efficiency and war. See GR review of Kurt Vonnegut's novel Player Piano.Contrast Shannon's reductionist's theory of information with that a semiotic theory of information. In Semiotics the unit of analysis is called a 'sign'. A sign is something that can be interpreted as having a meaning, which is something other than itself, and which is therefore able to communicate information to the one interpreting or decoding the sign. In Semiotics, words are signs, behaviour is a sign, anything with a potential meaning is a sign. So the Covariant Quantum Field is a sign. In fact a person is also a sign. Defined as a sign, a person is not 'decomposed' into bits, but taken as an entire human entity. This entity can, in fact insists upon, being interpreted and interpreting. It is not constituted by anything other than itself. Like quantum particles, a sign is always relative to other signs but not subordinate. Unlike quantum particles, the human sign can love. Perhaps Professor Rovelli might consider this sign as an alternative reality."

Rovelli has an amazing talent for singing the esoteric, theoretical language of Quantum Gravity. He finds meter with its loops and rhyme in the paradoxes. He is able to fluidly convert the edges of theoretical physics into a language that amateur scientists, the untrained, or even the casually curious can enjoy. I'd write more today, but I'm heading tomorrow to a land where I can observe better the eclipse next week. May the sun shine, the clouds part, and the predictive abilities of cosmologists continue, at least for another week. I'll pick this review up again in a week+ with some notes and comments about the eclipse and the non-infinite universe.**** (x) ****Post eclipse Baily's beads. So, one of the people I met at the eclipse totality (she stayed at my sister-in-law's house in Rigby, Idaho) was Lisa Randall, Harvard professor of particle physics and dark matter expert. I teased her about how it must be tough to hear an Italian physicist proclaim the death of String Theory and that Loop Theory is where it is at. She sniffed and said he was a great writer, but she couldn't take seriously someone who got the basics of quantum mechanics and the date of the discovery of the Higgs particle wrong*. The many errors, and general sloppiness of physics in the book drove her nuts. I can see Randall's point, but also still love the way that Rovelli translates, even with a certain looseness, Quantum Gravity and the history of physics for layman like myself. It highlights one of the tensions that have existed for years in science. Often, fame follows not just who is RIGHT, but who WRITES well.As my NOW favorite LIVING theoretical physicist Lisa Randall suggests in her New York Times review :""The beauty of physics lies in its precise statements, and that is what is essential to convey. Many readers won’t have the background required to distinguish fact from speculation. Words can turn equations into poetry, but elegant language shouldn’t come at the expense of understanding.""* On page 129 Rovelli says ""A recent confirmation was the discovery of the Higgs particle, which caused a sensation in 2013."" (4 July 2012 was the date of discovery; on December 10, 2013, Peter Higgs and François Englert were awarded Nobel prizes for predicting this discovery). Randall also told me she had an issue with the metaphors Rovelli used. ""Metaphors are supposed to make things more clear, not more confusing."""
3,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"I'll be honest and up front, I only wanted to read more into Loop Quantum Gravity. Say what?!? Well, it's the leading contender against String theory. It doesn't try to mash together the main problem area of gravity with quantum mechanics, but rather extends quantum mechanics as a granular geometric equation into the macro realm of what we understand as special relativity.In other words, Reality is finite, quantifiable, and can be extrapolated from the underpinnings of the general field of quantum mechanics.If you know anything about the underlying basis of string theory, this idea is both flabbergasting and simplistic. And maybe, it's also correct.I can't say for certain, and as far as I can tell, neither can the author. Most of the book gives us a survey of the underpinnings of reality physics from the conceptualization of the atom through Einstein's reformulation of heat energy on the equilibrium of those atoms in their environmental matrices. (E=MC squared) Spin Foam is the name of the minimum Planck distance that forces atoms into discrete and quantifiable distances between each other. It's the reason why atoms don't just fall into singularities like black holes or crushed neutronium states under normal gravitic circumstances. It's not merely probability shells and energy levels, but quantum loops that behave like bubbles forcing certain distances... and therefore forcing Matter to behave the way it apparently behaves... making atomic structure. The most interesting idea I'm getting from this is the idea of the Big Bounce. In other words, the cause of the great expansion once the Big Bang got lit. It reminds me a lot of how iron molecules make stars burp in the process of digesting (fusion) and cause a nova. Only we're dealing with a quantum state that coaxes atoms into creation through special wave functions behaving like granular notations. You know, like how light behaves like both a wave and a particle.And beyond this... I'm completely lost. :)I don't know the math but this book is pretty decent on the conceptual side. The basics are commonplace and I was mainly into it for the later weird stuff. But all in all? Rovelli is a very, very good writer. Convincing. Clear. It may not be the answer to the great question of our day and age, but he makes a very good case. :)"

5,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,3,"3.5 starsIn this book Carlo Rovelli, a theoretical physicist, explains Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) - a concept that merges Einstein's theory of general relativity with quantum mechanics.  Carlo RovelliThe theory of LQG was developed over the past few decades by theoretical physicists using sophisticated mathematics. Theoretical physicists, however, were hardly the first people to speculate about the nature of the universe. Rovelli's discussion starts with ancient philosophers like Anaximander, Plato, Socrates, and Archimedes - men who had surprisingly insightful notions about the world.  AnaximanderPlatoSocratesArchimedesHumanity's understanding of the cosmos then advanced over the ages, with huge breakthroughs by Sir Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein, and important contributions by many others. Rovelli gives us a brief overview of the work of many great thinkers. Sir Isaac NewtonAlbert Einstein[Note: We'd probably be much farther along if women had been allowed to contribute throughout history. LOL 😎]*****LQG - being largely mathematical - is difficult to explain in plain English, but Rovelli does a creditable job conveying the general idea. I'll try to provide a VERY abbreviated explanation in this review, starting with general relativity and quantum mechanics. The Theory of General Relativity posits that gravity results from the curvature of spacetime. For example, a planet bends space around itself, and a moon circles around a planet because it follows the curve of space (like a marble that rolls around a funnel). This explains the 'force of gravity' that prevents the moon from flying off into the galaxy.Quantum Mechanics contends that the energy of a field is distributed in 'quanta', or packets of energy, like electrons in an electrical field. However the exact location of the quanta is unknowable because they exist in a haze of probability. That is, at any instant a quantum might show up at point A, or point B, or point C, etc....but some locations are more likely than others.  LQG combines these two concepts by trying to quantize space itself. In other words, LQG treats space like it comes in quanta or small chunks. The current idea is that space is a fabric of loops (closed filaments) and nodes woven together into geometrical assemblages called spin networks. Filaments and NodesSpin networks are combined with time to produce spin foams. Thus, the universe is comprised of spin foams. [Rovelli mentions that this model doesn't explain dark matter, which we still don't understand. Get to work physicists!!!]The components of spin networks are unimaginably small, having what is called a 'Planck length' of 1.6×10−35 meters. The size of the Planck length can be visualized as follows: ""If a particle or dot about 0.1 mm in size (which is about the smallest the unaided human eye can see) were magnified in size to be as large as the universe, then inside that universe-sized dot, the Planck length would be roughly the size of an actual 0.1 mm dot.LQG is useful because it tells us more about black holes and adds to our understanding of the origin of the universe (which could have been a 'big bounce' rather than a 'big bang').Moreover, LQG eliminates pesky singularities in math and science (points at which an object's behavior is very bizarre and hard to explain).""In the center of a black hole is a gravitational singularity, a one-dimensional point which contains a huge mass in an infinitely small space, where density and gravity become infinite and space-time curves infinitely, and where the laws of physics as we know them cease to operate.""Currently LQG is competing with String Theory to explain the universe, but that's a whole other book. 😊I'm interested in theoretical physics so I enjoyed Rovelli's narrative. I'll admit, though, that I'm still not clear about everything the author says, which probably requires knowledge of the underlying math. Still, I'd recommend the book - which explains LQG a billion times more thoroughly than this review - to folks interested in the subject.You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot...."

(No there are no extra-physical beings in this review.) On warm, summer, prairie evenings, I would wander over and lay down in the grass to watch the sky. (This was a time when I had rejected the totality of the human race. The peace of the cemetery was welcoming.) I saw a great deal, both above me and in my thoughts. I recall the sparrow hawks circling overhead and then dropping from above at tremendous speeds to capture the unsuspecting insects that flew into the paths of the open jaws of the birds. And I waited each time for the swoosh of the wind through their wings as they pulled out of their seemingly inevitable meeting with the earth. I never lost the wonder of it. And every night, the darkness came, or better, the light that pushed back the darkness came and I entered into a world of my imagination at its best. I lay trying to imagine those two greatest enigmas for me (having written off humanity) - infinity and eternity. I had not yet heard of William Blake, but I was delighted when I first read ‘Auguries of Innocence’ - despite its religious overtones. I would lie there for hours watching the sky roll by and becoming entranced with my own thoughts. It was my childhood version of Zen. I was less concerned with finding an answer to my questioning and more taken by my state of mind. I realized that I could never really imagine a universe that stretched on infinitely - nor could I imagine one that had limits. What could be beyond the limits? The same types of ideas arose around eternity. How could time stretch backwards and forwards without beginning or ending? And what did that all mean anyway? I lay there boggling my mind and thoroughly bewildering myself. Interestingly, it never occurred to me that science could help with this. In the early 1960s, we learned nothing beyond seventeenth century science, and not much of that. Until recently, I never tried to grasp anything about Quantum Physics. I’ve been more the poet than the scientist. Now I struggle with the most basic concepts. Carlo Rovelli is trying to help. He also wants to explain that he too has the heart of a poet. I’m not sure. So, what would Rovelli make of my childhood reveries? Well, he would, and has, among many other things, explained to me that space and time, at least in my sense, do not do not ‘really’ exist. And, I suppose, that Blake had it wrong. There are particles and there are relationships between these particles but my concerns have been misplaced. Well, misplaced in any ultimate sense. I have immersed myself in enough Madhyamaka Buddhist thinking to be able to understand that I can distinguish ‘conventional’ stuff from ‘ultimate’ or ‘absolute’ stuff and that the absolute stuff is not only unknowable but is not reality. And of course, such ideas would seem at times to be where Rovelli and I part company. But then, maybe not. I do not even agree with his use of the word “reality”. His definition seems to meander. Some quotes:“And it is reliability that we need, not certainty. We don't have absolute certainty, and never will have unless accept blind belief. The most credible answers are the ones given by science, because science is the search for the most credible answers available, not for answers pretending to certainty.”“ ... parts of an indispensable grammar for understanding the world. This grammar has evolved, and is still in the process.”“water? A wave is not an object, in the sense that it is not made of matter that travels with it. The atoms of our body, as well flow in and away from us. We, like waves and like all objects, are events; we are processes, for a brief time monotonous. .... Quantum mechanics does not describe objects: it describes processes and events that are junction points between processes.”“What makes a subject hard to understand - if it's something significant and important - is not that before you can understand it you need to be specially trained in abstruse matters, but the contrast between understanding the subject and what most people want to see. Because of this the very things [t]hat are most obvious may become the hardest of all to understand. What has to be overcome is a difficulty having to do with the will, rather than with the intellect. The reason there is so much ""resistance of will"" is because we wrongly assume that that which we are explaining resides in some foundation beyond us, be it God or the foundation of the physical world, namely,. particles. We need to see that we and our surroundings are the foundations, and we describe these, we do not explain them; just as we do not explain our consciousness; rather, we are conscious.”I would like to agree with Rovelli on this last point, I really would, but I do not know that he has succeeded. He has not completely, in my case anyway, been able to convert his formulas and numbers into language that I can totally grasp. Too much of what he presents is in the form of metaphors, and until those metaphors become so deeply embedded in our daily speech, the are only metaphors. I don’t know that I can wait that long. Where Rovelli has succeeded is in further eroding those metaphors of my past. I will no longer look at the night sky in search of limiting walls to the universe. I shall simply continue to wonder (perhaps in cemeteries at night). ... and read, of course."

Space...hold on...I have to pause dramatically, because this is just mindblowing...Space is granular. That's right. Space itself is chunked just like light is made of photons. HOLY SHIT! That is why the hare can pass the turtle. There is no infinitely small. The Planck distance measures more than the smallest measurement possible, it measure the literal granules in spacetime. I'm stunned by the simplicity.The first half of this book is a recap of the current experimentally demonstrated science of quantum physics, gravity, spacetime and particularly Einstein's theories. Rovelli is enlightening in this regard; he does an amazing job of making them comprehensible and further frames them in ways that I've never read before. Then Rovelli moves on to what he describes as untested theory around how gravity works and what it is. Although unproven, he was very convincing and the deductions logical.One item that I found quite interesting was what Rovelli left out. He did not even once mention the multiverse theories that have grown from physicists trying to explain the meaning of the randomness in the Schrodinger Equation and the Copenhagan Interpretation. I thought he might have backhandedly slapped that approach when he said that those who focus on the solution to the equation are misguided.If you have any interest at all in physics or the nature of the universe and reality, I highly recommend this book. I will likely read it again."
9,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,3,"This is an introductory book to one of the most promising theories of “quantum gravity” currently attempting to merge quantum mechanics and general relativity: Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), of which the author is one of the co-founders. Loop quantum gravity posits that spacetime is essentially just a new field, conceptually not dissimilar to the other quantized fields postulated by Quantum Field Theory, and similarly characterized by features such as granularity, “probabilistic” behaviour and “indeterminacy”. Contrarily to the assumption of General Relativity (and as implicit in Quantum Field Theory too) that space is a continuum, the basic structure of space-time in LQG is assumed to be discrete, and subject to quantum fluctuations. Moreover, the locations of the single quanta of space are not defined with regard to something else, but only by the inter-relational links between them. The gravitational field is assumed indistinguishable to the geometry of spacetime (after all, in general relativity the same mathematical object, which is the metric tensor ﬁeld, represents both gravity and the geometry of spacetime): space is created by the interaction of individual quanta of gravity.This book is directed at the layman with only limited background in physics, and it does not get into any quantitative detail (do not expect to find here any mention of Lagrangians, Hilbert spaces or operator algebras), so it may be quite a disappointment to the more knowledgeable reader looking for some mathematical treatment of this theory. At least some sort of appendix with some decent mathematical detail would have been highly beneficial, in my opinion. Moreover, the book does not get into any meaningful physics until page 50, as its first part is mainly dedicated to a brief history of physics starting with the Ionian Greek philosophers, reaching up to Newton; an history that does not add much to the book and it is also disseminated with platitudes and inaccuracies (such as the myth that the experimental method started with Galileo, that the Middle Ages were the “Dark Ages”, that there is a direct link connecting modern physics with the Ancient Greeks etc.). Things do get better with chapters 3 and 4, when the author deals with special and general relativity, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. The treatment is still at 30,000 feet altitude, and with an impressionistic style and approach, mind you, but the author at least manages to express the main concepts with great lucidity, elegance and conciseness. I also like the way the authors highlights the increasingly fundamental importance of relational and informational aspects in modern physics.The author now leads us through the main concepts of loop quantum gravity, which is a very interesting theory, of which one of the most appealing features (at least to me) is that it tries to combine general relativity with quantum field theory in a rather conservative way: it does not require exotic new entities such as invisible extra dimensions or an infinite number of parallel universes, and it does not employ other hypotheses apart from those of GR and QFT, suitably rewritten to render them compatible. It also naturally removes the re-normalization issues that characterize Quantum Field Theory (and very possibly any theory assuming a continuum of spacetime, I would like to add – think about the singularities in General Relativity), as it assumes a minimum length/volume of spacetime. As an aside note, I must say, personally speaking, that I am still to be convinced that the need for renormalization is such a big, decisive issue: after all, QED is a fully renormalizable theory requiring only three counter-terms, and in more general terms, re-normalization is not that big evil as portrayed in some popular science: it is simply a procedure which allows us to sensibly calculate the effects of low energy physics, independently of how it may be possibly corrected at high energies (where for example there might be some heavy particles contributing to the diagrams and removing the divergencies apparent at lower energies). Renormalization is not an exercise in hiding infinities, but a process followed in order to identify any corrections necessary to an initially formulated Lagrangian, so to make it represent real life at “low energies”.Anyway, loop quantum theory does appear very enticing in its postulating that everything is about fields, where all fields do not “live in spacetime” - fields live, so to speak, “one on top of the other : fields on fields”. Moreover, contrarily to what characterize other more exotic theories such as the Multiverse (theories that verge, in my eyes, perilously close to metaphysics), Loop Quantum Theory appears to be, at least in principle, open to empirical verification. I greatly appreciated that the author dedicates a whole chapter to this aspect (there is even some detail about the predicted statistical distribution of the fluctuations of the cosmic background radiation, and the predicted cosmic gravitational background radiation that might be identified by the future LISA experiment). This is absolutely fundamental – without at least the possibility for some experimental empirical support, no theory can be taken too seriously. The only serious criticism that I have to make to the author's approach is that he verges on the disingenuous when he does not discuss potentially significant open issues with Loop Quantum Gravity (these are issues that are for example discussed by Penrose in his brilliant book “The Road to Reality”. Penrose is quite keen on this theory, and he does not hide his admiration for several aspects of Loop Quantum Gravity, but this does not prevent him from honestly highlighting the open issues of such theory).To conclude, I also must say that I particularly enjoyed the positions that Rovelli has in relation to the epistemological role of science: “...science is affected by every sort of cultural and social influence. Nevertheless, despite all of this, and in opposition to the exaggerations of a few post-modernists, cultural relativists and the like, none of this diminishes the practical and theoretical efficacy of scientific thinking”. “Science is not reliable because it provides certainty. It is reliable because it provides us with the best answers we have at present. These answers are not reliable because they are definitive. They are reliable because they are not definitive”.Overall, a pleasant enough book, not badly written, and informative (to a point), but in my personal view it represents a bit of a missed opportunity, as aimed too much at a very generic audience. 3 stars."
10,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Rovelli crafts a unique presentation combining insight from the ancient Greeks, some Dante, a selective history of physics and his own quest for a theory of quantum gravity. He adds a little philosophy and even a few lines of poetry to challenging scientific concepts. Despite the trimmings, Rovelli is definitely writing for the science buff. For those that read popular physics books, there is little new in the historical section, but his selections help him make his point. He describes the incompatibility of general relativity and quantum mechanics as an entry into his ideas on quantum gravity. I had not read much about quantum gravity before. I had to take my time reading these sections and pause to think through what he was saying. After a while his arguments began to make sense and actually seemed quite logical. Undoubtedly some of it flew over my head; still I got some good takeaways and felt my time was well spent. My notes follow.Rovelli gives snippets of the work of Newton, Faraday and Maxwell, Einstein, and Bohr, Heisenberg and Dirac to illustrate the progression of thought regarding the fundamental constituents of reality. Newton sees reality as space, time and particles. Faraday posits lines of force and Maxwell defines them mathematically adding fields to space, time and particles. In Special Relativity Einstein combines space and time into one entity spacetime so now we have spacetime, particles and fields. In General Relativity Einstein shows spacetime to be the gravitational field but not quantum. The work of Bohr, Heisenberg and Dirac reduces fields and particles to quantum fields so we are down to spacetime and quantum fields. Finally Rovelli goes on to argue that based on his ideas about quantum gravity spacetime is also a quantum field so there are only quantum fields.Key quantum concepts to Rovelli are granularity, relationality and indeterminacy. Granularity: Nothing is continuous, everything is discrete. Nothing is smaller than the Planck scale. Thus unlike general relativity, infinities are eliminated. There are no singularities. Distances and volumes can’t be subdivided forever. Relationality: Only properties of objects that don’t change are inherent. All variables (position, momentum, energy) of objects are defined by interactions. Electrons only materialize when there is a collision. Rovelli says to think in terms of processes, not things. Indeterminacy: The specific values of the next interaction are not definite only probable.Rovelli embraces Heisenberg’s matrix solution to quantum mechanics and sees Schrodinger’s wave function only as an aid to calculation, not reality. He also relies heavily on Dirac’s formulation of quantum mechanics holding that fields and particles are the same. He gives an example: “The electromagnetic waves are vibrations of Faraday’s lines, but also at a small scale swarms of photons. When they interact with something else, as in the photoelectric effect, they manifest themselves as particles…Photons are the ‘quanta’ of the electromagnetic field. But the electrons and all other particles of which the world is made are equally ‘quanta’ of fields!”Granularity in quantum mechanics tells us that within any system there are a finite number of states, in other words a limit to the information within a system. But while everything is composed of discrete quanta, Rovelli clarifies “The world is not made up of tiny pebbles. It is a world of vibrations, a continuous fluctuation, a microscopic swarming of fleeting microevents.” It is the interaction or relation between these microevents that we see as particles. “There is no reality except the relations between physical systems. It isn’t things that enter into relations, but rather relations that ground into the notion of thing. The world of quantum mechanics is not a world of objects: it is a world of events. Things are built by the happening of elementary events.” Rovelli’s view of quantum mechanics is called the “relational interpretation”.Rovelli turns to loop quantum gravity to reconcile the disparity between general relativity which doesn’t incorporate quantum fields and quantum mechanics which doesn’t take into account the curvature of spacetime. In quantum gravity space itself is quantized. Thus postulating gravitons proceeding through space doesn’t work. Loop quantum gravity is based on a solution by Lee Smolin and Ted Jacobson to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation that describes curved space. In loop quantum gravity the lines of the gravitational field are in loops that meet at nodes. The loops provide for spacetime’s curvature. The nodes are the quanta of the gravitational field. The volume of space arises from the nodes. The lines link the volumes together. Unlike other quanta such as photons which reside in space, nodes are not in space, they are space. In Rovelli’s words “At an extremely small scale, space is a fluctuating swarm of quanta of gravity, and together acting upon things…”In this theory, time doesn’t exist as a continuous flow in which events occur. In Rovelli’s words “…the quanta of gravity do not evolve in time. Time just counts their interactions.” Time “…is born of the world, out of the relations of quantum events that are the world and themselves generate their own time.” “The space and time that we perceive in large scale are our blurred and approximate image…of the gravitational field.” “Fields that live on themelves, without the need of spacetime as a substratum, as a support, and which are capable by themselves of generating spacetime, are called ‘covariant quantum fields”. Rovelli holds that everything is made of these fields that simply lie “one on top of the other: fields on fields.”Rovelli considers the effect of quantum gravity on cosmology, although he notes his ideas are exploratory. General relativity would have the universe come from an infinitely small and dense beginning, the Big Bang. In quantum gravity there is a limit to how small things can get. The equations of loop quantum gravity support the idea of the Big Bounce. If a universe collapsed it would proceed to the point where quantum repulsion took over and begin expanding. The same logic applies to black holes since there is no singularity in quantum gravity. The initial expansion would proceed very slowly since the intense gravitational force in a black hole slows time, but once it broke the event horizon there would be an explosion. Rovelli hopes we could detect such explosions in primordial black holes.I find Rovelli’s ideas as palatable as the others I have read by theoretical physicists. Even though I have no way of knowing whose ideas, if any, will turn out to be important, I still enjoy reading these books. They send my mind wandering as I try to visualize the reality they describe. Although whether quantum gravity, string theory, wildly different quantum mechanics interpretations, it always seems like we are just peeling back another layer of the onion. Or as Rovelli puts it, “We are akin to small blind moles underground who know nothing about the world. But we continue to learn…”"
11,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,5,"For a topic as mind-bending as quantum physics, I marvel at Carlo Rovelli's ability to distill it down to something which normal folks like me can comprehend. To a certain extent, anyway. The first part of the book which talked about the evolution of physics was well-written, concise and fairly easy to understand. Once he started to move into the realm of quantum gravity, the ideas and notions do get harder to grasp. Loop quantum gravity, spin networks and spin foam - the alternative to string theory - are almost beyond the reasonable imagination of humans who can only see and visualise matter on a macro level. Whoever said scientists have no imagination and creativity have no clue what they are talking about. In referencing Dante's Paradiso, Rovelli writes:

I believe that this example demonstrates how great science and great poetry are both visionary, and may even arrive at the same intuitions. Our culture is foolish to keep science and poetry separated: they are two tools to open our eyes to the complexity and beauty of the world.

An intuitive representation of quantum gravityI will need and want to revisit this book in the future once I've studied more on the subject and be able to compare string theory to loop quantum gravity. Similar to his other book, Seven Brief Lessons on Physics, this is a beautifully written book on a scientific theory that is one of the most difficult to understand. I will also be reading his latest book, The Order of Time, hopefully soon.

12,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"I was no great fan of Carlo Rovelli's flowery, overpriced previous title, and the introduction to this book on loop quantum gravity has a similar style, but thankfully it settles down a little. However, there is still rather too much of the woffle, reverting to floral form on Lucretius and his atomist poem on nature. For those who remember How to be Topp, this is the Fotherington Thomas school of popular science - all 'Hullo clouds, hullo sky!'We then get onto Galileo. At times, Rovelli's history of science goes wildly astray - he says, for example, that Galileo was the first experimenter - what of William Gilbert or the medieval optical experiments, for example? Similarly, Rovelli tells us that no one from Newton to Faraday tried to come up with an explanation for action at a distance - which just isn't true. Not only did Newton himself have an idea, there were plenty of mechanisms proposed. This isn't a matter of obscure history, you can read about it in Wikipedia. Best then to move on from mangled recounting of the past and get on to the more recent physics.Here, in a gallop through special and general relativity and quantum theory we get far more rigour, though oddly it often comes in ways that aren't always obvious - for example we jump into to general relativity with the idea that spacetime is a field, without any of Einstein's far more accessible route using the equivalence principle. It fits better with the model that Rovelli is using, but it doesn't help the reader understand what he is talking about.The last part of the book takes in what has been its goal all along - loop quantum gravity. In his opening, Rovelli remarks that a book (for the public) on loop quantum gravity didn't exist which is why he had to write it. This isn't true, there was Martin Bojowald's Once Before Time - but that failed singularly to explain the theory in a comprehensible way. This is where I hoped I could finally get the point of Rovelli's writing. I desperately want to see a good, accessible introduction to loop quantum gravity.The good news is that Rovelli on the topic reads a lot more smoothly than anything I've so far read - but he still fails to bring the topic to a level the general reader can get his or her head around. The book should have had an editor brave enough to keep sending it back until Rovelli had got there, but it clearly didn't happen.You may gather I had problems with this book, but I have to congratulate Rovelli for trying. What was most frustrating was that if loop quantum gravity were as obvious to physicists and as complete as it's presented, it would be quantum gravity solved and no one would be bothering about string theory (which Rovelli only gives a passing mention to). Tick. Next problem? We know it's not really like that. Also, like many physicists seem to do, Rovelli either doesn't realise a model isn't the same as reality, or forgets to explain this to his readers. Even so, it is an interesting book despite its problems."

It is precisely its openness, the fact that it constantly calls current knowledge into question, which guarantees that the answers it offers are the best so far available: if you find better answers, these new answers become science. When Einstein found better answers than Newton, he didn't question the capacity of science to give the best possible answers - on the contrary, he confirmed it.The answers given by science, then, are not reliable because they are definitive.

15,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47021487-jose-moa,5,"There are two main streams of research in joining quantum mechanis and general relativity,the string theory that is background dependant,the space-time,and the loop quantum gravity that is not backgroun dependant as it is a quantum theory of the space-time,in this sense ,for me, this is a more fundamental theory.This is the first book I have read on loop quantum gravity and I have found it very clear ,accesible and easy to read in this difficult and technical subject,I also have found this theory beautiful and natural in the sense that it uses the same way to obtain a equation on the quantum dynamics of gravity as have used Schrödinger to obtain his equation on quantum dynamics of a particle,Schrodinger derived it from the classical mechanics equation of Hamilton-Jacobi and followig similar ways this theory derived it equation for the classic general relativity Hamilton-Jacobi equation of Wheeler-De Witt.After a brief histhory and fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics and general relativity where Aristóteles is subtly criticed and Democritus praised the book tells that the solutins of quanticed Wheeler-De Witt equation are spin networks where in the knots is the quanticed space vales and the relations with the next quanticed space knots are in the links where the spin resides and can have multiple of 1/2,I have found this razonable as the spin,a quantum magnitude that has not classic analoge, is related with the matrix unitarian representation in complex spaces of the Lorentz group,the group of lorentz transformations,a generalization of the space rotations and time translations of the galilean group, of the space-time in Special Relativity.In this theory the time dont appear in the equation,the time is relational,a ordered sucesión of events,macroscopically this order is given by the irreversibility the dynamics of the spin network is the spin foam and the quanta of gravity and space are the same in the new field named quantum covariant field.So far this is only a beautiful theory,but for me have several positive points :First-The Heisenberg incertidumbre principle for position momentun only give not absurd results if the space cant be shorter than Plancks length.Second-As the space have a minimun size,the infinites in the quantum field theory dont any more exist as the perturbative serie is finite and renormalization trick is not needed.Third-Inside the black hole the infinite density zero space point singularity dissapears.In a editorial world full of rather fancy physics books as those of Brian Green,Lisa Randal and others,this is a honest and fresh air book that gives a realistic alternative pointAs a anecdote,it seems that Greg Egan is a fan of this theory because in his novel Schids Lader the theory of everything is a quatum graph theory,the novel a really hard SF novel, begins textually so :""In the beginning was a graph,more like a diamond than graphite.Every node in this graph was tetravalent :connected by four edges to four other nodes.The edges has not length or shape,the nodes no position ;the graph consisted only of the fact that some nodes were conected to others.This pattern of connections,repeated endessly,was all there was ""¡The world, pure geometry!"

18,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"This book is a modern day, On the Nature of Things. Like Lucretius himself, Rovelli is a poet who, with his words, constructs beautiful images of the true nature of reality. The key message in this book is that everything comes down to geometry and the geometry of space is much more interesting than we probably suppose. Energy has morphed into various shapes as it traveled from the radiation of the hot, dense, atom sized ball it was when it was young, to elements and forms seen in the cooler, expanding, vast universe of today. The laws of thermodynamics have ensured that various geometrical shapes occur and those geometrical shapes are forced to interact with other thermodynamically created geometrical shapes. What a symphony! Rovelli detailed the most exquisitely beautiful history of how humans have come to understand the geometry of space itself, the matter that populates space, and how that geometry translates into motion of objects on Earth and in the universe at large. For example, Newton came to understand, and subsequently helped the rest of humanity understand, that because of Earth's shape and size, it would exert a strong gravitational pull on an apple and the apple would exert a small pull on Earth. Humanity could then finally understand how they would remain solidly planted to the ground if the earth were to rotate. It was perfectly reasonable before Newton to assume a human would fall off Earth if it spun upside down. However, Newton himself could not understand the implication of his own theory. What physical material could do the action of pulling one object to another-- something Einstein later called ""spooky action at a distance.""? Without this substance, Newton could not understand how gravity could cause the large object to pull the smaller object physically toward it. Michael Faraday was able to shed some light on this problem when he came to understand that the electric field and magnetic field were one in the same, the electromagnetic field, which can be thought of as lines in space that fill all of space, that attract elements toward each other. But, how then could this fully explain the gravitational pull of a large object like the sun pulling Earth toward it or a black hole pulling whole solar systems toward it? (As an aside: I love all histories of Faraday. I cannot help but constantly play a voice inside my head that says, ""Michael Faraday, May The Force be with you!"" This is so stupid and has nothing to do with the actual force in the universe; and yet, I cannot help saying it in my head every time I read about Faraday.)With his theories of special and general relativity, Einstein helped humanity understand how forms with large masses could pull smaller masses toward them. Einstein came to understand how spacetime itself was not just populated with Faraday's field lines; spacetime itself was warped by large objects. That is, large objects bend and stretch the fabric of spacetime such that nearby smaller objects have their spacetime bent too. The spacetime bends so the large object is always at the bottom of a hill and all the objects around it are higher up and fall toward it. The density of the object is what bends the spacetime and acts to lower the energy needed for other objects to fall toward it. (it really isn't that different from an enzyme in living systems). This is why Caleb Sharf (who was not mentioned in this book) called black holes ""Gravity's Engines."" They power the motion of the universe. Rovelli argues that, like Faraday's field lines, gravity has its own lines. But, and this is the crucial but, gravity does not make up lines in space, gravitational lines *are* space. They construct the actual space upon which Faraday's lines can exist. John Wheeler's equations show that these gravitational lines close in on themselves. Thus, they are a loop; and thus, they are quantized loops of gravity. According to this theory, these quantized loops of gravity are what makeup spacetime itself. These quantum loops of gravity have some important and fascinating implications. Since each loop is a specific quanta of space, it affects how we understand the singularity of the beginning of the universe or the singularity of black holes. General relativity tells us that gravity in a black hole will pull objects into it to smaller and smaller spaces, to a point of infinite density. But, and this is an important but, quantum gravity says that nothing can be condensed indefinitely. Things being pulled into a black hole can only be pulled in to a *finite* density. This is because *space itself* is quantized. Space itself can only get so small (the size of each loop of gravity). So, an object can only be condensed to the size of the smallest size of space itself (the loop). I love the idea of each loop being a node in a web, but I would eventually like a more solid explanation of how that can be. I suspect that the universe works that way, but that is based on nothing except for the my love of networks. I need a little more convincing before I buy the whole argument, but I have to say, it is by far my favorite argument for how the universe works. At the end, Rovelli eluded to Jeremy England's work on dissipation of energy in living systems (thermodynamically driven evolution, which is a continuation of Schrodinger's work) but didn't really do much other than gloss over it. Still, I was happy to see it included. "

Apart from space, time has no meaning. I used to think time was a measure of movement through space, but I was wrong. It's not. It turns out time is the measure of the transfer of information. If no information is transferred, no time takes place. There are lots of other insights in this dandy little book. I would recommend as the next best thing to an acid trip for mind-blowing expansion of the cerebral neurons. I don't understand it all. Or much of any of it, really. But love reading about it. "

Rovelli is a fabulous writer and brings the awesomely complex theories surrounding quantum physics to the reader in a compelling and accessible way. Brilliant!"
25,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25570776-pi,3,"Carlo Rovelli, a prominent theoretical physicist, presents to the broad public an easily accessible introduction to quantum gravity. The book traces the development of ideas from antiquity, through the renaissance, to present times. It's a story about the origins and development of special and general relativity, quantum theory, and their long-awaited reconciliation: quantum gravity. We get a glimpse into the process of inventing a scientific theory, specifically, the natural progression to loop quantum gravity, the domain in which Rovelli has made most of his scientific career. At its core, the book, and Rovelli's arguments, are a defence of the doctrine of atomism; a relational version of atomism, where atoms are interconnected events, meaningless in separation, and giving rise to relativistic spacetime. What we get is a complete and simple picture of reality -- one in which space and time are really not what they seem. I appreciate when authors incorporate personal stories in order to make the text more engaging. There is always the risk, however, of focusing on some characters more than others, and thus leaving some important contributions out. For example, although Rovelli presents a relational view of reality, with atoms as processes, there is no mention of Haraclitus, Leibnitz, or Mach: some of the great proponents of such views. Instead, we get a tribute to the atomism of Democritus, and the potency of the absolutist theories of Newton. Rovelli even says, ""The entire technology of the nineteenth century and of our own modern world rests largely upon Newton's formulae"". Although the statement is to some extent true, it gives the wrong impression that no other major contributions existed that made such technology possible. Do the names of Euler, Lagrange and Laplace ring a bell? I find this to be a major drawback, for this way the author paints a one-sided story. It makes superstars out of some of the great minds in history, but shuns others. Another example of this is that Rovelli refers to the Medieval Period as ""The Dark Ages"" -- without even a hint of some of the developments during that time that led to the works of Kepler, Copernicus and Galileo. Of course, this is a common misconception, so we shouldn't blame Rovelli for it, but we should expect better of him.When discussing quantum theory, Rovelli suggests it necessitates the ""absence of determinism"". But this, again, is only a limited view, for it fails to distinguish metaphysical preconceptions from the core of a theory. There actually are different interpretations of quantum mechanics, and some of them, such as the many-worlds interpretation and De Broglie–Bohm theory, do not dispense with determinism. To the contrary, they view determinism as an important principle for a metaphysically sound theory of reality.Something similar happens to the concept of time. Rovelli tells us that time does not exist, but it seems what the author actually means is that absolute, Newtonian time does not exist. In his own words: ""The passage of time is only the measure of the process itself"". So, it's not that time does not exist or is not real, but instead that Newton's idea of an absolute time independent of the processes in the universe is wrong when taken as model of reality. What Rovelli does here can be slightly confusing to the reader, for although he says that time is not real, he actually presents time as something much more real than the abstract, Newtonian conception of time. According to him, time is equivalent to change; and isn't change something real?Finally, although Rovelli doesn't defend his conception of time against some opposing contemporary views, he's obviously in conflict with the ideas of Lee Smolin (see Time Reborn: From the Crisis in Physics to the Future of the Universe, and the more philosophical The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time: A Proposal in Natural Philosophy), another famous contributor to the theory of loop quantum gravity. Smolin's arguments conceive of the reality of time as a variability of change (a changing change). He claims this to be supported by the empirical evidence showing that the universe has a history (exists in time), and that this is crucial to cosmological models. Nothing along these lines we read from Rovelli.In conclusion, I would recommend this book to anyone unfamiliar with quantum gravity, and physics in general. Its best merits are that it's easily accessible and well written. But, in order to get a more complete picture, I would also suggest complementing it with Three Roads To Quantum Gravity, by Lee Smolin."
26,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30541335-jimmy-ele,5,A need to think about the ideas more thoroughly is preventing me (at the moment) from writing a review.
27,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55163554-emre-sevin,4,"How about setting up a protocol among popular physics writers, so that they don't have to start from Democritus, continue with Newton, explain Einstein's special and general relativity and then quantum mechanics for the hundredth time? I don't know if it's publishers pushing a for a minimum number of pages, or maybe it is that authors think they have to give the whole context from scratch every time they write a book, but I think it will be much space-saving if we could refer to established popular accounts of ancient Greek, relativity, and quantum mechanics, so that it'd be possible to immediately dive into the current challenges in physics.Having said that, I must congratulate Prof. Rovelli because he was able to convey the gist of loop quantum gravity without diving deep down into the gory mathematical details. Of course, without even summarizing such details, one can only get a very fuzzy and intuitive grasp of the matter, but that's better than nothing. I was also excited to learn about LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), mission designed to detect and accurately measure gravitational waves from astronomical sources. According to Rovelli, what the famous LIGO did for detection of gravitational waves caused by black holes colliding, LISA will do for ancient black holes exploding, sort of a cosmic quantum gravitational background effect, similar to the famous cosmic microwave background radiation. I also liked how Rovelli connected some of the scientific themes to literature and history, especially his references to ""De rerum natura"" and Dante, as well as establishing a continuity with the great thinkers of ancient Greece. I think the chapter regarding the concept of ""information"" and the role it plays in modern physics theories could be expanded and clarified more. Instead of trying to introduce quantum mechanics and relativity for which we have great popular accounts, he could've used those pages to explain his ideas about information in more depth. I can recommend this book to people who'd like to have an intuitive overview of an important direction where modern physics research is headed to. And it's always nice and inspirational to read an Italian author who knows his history and literature so well."
28,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,4,"The first half of this 'journey to quantum gravity' provides a lively and poetic insight into the key moments in the history of development of atomistic theory, from Leucippus, Democritus and the Lucrecius's poem On the Nature of Things, through Newton, Faraday and Maxwell, to general relativity and quantum theory.The second half is an enthusiastic and entertaining attempt to explain to the general reader the implications of the ongoing theory known as 'loop quantum gravity'.This part was an extremely interesting and thought-provoking read which succeded to persuade me that the LQG approach to description of reality is quite plausible since there are clues in its favour though still not concrete empirical confirmations. However, I couldn't give the book more than 4 stars because I found some explanations needlessly puzzling and confusing.For instance, regarding the explanation of a 3-sphere, I still wonder how anybody (even Einstein and Dante) could imagine ''two balls stuck together all along their edges''. How on earth can a sphere have edges? But, first and foremost, I found the explanation of the quantization of space contradictory and unclear. Namely, I can understand and accept that ''an elementary structure of the world is emerging, generated by a swarm of quantum events, where time and space do not exist'', but then I find it contradictory to say that 'the quanta of gravity are the way in which space and time interact.''"

I enjoyed it greatly mainly for those reasons. Rovelli places modern physics and cosmology into a western philosophical story. It, of course, is bigger than any one culture but it is a tradition I have grown in so it appeals to me. Rovelli combines recent physics and Ionian Presocratics. Democritus and the quantum, Dante, and Einstein, Newton, Archimedes, and Zeno. He has his own particular speculations on what a theory of Quantum gravity looks like in the later part of the book but does a magisterial historical and philosophical narrative on his way to getting there. I enjoyed it a great deal."

But then, who really does??This is the first physics text I've read clearly written after the Higgs boson was found and super symmetry was not confirmed at the LHC, which seems to have shifted the balance between the competing theories of loop quantum gravity and string theory."
31,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2989615-lukasz-pruski,4,"""The only truly infinite thing is our ignorance.""I love reading works by Carlo Rovelli, one of the world's top physicists, and - in my view - the best ever popularizer of modern physics. Statements like the one I used in the epigraph, about human infinite ignorance, resonate with me. I teach mathematics at a university, I have quite an extensive exposure to classical physics, yet my ignorance about modern physics is certainly limitless. (By the way, there is no better way to understand the vastness of one's ignorance than being a professor.)While I will not rate this book by Dr. Rovelli as a masterpiece like 
Seven Brief Lessons on Physics
, it is still a great read and I have learned a lot from it - not only about my lack of knowledge. The author begins with a story about Anaximander of Miletus (450 BCE) whose work contributed to the foundations of Western science and philosophy.  ""The Milesians understand that by shrewdly using observation and reason, rather than searching for answers in fantasy, ancient myths, or religion - and above all by using critical thought in a discriminating way - it is possible to repeatedly correct our worldview and to discover new aspects of reality that are hidden to the common view.""  Progressing through time, we read about Democritus, then through Copernicus, Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, we follow the evolution of human models of reality. Then come Einstein, Heisenberg, Bohr, Dirac - fathers of the modern physics - and we arrive at the ""two pillars of twentieth-century physics - general relativity and quantum mechanics."" General relativity is ""a simple and coherent vision of gravity, space, and time."" Quantum mechanics unveils the three aspects of reality: ""granularity, indeterminism, and relationality.""Part Three, Quantum Space and Relational Time is to me the most fascinating part of the book. General relativity and quantum mechanics, ""the two jewels that the twentieth century has left us,"" seem to contradict each other. ""They cannot both be true, at least not in their present forms."" Chapters 5 through 7 provide an introduction to the loop quantum gravity theory in whose development the author has played one of the key roles.  ""[...] the world described by the theory is far from the one we are familiar with. There is no longer space that ""contains"" the world, and no longer time ""during the course of which"" events occur.""  Part Four, Beyond Space and Time, discusses such aspects of cosmology as Big Bang and black holes. I found the chapter Information the most illuminating. Information is defined as the number of possible alternatives, connections to Boltzmann's statistical mechanics are shown, and the author presents yet another crucial idea - thermal time and its connection with the concept of irreversibility. The author's succinct summary is stunning:  ""Time is an effect of our overlooking the physical microstates of things. Time is the information we don't have. Time is our ignorance.""  I absolutely love the powerful final chapter, Mystery, with its convincing argument why nothing but science can be reliable:  ""The answers given by science [...] are not reliable because they are definitive. They are reliable because they are not definitive.  This is the most powerful argument I have ever heard against all kinds of mumbo-jumbo that ignores science, which is particularly important in the times of a pandemic. The author provides two fascinating historical vignettes: the first about a ""race"" to formalize Einstein's theory between David Hilbert, one of the most famous mathematicians in history, and Albert Einstein. The other vignette is about a little known Belgian priest, Georges Lemaître, who showed that both Einstein in his skepticism about the expansion of the universe as well as pope Pius XII in his declaration that the Big Bang confirms the account of Creation given in Genesis were wrong.Fascinating read!Four-and-a-quarter stars."
32,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4277032-d,5,"I wholeheartedly agree with Manny's review.Applying Occam's razor clearly favors Loop Quantum Gravity (LCG) theory over String theory with its 11 or more dimensions. Amazingly, dropping the 'background' of empty space and time as basic notions simplifies obtaining LCG as a theory that makes General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics compatible. There are even some cosmological experiments that could test LCG: e.g. observing a black hole that expands again (bounces back) would suggest that space/matter is granular, making everything finite, again simplifying matters considerably, it seems. However this experiment shows that, if true, the size of a matter/space quantum should be really small: 10-48m (10 to the power of -48), much smaller than the Planck scale."
33,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,2,"39th book for 2017. A relatively quick read on modern physics starting with the Ancient Greeks and ending with Quantum Gravity. I have mixed feelings about the book. Rovelli's prose is quite poetic at times (and perhaps a little damaged in translation from the Italian). I found the historical background quite clear, but when he got to describing quantum gravity, and how space/time do not exist at the most basic level I was lost. That's a shame, because it's the most interesting part of the book. It would also have been nice to have a somewhat broader view of the rest of physics (e.g., String Theory; how does Dark Matter or Dark Energy fit in?). I was also a bit disturbed to read in other reviews that the form of Quantum Gravity being presented here is only the flavor that Rovelli is working on and he has left out other competing versions, which view time quite differently.Finally, and most annoyingly, large chunks of text are reused almost word for word from his previous book Seven Brief Lessons on Physics. If you have read the first, you have already third-to-half of this one (hence 2-stars)."

For decades, the only approach dominating to resolve the grand unification problem was the string theory and if like me you saw Brian Greene's dramatically made TV documentary then you might have been fooled into believing we have indeed solved it. But when our friendly particle collider @ Geneva, didn't throw out a bunch of predicted supersymmetric particles, the long suspected truth came into the reality that - String theory is not the last word! In contrast to string theory, LQG has been steadily building up and has found much stronger footing. Carlo starts from antiquity in ancient Greece to the original apple guy Newton and to our generation's greatest genius maverick Einstein, before introducing LQG. A short book with beautiful explanations of some rather tough concepts. A fun read, to say the least!My Rating - 5/5"

38,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22241323-judy,3,"Rovelli tells the reader that he’s written with a particular reader in mind: someone who knows little or nothing about today’s physics but is curious to find out what we know, as well as what we don’t yet understand, about the elementary weave of the world. (p 8)I need to acknowledge that Physics has never been my favorite branch of science. However, I've always been intrigued by how Physicists think, so when my niece gave this book 3-stars and said it was ""pretty good,"" I decided to give it a try. I'm reading her copy of the book, so I can't write in it, but I am noting quite a few page numbers, most of which indicate something I want to give some thought. This isn’t going to be a review but rather a list of ideas that are food for thought (to me anyway).p 21: Our life is a combination of atoms, our thoughts are made up of thin atoms, our dreams are the products of atoms; our hopes and our emotions are written in a language formed by combinations of atoms; …That is true at a very fundamental level. (Thin atoms?)p 29: The definitive proof of the ‘atomic hypothesis’ had to wait until 1905. It was found by a rebellious 25 year-old who had studied physics but had not been able to find employment as a scientist …Einstein, of course.p 33: The closure of the ancient schools such as those of Athens and Alexandria, and the destruction of all the texts not in accordance with Christian ideas was vast and systematic …Apparently Plato and Aristotle were viewed as pagans. Democritus was even “worse.” I’d like to read more about these ancient thinkers.p 39: In the world of Democritus as sung by Lucretius -There is no fear of the gods; … There is a deep love of nature, a serene immersion within it; a recognition that we are profoundly part of it; that men, women, animals, plants, and clouds are organic threads of a marvelous whole, without hierarchies.In the Biological or Chemical use of the word, clouds wouldn’t be considered organic, … but this is a Physicist writing. (I think I like Democritus.)p 44: Mathematics allows the world to be described and the future to be predicted.Oh, my!p 47: A reminder:Experimental science begins with Galileo. His experiment is simple: he lets objects fall … and seeks to measure precisely their falling speed.p 69: I don't know enough to appreciate statements such as this one.Newton’s mechanics are not compatible with the existence of a fundamental velocity, because what enters Newton’s equations is acceleration, not velocity.p 81: Einstein, in an “extraordinary stroke of genius” asks:What if Newton’s space is nothing more than the gravitational field? This extremely simple, beautiful, brilliant idea is the theory of general relativity.The words are straightforward, but I can’t appreciate the significance.p 93: For Einstein, the theory of general relativity is a mental image of the world arduously translated into equations.And here’s another idea that seems really important, but I don’t fully grasp.p 153: Rovelli made a valiant attempt at explaining the scale of matter that is the subject of this book … and it surpasses my imagination.It is at this extremely minute scale that quantum gravity manifests itself. To give an idea of the smallness of the scale we are discussing: if we enlarged a walnut shell until it had become as big as the whole observable universe, we would still not see the Planck length. Even after having been enormously magnified thus, it would still be a million times smaller than the actual walnut shell was before magnification. At this scale, space and time change their nature. The become something different; they become ‘quantum space and time.’p 172:  Quanta of gravity are not in space; they are themselves space.Whew! That’s a lot to take in.p 176: If I wanted to pursue time travel, I suspect that I would need a solid understanding of these ideas:Time emerges, like space, from the quantum gravitational field. … The moment we take quantum mechanics into account, we recognize that time too must have those aspects of probabilistic indeterminacy, granularity, and relationality, which are common to all of reality. It becomes a ‘time’ markedly different from all that we have hitherto meant by the word.p 192: Here’s something that both blows me away and strikes me as totally incomprehensible.Every cubic centimeter of space, and every second that passes, is the result of this dancing foam of extremely small quanta. …. Light is formed by quanta of a field; space is nothing more than a field, which is also made of quanta; and time emerges from the processes of this same field. In other words, the world is made entirely from quantum fields.p 225: Ahh, something I do understand (at least to some extent):Stephen Hawking theoretically deduced that black holes are “hot.” They behave like hot bodies: they emit heat. In doing so, they lose energy and hence mass (since energy and mass are the same thing), becoming progressively smaller. They “evaporate.”. This is Hawking’s most important discovery.Maybe, if I read this another three or four or five or … times, just maybe I could summarize the big ideas. But I can’t do that now."
39,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"I had come across references to Carlo Rovelli previously, probably in the books I read by Lee Smolin, so when I saw this come into the library I was interested in checking it out. Rovelli is a leader in research into the ""Loop Quantum Gravity"" approach to fundamental physics, and this book describes that perspective in fairly simple non-mathematical terms, rather than in depth. The book is aimed at the layperson with little knowledge of physics, so it takes the historical approach starting with Democritus and explaining the differences between Newton, relativity and quantum mechanics before getting into the new story. (I hadn't known that LQG was actually first proposed in the early thirties by a Soviet physicist Matvei Bronstejn, who was murdered by Stalin in 1938.) Rovelli represents LQG as the most conservative of the approaches to quantum gravity, being based only on synthesizing general relativity, Standard Model quantum theory and thermodynamics rather than postulating new extra dimensions and totally unknown entities such as strings and branes as string theorists do. Nevertheless it is very radical in what it proposes: that rather than the world existing in space and time, space and time are constructed from the interactions of atomic quantum events. (Atomic in the sense of ""indivisible"", not as in the modern sense of nucleus and electrons; these ""atomic"" quanta of space are millions of time smaller than an atom.) His description of the theory was more understandable than the description by Smolin in the earlier Three Roads to Quantum Gravity, I think partly because the theory has become more developed in the meantime. (This book was published in 2014 in Italian, but since the text mentions the discovery of gravity waves last year it was obviously revised for the English translation.) Of course, without the mathematics I couldn't really understand it (and with the mathematics I certainly couldn't have understood it) but it did give an idea of what the theory is about. Judging by Smolin and Rovelli, LQG theorists are better philosophers than string theorists are; I'm not sure whether that's good or bad for a physicist's reputation."

Relativity I can fathom, more or less, quantum physics I am familiar with up to a certain degree, I don't know the Standard Model intimately but at least I recognize what people are talking about when they use the name, string theory I could never really follow but occasionally I keep trying, I am mostly fine with cosmology. It is, however, my first book on loop quantum gravity, and on that level I acknowledge myself speechless. Time is destroyed. Matter is presented as spinfoam, which is even stranger than it sounds. And there are some aspects on information theory I don't think I had heard before, either (then again, information theory gives me headaches, mostly when applied to black holes, so I might have missed out on stuff there earlier). Well. Surprising to say the least. One would think there would have been an announcement or something. The first hundred or so pages are an easy read, as a historical overview of the progress from Democritus to Einstein. From then onwards it becomes a bit of a struggle. I managed to read the historical overview in a day and it took me two weeks to go through the other hundred and fifty pages. I almost gave up twice. However, if you are interested in the subject, have some foreknowledge and you hang on to it you will probably get to it in the end. Personally I think I am going to need a second book on the subject after this introduction. Not sure if am seeking a second explanation or a second medical opinion, really, but the theory does seem worth exploring more in depth."

WHAT?!Do things that happen in nature require a cause in order to be properly explained? The answer to this was a resounding yes back in the days of Newton. This seems rather straightforward and our intuitions back it up. But what we are now finding out from quantum gravity is utterly shocking, and a blow to the cause-and-effect paradigm that helps us make sense of our world. This is a book about the fundamental nature of the universe: what is reality? What is reality made out of? How does it relate with what we know? What does reality mean for our own existence? Why did the universe bang into existence? Will the universe be there forever? What is forever anyway?Once someone thinks things through, then it becomes easy to understand what they are saying because they'll be able to tell you something that is condensed. The author has properly thought through the concepts that explain reality and in this book he summarizes them very well. I had no trouble understanding what he was saying up until the last chapter on Information Theory, but that's okay because he said the theory is not yet solidified. Aside from simplicity, it was also beautiful.It seems that the theories are pointing towards a non-dualistic structure of nature. I hope someday we'll have a grand theory that explains everything.The truth is in the depths. — Democritus"

I thoroughly enjoyed this introduction to the theory behind loop quantum gravity. I thought the author, Carlo Rovelli, did an excellent job of illustrating some complex theoretical physics in a manner that is easy for anybody to understand, whether you are a physics pro or you have very little background in or aptitude for physics. To do this feat, Rovelli started way back in the beginning, way back in Ancient Greece, with Aristotle and Archimedes, and he revisited Greece many times throughout the book. He took a great deal of the book to explain the physics of Einstein in a way that made it even more clear to me, even though I’ve studied relativity before, and the same with the quantum revolution. Rovelli introduced quantum gravity with a high level discussion fit for everybody, flowing language to make it slide down easy, and some excellent illustrations. Although the concepts are difficult and theoretical in nature, the poetic illustrations Rovelli provided made these ideas tangible for anyone to grasp. I listened to the audio version, which was very well done. "

45,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,5,"It is always a pleasure when one comes across a book such as this. Theoretical physicist Rovelli, who works in the area relating to Quantum Gravity, goes out of his way to introduce key concepts of his chosen discipline, and successfully manages to communicate its mysteries to us laypersons in language that is clear and informative. We are all made wiser and more appreciative as a result.Rovelli sees his current profession as being the result of a history of ideas about the nature of reality, and he lightly traces out this history, quickly arrives at the Miletians (Thales, Anaximander, etc) and then circa 450 BCE on to Leucippus and his young disciple Democritus and the idea of atomism. In a sense, the stage is now set for the development of further ideas that will ultimately result in Quantum theory and Quantum mechanics. Rovelli traces the acceptance, denial, dismissal, revival of these and associated ideas in a sweeping through-the-centuries overview that is exciting and adventurous, and we soon arrive at Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, and then Einstein and all the other associated physicists we may be more knowledgeable about today.Each step along the way is spelled out clearly and simply. Of course, this is not to say that the reader necessarily understands all the possible implications, but we do begin to see the links between: Space, Time and Spacetime; Particles and Fields; how Spacetime and Fields link to form Covariant Fields; and Fields and Particles combine to form Quantum Fields; and ultimately how Quantum Fields and Spacetime unite to form the “single ingredient”, Covariant Quantum Fields, which Rovelli considers to be the answer to the question “What is the word made of?”This is the conclusion that the author comes to, and his arguments form the rationale of the first three parts of this book. At the same time, he is aware that this view is not necessarily the accepted view of every physicist. His understanding based on loop-theory/loop-quantum-gravity suggests that at the very deepest level his research has lead him, time might very well not exist, nor even particles or quanta (he uses terms such as “Spacetime sushi” and “Spinfoams”) — the suspicion, perhaps, that we may all need to reconsider and/or reevaluate the validity of all current models of reality.Yet Rovelli pushes the envelope even more in Part Four, which is entitled “Beyond Space and Time”, where he explores other issues such as Beyond the Big Bang, Quantum Cosmology, Quantum Black Holes, and the End of Infinity. His final chapter is entitled “Mystery”, where he essentially reminds his readers that there remain more and more unknowns that need to be explored.For the cynics among us (and I would consider myself to be partial to the odd cynicism at times!) all the above is just a load of speculative bull that has no relevance whatever to “real” reality, i.e. what we might call the “four dimensional” Space-Time Continuum. This is the “place” where we as individuals need to position ourselves and negotiate our way about in order to survive and live our lives as happily as possible. Even on this level the title of this book (“Reality Is Not What It Seems”) makes sense — we can be deceived and/or misled by our senses (and even, sometimes, by our intelligence) with very unfortunate results… It could be that thinking too deeply on the “nature” of physical reality is not good for our health and well-being — pretty much the same as, say, for people suffering from schizophrenia or paranoia, or even for a whole slew of physiological, social, religious and psychological reasons: they believe that their experiences are real: for them Reality is exactly what it seems!Whatever one might think about this, it doesn’t mean that this book must needs be dismissed. If you want to know what Quantum Gravity physicists are on about, then this book strikes me as being a very good place to start."

Now I know what the universe is made of, and how to reconcile quantum gravity with the standard model. I truly expected to be left dangling at the end of this book, which takes the reader on a beautifully written, often funny, often moving journey from the ancient greeks to modern day, building up a picture of what we understand are the building blocks of the universe. There's a little bit of maths, but nothing that ought to daunt anyone who did maths in high-school and still remembers it, but mostly it's just a wonderfully written, and incredibly informative narrative.The original text was written in Italian and has been translated, and I could not help reading most of it with an Italian accent. In parts I caught myself waving my hands around as I read it.Makes me want to go and read more by Lee Smolin now."

Rovelli says, ""I don't criticize those who prefer to believe in [Truth and certainty]"" but he says they are ""immersed in ignorance."" He says ""we don't have absolute certainty"" about reality, the hallmark of science, except for his own certainty that what is written in the ""Great Book"" is silly. And somehow for reasons unexplained, being a quantum physicist gives him the means by which to apply the scientific method to all moral questions whatever, where ""it makes little sense to ask whether a half-cut fingernail is still 'me,' or has become 'not-me' . . . or precisely when a child's life begins."" If there is always universal uncertainty for any question whatever, which Rovelli clearly does not confine to questions of science, then by what standard can you judge any action or any belief? "

All the tests, last 100 years, have proven general relativity and quantum mechanics correct. The problem happens when we look at extremes they can't be both correct. Especially gravity. Quantum gravity removes infinity, removes singularity and takes Democritus to the word. Basic component of space is the ATOM. And it is the size of the Planck length.

52,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32544970-raf,5,"✨✨⭐ 10 out of 10 ⭐✨✨I just found my new favourite popular science author after Michio Kaku. I love Rovelli's writing so much! ❤️❤️❤️ Keywords: popular science, physics, astronomy, cosmology, general relativity, loop quantum gravity, big bounce   ""The curiousity to learn, to discover, to look over the next hill, the desire to taste the apple; these are the things which make us human.""   REVIEW  Have you ever heard about Big Bounce? It's an alternate theory to Big Bang, that maybe the universe as we know it is a result of contracting and expanding explosion. Reality is Not What it Seems, tells about this theory and the theory that become the core of big bounce: loop quantum gravity. Loop quantum gravity is a theory that will unite relativity and quantum mechanics, two which are very opposite of each other.  The Explanation is Easy to Understand  This book is written in very clear and slow explanations. Things are explained in layman terms, that even people who doesn't know physics will understand. His topic escalate slowly, from the foundation to the hardest part of the theory. From what is atoms, to what is field, gravitation, time, universe and so on escalate until quantum loop gravity. He often compares today's scientific theories with philosophies from ancient time; mentioned ancient philosophers and tells us their contribution to building of nowadays's science. There are many new insights I didn't know before and albeit the topic of quantum loop gravity itself very hard, I can quite grasp the bigger picture due to this book.  I love his humility  I also love how Carlo Rovelli is very humble. He always mentioned that he himself is not certain. Do not believe something with blind faith because our scientific knowledges have a limit and what we thought is true may be proven otherwise later. He encourage scientific thinking, that is to never fear of learning and unlearning things that we know. Conclusion  The topic of this book is very specific so unless you really curious about it you might not enjoy it. But the explanation is easy to understand so you don't need to fear that it will be hard to read. I recommend this to those who want to know more about astronomy, astrophysics, or physics itself in general.   ""Science is continual exploration of ways of thinking. Its strength is its visionary capacity to demolish preconceived ideas, to reveal new regions of reality, and to construct novel and more effective images of the world. This adventure rests upon the entirety of past knowledge, but at its heart is change. The world is boundless and iridescent, we want to go and see it. We are immersed in its mystery and in its beauty, and over the horizon there is unexplored territory. The incompleteness and the uncertainty of our knowledges, our precariousness, suspended over the abyss of the immensity of what we don't know, doesn't render life meaningless, it makes it interesting and precious.""  "
53,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"Carlo Rovelli's first book (aside from 7 Brief Lessons...), Reality is Not What it Seems, is a beautiful narrative regarding the foundational human conceptions of the fabric of reality ranging from Democritus and Anaximander's conception of the apeiron (""the primal substance of which everything is formed"") and concluding at the precipice of modern theoretic physics: Quantum Gravity. Rovelli begins by setting the stage of modern theoretical physics by first introducing the historical conceptions of the nature of reality, discussing ideas from ancient minds such as Democritus, Lucretius, and Anaximander who together postulated an astoundingly clarivoyant theory that everything was comprised of super-small components called ""atoms"" (humanity would have to wait for proof of such a claim until 1905). With a brief digression into some pleasing philosophical musings of the aforementioned thinkers, necessitated by the inability to test any of these theories, Rovelli moves on to explain the original of classical mechanics.Moving forwards in time (inside joke-- read the book!), Rovelli elegantly and relevantly presents the origins of several seminal ideas in classical mechanics like gravity (Galileo + Newton) planetary motion (Copernicus & Newton), the mathematical foundations upon which such theories were based (Plato/Aristotle/Pythagoras/etc - that physical processes could be modeled with mathematics), and the physical and philosophical implications of the new ways of thinking about the world. Not even a few centuries go by before Faraday, Maxwell, and their co-intellectuals of the 1800s arrive on the scene and postulate the notion of an ""Electro-Magnetic Field"", solving some of the greatest mysteries about the forces of electricity and magnetism by presenting a mathematical model of particles and fields that move through space and time. Upon the shoulders of such great conceivers, Einstein publishes a series of seminal papers that almost literally invoke a formal conception of ""atomic physics"", or ""particle physics""-- not only does Einstein prove that atoms exist, he also proves (via irrefutable mathematical models that predict reality down to the ump-teenth decimal place) that time is not consistent for all matter within space, AND that space and time themselves may be constituted by the notion of a Gravitational Field (with a stroke of genius, he applies Maxwell's conception of fields and particles to gravity!). The descriptions of special relativity, quantum mechanics, and general relativity are all eloquently and concisely explained by Rovelli, thus I choose to not digress here into any explanation of such awesome theories of reality and instead implore you to read the book! Throughout this section, short digressions into the theories and contributions of seminal quantum physicists such as Dirac, Heisenberg, Bohr, Wheeler, Feyman, etc., are discussed for support and insight for the nuanced non-intuitive conceptions of reality portrayed. This section is concluded with a thorough yet concise explanation of the three pillars of quantum mechanics: granularity, indeterminacy, and relationality. Perhaps the most intriguing of which to me was the notion that our universe is finite-but-without-boundaries: Einstein conceived of such a property of the universe with the notion of a 3-sphere-- yet again I implore you to read the book!The 3rd section of the book and, in my opinion, crown jewel, is focused on an elaboration of the theory of Quantum Gravity. Without diving too deep, in an attempt to let Rovelli's art stand on its own: The theory of quantum gravity, along with its components (loop theory, spin-networks, spinfoam, etc), is an incredibly intriguing conception of physical reality with which a quantum-field theory of spacetime is theorized. No longer is space some inert container, but is comprised of quanta and the relationships between them; No longer is time a parameter to the functions and equations of such a physics, but is simply the evolution of the relations of said quanta! A human's conception of space and time emerge as the manifestation of the evolution of such relationships between the inconceivably small quanta (particles) of the quantum field of space time itself-- such quanta are not IN space, nor are they evolving IN time: the quanta and their relationships ARE space, and their (indeterminate) evolutions PRODUCE the conception of time. Admittedly, I had to re-read chapters of this section due to the non-intuitive nature of such a conception of reality; But, I reread them because I wanted to, and was so deeply intrigued by the subject matter during the first pass that I felt compelled to go back and read this section (all 50 pages) a second time around in an attempt to understand it better. I, like Rovelli, believe that to understand a theory in any scientific domain, one must first become familiar with the ""episteme"" (- Foucault) or underlying scientific and philosophical framework from whence the theories came; Thus, I thoroughly enjoyed the progression of the book, and the attention to detail that Rovelli gave to ancient (Greek) conceptions of what reality might be comprised, and how these conceptions evolved through the centuries, discovered or invented by the great minds such as Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, Einstein, and now, quantum gravity theorists! I finished this book with a greater holistic understanding of ways in which to think about physical reality, and excitedly: a potential theory that might traverse the chasm between general relativity and quantum mechanics!Rovelli concludes the book by pushing even further into the unknown. He first discusses how the new theory of Quantum Gravity is being tested, confirming certain theories about the inception (or continuation) of our universe (think: The Big Bang... or, The Big Bounce!), and how it may play large role in the future of astronomy, ultimately better describing our universe at a macro scale than general relativity does! Venturing even further, Rovelli postulates interesting techniques for interpreting still-confounding aspects of reality with ideas such as the potential application of information theory to quantum mechanics, how time might be best quantified by (and even integrated mathematically into) thermodynamic phenomena, and how the notion of infinity (within any conception of physical reality) might have a place after all: reality might be truly be finite, at the most foundational level.I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did. It has presented to me a world of ideas-- the greater understanding of which I will pursue for the rest of my life-- in addition to the universe of ways (hopefully a finite 3-sphere) in which to better conceive reality."
54,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38087945-farha-crystal,4,"Are we so imprisoned in our consciousness, like the slaves in Plato's Cave, can't break loose of our chains?I can never make peace with Zeno's paradox. Oh! Rovelli, for peace and order's sake, can you please at least talk some sweet words to forget my misery for the chaos driven by Zeno's paradox? :) The concept of Infinity, as well as time, is only our ignorance, our limitations. In this book, Rovelli talks about the basic ideas behind loop quantum gravity, considering the feature of granularity, indeterminacy and probabilistic behavior. Loop quantum gravity, tries to combine general relativity with quantum field theory. In the world of Quantum Gravity, the principle of cause and effect no longer holds. Space, particles, quanta only exist when they interact only probabilistically. The book does not get into any quantitative detail for the knowledgeable reader but maybe it can at least provide the outline for the laypersons. It doesn't matter if complex issues like loop quantum gravity or superstrings are best possible answers for the intense situations like blackhole or the beginning of our known universe but this book is a poem. In fact, when Rovelli recites his poem I couldn't stop myself to put his beautiful lyrics into my mouth and suck it like a strawberry. He plays the chord of esoteric quantum gravity in an amazing way that the music infused through my veins to mandate a cosmic orgasm. :)Favorite line:  ""It is only in interactions that nature draws the world."" "
55,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40566664-knowlton-murphy,4,"A book on quantum physics for dumb people! Right up my alley. I do not have a brain for math or physics, so I am deeply indebted to the kind of work Rovelli has produced. I am absolutely sure I did not understand everything, but it was a fun and thought-provoking ride, and the fact that I understood anything is more a mark of Rovelli's skill in communication than my own acuity. The book is worth reading for its summary of the history of physics, and for its accessible explanation of quantum gravity. Rovelli, in general, writes clearly, and entertainingly. My favorite aspect of loop theory is its central prediction that ""...space is not a continuum, it is not divisible ad infinitum, it is formed of 'atoms of space'..."" (168) That is, ""...arbitrarily small chunks of space do not exist. There is a lower limit to the divisibility of space."" (169) What do you know. As a Christian, this is an interesting point because of its theological value: it draws that much more of a distinction between Creator and Created. Finitude is woven into the fabric of our created existence. There is nothing physical we can look to that compares to the infinitude of God. As a human with practical concerns in daily life, this matches my experience of life...I don't have to traverse an infinity of atomic infinities to reach my mug of tea. I can finally stop thinking about swift Achilles chasing that slow tortoise, forever doomed to fail! My second favorite concept is that of reality being relational. It is something I have thought about culturally in seeking to understand my own culture, but Rovelli helped me think about the relational nature of reality beyond the sociological sense. Again, this raised a theological point for me. As a Christian of my particular theological convictions, it makes sense to see the world in terms of relationships, because I believe God is a Trinity, a being who exists eternally in relationship.I was fascinated by Rovelli's guidance through the history of physics. It was cool to see how Democritus' idea of atomic/granular reality has become so validated. I do think that his atomic worldview is nightmarish, though:""There is no finality, no purpose, in this endless dance of atoms. We, just like the rest of the natural world, are one of many products of this infinite dance--the product, that is, of an accidental combination...Our life is a combination of atoms, our thoughts are made up of thin atoms, our dreams are the products of atoms; our hopes and our emotions are written in a language formed by combinations of atoms, which bring us images."" (21, summary by Rovelli)Rovelli returns to Democritus in his penultimate chapter to point out that ""...it is not just a question of these atoms but also of the order in which they are arranged...We are not atoms: we are orders in which atoms are arranged, capable of mirroring other atoms and mirroring ourselves."" (256) For me, this raises a cause for concern. Rovelli can speak romantically about human nature all he wants, but the only hope any of us have for reflecting the kind of good humanity he envisions is for our atoms to order themselves properly. Which according to Democritus is completely subject to accidental chance. Rovelli says atoms can think about themselves (256). This is quite a leap to me, but Rovelli manages it with graceful ease. Random accidents of atomic chance not only create the ordered world I inhabit, but align in such a way to lead to my sentient experience of it...seven billion times over. But I am not a theoretical physicist, so perhaps I just don't have enough faith. Speaking of faith, Rovelli has a flawed view of religion. He seems to think that the role of religion is primarily that of comfort for people who cannot bear the harsh nature of reality. He never suspects that people might be interested in religion as a means of pursuing truth. ""Ignorance can be scary. Out of fear, we tell ourselves calming stories: up there beyond the stars there is an enchanted garden, with a gentle father who will welcome us into his arms. It doesn't matter if it's true--it is reassuring."" Precisely what is reassuring about this system? This isn't historic Christianity, for example, which by and large holds sacred texts like 1 John 1:1-4 and 2 Peter 1:16 (which appeal to the reality of eyewitness as a grounds for believing in truth) or 1 Timothy 4:7 (which specifically tells us to not waste time with myths). Rather, Rovelli is describing existentialism...looking at the absurdity of our existence and seeking comfort in a fabricated view of reality, all the while knowing deep down that it is a lie. Incidentally, that's exactly what Rovelli does. He is convinced that men are not made ""...to live like brutes, but to seek virtue and knowledge"" (263-64, quote from Dante), but never bothers explaining why.Rovelli repeatedly says he wants to keep an open mind in case he is wrong. Clearly his idea of open-mindedness could never entertain supernaturality, though, so one wonders how genuine his claim is, especially in a world where materialists are minorities. Ironically, one of his suggestions for why people choose to be religious is that they ""...prefer to believe in a story just because it was believed by the tribe's ancestors, rather than bravely accept uncertainty."" (262) Wait. What about ancient Democritus, patriarch of the materialism, being right about atomic reality, which was counter-intuitive, and that magnificent list of heroes upon whose shoulders we sit (chapters 1-4)? Does Rovelli really have no mechanism for seeing the parallel? Ah well. The biggest awkward elephant in the room is of course that he doesn't really bother speculating where atoms come from. The closest he comes to saying where our current atoms come from is The Big Bounce (206-07), but it is funny for him to spend so much time talking about how the universe is finite only to gently acknowledge it is also eternal."

This one is probably the most incomprehensible of all that I’ve read on the subject of quantum physics so far, though, admittedly, it is also very skillfully written. Beautifully woven phrases intermingle with claims, terms and equations that I’m not equipped to understand. Even though it is still a pop-science book, on the spectrum of pop-science literature it is quite far removed from Michio Kaku’s light writing (e.g. Parallel Worlds: A Journey through Creation, Higher Dimensions, and the Future of the Cosmos) and much closer to Brian Cox’s level of detail (The Quantum Universe: Everything That Can Happen Does Happen), though Cox’s book was made even more obscure than it had to be by weird thought experiments meant to make it easier for the reader to visualise things, and failing. Rovelli doesn’t bother with thought experiments, he just ‘says it as it is’ in grand style.By no means am I trying to say that reading this book was a waste of my time. Quite the contrary, I did get a slightly better insight to how physicists think, even if I failed – as usual – to comprehend the essentials. Also, this book is the first one I’ve read that talks about an alternative hypothesis to the popular string theory: the loop theory, Rovelli’s (and others) intellectual child. Perhaps the lack of infinite universes makes it less cool in people’s eyes, but I find it comforting that there may not be, after all, countless other ‘mes’ capable of screwing up in innumerable ways!"

But this, this whole book is exactly what I have been looking for for very nearly the past ten years. It opens with a very brief (well, not too brief; it does take about half of what is actually a very short book) overview of classical physics, then general and special relativity, then quantum mechanics, and then dives right in to the heart of the matter: quantum gravity, or loop gravity, or loop quantum gravity; even Rovelli seems to use the terms interchangeably. The writing style was amazing. Fantastic. So light and breezy and conversational. Funny, even (there's really - and I am convinced of this - a ""The name of that man? Albert Einstein."" joke somewhere in chapter 2, and I lost my mind laughing), but still concise. The reader was great; his emphasis was spot-on. I'm half-tempted to listen to it over again and I wish my to-read list wasn't so long because I genuinely would. I enjoyed it that much.I won't lie - I didn't... quite catch on.At no point during this did I feel confused. At all. In fact, I almost feel like maybe the way Rovelli explained quantum gravity seemed... too easy? Space is granular, check. I follow. Time is what happens because we can't understand everything that's happening all the time. That's highly speculative and still, check, I gotcha, I follow. But if you wanted me to tell you what you what quantum gravity is right now? I'm not sure I could. Maybe that's okay though. Maybe that's okay because this is the first book like this - or at least the first one I've been able to get my hands on - and soon I'll be able to devour books on loop quantum gravity the same way I had the chance to eat up string theory before I realized that the point that it was getting to was indeed no point at all (I had to get one in there, so sue me). Maybe Carlo Rovelli is the Brian Greene of quantum gravity. I sure hope so. I could use a lot more books like this."

Statements like the one I used in the epigraph, about human infinite ignorance, resonate with me. I teach mathematics at a university, I have quite an extensive exposure to classical physics, yet my ignorance about modern physics is certainly limitless. (By the way, there is no better way to understand the vastness of one's ignorance than being a professor.)While I will not rate this book by Dr. Rovelli as a masterpiece like 
Seven Brief Lessons on Physics
, it is still a great read and I have learned a lot from it - not only about my lack of knowledge. The author begins with a story about Anaximander of Miletus (450 BCE) whose work contributed to the foundations of Western science and philosophy.  ""The Milesians understand that by shrewdly using observation and reason, rather than searching for answers in fantasy, ancient myths, or religion - and above all by using critical thought in a discriminating way - it is possible to repeatedly correct our worldview and to discover new aspects of reality that are hidden to the common view.""  Progressing through time, we read about Democritus, then through Copernicus, Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, we follow the evolution of human models of reality. Then come Einstein, Heisenberg, Bohr, Dirac - fathers of the modern physics - and we arrive at the ""two pillars of twentieth-century physics - general relativity and quantum mechanics."" General relativity is ""a simple and coherent vision of gravity, space, and time."" Quantum mechanics unveils the three aspects of reality: ""granularity, indeterminism, and relationality.""Part Three, Quantum Space and Relational Time is to me the most fascinating part of the book. General relativity and quantum mechanics, ""the two jewels that the twentieth century has left us,"" seem to contradict each other. ""They cannot both be true, at least not in their present forms."" Chapters 5 through 7 provide an introduction to the loop quantum gravity theory in whose development the author has played one of the key roles.  ""[...] the world described by the theory is far from the one we are familiar with. There is no longer space that ""contains"" the world, and no longer time ""during the course of which"" events occur.""  Part Four, Beyond Space and Time, discusses such aspects of cosmology as Big Bang and black holes. I found the chapter Information the most illuminating. Information is defined as the number of possible alternatives, connections to Boltzmann's statistical mechanics are shown, and the author presents yet another crucial idea - thermal time and its connection with the concept of irreversibility. The author's succinct summary is stunning:  ""Time is an effect of our overlooking the physical microstates of things. Time is the information we don't have. Time is our ignorance.""  I absolutely love the powerful final chapter, Mystery, with its convincing argument why nothing but science can be reliable:  ""The answers given by science [...] are not reliable because they are definitive. They are reliable because they are not definitive.  This is the most powerful argument I have ever heard against all kinds of mumbo-jumbo that ignores science, which is particularly important in the times of a pandemic. The author provides two fascinating historical vignettes: the first about a ""race"" to formalize Einstein's theory between David Hilbert, one of the most famous mathematicians in history, and Albert Einstein. The other vignette is about a little known Belgian priest, Georges Lemaître, who showed that both Einstein in his skepticism about the expansion of the universe as well as pope Pius XII in his declaration that the Big Bang confirms the account of Creation given in Genesis were wrong.Fascinating read!Four-and-a-quarter stars."
62,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4277032-d,5,"I wholeheartedly agree with Manny's review.Applying Occam's razor clearly favors Loop Quantum Gravity (LCG) theory over String theory with its 11 or more dimensions. Amazingly, dropping the 'background' of empty space and time as basic notions simplifies obtaining LCG as a theory that makes General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics compatible. There are even some cosmological experiments that could test LCG: e.g. observing a black hole that expands again (bounces back) would suggest that space/matter is granular, making everything finite, again simplifying matters considerably, it seems. However this experiment shows that, if true, the size of a matter/space quantum should be really small: 10-48m (10 to the power of -48), much smaller than the Planck scale."
63,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,2,"39th book for 2017. A relatively quick read on modern physics starting with the Ancient Greeks and ending with Quantum Gravity. I have mixed feelings about the book. Rovelli's prose is quite poetic at times (and perhaps a little damaged in translation from the Italian). I found the historical background quite clear, but when he got to describing quantum gravity, and how space/time do not exist at the most basic level I was lost. That's a shame, because it's the most interesting part of the book. It would also have been nice to have a somewhat broader view of the rest of physics (e.g., String Theory; how does Dark Matter or Dark Energy fit in?). I was also a bit disturbed to read in other reviews that the form of Quantum Gravity being presented here is only the flavor that Rovelli is working on and he has left out other competing versions, which view time quite differently.Finally, and most annoyingly, large chunks of text are reused almost word for word from his previous book Seven Brief Lessons on Physics. If you have read the first, you have already third-to-half of this one (hence 2-stars)."

For decades, the only approach dominating to resolve the grand unification problem was the string theory and if like me you saw Brian Greene's dramatically made TV documentary then you might have been fooled into believing we have indeed solved it. But when our friendly particle collider @ Geneva, didn't throw out a bunch of predicted supersymmetric particles, the long suspected truth came into the reality that - String theory is not the last word! In contrast to string theory, LQG has been steadily building up and has found much stronger footing. Carlo starts from antiquity in ancient Greece to the original apple guy Newton and to our generation's greatest genius maverick Einstein, before introducing LQG.

66,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/900147-laura,3,From BBC Radio 4 Extra:Carlo Rovelli's provocative account of how science affects our understanding of the world around us. Read by Mark Meadows.http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b084n7jp
67,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32136926-mysi,1,"TOO. WORDY. holy crap. Get to the point! It's nearly poetry. Which is probably lovely, but I was hoping to learn something. Oh boy. "
68,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22241323-judy,3,"Rovelli tells the reader that he’s written with a particular reader in mind: someone who knows little or nothing about today’s physics but is curious to find out what we know, as well as what we don’t yet understand, about the elementary weave of the world. (p 8)I need to acknowledge that Physics has never been my favorite branch of science. However, I've always been intrigued by how Physicists think, so when my niece gave this book 3-stars and said it was ""pretty good,"" I decided to give it a try. I'm reading her copy of the book, so I can't write in it, but I am noting quite a few page numbers, most of which indicate something I want to give some thought. This isn’t going to be a review but rather a list of ideas that are food for thought (to me anyway).p 21: Our life is a combination of atoms, our thoughts are made up of thin atoms, our dreams are the products of atoms; our hopes and our emotions are written in a language formed by combinations of atoms; …That is true at a very fundamental level. (Thin atoms?)p 29: The definitive proof of the ‘atomic hypothesis’ had to wait until 1905. It was found by a rebellious 25 year-old who had studied physics but had not been able to find employment as a scientist …Einstein, of course.p 33: The closure of the ancient schools such as those of Athens and Alexandria, and the destruction of all the texts not in accordance with Christian ideas was vast and systematic …Apparently Plato and Aristotle were viewed as pagans. Democritus was even “worse.” I’d like to read more about these ancient thinkers.p 39: In the world of Democritus as sung by Lucretius -There is no fear of the gods; … There is a deep love of nature, a serene immersion within it; a recognition that we are profoundly part of it; that men, women, animals, plants, and clouds are organic threads of a marvelous whole, without hierarchies.In the Biological or Chemical use of the word, clouds wouldn’t be considered organic, … but this is a Physicist writing. (I think I like Democritus.)p 44: Mathematics allows the world to be described and the future to be predicted.Oh, my!p 47: A reminder:Experimental science begins with Galileo. His experiment is simple: he lets objects fall … and seeks to measure precisely their falling speed.p 69: I don't know enough to appreciate statements such as this one.Newton’s mechanics are not compatible with the existence of a fundamental velocity, because what enters Newton’s equations is acceleration, not velocity.p 81: Einstein, in an “extraordinary stroke of genius” asks:What if Newton’s space is nothing more than the gravitational field? This extremely simple, beautiful, brilliant idea is the theory of general relativity.The words are straightforward, but I can’t appreciate the significance.p 93: For Einstein, the theory of general relativity is a mental image of the world arduously translated into equations.And here’s another idea that seems really important, but I don’t fully grasp.p 153: Rovelli made a valiant attempt at explaining the scale of matter that is the subject of this book … and it surpasses my imagination.It is at this extremely minute scale that quantum gravity manifests itself. To give an idea of the smallness of the scale we are discussing: if we enlarged a walnut shell until it had become as big as the whole observable universe, we would still not see the Planck length. Even after having been enormously magnified thus, it would still be a million times smaller than the actual walnut shell was before magnification. At this scale, space and time change their nature. The become something different; they become ‘quantum space and time.’p 172:  Quanta of gravity are not in space; they are themselves space.Whew! That’s a lot to take in.p 176: If I wanted to pursue time travel, I suspect that I would need a solid understanding of these ideas:Time emerges, like space, from the quantum gravitational field. … The moment we take quantum mechanics into account, we recognize that time too must have those aspects of probabilistic indeterminacy, granularity, and relationality, which are common to all of reality. It becomes a ‘time’ markedly different from all that we have hitherto meant by the word.p 192: Here’s something that both blows me away and strikes me as totally incomprehensible.Every cubic centimeter of space, and every second that passes, is the result of this dancing foam of extremely small quanta. …. Light is formed by quanta of a field; space is nothing more than a field, which is also made of quanta; and time emerges from the processes of this same field. In other words, the world is made entirely from quantum fields.p 225: Ahh, something I do understand (at least to some extent):Stephen Hawking theoretically deduced that black holes are “hot.” They behave like hot bodies: they emit heat. In doing so, they lose energy and hence mass (since energy and mass are the same thing), becoming progressively smaller. They “evaporate.”. This is Hawking’s most important discovery.Maybe, if I read this another three or four or five or … times, just maybe I could summarize the big ideas. But I can’t do that now."
69,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"I had come across references to Carlo Rovelli previously, probably in the books I read by Lee Smolin, so when I saw this come into the library I was interested in checking it out. Rovelli is a leader in research into the ""Loop Quantum Gravity"" approach to fundamental physics, and this book describes that perspective in fairly simple non-mathematical terms, rather than in depth. The book is aimed at the layperson with little knowledge of physics, so it takes the historical approach starting with Democritus and explaining the differences between Newton, relativity and quantum mechanics before getting into the new story. (I hadn't known that LQG was actually first proposed in the early thirties by a Soviet physicist Matvei Bronstejn, who was murdered by Stalin in 1938.) Rovelli represents LQG as the most conservative of the approaches to quantum gravity, being based only on synthesizing general relativity, Standard Model quantum theory and thermodynamics rather than postulating new extra dimensions and totally unknown entities such as strings and branes as string theorists do. Nevertheless it is very radical in what it proposes: that rather than the world existing in space and time, space and time are constructed from the interactions of atomic quantum events. (Atomic in the sense of ""indivisible"", not as in the modern sense of nucleus and electrons; these ""atomic"" quanta of space are millions of time smaller than an atom.) His description of the theory was more understandable than the description by Smolin in the earlier Three Roads to Quantum Gravity, I think partly because the theory has become more developed in the meantime. (This book was published in 2014 in Italian, but since the text mentions the discovery of gravity waves last year it was obviously revised for the English translation.) Of course, without the mathematics I couldn't really understand it (and with the mathematics I certainly couldn't have understood it) but it did give an idea of what the theory is about. Judging by Smolin and Rovelli, LQG theorists are better philosophers than string theorists are; I'm not sure whether that's good or bad for a physicist's reputation."
70,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22926162-in-s-chamarro,4,"I am a lawyer and most certainly a scientific layman, but I am determined to remain an informed fan of science and this is definitely not my first science book. Relativity I can fathom, more or less, quantum physics I am familiar with up to a certain degree, I don't know the Standard Model intimately but at least I recognize what people are talking about when they use the name, string theory I could never really follow but occasionally I keep trying, I am mostly fine with cosmology. It is, however, my first book on loop quantum gravity, and on that level I acknowledge myself speechless. Time is destroyed. Matter is presented as spinfoam, which is even stranger than it sounds. And there are some aspects on information theory I don't think I had heard before, either (then again, information theory gives me headaches, mostly when applied to black holes, so I might have missed out on stuff there earlier). Well. Surprising to say the least. One would think there would have been an announcement or something. The first hundred or so pages are an easy read, as a historical overview of the progress from Democritus to Einstein. From then onwards it becomes a bit of a struggle. I managed to read the historical overview in a day and it took me two weeks to go through the other hundred and fifty pages. I almost gave up twice. However, if you are interested in the subject, have some foreknowledge and you hang on to it you will probably get to it in the end. Personally I think I am going to need a second book on the subject after this introduction. Not sure if am seeking a second explanation or a second medical opinion, really, but the theory does seem worth exploring more in depth."
71,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60222708-nati-s,5,"There is no such thing as time, it is nothing but an illusion. Also space, that too does not really exist. WHAT?!Do things that happen in nature require a cause in order to be properly explained? The answer to this was a resounding yes back in the days of Newton. This seems rather straightforward and our intuitions back it up. But what we are now finding out from quantum gravity is utterly shocking, and a blow to the cause-and-effect paradigm that helps us make sense of our world. This is a book about the fundamental nature of the universe: what is reality? What is reality made out of? How does it relate with what we know? What does reality mean for our own existence? Why did the universe bang into existence? Will the universe be there forever? What is forever anyway?Once someone thinks things through, then it becomes easy to understand what they are saying because they'll be able to tell you something that is condensed. The author has properly thought through the concepts that explain reality and in this book he summarizes them very well. I had no trouble understanding what he was saying up until the last chapter on Information Theory, but that's okay because he said the theory is not yet solidified. Aside from simplicity, it was also beautiful.It seems that the theories are pointing towards a non-dualistic structure of nature. I hope someday we'll have a grand theory that explains everything.The truth is in the depths. — Democritus"
72,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6309342-bruce,5,"If you’ve ever wondered about the nature of reality, what is the fabric of space, and how does time work, then this book is for you. I thoroughly enjoyed this introduction to the theory behind loop quantum gravity. I thought the author, Carlo Rovelli, did an excellent job of illustrating some complex theoretical physics in a manner that is easy for anybody to understand, whether you are a physics pro or you have very little background in or aptitude for physics. To do this feat, Rovelli started way back in the beginning, way back in Ancient Greece, with Aristotle and Archimedes, and he revisited Greece many times throughout the book. He took a great deal of the book to explain the physics of Einstein in a way that made it even more clear to me, even though I’ve studied relativity before, and the same with the quantum revolution. Rovelli introduced quantum gravity with a high level discussion fit for everybody, flowing language to make it slide down easy, and some excellent illustrations. Although the concepts are difficult and theoretical in nature, the poetic illustrations Rovelli provided made these ideas tangible for anyone to grasp. I listened to the audio version, which was very well done. "
73,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15818992-elsof,3,"It's hard to review a book like this. Suffice to say the information was dizzying yet compelling, and if I had the mathematical ability, I'd jump head first into theoretical physics, because it aims to reveal the very nature of reality, which to me, is more fascinating than anything else."
74,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20923295-anton,5,I am in absolute awe. Best read of the year for me. More detailed review to follow.This book is incredible!
75,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,5,"It is always a pleasure when one comes across a book such as this. Theoretical physicist Rovelli, who works in the area relating to Quantum Gravity, goes out of his way to introduce key concepts of his chosen discipline, and successfully manages to communicate its mysteries to us laypersons in language that is clear and informative. We are all made wiser and more appreciative as a result.Rovelli sees his current profession as being the result of a history of ideas about the nature of reality, and he lightly traces out this history, quickly arrives at the Miletians (Thales, Anaximander, etc) and then circa 450 BCE on to Leucippus and his young disciple Democritus and the idea of atomism. In a sense, the stage is now set for the development of further ideas that will ultimately result in Quantum theory and Quantum mechanics. Rovelli traces the acceptance, denial, dismissal, revival of these and associated ideas in a sweeping through-the-centuries overview that is exciting and adventurous, and we soon arrive at Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, and then Einstein and all the other associated physicists we may be more knowledgeable about today.Each step along the way is spelled out clearly and simply. Of course, this is not to say that the reader necessarily understands all the possible implications, but we do begin to see the links between: Space, Time and Spacetime; Particles and Fields; how Spacetime and Fields link to form Covariant Fields; and Fields and Particles combine to form Quantum Fields; and ultimately how Quantum Fields and Spacetime unite to form the “single ingredient”, Covariant Quantum Fields, which Rovelli considers to be the answer to the question “What is the word made of?”This is the conclusion that the author comes to, and his arguments form the rationale of the first three parts of this book. At the same time, he is aware that this view is not necessarily the accepted view of every physicist. His understanding based on loop-theory/loop-quantum-gravity suggests that at the very deepest level his research has lead him, time might very well not exist, nor even particles or quanta (he uses terms such as “Spacetime sushi” and “Spinfoams”) — the suspicion, perhaps, that we may all need to reconsider and/or reevaluate the validity of all current models of reality.Yet Rovelli pushes the envelope even more in Part Four, which is entitled “Beyond Space and Time”, where he explores other issues such as Beyond the Big Bang, Quantum Cosmology, Quantum Black Holes, and the End of Infinity. His final chapter is entitled “Mystery”, where he essentially reminds his readers that there remain more and more unknowns that need to be explored.For the cynics among us (and I would consider myself to be partial to the odd cynicism at times!) all the above is just a load of speculative bull that has no relevance whatever to “real” reality, i.e. what we might call the “four dimensional” Space-Time Continuum. This is the “place” where we as individuals need to position ourselves and negotiate our way about in order to survive and live our lives as happily as possible. Even on this level the title of this book (“Reality Is Not What It Seems”) makes sense — we can be deceived and/or misled by our senses (and even, sometimes, by our intelligence) with very unfortunate results… It could be that thinking too deeply on the “nature” of physical reality is not good for our health and well-being — pretty much the same as, say, for people suffering from schizophrenia or paranoia, or even for a whole slew of physiological, social, religious and psychological reasons: they believe that their experiences are real: for them Reality is exactly what it seems!Whatever one might think about this, it doesn’t mean that this book must needs be dismissed. If you want to know what Quantum Gravity physicists are on about, then this book strikes me as being a very good place to start."
76,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5896715-dave,5,"Well that was an unexpected delight. Now I know what the universe is made of, and how to reconcile quantum gravity with the standard model. I truly expected to be left dangling at the end of this book, which takes the reader on a beautifully written, often funny, often moving journey from the ancient greeks to modern day, building up a picture of what we understand are the building blocks of the universe. There's a little bit of maths, but nothing that ought to daunt anyone who did maths in high-school and still remembers it, but mostly it's just a wonderfully written, and incredibly informative narrative.The original text was written in Italian and has been translated, and I could not help reading most of it with an Italian accent. In parts I caught myself waving my hands around as I read it.Makes me want to go and read more by Lee Smolin now."
77,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1920850-nate-ahern,3,"Good and interesting but gets too big for its britches in the last chapter. Rovelli says, ""I don't criticize those who prefer to believe in [Truth and certainty]"" but he says they are ""immersed in ignorance."" He says ""we don't have absolute certainty"" about reality, the hallmark of science, except for his own certainty that what is written in the ""Great Book"" is silly. And somehow for reasons unexplained, being a quantum physicist gives him the means by which to apply the scientific method to all moral questions whatever, where ""it makes little sense to ask whether a half-cut fingernail is still 'me,' or has become 'not-me' . . . or precisely when a child's life begins."" If there is always universal uncertainty for any question whatever, which Rovelli clearly does not confine to questions of science, then by what standard can you judge any action or any belief? "

All the tests, last 100 years, have proven general relativity and quantum mechanics correct. The problem happens when we look at extremes they can't be both correct. Especially gravity. Quantum gravity removes infinity, removes singularity and takes Democritus to the word. Basic component of space is the ATOM. And it is the size of the Planck length. As for time, there is not time, there is entropy."

I love Rovelli's writing so much! ❤️❤️❤️ Keywords: popular science, physics, astronomy, cosmology, general relativity, loop quantum gravity, big bounce   ""The curiousity to learn, to discover, to look over the next hill, the desire to taste the apple; these are the things which make us human.""   REVIEW  Have you ever heard about Big Bounce? It's an alternate theory to Big Bang, that maybe the universe as we know it is a result of contracting and expanding explosion. Reality is Not What it Seems, tells about this theory and the theory that become the core of big bounce: loop quantum gravity. Loop quantum gravity is a theory that will unite relativity and quantum mechanics, two which are very opposite of each other.  The Explanation is Easy to Understand  This book is written in very clear and slow explanations. Things are explained in layman terms, that even people who doesn't know physics will understand. His topic escalate slowly, from the foundation to the hardest part of the theory. From what is atoms, to what is field, gravitation, time, universe and so on escalate until quantum loop gravity. He often compares today's scientific theories with philosophies from ancient time; mentioned ancient philosophers and tells us their contribution to building of nowadays's science. There are many new insights I didn't know before and albeit the topic of quantum loop gravity itself very hard, I can quite grasp the bigger picture due to this book.  I love his humility  I also love how Carlo Rovelli is very humble. He always mentioned that he himself is not certain. Do not believe something with blind faith because our scientific knowledges have a limit and what we thought is true may be proven otherwise later. He encourage scientific thinking, that is to never fear of learning and unlearning things that we know. Conclusion  The topic of this book is very specific so unless you really curious about it you might not enjoy it. But the explanation is easy to understand so you don't need to fear that it will be hard to read. I recommend this to those who want to know more about astronomy, astrophysics, or physics itself in general.   ""Science is continual exploration of ways of thinking. Its strength is its visionary capacity to demolish preconceived ideas, to reveal new regions of reality, and to construct novel and more effective images of the world. This adventure rests upon the entirety of past knowledge, but at its heart is change. The world is boundless and iridescent, we want to go and see it. We are immersed in its mystery and in its beauty, and over the horizon there is unexplored territory. The incompleteness and the uncertainty of our knowledges, our precariousness, suspended over the abyss of the immensity of what we don't know, doesn't render life meaningless, it makes it interesting and precious.""  "
83,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"Carlo Rovelli's first book (aside from 7 Brief Lessons...), Reality is Not What it Seems, is a beautiful narrative regarding the foundational human conceptions of the fabric of reality ranging from Democritus and Anaximander's conception of the apeiron (""the primal substance of which everything is formed"") and concluding at the precipice of modern theoretic physics: Quantum Gravity. Rovelli begins by setting the stage of modern theoretical physics by first introducing the historical conceptions of the nature of reality, discussing ideas from ancient minds such as Democritus, Lucretius, and Anaximander who together postulated an astoundingly clarivoyant theory that everything was comprised of super-small components called ""atoms"" (humanity would have to wait for proof of such a claim until 1905). With a brief digression into some pleasing philosophical musings of the aforementioned thinkers, necessitated by the inability to test any of these theories, Rovelli moves on to explain the original of classical mechanics.Moving forwards in time (inside joke-- read the book!), Rovelli elegantly and relevantly presents the origins of several seminal ideas in classical mechanics like gravity (Galileo + Newton) planetary motion (Copernicus & Newton), the mathematical foundations upon which such theories were based (Plato/Aristotle/Pythagoras/etc - that physical processes could be modeled with mathematics), and the physical and philosophical implications of the new ways of thinking about the world. Not even a few centuries go by before Faraday, Maxwell, and their co-intellectuals of the 1800s arrive on the scene and postulate the notion of an ""Electro-Magnetic Field"", solving some of the greatest mysteries about the forces of electricity and magnetism by presenting a mathematical model of particles and fields that move through space and time. Upon the shoulders of such great conceivers, Einstein publishes a series of seminal papers that almost literally invoke a formal conception of ""atomic physics"", or ""particle physics""-- not only does Einstein prove that atoms exist, he also proves (via irrefutable mathematical models that predict reality down to the ump-teenth decimal place) that time is not consistent for all matter within space, AND that space and time themselves may be constituted by the notion of a Gravitational Field (with a stroke of genius, he applies Maxwell's conception of fields and particles to gravity!). The descriptions of special relativity, quantum mechanics, and general relativity are all eloquently and concisely explained by Rovelli, thus I choose to not digress here into any explanation of such awesome theories of reality and instead implore you to read the book! Throughout this section, short digressions into the theories and contributions of seminal quantum physicists such as Dirac, Heisenberg, Bohr, Wheeler, Feyman, etc., are discussed for support and insight for the nuanced non-intuitive conceptions of reality portrayed. This section is concluded with a thorough yet concise explanation of the three pillars of quantum mechanics: granularity, indeterminacy, and relationality. Perhaps the most intriguing of which to me was the notion that our universe is finite-but-without-boundaries: Einstein conceived of such a property of the universe with the notion of a 3-sphere-- yet again I implore you to read the book!The 3rd section of the book and, in my opinion, crown jewel, is focused on an elaboration of the theory of Quantum Gravity. Without diving too deep, in an attempt to let Rovelli's art stand on its own: The theory of quantum gravity, along with its components (loop theory, spin-networks, spinfoam, etc), is an incredibly intriguing conception of physical reality with which a quantum-field theory of spacetime is theorized. No longer is space some inert container, but is comprised of quanta and the relationships between them; No longer is time a parameter to the functions and equations of such a physics, but is simply the evolution of the relations of said quanta! A human's conception of space and time emerge as the manifestation of the evolution of such relationships between the inconceivably small quanta (particles) of the quantum field of space time itself-- such quanta are not IN space, nor are they evolving IN time: the quanta and their relationships ARE space, and their (indeterminate) evolutions PRODUCE the conception of time. Admittedly, I had to re-read chapters of this section due to the non-intuitive nature of such a conception of reality; But, I reread them because I wanted to, and was so deeply intrigued by the subject matter during the first pass that I felt compelled to go back and read this section (all 50 pages) a second time around in an attempt to understand it better. I, like Rovelli, believe that to understand a theory in any scientific domain, one must first become familiar with the ""episteme"" (- Foucault) or underlying scientific and philosophical framework from whence the theories came; Thus, I thoroughly enjoyed the progression of the book, and the attention to detail that Rovelli gave to ancient (Greek) conceptions of what reality might be comprised, and how these conceptions evolved through the centuries, discovered or invented by the great minds such as Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, Einstein, and now, quantum gravity theorists! I finished this book with a greater holistic understanding of ways in which to think about physical reality, and excitedly: a potential theory that might traverse the chasm between general relativity and quantum mechanics!Rovelli concludes the book by pushing even further into the unknown. He first discusses how the new theory of Quantum Gravity is being tested, confirming certain theories about the inception (or continuation) of our universe (think: The Big Bang... or, The Big Bounce!), and how it may play large role in the future of astronomy, ultimately better describing our universe at a macro scale than general relativity does! Venturing even further, Rovelli postulates interesting techniques for interpreting still-confounding aspects of reality with ideas such as the potential application of information theory to quantum mechanics, how time might be best quantified by (and even integrated mathematically into) thermodynamic phenomena, and how the notion of infinity (within any conception of physical reality) might have a place after all: reality might be truly be finite, at the most foundational level.I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did. It has presented to me a world of ideas-- the greater understanding of which I will pursue for the rest of my life-- in addition to the universe of ways (hopefully a finite 3-sphere) in which to better conceive reality."
84,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38087945-farha-crystal,4,"Are we so imprisoned in our consciousness, like the slaves in Plato's Cave, can't break loose of our chains?I can never make peace with Zeno's paradox. Oh! Rovelli, for peace and order's sake, can you please at least talk some sweet words to forget my misery for the chaos driven by Zeno's paradox? :) The concept of Infinity, as well as time, is only our ignorance, our limitations. In this book, Rovelli talks about the basic ideas behind loop quantum gravity, considering the feature of granularity, indeterminacy and probabilistic behavior. Loop quantum gravity, tries to combine general relativity with quantum field theory. In the world of Quantum Gravity, the principle of cause and effect no longer holds. Space, particles, quanta only exist when they interact only probabilistically. The book does not get into any quantitative detail for the knowledgeable reader but maybe it can at least provide the outline for the laypersons. It doesn't matter if complex issues like loop quantum gravity or superstrings are best possible answers for the intense situations like blackhole or the beginning of our known universe but this book is a poem. In fact, when Rovelli recites his poem I couldn't stop myself to put his beautiful lyrics into my mouth and suck it like a strawberry. He plays the chord of esoteric quantum gravity in an amazing way that the music infused through my veins to mandate a cosmic orgasm. :)Favorite line:  ""It is only in interactions that nature draws the world."" "
85,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40566664-knowlton-murphy,4,"A book on quantum physics for dumb people! Right up my alley. I do not have a brain for math or physics, so I am deeply indebted to the kind of work Rovelli has produced. I am absolutely sure I did not understand everything, but it was a fun and thought-provoking ride, and the fact that I understood anything is more a mark of Rovelli's skill in communication than my own acuity. The book is worth reading for its summary of the history of physics, and for its accessible explanation of quantum gravity. Rovelli, in general, writes clearly, and entertainingly. My favorite aspect of loop theory is its central prediction that ""...space is not a continuum, it is not divisible ad infinitum, it is formed of 'atoms of space'..."" (168) That is, ""...arbitrarily small chunks of space do not exist. There is a lower limit to the divisibility of space."" (169) What do you know. As a Christian, this is an interesting point because of its theological value: it draws that much more of a distinction between Creator and Created. Finitude is woven into the fabric of our created existence. There is nothing physical we can look to that compares to the infinitude of God. As a human with practical concerns in daily life, this matches my experience of life...I don't have to traverse an infinity of atomic infinities to reach my mug of tea. I can finally stop thinking about swift Achilles chasing that slow tortoise, forever doomed to fail! My second favorite concept is that of reality being relational. It is something I have thought about culturally in seeking to understand my own culture, but Rovelli helped me think about the relational nature of reality beyond the sociological sense. Again, this raised a theological point for me. As a Christian of my particular theological convictions, it makes sense to see the world in terms of relationships, because I believe God is a Trinity, a being who exists eternally in relationship.I was fascinated by Rovelli's guidance through the history of physics. It was cool to see how Democritus' idea of atomic/granular reality has become so validated. I do think that his atomic worldview is nightmarish, though:""There is no finality, no purpose, in this endless dance of atoms. We, just like the rest of the natural world, are one of many products of this infinite dance--the product, that is, of an accidental combination...Our life is a combination of atoms, our thoughts are made up of thin atoms, our dreams are the products of atoms; our hopes and our emotions are written in a language formed by combinations of atoms, which bring us images."" (21, summary by Rovelli)Rovelli returns to Democritus in his penultimate chapter to point out that ""...it is not just a question of these atoms but also of the order in which they are arranged...We are not atoms: we are orders in which atoms are arranged, capable of mirroring other atoms and mirroring ourselves."" (256) For me, this raises a cause for concern. Rovelli can speak romantically about human nature all he wants, but the only hope any of us have for reflecting the kind of good humanity he envisions is for our atoms to order themselves properly. Which according to Democritus is completely subject to accidental chance. Rovelli says atoms can think about themselves (256). This is quite a leap to me, but Rovelli manages it with graceful ease. Random accidents of atomic chance not only create the ordered world I inhabit, but align in such a way to lead to my sentient experience of it...seven billion times over. But I am not a theoretical physicist, so perhaps I just don't have enough faith. Speaking of faith, Rovelli has a flawed view of religion. He seems to think that the role of religion is primarily that of comfort for people who cannot bear the harsh nature of reality. He never suspects that people might be interested in religion as a means of pursuing truth. ""Ignorance can be scary. Out of fear, we tell ourselves calming stories: up there beyond the stars there is an enchanted garden, with a gentle father who will welcome us into his arms. It doesn't matter if it's true--it is reassuring."" Precisely what is reassuring about this system? This isn't historic Christianity, for example, which by and large holds sacred texts like 1 John 1:1-4 and 2 Peter 1:16 (which appeal to the reality of eyewitness as a grounds for believing in truth) or 1 Timothy 4:7 (which specifically tells us to not waste time with myths). Rather, Rovelli is describing existentialism...looking at the absurdity of our existence and seeking comfort in a fabricated view of reality, all the while knowing deep down that it is a lie. Incidentally, that's exactly what Rovelli does. He is convinced that men are not made ""...to live like brutes, but to seek virtue and knowledge"" (263-64, quote from Dante), but never bothers explaining why.Rovelli repeatedly says he wants to keep an open mind in case he is wrong. Clearly his idea of open-mindedness could never entertain supernaturality, though, so one wonders how genuine his claim is, especially in a world where materialists are minorities. Ironically, one of his suggestions for why people choose to be religious is that they ""...prefer to believe in a story just because it was believed by the tribe's ancestors, rather than bravely accept uncertainty."" (262) Wait. What about ancient Democritus, patriarch of the materialism, being right about atomic reality, which was counter-intuitive, and that magnificent list of heroes upon whose shoulders we sit (chapters 1-4)? Does Rovelli really have no mechanism for seeing the parallel? Ah well. The biggest awkward elephant in the room is of course that he doesn't really bother speculating where atoms come from. The closest he comes to saying where our current atoms come from is The Big Bounce (206-07), but it is funny for him to spend so much time talking about how the universe is finite only to gently acknowledge it is also eternal."

This one is probably the most incomprehensible of all that I’ve read on the subject of quantum physics so far, though, admittedly, it is also very skillfully written. Beautifully woven phrases intermingle with claims, terms and equations that I’m not equipped to understand. Even though it is still a pop-science book, on the spectrum of pop-science literature it is quite far removed from Michio Kaku’s light writing (e.g. Parallel Worlds: A Journey through Creation, Higher Dimensions, and the Future of the Cosmos) and much closer to Brian Cox’s level of detail (The Quantum Universe: Everything That Can Happen Does Happen), though Cox’s book was made even more obscure than it had to be by weird thought experiments meant to make it easier for the reader to visualise things, and failing. Rovelli doesn’t bother with thought experiments, he just ‘says it as it is’ in grand style.By no means am I trying to say that reading this book was a waste of my time. Quite the contrary, I did get a slightly better insight to how physicists think, even if I failed – as usual – to comprehend the essentials. Also, this book is the first one I’ve read that talks about an alternative hypothesis to the popular string theory: the loop theory, Rovelli’s (and others) intellectual child. Perhaps the lack of infinite universes makes it less cool in people’s eyes, but I find it comforting that there may not be, after all, countless other ‘mes’ capable of screwing up in innumerable ways!"

Carlo Rovelli has done a remarkable job to put down such complicated concepts into simple, easy to understand language. One of best thing about book is style of connecting all the dots throughout history, right from Democritus's theory of atoms in 400BC to Quantum gravity loop in modern era. Definitely, a must-read for anyone who loves Physics."

But this, this whole book is exactly what I have been looking for for very nearly the past ten years. It opens with a very brief (well, not too brief; it does take about half of what is actually a very short book) overview of classical physics, then general and special relativity, then quantum mechanics, and then dives right in to the heart of the matter: quantum gravity, or loop gravity, or loop quantum gravity; even Rovelli seems to use the terms interchangeably. The writing style was amazing. Fantastic. So light and breezy and conversational. Funny, even (there's really - and I am convinced of this - a ""The name of that man? Albert Einstein."" joke somewhere in chapter 2, and I lost my mind laughing), but still concise. The reader was great; his emphasis was spot-on. I'm half-tempted to listen to it over again and I wish my to-read list wasn't so long because I genuinely would. I enjoyed it that much.I won't lie - I didn't... quite catch on.At no point during this did I feel confused. At all. In fact, I almost feel like maybe the way Rovelli explained quantum gravity seemed... too easy? Space is granular, check. I follow. Time is what happens because we can't understand everything that's happening all the time. That's highly speculative and still, check, I gotcha, I follow. But if you wanted me to tell you what you what quantum gravity is right now? I'm not sure I could. Maybe that's okay though. Maybe that's okay because this is the first book like this - or at least the first one I've been able to get my hands on - and soon I'll be able to devour books on loop quantum gravity the same way I had the chance to eat up string theory before I realized that the point that it was getting to was indeed no point at all (I had to get one in there, so sue me). Maybe Carlo Rovelli is the Brian Greene of quantum gravity. I sure hope so. I could use a lot more books like this."

Statements like the one I used in the epigraph, about human infinite ignorance, resonate with me. I teach mathematics at a university, I have quite an extensive exposure to classical physics, yet my ignorance about modern physics is certainly limitless. (By the way, there is no better way to understand the vastness of one's ignorance than being a professor.)While I will not rate this book by Dr. Rovelli as a masterpiece like 
Seven Brief Lessons on Physics
, it is still a great read and I have learned a lot from it - not only about my lack of knowledge. The author begins with a story about Anaximander of Miletus (450 BCE) whose work contributed to the foundations of Western science and philosophy.  ""The Milesians understand that by shrewdly using observation and reason, rather than searching for answers in fantasy, ancient myths, or religion - and above all by using critical thought in a discriminating way - it is possible to repeatedly correct our worldview and to discover new aspects of reality that are hidden to the common view.""  Progressing through time, we read about Democritus, then through Copernicus, Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, we follow the evolution of human models of reality. Then come Einstein, Heisenberg, Bohr, Dirac - fathers of the modern physics - and we arrive at the ""two pillars of twentieth-century physics - general relativity and quantum mechanics."" General relativity is ""a simple and coherent vision of gravity, space, and time."" Quantum mechanics unveils the three aspects of reality: ""granularity, indeterminism, and relationality.""Part Three, Quantum Space and Relational Time is to me the most fascinating part of the book. General relativity and quantum mechanics, ""the two jewels that the twentieth century has left us,"" seem to contradict each other. ""They cannot both be true, at least not in their present forms."" Chapters 5 through 7 provide an introduction to the loop quantum gravity theory in whose development the author has played one of the key roles.  ""[...] the world described by the theory is far from the one we are familiar with. There is no longer space that ""contains"" the world, and no longer time ""during the course of which"" events occur.""  Part Four, Beyond Space and Time, discusses such aspects of cosmology as Big Bang and black holes. I found the chapter Information the most illuminating. Information is defined as the number of possible alternatives, connections to Boltzmann's statistical mechanics are shown, and the author presents yet another crucial idea - thermal time and its connection with the concept of irreversibility. The author's succinct summary is stunning:  ""Time is an effect of our overlooking the physical microstates of things. Time is the information we don't have. Time is our ignorance.""  I absolutely love the powerful final chapter, Mystery, with its convincing argument why nothing but science can be reliable:  ""The answers given by science [...] are not reliable because they are definitive. They are reliable because they are not definitive.  This is the most powerful argument I have ever heard against all kinds of mumbo-jumbo that ignores science, which is particularly important in the times of a pandemic. The author provides two fascinating historical vignettes: the first about a ""race"" to formalize Einstein's theory between David Hilbert, one of the most famous mathematicians in history, and Albert Einstein. The other vignette is about a little known Belgian priest, Georges Lemaître, who showed that both Einstein in his skepticism about the expansion of the universe as well as pope Pius XII in his declaration that the Big Bang confirms the account of Creation given in Genesis were wrong.Fascinating read!Four-and-a-quarter stars."
92,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4277032-d,5,"I wholeheartedly agree with Manny's review.Applying Occam's razor clearly favors Loop Quantum Gravity (LCG) theory over String theory with its 11 or more dimensions. Amazingly, dropping the 'background' of empty space and time as basic notions simplifies obtaining LCG as a theory that makes General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics compatible. There are even some cosmological experiments that could test LCG: e.g. observing a black hole that expands again (bounces back) would suggest that space/matter is granular, making everything finite, again simplifying matters considerably, it seems. However this experiment shows that, if true, the size of a matter/space quantum should be really small: 10-48m (10 to the power of -48), much smaller than the Planck scale."

I have mixed feelings about the book. Rovelli's prose is quite poetic at times (and perhaps a little damaged in translation from the Italian). I found the historical background quite clear, but when he got to describing quantum gravity, and how space/time do not exist at the most basic level I was lost. That's a shame, because it's the most interesting part of the book. It would also have been nice to have a somewhat broader view of the rest of physics (e.g., String Theory; how does Dark Matter or Dark Energy fit in?). I was also a bit disturbed to read in other reviews that the form of Quantum Gravity being presented here is only the flavor that Rovelli is working on and he has left out other competing versions, which view time quite differently.Finally, and most annoyingly, large chunks of text are reused almost word for word from his previous book Seven Brief Lessons on Physics. If you have read the first, you have already third-to-half of this one (hence 2-stars)."

For decades, the only approach dominating to resolve the grand unification problem was the string theory and if like me you saw Brian Greene's dramatically made TV documentary then you might have been fooled into believing we have indeed solved it. But when our friendly particle collider @ Geneva, didn't throw out a bunch of predicted supersymmetric particles, the long suspected truth came into the reality that - String theory is not the last word! In contrast to string theory, LQG has been steadily building up and has found much stronger footing. Carlo starts from antiquity in ancient Greece to the original apple guy Newton and to our generation's greatest genius maverick Einstein, before introducing LQG.

98,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22241323-judy,3,"Rovelli tells the reader that he’s written with a particular reader in mind: someone who knows little or nothing about today’s physics but is curious to find out what we know, as well as what we don’t yet understand, about the elementary weave of the world. (p 8)I need to acknowledge that Physics has never been my favorite branch of science. However, I've always been intrigued by how Physicists think, so when my niece gave this book 3-stars and said it was ""pretty good,"" I decided to give it a try. I'm reading her copy of the book, so I can't write in it, but I am noting quite a few page numbers, most of which indicate something I want to give some thought. This isn’t going to be a review but rather a list of ideas that are food for thought (to me anyway).p 21: Our life is a combination of atoms, our thoughts are made up of thin atoms, our dreams are the products of atoms; our hopes and our emotions are written in a language formed by combinations of atoms; …That is true at a very fundamental level. (Thin atoms?)p 29: The definitive proof of the ‘atomic hypothesis’ had to wait until 1905. It was found by a rebellious 25 year-old who had studied physics but had not been able to find employment as a scientist …Einstein, of course.p 33: The closure of the ancient schools such as those of Athens and Alexandria, and the destruction of all the texts not in accordance with Christian ideas was vast and systematic …Apparently Plato and Aristotle were viewed as pagans. Democritus was even “worse.” I’d like to read more about these ancient thinkers.p 39: In the world of Democritus as sung by Lucretius -There is no fear of the gods; … There is a deep love of nature, a serene immersion within it; a recognition that we are profoundly part of it; that men, women, animals, plants, and clouds are organic threads of a marvelous whole, without hierarchies.In the Biological or Chemical use of the word, clouds wouldn’t be considered organic, … but this is a Physicist writing. (I think I like Democritus.)p 44: Mathematics allows the world to be described and the future to be predicted.Oh, my!p 47: A reminder:Experimental science begins with Galileo. His experiment is simple: he lets objects fall … and seeks to measure precisely their falling speed.p 69: I don't know enough to appreciate statements such as this one.Newton’s mechanics are not compatible with the existence of a fundamental velocity, because what enters Newton’s equations is acceleration, not velocity.p 81: Einstein, in an “extraordinary stroke of genius” asks:What if Newton’s space is nothing more than the gravitational field? This extremely simple, beautiful, brilliant idea is the theory of general relativity.The words are straightforward, but I can’t appreciate the significance.p 93: For Einstein, the theory of general relativity is a mental image of the world arduously translated into equations.And here’s another idea that seems really important, but I don’t fully grasp.p 153: Rovelli made a valiant attempt at explaining the scale of matter that is the subject of this book … and it surpasses my imagination.It is at this extremely minute scale that quantum gravity manifests itself. To give an idea of the smallness of the scale we are discussing: if we enlarged a walnut shell until it had become as big as the whole observable universe, we would still not see the Planck length. Even after having been enormously magnified thus, it would still be a million times smaller than the actual walnut shell was before magnification. At this scale, space and time change their nature. The become something different; they become ‘quantum space and time.’p 172:  Quanta of gravity are not in space; they are themselves space.Whew! That’s a lot to take in.p 176: If I wanted to pursue time travel, I suspect that I would need a solid understanding of these ideas:Time emerges, like space, from the quantum gravitational field. … The moment we take quantum mechanics into account, we recognize that time too must have those aspects of probabilistic indeterminacy, granularity, and relationality, which are common to all of reality. It becomes a ‘time’ markedly different from all that we have hitherto meant by the word.p 192: Here’s something that both blows me away and strikes me as totally incomprehensible.Every cubic centimeter of space, and every second that passes, is the result of this dancing foam of extremely small quanta. …. Light is formed by quanta of a field; space is nothing more than a field, which is also made of quanta; and time emerges from the processes of this same field. In other words, the world is made entirely from quantum fields.p 225: Ahh, something I do understand (at least to some extent):Stephen Hawking theoretically deduced that black holes are “hot.” They behave like hot bodies: they emit heat. In doing so, they lose energy and hence mass (since energy and mass are the same thing), becoming progressively smaller. They “evaporate.”. This is Hawking’s most important discovery.Maybe, if I read this another three or four or five or … times, just maybe I could summarize the big ideas. But I can’t do that now."
99,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"I had come across references to Carlo Rovelli previously, probably in the books I read by Lee Smolin, so when I saw this come into the library I was interested in checking it out. Rovelli is a leader in research into the ""Loop Quantum Gravity"" approach to fundamental physics, and this book describes that perspective in fairly simple non-mathematical terms, rather than in depth. The book is aimed at the layperson with little knowledge of physics, so it takes the historical approach starting with Democritus and explaining the differences between Newton, relativity and quantum mechanics before getting into the new story. (I hadn't known that LQG was actually first proposed in the early thirties by a Soviet physicist Matvei Bronstejn, who was murdered by Stalin in 1938.) Rovelli represents LQG as the most conservative of the approaches to quantum gravity, being based only on synthesizing general relativity, Standard Model quantum theory and thermodynamics rather than postulating new extra dimensions and totally unknown entities such as strings and branes as string theorists do. Nevertheless it is very radical in what it proposes: that rather than the world existing in space and time, space and time are constructed from the interactions of atomic quantum events. (Atomic in the sense of ""indivisible"", not as in the modern sense of nucleus and electrons; these ""atomic"" quanta of space are millions of time smaller than an atom.) His description of the theory was more understandable than the description by Smolin in the earlier Three Roads to Quantum Gravity, I think partly because the theory has become more developed in the meantime. (This book was published in 2014 in Italian, but since the text mentions the discovery of gravity waves last year it was obviously revised for the English translation.) Of course, without the mathematics I couldn't really understand it (and with the mathematics I certainly couldn't have understood it) but it did give an idea of what the theory is about. Judging by Smolin and Rovelli, LQG theorists are better philosophers than string theorists are; I'm not sure whether that's good or bad for a physicist's reputation."

It is, however, my first book on loop quantum gravity, and on that level I acknowledge myself speechless. Time is destroyed. Matter is presented as spinfoam, which is even stranger than it sounds. And there are some aspects on information theory I don't think I had heard before, either (then again, information theory gives me headaches, mostly when applied to black holes, so I might have missed out on stuff there earlier). Well. Surprising to say the least. One would think there would have been an announcement or something. The first hundred or so pages are an easy read, as a historical overview of the progress from Democritus to Einstein. From then onwards it becomes a bit of a struggle. I managed to read the historical overview in a day and it took me two weeks to go through the other hundred and fifty pages. I almost gave up twice. However, if you are interested in the subject, have some foreknowledge and you hang on to it you will probably get to it in the end. Personally I think I am going to need a second book on the subject after this introduction. Not sure if am seeking a second explanation or a second medical opinion, really, but the theory does seem worth exploring more in depth."

WHAT?!Do things that happen in nature require a cause in order to be properly explained? The answer to this was a resounding yes back in the days of Newton. This seems rather straightforward and our intuitions back it up. But what we are now finding out from quantum gravity is utterly shocking, and a blow to the cause-and-effect paradigm that helps us make sense of our world. This is a book about the fundamental nature of the universe: what is reality? What is reality made out of? How does it relate with what we know? What does reality mean for our own existence? Why did the universe bang into existence? Will the universe be there forever? What is forever anyway?Once someone thinks things through, then it becomes easy to understand what they are saying because they'll be able to tell you something that is condensed. The author has properly thought through the concepts that explain reality and in this book he summarizes them very well. I had no trouble understanding what he was saying up until the last chapter on Information Theory, but that's okay because he said the theory is not yet solidified. Aside from simplicity, it was also beautiful.It seems that the theories are pointing towards a non-dualistic structure of nature. I hope someday we'll have a grand theory that explains everything.The truth is in the depths. — Democritus"

I thoroughly enjoyed this introduction to the theory behind loop quantum gravity. I thought the author, Carlo Rovelli, did an excellent job of illustrating some complex theoretical physics in a manner that is easy for anybody to understand, whether you are a physics pro or you have very little background in or aptitude for physics. To do this feat, Rovelli started way back in the beginning, way back in Ancient Greece, with Aristotle and Archimedes, and he revisited Greece many times throughout the book. He took a great deal of the book to explain the physics of Einstein in a way that made it even more clear to me, even though I’ve studied relativity before, and the same with the quantum revolution. Rovelli introduced quantum gravity with a high level discussion fit for everybody, flowing language to make it slide down easy, and some excellent illustrations. Although the concepts are difficult and theoretical in nature, the poetic illustrations Rovelli provided made these ideas tangible for anyone to grasp. I listened to the audio version, which was very well done. "

105,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,5,"It is always a pleasure when one comes across a book such as this. Theoretical physicist Rovelli, who works in the area relating to Quantum Gravity, goes out of his way to introduce key concepts of his chosen discipline, and successfully manages to communicate its mysteries to us laypersons in language that is clear and informative. We are all made wiser and more appreciative as a result.Rovelli sees his current profession as being the result of a history of ideas about the nature of reality, and he lightly traces out this history, quickly arrives at the Miletians (Thales, Anaximander, etc) and then circa 450 BCE on to Leucippus and his young disciple Democritus and the idea of atomism. In a sense, the stage is now set for the development of further ideas that will ultimately result in Quantum theory and Quantum mechanics. Rovelli traces the acceptance, denial, dismissal, revival of these and associated ideas in a sweeping through-the-centuries overview that is exciting and adventurous, and we soon arrive at Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, and then Einstein and all the other associated physicists we may be more knowledgeable about today.Each step along the way is spelled out clearly and simply. Of course, this is not to say that the reader necessarily understands all the possible implications, but we do begin to see the links between: Space, Time and Spacetime; Particles and Fields; how Spacetime and Fields link to form Covariant Fields; and Fields and Particles combine to form Quantum Fields; and ultimately how Quantum Fields and Spacetime unite to form the “single ingredient”, Covariant Quantum Fields, which Rovelli considers to be the answer to the question “What is the word made of?”This is the conclusion that the author comes to, and his arguments form the rationale of the first three parts of this book. At the same time, he is aware that this view is not necessarily the accepted view of every physicist. His understanding based on loop-theory/loop-quantum-gravity suggests that at the very deepest level his research has lead him, time might very well not exist, nor even particles or quanta (he uses terms such as “Spacetime sushi” and “Spinfoams”) — the suspicion, perhaps, that we may all need to reconsider and/or reevaluate the validity of all current models of reality.Yet Rovelli pushes the envelope even more in Part Four, which is entitled “Beyond Space and Time”, where he explores other issues such as Beyond the Big Bang, Quantum Cosmology, Quantum Black Holes, and the End of Infinity. His final chapter is entitled “Mystery”, where he essentially reminds his readers that there remain more and more unknowns that need to be explored.For the cynics among us (and I would consider myself to be partial to the odd cynicism at times!) all the above is just a load of speculative bull that has no relevance whatever to “real” reality, i.e. what we might call the “four dimensional” Space-Time Continuum. This is the “place” where we as individuals need to position ourselves and negotiate our way about in order to survive and live our lives as happily as possible. Even on this level the title of this book (“Reality Is Not What It Seems”) makes sense — we can be deceived and/or misled by our senses (and even, sometimes, by our intelligence) with very unfortunate results… It could be that thinking too deeply on the “nature” of physical reality is not good for our health and well-being — pretty much the same as, say, for people suffering from schizophrenia or paranoia, or even for a whole slew of physiological, social, religious and psychological reasons: they believe that their experiences are real: for them Reality is exactly what it seems!Whatever one might think about this, it doesn’t mean that this book must needs be dismissed. If you want to know what Quantum Gravity physicists are on about, then this book strikes me as being a very good place to start."

There's a little bit of maths, but nothing that ought to daunt anyone who did maths in high-school and still remembers it, but mostly it's just a wonderfully written, and incredibly informative narrative.The original text was written in Italian and has been translated, and I could not help reading most of it with an Italian accent.

And somehow for reasons unexplained, being a quantum physicist gives him the means by which to apply the scientific method to all moral questions whatever, where ""it makes little sense to ask whether a half-cut fingernail is still 'me,' or has become 'not-me' . . . or precisely when a child's life begins."" If there is always universal uncertainty for any question whatever, which Rovelli clearly does not confine to questions of science, then by what standard can you judge any action or any belief? "

All the tests, last 100 years, have proven general relativity and quantum mechanics correct. The problem happens when we look at extremes they can't be both correct. Especially gravity. Quantum gravity removes infinity, removes singularity and takes Democritus to the word. Basic component of space is the ATOM. And it is the size of the Planck length. As for time, there is not time, there is entropy."

112,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32544970-raf,5,"✨✨⭐ 10 out of 10 ⭐✨✨I just found my new favourite popular science author after Michio Kaku. I love Rovelli's writing so much! ❤️❤️❤️ Keywords: popular science, physics, astronomy, cosmology, general relativity, loop quantum gravity, big bounce   ""The curiousity to learn, to discover, to look over the next hill, the desire to taste the apple; these are the things which make us human.""   REVIEW  Have you ever heard about Big Bounce? It's an alternate theory to Big Bang, that maybe the universe as we know it is a result of contracting and expanding explosion. Reality is Not What it Seems, tells about this theory and the theory that become the core of big bounce: loop quantum gravity. Loop quantum gravity is a theory that will unite relativity and quantum mechanics, two which are very opposite of each other.  The Explanation is Easy to Understand  This book is written in very clear and slow explanations. Things are explained in layman terms, that even people who doesn't know physics will understand. His topic escalate slowly, from the foundation to the hardest part of the theory. From what is atoms, to what is field, gravitation, time, universe and so on escalate until quantum loop gravity. He often compares today's scientific theories with philosophies from ancient time; mentioned ancient philosophers and tells us their contribution to building of nowadays's science. There are many new insights I didn't know before and albeit the topic of quantum loop gravity itself very hard, I can quite grasp the bigger picture due to this book.  I love his humility  I also love how Carlo Rovelli is very humble. He always mentioned that he himself is not certain. Do not believe something with blind faith because our scientific knowledges have a limit and what we thought is true may be proven otherwise later. He encourage scientific thinking, that is to never fear of learning and unlearning things that we know. Conclusion  The topic of this book is very specific so unless you really curious about it you might not enjoy it. But the explanation is easy to understand so you don't need to fear that it will be hard to read. I recommend this to those who want to know more about astronomy, astrophysics, or physics itself in general.   ""Science is continual exploration of ways of thinking. Its strength is its visionary capacity to demolish preconceived ideas, to reveal new regions of reality, and to construct novel and more effective images of the world. This adventure rests upon the entirety of past knowledge, but at its heart is change. The world is boundless and iridescent, we want to go and see it. We are immersed in its mystery and in its beauty, and over the horizon there is unexplored territory. The incompleteness and the uncertainty of our knowledges, our precariousness, suspended over the abyss of the immensity of what we don't know, doesn't render life meaningless, it makes it interesting and precious.""

113,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"Carlo Rovelli's first book (aside from 7 Brief Lessons...), Reality is Not What it Seems, is a beautiful narrative regarding the foundational human conceptions of the fabric of reality ranging from Democritus and Anaximander's conception of the apeiron (""the primal substance of which everything is formed"") and concluding at the precipice of modern theoretic physics: Quantum Gravity. Rovelli begins by setting the stage of modern theoretical physics by first introducing the historical conceptions of the nature of reality, discussing ideas from ancient minds such as Democritus, Lucretius, and Anaximander who together postulated an astoundingly clarivoyant theory that everything was comprised of super-small components called ""atoms"" (humanity would have to wait for proof of such a claim until 1905). With a brief digression into some pleasing philosophical musings of the aforementioned thinkers, necessitated by the inability to test any of these theories, Rovelli moves on to explain the original of classical mechanics.Moving forwards in time (inside joke-- read the book!), Rovelli elegantly and relevantly presents the origins of several seminal ideas in classical mechanics like gravity (Galileo + Newton) planetary motion (Copernicus & Newton), the mathematical foundations upon which such theories were based (Plato/Aristotle/Pythagoras/etc - that physical processes could be modeled with mathematics), and the physical and philosophical implications of the new ways of thinking about the world. Not even a few centuries go by before Faraday, Maxwell, and their co-intellectuals of the 1800s arrive on the scene and postulate the notion of an ""Electro-Magnetic Field"", solving some of the greatest mysteries about the forces of electricity and magnetism by presenting a mathematical model of particles and fields that move through space and time. Upon the shoulders of such great conceivers, Einstein publishes a series of seminal papers that almost literally invoke a formal conception of ""atomic physics"", or ""particle physics""-- not only does Einstein prove that atoms exist, he also proves (via irrefutable mathematical models that predict reality down to the ump-teenth decimal place) that time is not consistent for all matter within space, AND that space and time themselves may be constituted by the notion of a Gravitational Field (with a stroke of genius, he applies Maxwell's conception of fields and particles to gravity!). The descriptions of special relativity, quantum mechanics, and general relativity are all eloquently and concisely explained by Rovelli, thus I choose to not digress here into any explanation of such awesome theories of reality and instead implore you to read the book! Throughout this section, short digressions into the theories and contributions of seminal quantum physicists such as Dirac, Heisenberg, Bohr, Wheeler, Feyman, etc., are discussed for support and insight for the nuanced non-intuitive conceptions of reality portrayed. This section is concluded with a thorough yet concise explanation of the three pillars of quantum mechanics: granularity, indeterminacy, and relationality. Perhaps the most intriguing of which to me was the notion that our universe is finite-but-without-boundaries: Einstein conceived of such a property of the universe with the notion of a 3-sphere-- yet again I implore you to read the book!The 3rd section of the book and, in my opinion, crown jewel, is focused on an elaboration of the theory of Quantum Gravity. Without diving too deep, in an attempt to let Rovelli's art stand on its own: The theory of quantum gravity, along with its components (loop theory, spin-networks, spinfoam, etc), is an incredibly intriguing conception of physical reality with which a quantum-field theory of spacetime is theorized. No longer is space some inert container, but is comprised of quanta and the relationships between them; No longer is time a parameter to the functions and equations of such a physics, but is simply the evolution of the relations of said quanta! A human's conception of space and time emerge as the manifestation of the evolution of such relationships between the inconceivably small quanta (particles) of the quantum field of space time itself-- such quanta are not IN space, nor are they evolving IN time: the quanta and their relationships ARE space, and their (indeterminate) evolutions PRODUCE the conception of time. Admittedly, I had to re-read chapters of this section due to the non-intuitive nature of such a conception of reality; But, I reread them because I wanted to, and was so deeply intrigued by the subject matter during the first pass that I felt compelled to go back and read this section (all 50 pages) a second time around in an attempt to understand it better. I, like Rovelli, believe that to understand a theory in any scientific domain, one must first become familiar with the ""episteme"" (- Foucault) or underlying scientific and philosophical framework from whence the theories came; Thus, I thoroughly enjoyed the progression of the book, and the attention to detail that Rovelli gave to ancient (Greek) conceptions of what reality might be comprised, and how these conceptions evolved through the centuries, discovered or invented by the great minds such as Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, Einstein, and now, quantum gravity theorists! I finished this book with a greater holistic understanding of ways in which to think about physical reality, and excitedly: a potential theory that might traverse the chasm between general relativity and quantum mechanics!Rovelli concludes the book by pushing even further into the unknown. He first discusses how the new theory of Quantum Gravity is being tested, confirming certain theories about the inception (or continuation) of our universe (think: The Big Bang... or, The Big Bounce!), and how it may play large role in the future of astronomy, ultimately better describing our universe at a macro scale than general relativity does! Venturing even further, Rovelli postulates interesting techniques for interpreting still-confounding aspects of reality with ideas such as the potential application of information theory to quantum mechanics, how time might be best quantified by (and even integrated mathematically into) thermodynamic phenomena, and how the notion of infinity (within any conception of physical reality) might have a place after all: reality might be truly be finite, at the most foundational level.I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did. It has presented to me a world of ideas-- the greater understanding of which I will pursue for the rest of my life-- in addition to the universe of ways (hopefully a finite 3-sphere) in which to better conceive reality."
114,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38087945-farha-crystal,4,"Are we so imprisoned in our consciousness, like the slaves in Plato's Cave, can't break loose of our chains?I can never make peace with Zeno's paradox. Oh! Rovelli, for peace and order's sake, can you please at least talk some sweet words to forget my misery for the chaos driven by Zeno's paradox? :) The concept of Infinity, as well as time, is only our ignorance, our limitations. In this book, Rovelli talks about the basic ideas behind loop quantum gravity, considering the feature of granularity, indeterminacy and probabilistic behavior. Loop quantum gravity, tries to combine general relativity with quantum field theory. In the world of Quantum Gravity, the principle of cause and effect no longer holds. Space, particles, quanta only exist when they interact only probabilistically. The book does not get into any quantitative detail for the knowledgeable reader but maybe it can at least provide the outline for the laypersons. It doesn't matter if complex issues like loop quantum gravity or superstrings are best possible answers for the intense situations like blackhole or the beginning of our known universe but this book is a poem. In fact, when Rovelli recites his poem I couldn't stop myself to put his beautiful lyrics into my mouth and suck it like a strawberry. He plays the chord of esoteric quantum gravity in an amazing way that the music infused through my veins to mandate a cosmic orgasm. :)Favorite line:  ""It is only in interactions that nature draws the world."" "
115,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40566664-knowlton-murphy,4,"A book on quantum physics for dumb people! Right up my alley. I do not have a brain for math or physics, so I am deeply indebted to the kind of work Rovelli has produced. I am absolutely sure I did not understand everything, but it was a fun and thought-provoking ride, and the fact that I understood anything is more a mark of Rovelli's skill in communication than my own acuity. The book is worth reading for its summary of the history of physics, and for its accessible explanation of quantum gravity. Rovelli, in general, writes clearly, and entertainingly. My favorite aspect of loop theory is its central prediction that ""...space is not a continuum, it is not divisible ad infinitum, it is formed of 'atoms of space'..."" (168) That is, ""...arbitrarily small chunks of space do not exist. There is a lower limit to the divisibility of space."" (169) What do you know. As a Christian, this is an interesting point because of its theological value: it draws that much more of a distinction between Creator and Created. Finitude is woven into the fabric of our created existence. There is nothing physical we can look to that compares to the infinitude of God. As a human with practical concerns in daily life, this matches my experience of life...I don't have to traverse an infinity of atomic infinities to reach my mug of tea. I can finally stop thinking about swift Achilles chasing that slow tortoise, forever doomed to fail! My second favorite concept is that of reality being relational. It is something I have thought about culturally in seeking to understand my own culture, but Rovelli helped me think about the relational nature of reality beyond the sociological sense. Again, this raised a theological point for me. As a Christian of my particular theological convictions, it makes sense to see the world in terms of relationships, because I believe God is a Trinity, a being who exists eternally in relationship.I was fascinated by Rovelli's guidance through the history of physics. It was cool to see how Democritus' idea of atomic/granular reality has become so validated. I do think that his atomic worldview is nightmarish, though:""There is no finality, no purpose, in this endless dance of atoms. We, just like the rest of the natural world, are one of many products of this infinite dance--the product, that is, of an accidental combination...Our life is a combination of atoms, our thoughts are made up of thin atoms, our dreams are the products of atoms; our hopes and our emotions are written in a language formed by combinations of atoms, which bring us images."" (21, summary by Rovelli)Rovelli returns to Democritus in his penultimate chapter to point out that ""...it is not just a question of these atoms but also of the order in which they are arranged...We are not atoms: we are orders in which atoms are arranged, capable of mirroring other atoms and mirroring ourselves."" (256) For me, this raises a cause for concern. Rovelli can speak romantically about human nature all he wants, but the only hope any of us have for reflecting the kind of good humanity he envisions is for our atoms to order themselves properly. Which according to Democritus is completely subject to accidental chance. Rovelli says atoms can think about themselves (256). This is quite a leap to me, but Rovelli manages it with graceful ease. Random accidents of atomic chance not only create the ordered world I inhabit, but align in such a way to lead to my sentient experience of it...seven billion times over. But I am not a theoretical physicist, so perhaps I just don't have enough faith. Speaking of faith, Rovelli has a flawed view of religion. He seems to think that the role of religion is primarily that of comfort for people who cannot bear the harsh nature of reality. He never suspects that people might be interested in religion as a means of pursuing truth. ""Ignorance can be scary. Out of fear, we tell ourselves calming stories: up there beyond the stars there is an enchanted garden, with a gentle father who will welcome us into his arms. It doesn't matter if it's true--it is reassuring."" Precisely what is reassuring about this system? This isn't historic Christianity, for example, which by and large holds sacred texts like 1 John 1:1-4 and 2 Peter 1:16 (which appeal to the reality of eyewitness as a grounds for believing in truth) or 1 Timothy 4:7 (which specifically tells us to not waste time with myths). Rather, Rovelli is describing existentialism...looking at the absurdity of our existence and seeking comfort in a fabricated view of reality, all the while knowing deep down that it is a lie. Incidentally, that's exactly what Rovelli does. He is convinced that men are not made ""...to live like brutes, but to seek virtue and knowledge"" (263-64, quote from Dante), but never bothers explaining why.Rovelli repeatedly says he wants to keep an open mind in case he is wrong. Clearly his idea of open-mindedness could never entertain supernaturality, though, so one wonders how genuine his claim is, especially in a world where materialists are minorities. Ironically, one of his suggestions for why people choose to be religious is that they ""...prefer to believe in a story just because it was believed by the tribe's ancestors, rather than bravely accept uncertainty."" (262) Wait. What about ancient Democritus, patriarch of the materialism, being right about atomic reality, which was counter-intuitive, and that magnificent list of heroes upon whose shoulders we sit (chapters 1-4)? Does Rovelli really have no mechanism for seeing the parallel? Ah well. The biggest awkward elephant in the room is of course that he doesn't really bother speculating where atoms come from. The closest he comes to saying where our current atoms come from is The Big Bounce (206-07), but it is funny for him to spend so much time talking about how the universe is finite only to gently acknowledge it is also eternal."

This one is probably the most incomprehensible of all that I’ve read on the subject of quantum physics so far, though, admittedly, it is also very skillfully written. Beautifully woven phrases intermingle with claims, terms and equations that I’m not equipped to understand. Even though it is still a pop-science book, on the spectrum of pop-science literature it is quite far removed from Michio Kaku’s light writing (e.g. Parallel Worlds: A Journey through Creation, Higher Dimensions, and the Future of the Cosmos) and much closer to Brian Cox’s level of detail (The Quantum Universe: Everything That Can Happen Does Happen), though Cox’s book was made even more obscure than it had to be by weird thought experiments meant to make it easier for the reader to visualise things, and failing. Rovelli doesn’t bother with thought experiments, he just ‘says it as it is’ in grand style.By no means am I trying to say that reading this book was a waste of my time. Quite the contrary, I did get a slightly better insight to how physicists think, even if I failed – as usual – to comprehend the essentials. Also, this book is the first one I’ve read that talks about an alternative hypothesis to the popular string theory: the loop theory, Rovelli’s (and others) intellectual child. Perhaps the lack of infinite universes makes it less cool in people’s eyes, but I find it comforting that there may not be, after all, countless other ‘mes’ capable of screwing up in innumerable ways!"

But this, this whole book is exactly what I have been looking for for very nearly the past ten years. It opens with a very brief (well, not too brief; it does take about half of what is actually a very short book) overview of classical physics, then general and special relativity, then quantum mechanics, and then dives right in to the heart of the matter: quantum gravity, or loop gravity, or loop quantum gravity; even Rovelli seems to use the terms interchangeably. The writing style was amazing. Fantastic. So light and breezy and conversational. Funny, even (there's really - and I am convinced of this - a ""The name of that man? Albert Einstein."" joke somewhere in chapter 2, and I lost my mind laughing), but still concise. The reader was great; his emphasis was spot-on. I'm half-tempted to listen to it over again and I wish my to-read list wasn't so long because I genuinely would. I enjoyed it that much.I won't lie - I didn't... quite catch on.At no point during this did I feel confused. At all. In fact, I almost feel like maybe the way Rovelli explained quantum gravity seemed... too easy? Space is granular, check. I follow. Time is what happens because we can't understand everything that's happening all the time. That's highly speculative and still, check, I gotcha, I follow. But if you wanted me to tell you what you what quantum gravity is right now? I'm not sure I could. Maybe that's okay though. Maybe that's okay because this is the first book like this - or at least the first one I've been able to get my hands on - and soon I'll be able to devour books on loop quantum gravity the same way I had the chance to eat up string theory before I realized that the point that it was getting to was indeed no point at all (I had to get one in there, so sue me). Maybe Carlo Rovelli is the Brian Greene of quantum gravity. I sure hope so. I could use a lot more books like this."

Statements like the one I used in the epigraph, about human infinite ignorance, resonate with me. I teach mathematics at a university, I have quite an extensive exposure to classical physics, yet my ignorance about modern physics is certainly limitless. (By the way, there is no better way to understand the vastness of one's ignorance than being a professor.)While I will not rate this book by Dr. Rovelli as a masterpiece like 
Seven Brief Lessons on Physics
, it is still a great read and I have learned a lot from it - not only about my lack of knowledge. The author begins with a story about Anaximander of Miletus (450 BCE) whose work contributed to the foundations of Western science and philosophy.  ""The Milesians understand that by shrewdly using observation and reason, rather than searching for answers in fantasy, ancient myths, or religion - and above all by using critical thought in a discriminating way - it is possible to repeatedly correct our worldview and to discover new aspects of reality that are hidden to the common view.""  Progressing through time, we read about Democritus, then through Copernicus, Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, we follow the evolution of human models of reality. Then come Einstein, Heisenberg, Bohr, Dirac - fathers of the modern physics - and we arrive at the ""two pillars of twentieth-century physics - general relativity and quantum mechanics."" General relativity is ""a simple and coherent vision of gravity, space, and time."" Quantum mechanics unveils the three aspects of reality: ""granularity, indeterminism, and relationality.""Part Three, Quantum Space and Relational Time is to me the most fascinating part of the book. General relativity and quantum mechanics, ""the two jewels that the twentieth century has left us,"" seem to contradict each other. ""They cannot both be true, at least not in their present forms."" Chapters 5 through 7 provide an introduction to the loop quantum gravity theory in whose development the author has played one of the key roles.  ""[...] the world described by the theory is far from the one we are familiar with. There is no longer space that ""contains"" the world, and no longer time ""during the course of which"" events occur.""  Part Four, Beyond Space and Time, discusses such aspects of cosmology as Big Bang and black holes. I found the chapter Information the most illuminating. Information is defined as the number of possible alternatives, connections to Boltzmann's statistical mechanics are shown, and the author presents yet another crucial idea - thermal time and its connection with the concept of irreversibility. The author's succinct summary is stunning:  ""Time is an effect of our overlooking the physical microstates of things. Time is the information we don't have. Time is our ignorance.""  I absolutely love the powerful final chapter, Mystery, with its convincing argument why nothing but science can be reliable:  ""The answers given by science [...] are not reliable because they are definitive. They are reliable because they are not definitive.  This is the most powerful argument I have ever heard against all kinds of mumbo-jumbo that ignores science, which is particularly important in the times of a pandemic. The author provides two fascinating historical vignettes: the first about a ""race"" to formalize Einstein's theory between David Hilbert, one of the most famous mathematicians in history, and Albert Einstein. The other vignette is about a little known Belgian priest, Georges Lemaître, who showed that both Einstein in his skepticism about the expansion of the universe as well as pope Pius XII in his declaration that the Big Bang confirms the account of Creation given in Genesis were wrong.Fascinating read!Four-and-a-quarter stars."
122,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4277032-d,5,"I wholeheartedly agree with Manny's review.Applying Occam's razor clearly favors Loop Quantum Gravity (LCG) theory over String theory with its 11 or more dimensions. Amazingly, dropping the 'background' of empty space and time as basic notions simplifies obtaining LCG as a theory that makes General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics compatible. There are even some cosmological experiments that could test LCG: e.g. observing a black hole that expands again (bounces back) would suggest that space/matter is granular, making everything finite, again simplifying matters considerably, it seems. However this experiment shows that, if true, the size of a matter/space quantum should be really small: 10-48m (10 to the power of -48), much smaller than the Planck scale."

I have mixed feelings about the book. Rovelli's prose is quite poetic at times (and perhaps a little damaged in translation from the Italian). I found the historical background quite clear, but when he got to describing quantum gravity, and how space/time do not exist at the most basic level I was lost. That's a shame, because it's the most interesting part of the book. It would also have been nice to have a somewhat broader view of the rest of physics (e.g., String Theory; how does Dark Matter or Dark Energy fit in?). I was also a bit disturbed to read in other reviews that the form of Quantum Gravity being presented here is only the flavor that Rovelli is working on and he has left out other competing versions, which view time quite differently.Finally, and most annoyingly, large chunks of text are reused almost word for word from his previous book Seven Brief Lessons on Physics.

But when our friendly particle collider @ Geneva, didn't throw out a bunch of predicted supersymmetric particles, the long suspected truth came into the reality that - String theory is not the last word! In contrast to string theory, LQG has been steadily building up and has found much stronger footing.

(p 8)I need to acknowledge that Physics has never been my favorite branch of science.

Democritus was even “worse.” I’d like to read more about these ancient thinkers.p 39: In the world of Democritus as sung by Lucretius -There is no fear of the gods; … There is a deep love of nature, a serene immersion within it; a recognition that we are profoundly part of it; that men, women, animals, plants, and clouds are organic threads of a marvelous whole, without hierarchies.In the Biological or Chemical use of the word, clouds wouldn’t be considered organic, … but this is a Physicist writing. (I think I like Democritus.)p 44: Mathematics allows the world to be described and the future to be predicted.Oh, my!p 47: A reminder:Experimental science begins with Galileo. His experiment is simple: he lets objects fall … and seeks to measure precisely their falling speed.p 69: I don't know enough to appreciate statements such as this one.Newton’s mechanics are not compatible with the existence of a fundamental velocity, because what enters Newton’s equations is acceleration, not velocity.p 81: Einstein, in an “extraordinary stroke of genius” asks:What if Newton’s space is nothing more than the gravitational field? This extremely simple, beautiful, brilliant idea is the theory of general relativity.The words are straightforward, but I can’t appreciate the significance.p 93: For Einstein, the theory of general relativity is a mental image of the world arduously translated into equations.And here’s another idea that seems really important, but I don’t fully grasp.p 153: Rovelli made a valiant attempt at explaining the scale of matter that is the subject of this book … and it surpasses my imagination.It is at this extremely minute scale that quantum gravity manifests itself. To give an idea of the smallness of the scale we are discussing: if we enlarged a walnut shell until it had become as big as the whole observable universe, we would still not see the Planck length. Even after having been enormously magnified thus, it would still be a million times smaller than the actual walnut shell was before magnification. At this scale, space and time change their nature. The become something different; they become ‘quantum space and time.’p 172:  Quanta of gravity are not in space; they are themselves space.Whew! That’s a lot to take in.p 176: If I wanted to pursue time travel, I suspect that I would need a solid understanding of these ideas:Time emerges, like space, from the quantum gravitational field. … The moment we take quantum mechanics into account, we recognize that time too must have those aspects of probabilistic indeterminacy, granularity, and relationality, which are common to all of reality. It becomes a ‘time’ markedly different from all that we have hitherto meant by the word.p 192: Here’s something that both blows me away and strikes me as totally incomprehensible.Every cubic centimeter of space, and every second that passes, is the result of this dancing foam of extremely small quanta. …. Light is formed by quanta of a field; space is nothing more than a field, which is also made of quanta; and time emerges from the processes of this same field. In other words, the world is made entirely from quantum fields.p 225: Ahh, something I do understand (at least to some extent):Stephen Hawking theoretically deduced that black holes are “hot.” They behave like hot bodies: they emit heat. In doing so, they lose energy and hence mass (since energy and mass are the same thing), becoming progressively smaller. They “evaporate.”. This is Hawking’s most important discovery.Maybe, if I read this another three or four or five or … times, just maybe I could summarize the big ideas. But I can’t do that now."
129,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"I had come across references to Carlo Rovelli previously, probably in the books I read by Lee Smolin, so when I saw this come into the library I was interested in checking it out. Rovelli is a leader in research into the ""Loop Quantum Gravity"" approach to fundamental physics, and this book describes that perspective in fairly simple non-mathematical terms, rather than in depth. The book is aimed at the layperson with little knowledge of physics, so it takes the historical approach starting with Democritus and explaining the differences between Newton, relativity and quantum mechanics before getting into the new story. (I hadn't known that LQG was actually first proposed in the early thirties by a Soviet physicist Matvei Bronstejn, who was murdered by Stalin in 1938.) Rovelli represents LQG as the most conservative of the approaches to quantum gravity, being based only on synthesizing general relativity, Standard Model quantum theory and thermodynamics rather than postulating new extra dimensions and totally unknown entities such as strings and branes as string theorists do. Nevertheless it is very radical in what it proposes: that rather than the world existing in space and time, space and time are constructed from the interactions of atomic quantum events. (Atomic in the sense of ""indivisible"", not as in the modern sense of nucleus and electrons; these ""atomic"" quanta of space are millions of time smaller than an atom.) His description of the theory was more understandable than the description by Smolin in the earlier Three Roads to Quantum Gravity, I think partly because the theory has become more developed in the meantime. (This book was published in 2014 in Italian, but since the text mentions the discovery of gravity waves last year it was obviously revised for the English translation.) Of course, without the mathematics I couldn't really understand it (and with the mathematics I certainly couldn't have understood it) but it did give an idea of what the theory is about. Judging by Smolin and Rovelli, LQG theorists are better philosophers than string theorists are; I'm not sure whether that's good or bad for a physicist's reputation."
130,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22926162-in-s-chamarro,4,"I am a lawyer and most certainly a scientific layman, but I am determined to remain an informed fan of science and this is definitely not my first science book. Relativity I can fathom, more or less, quantum physics I am familiar with up to a certain degree, I don't know the Standard Model intimately but at least I recognize what people are talking about when they use the name, string theory I could never really follow but occasionally I keep trying, I am mostly fine with cosmology. It is, however, my first book on loop quantum gravity, and on that level I acknowledge myself speechless. Time is destroyed. Matter is presented as spinfoam, which is even stranger than it sounds. And there are some aspects on information theory I don't think I had heard before, either (then again, information theory gives me headaches, mostly when applied to black holes, so I might have missed out on stuff there earlier). Well. Surprising to say the least. One would think there would have been an announcement or something. The first hundred or so pages are an easy read, as a historical overview of the progress from Democritus to Einstein. From then onwards it becomes a bit of a struggle. I managed to read the historical overview in a day and it took me two weeks to go through the other hundred and fifty pages. I almost gave up twice. However, if you are interested in the subject, have some foreknowledge and you hang on to it you will probably get to it in the end. Personally I think I am going to need a second book on the subject after this introduction. Not sure if am seeking a second explanation or a second medical opinion, really, but the theory does seem worth exploring more in depth."

WHAT?!Do things that happen in nature require a cause in order to be properly explained? The answer to this was a resounding yes back in the days of Newton. This seems rather straightforward and our intuitions back it up. But what we are now finding out from quantum gravity is utterly shocking, and a blow to the cause-and-effect paradigm that helps us make sense of our world. This is a book about the fundamental nature of the universe: what is reality? What is reality made out of? How does it relate with what we know? What does reality mean for our own existence? Why did the universe bang into existence? Will the universe be there forever? What is forever anyway?Once someone thinks things through, then it becomes easy to understand what they are saying because they'll be able to tell you something that is condensed. The author has properly thought through the concepts that explain reality and in this book he summarizes them very well. I had no trouble understanding what he was saying up until the last chapter on Information Theory, but that's okay because he said the theory is not yet solidified. Aside from simplicity, it was also beautiful.It seems that the theories are pointing towards a non-dualistic structure of nature. I hope someday we'll have a grand theory that explains everything.The truth is in the depths. — Democritus"

I thoroughly enjoyed this introduction to the theory behind loop quantum gravity. I thought the author, Carlo Rovelli, did an excellent job of illustrating some complex theoretical physics in a manner that is easy for anybody to understand, whether you are a physics pro or you have very little background in or aptitude for physics. To do this feat, Rovelli started way back in the beginning, way back in Ancient Greece, with Aristotle and Archimedes, and he revisited Greece many times throughout the book. He took a great deal of the book to explain the physics of Einstein in a way that made it even more clear to me, even though I’ve studied relativity before, and the same with the quantum revolution. Rovelli introduced quantum gravity with a high level discussion fit for everybody, flowing language to make it slide down easy, and some excellent illustrations. Although the concepts are difficult and theoretical in nature, the poetic illustrations Rovelli provided made these ideas tangible for anyone to grasp. I listened to the audio version, which was very well done. "

Suffice to say the information was dizzying yet compelling, and if I had the mathematical ability, I'd jump head first into theoretical physics, because it aims to reveal the very nature of reality, which to me, is more fascinating than anything else."
134,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20923295-anton,5,I am in absolute awe. Best read of the year for me. More detailed review to follow.This book is incredible!
135,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,5,"It is always a pleasure when one comes across a book such as this. Theoretical physicist Rovelli, who works in the area relating to Quantum Gravity, goes out of his way to introduce key concepts of his chosen discipline, and successfully manages to communicate its mysteries to us laypersons in language that is clear and informative. We are all made wiser and more appreciative as a result.Rovelli sees his current profession as being the result of a history of ideas about the nature of reality, and he lightly traces out this history, quickly arrives at the Miletians (Thales, Anaximander, etc) and then circa 450 BCE on to Leucippus and his young disciple Democritus and the idea of atomism. In a sense, the stage is now set for the development of further ideas that will ultimately result in Quantum theory and Quantum mechanics. Rovelli traces the acceptance, denial, dismissal, revival of these and associated ideas in a sweeping through-the-centuries overview that is exciting and adventurous, and we soon arrive at Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, and then Einstein and all the other associated physicists we may be more knowledgeable about today.Each step along the way is spelled out clearly and simply. Of course, this is not to say that the reader necessarily understands all the possible implications, but we do begin to see the links between: Space, Time and Spacetime; Particles and Fields; how Spacetime and Fields link to form Covariant Fields; and Fields and Particles combine to form Quantum Fields; and ultimately how Quantum Fields and Spacetime unite to form the “single ingredient”, Covariant Quantum Fields, which Rovelli considers to be the answer to the question “What is the word made of?”This is the conclusion that the author comes to, and his arguments form the rationale of the first three parts of this book. At the same time, he is aware that this view is not necessarily the accepted view of every physicist. His understanding based on loop-theory/loop-quantum-gravity suggests that at the very deepest level his research has lead him, time might very well not exist, nor even particles or quanta (he uses terms such as “Spacetime sushi” and “Spinfoams”) — the suspicion, perhaps, that we may all need to reconsider and/or reevaluate the validity of all current models of reality.Yet Rovelli pushes the envelope even more in Part Four, which is entitled “Beyond Space and Time”, where he explores other issues such as Beyond the Big Bang, Quantum Cosmology, Quantum Black Holes, and the End of Infinity. His final chapter is entitled “Mystery”, where he essentially reminds his readers that there remain more and more unknowns that need to be explored.For the cynics among us (and I would consider myself to be partial to the odd cynicism at times!) all the above is just a load of speculative bull that has no relevance whatever to “real” reality, i.e. what we might call the “four dimensional” Space-Time Continuum. This is the “place” where we as individuals need to position ourselves and negotiate our way about in order to survive and live our lives as happily as possible. Even on this level the title of this book (“Reality Is Not What It Seems”) makes sense — we can be deceived and/or misled by our senses (and even, sometimes, by our intelligence) with very unfortunate results… It could be that thinking too deeply on the “nature” of physical reality is not good for our health and well-being — pretty much the same as, say, for people suffering from schizophrenia or paranoia, or even for a whole slew of physiological, social, religious and psychological reasons: they believe that their experiences are real: for them Reality is exactly what it seems!Whatever one might think about this, it doesn’t mean that this book must needs be dismissed. If you want to know what Quantum Gravity physicists are on about, then this book strikes me as being a very good place to start."

Now I know what the universe is made of, and how to reconcile quantum gravity with the standard model. I truly expected to be left dangling at the end of this book, which takes the reader on a beautifully written, often funny, often moving journey from the ancient greeks to modern day, building up a picture of what we understand are the building blocks of the universe. There's a little bit of maths, but nothing that ought to daunt anyone who did maths in high-school and still remembers it, but mostly it's just a wonderfully written, and incredibly informative narrative.The original text was written in Italian and has been translated, and I could not help reading most of it with an Italian accent. In parts I caught myself waving my hands around as I read it.Makes me want to go and read more by Lee Smolin now."

Rovelli says, ""I don't criticize those who prefer to believe in [Truth and certainty]"" but he says they are ""immersed in ignorance."" He says ""we don't have absolute certainty"" about reality, the hallmark of science, except for his own certainty that what is written in the ""Great Book"" is silly. And somehow for reasons unexplained, being a quantum physicist gives him the means by which to apply the scientific method to all moral questions whatever, where ""it makes little sense to ask whether a half-cut fingernail is still 'me,' or has become 'not-me' . . . or precisely when a child's life begins."" If there is always universal uncertainty for any question whatever, which Rovelli clearly does not confine to questions of science, then by what standard can you judge any action or any belief? "

All the tests, last 100 years, have proven general relativity and quantum mechanics correct. The problem happens when we look at extremes they can't be both correct. Especially gravity. Quantum gravity removes infinity, removes singularity and takes Democritus to the word. Basic component of space is the ATOM. And it is the size of the Planck length. As for time, there is not time, there is entropy."

I love Rovelli's writing so much! ❤️❤️❤️ Keywords: popular science, physics, astronomy, cosmology, general relativity, loop quantum gravity, big bounce   ""The curiousity to learn, to discover, to look over the next hill, the desire to taste the apple; these are the things which make us human.""   REVIEW  Have you ever heard about Big Bounce? It's an alternate theory to Big Bang, that maybe the universe as we know it is a result of contracting and expanding explosion. Reality is Not What it Seems, tells about this theory and the theory that become the core of big bounce: loop quantum gravity. Loop quantum gravity is a theory that will unite relativity and quantum mechanics, two which are very opposite of each other.  The Explanation is Easy to Understand  This book is written in very clear and slow explanations. Things are explained in layman terms, that even people who doesn't know physics will understand. His topic escalate slowly, from the foundation to the hardest part of the theory. From what is atoms, to what is field, gravitation, time, universe and so on escalate until quantum loop gravity. He often compares today's scientific theories with philosophies from ancient time; mentioned ancient philosophers and tells us their contribution to building of nowadays's science. There are many new insights I didn't know before and albeit the topic of quantum loop gravity itself very hard, I can quite grasp the bigger picture due to this book.  I love his humility  I also love how Carlo Rovelli is very humble. He always mentioned that he himself is not certain. Do not believe something with blind faith because our scientific knowledges have a limit and what we thought is true may be proven otherwise later. He encourage scientific thinking, that is to never fear of learning and unlearning things that we know. Conclusion  The topic of this book is very specific so unless you really curious about it you might not enjoy it. But the explanation is easy to understand so you don't need to fear that it will be hard to read. I recommend this to those who want to know more about astronomy, astrophysics, or physics itself in general.   ""Science is continual exploration of ways of thinking. Its strength is its visionary capacity to demolish preconceived ideas, to reveal new regions of reality, and to construct novel and more effective images of the world. This adventure rests upon the entirety of past knowledge, but at its heart is change. The world is boundless and iridescent, we want to go and see it. We are immersed in its mystery and in its beauty, and over the horizon there is unexplored territory. The incompleteness and the uncertainty of our knowledges, our precariousness, suspended over the abyss of the immensity of what we don't know, doesn't render life meaningless, it makes it interesting and precious.""  "
143,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"Carlo Rovelli's first book (aside from 7 Brief Lessons...), Reality is Not What it Seems, is a beautiful narrative regarding the foundational human conceptions of the fabric of reality ranging from Democritus and Anaximander's conception of the apeiron (""the primal substance of which everything is formed"") and concluding at the precipice of modern theoretic physics: Quantum Gravity. Rovelli begins by setting the stage of modern theoretical physics by first introducing the historical conceptions of the nature of reality, discussing ideas from ancient minds such as Democritus, Lucretius, and Anaximander who together postulated an astoundingly clarivoyant theory that everything was comprised of super-small components called ""atoms"" (humanity would have to wait for proof of such a claim until 1905). With a brief digression into some pleasing philosophical musings of the aforementioned thinkers, necessitated by the inability to test any of these theories, Rovelli moves on to explain the original of classical mechanics.Moving forwards in time (inside joke-- read the book!), Rovelli elegantly and relevantly presents the origins of several seminal ideas in classical mechanics like gravity (Galileo + Newton) planetary motion (Copernicus & Newton), the mathematical foundations upon which such theories were based (Plato/Aristotle/Pythagoras/etc - that physical processes could be modeled with mathematics), and the physical and philosophical implications of the new ways of thinking about the world. Not even a few centuries go by before Faraday, Maxwell, and their co-intellectuals of the 1800s arrive on the scene and postulate the notion of an ""Electro-Magnetic Field"", solving some of the greatest mysteries about the forces of electricity and magnetism by presenting a mathematical model of particles and fields that move through space and time. Upon the shoulders of such great conceivers, Einstein publishes a series of seminal papers that almost literally invoke a formal conception of ""atomic physics"", or ""particle physics""-- not only does Einstein prove that atoms exist, he also proves (via irrefutable mathematical models that predict reality down to the ump-teenth decimal place) that time is not consistent for all matter within space, AND that space and time themselves may be constituted by the notion of a Gravitational Field (with a stroke of genius, he applies Maxwell's conception of fields and particles to gravity!). The descriptions of special relativity, quantum mechanics, and general relativity are all eloquently and concisely explained by Rovelli, thus I choose to not digress here into any explanation of such awesome theories of reality and instead implore you to read the book! Throughout this section, short digressions into the theories and contributions of seminal quantum physicists such as Dirac, Heisenberg, Bohr, Wheeler, Feyman, etc., are discussed for support and insight for the nuanced non-intuitive conceptions of reality portrayed. This section is concluded with a thorough yet concise explanation of the three pillars of quantum mechanics: granularity, indeterminacy, and relationality. Perhaps the most intriguing of which to me was the notion that our universe is finite-but-without-boundaries: Einstein conceived of such a property of the universe with the notion of a 3-sphere-- yet again I implore you to read the book!The 3rd section of the book and, in my opinion, crown jewel, is focused on an elaboration of the theory of Quantum Gravity. Without diving too deep, in an attempt to let Rovelli's art stand on its own: The theory of quantum gravity, along with its components (loop theory, spin-networks, spinfoam, etc), is an incredibly intriguing conception of physical reality with which a quantum-field theory of spacetime is theorized. No longer is space some inert container, but is comprised of quanta and the relationships between them; No longer is time a parameter to the functions and equations of such a physics, but is simply the evolution of the relations of said quanta! A human's conception of space and time emerge as the manifestation of the evolution of such relationships between the inconceivably small quanta (particles) of the quantum field of space time itself-- such quanta are not IN space, nor are they evolving IN time: the quanta and their relationships ARE space, and their (indeterminate) evolutions PRODUCE the conception of time. Admittedly, I had to re-read chapters of this section due to the non-intuitive nature of such a conception of reality; But, I reread them because I wanted to, and was so deeply intrigued by the subject matter during the first pass that I felt compelled to go back and read this section (all 50 pages) a second time around in an attempt to understand it better. I, like Rovelli, believe that to understand a theory in any scientific domain, one must first become familiar with the ""episteme"" (- Foucault) or underlying scientific and philosophical framework from whence the theories came; Thus, I thoroughly enjoyed the progression of the book, and the attention to detail that Rovelli gave to ancient (Greek) conceptions of what reality might be comprised, and how these conceptions evolved through the centuries, discovered or invented by the great minds such as Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, Einstein, and now, quantum gravity theorists! I finished this book with a greater holistic understanding of ways in which to think about physical reality, and excitedly: a potential theory that might traverse the chasm between general relativity and quantum mechanics!Rovelli concludes the book by pushing even further into the unknown. He first discusses how the new theory of Quantum Gravity is being tested, confirming certain theories about the inception (or continuation) of our universe (think: The Big Bang... or, The Big Bounce!), and how it may play large role in the future of astronomy, ultimately better describing our universe at a macro scale than general relativity does! Venturing even further, Rovelli postulates interesting techniques for interpreting still-confounding aspects of reality with ideas such as the potential application of information theory to quantum mechanics, how time might be best quantified by (and even integrated mathematically into) thermodynamic phenomena, and how the notion of infinity (within any conception of physical reality) might have a place after all: reality might be truly be finite, at the most foundational level.I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did. It has presented to me a world of ideas-- the greater understanding of which I will pursue for the rest of my life-- in addition to the universe of ways (hopefully a finite 3-sphere) in which to better conceive reality."
144,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38087945-farha-crystal,4,"Are we so imprisoned in our consciousness, like the slaves in Plato's Cave, can't break loose of our chains?I can never make peace with Zeno's paradox. Oh! Rovelli, for peace and order's sake, can you please at least talk some sweet words to forget my misery for the chaos driven by Zeno's paradox? :) The concept of Infinity, as well as time, is only our ignorance, our limitations. In this book, Rovelli talks about the basic ideas behind loop quantum gravity, considering the feature of granularity, indeterminacy and probabilistic behavior. Loop quantum gravity, tries to combine general relativity with quantum field theory. In the world of Quantum Gravity, the principle of cause and effect no longer holds. Space, particles, quanta only exist when they interact only probabilistically. The book does not get into any quantitative detail for the knowledgeable reader but maybe it can at least provide the outline for the laypersons. It doesn't matter if complex issues like loop quantum gravity or superstrings are best possible answers for the intense situations like blackhole or the beginning of our known universe but this book is a poem. In fact, when Rovelli recites his poem I couldn't stop myself to put his beautiful lyrics into my mouth and suck it like a strawberry. He plays the chord of esoteric quantum gravity in an amazing way that the music infused through my veins to mandate a cosmic orgasm. :)Favorite line:  ""It is only in interactions that nature draws the world."" "
145,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40566664-knowlton-murphy,4,"A book on quantum physics for dumb people! Right up my alley. I do not have a brain for math or physics, so I am deeply indebted to the kind of work Rovelli has produced. I am absolutely sure I did not understand everything, but it was a fun and thought-provoking ride, and the fact that I understood anything is more a mark of Rovelli's skill in communication than my own acuity. The book is worth reading for its summary of the history of physics, and for its accessible explanation of quantum gravity. Rovelli, in general, writes clearly, and entertainingly. My favorite aspect of loop theory is its central prediction that ""...space is not a continuum, it is not divisible ad infinitum, it is formed of 'atoms of space'..."" (168) That is, ""...arbitrarily small chunks of space do not exist. There is a lower limit to the divisibility of space."" (169) What do you know. As a Christian, this is an interesting point because of its theological value: it draws that much more of a distinction between Creator and Created. Finitude is woven into the fabric of our created existence. There is nothing physical we can look to that compares to the infinitude of God. As a human with practical concerns in daily life, this matches my experience of life...I don't have to traverse an infinity of atomic infinities to reach my mug of tea. I can finally stop thinking about swift Achilles chasing that slow tortoise, forever doomed to fail! My second favorite concept is that of reality being relational. It is something I have thought about culturally in seeking to understand my own culture, but Rovelli helped me think about the relational nature of reality beyond the sociological sense. Again, this raised a theological point for me. As a Christian of my particular theological convictions, it makes sense to see the world in terms of relationships, because I believe God is a Trinity, a being who exists eternally in relationship.I was fascinated by Rovelli's guidance through the history of physics. It was cool to see how Democritus' idea of atomic/granular reality has become so validated. I do think that his atomic worldview is nightmarish, though:""There is no finality, no purpose, in this endless dance of atoms. We, just like the rest of the natural world, are one of many products of this infinite dance--the product, that is, of an accidental combination...Our life is a combination of atoms, our thoughts are made up of thin atoms, our dreams are the products of atoms; our hopes and our emotions are written in a language formed by combinations of atoms, which bring us images."" (21, summary by Rovelli)Rovelli returns to Democritus in his penultimate chapter to point out that ""...it is not just a question of these atoms but also of the order in which they are arranged...We are not atoms: we are orders in which atoms are arranged, capable of mirroring other atoms and mirroring ourselves."" (256) For me, this raises a cause for concern. Rovelli can speak romantically about human nature all he wants, but the only hope any of us have for reflecting the kind of good humanity he envisions is for our atoms to order themselves properly. Which according to Democritus is completely subject to accidental chance. Rovelli says atoms can think about themselves (256). This is quite a leap to me, but Rovelli manages it with graceful ease. Random accidents of atomic chance not only create the ordered world I inhabit, but align in such a way to lead to my sentient experience of it...seven billion times over. But I am not a theoretical physicist, so perhaps I just don't have enough faith. Speaking of faith, Rovelli has a flawed view of religion. He seems to think that the role of religion is primarily that of comfort for people who cannot bear the harsh nature of reality. He never suspects that people might be interested in religion as a means of pursuing truth. ""Ignorance can be scary. Out of fear, we tell ourselves calming stories: up there beyond the stars there is an enchanted garden, with a gentle father who will welcome us into his arms. It doesn't matter if it's true--it is reassuring."" Precisely what is reassuring about this system? This isn't historic Christianity, for example, which by and large holds sacred texts like 1 John 1:1-4 and 2 Peter 1:16 (which appeal to the reality of eyewitness as a grounds for believing in truth) or 1 Timothy 4:7 (which specifically tells us to not waste time with myths). Rather, Rovelli is describing existentialism...looking at the absurdity of our existence and seeking comfort in a fabricated view of reality, all the while knowing deep down that it is a lie. Incidentally, that's exactly what Rovelli does. He is convinced that men are not made ""...to live like brutes, but to seek virtue and knowledge"" (263-64, quote from Dante), but never bothers explaining why.Rovelli repeatedly says he wants to keep an open mind in case he is wrong. Clearly his idea of open-mindedness could never entertain supernaturality, though, so one wonders how genuine his claim is, especially in a world where materialists are minorities. Ironically, one of his suggestions for why people choose to be religious is that they ""...prefer to believe in a story just because it was believed by the tribe's ancestors, rather than bravely accept uncertainty."" (262) Wait. What about ancient Democritus, patriarch of the materialism, being right about atomic reality, which was counter-intuitive, and that magnificent list of heroes upon whose shoulders we sit (chapters 1-4)? Does Rovelli really have no mechanism for seeing the parallel? Ah well. The biggest awkward elephant in the room is of course that he doesn't really bother speculating where atoms come from. The closest he comes to saying where our current atoms come from is The Big Bounce (206-07), but it is funny for him to spend so much time talking about how the universe is finite only to gently acknowledge it is also eternal."

This one is probably the most incomprehensible of all that I’ve read on the subject of quantum physics so far, though, admittedly, it is also very skillfully written. Beautifully woven phrases intermingle with claims, terms and equations that I’m not equipped to understand. Even though it is still a pop-science book, on the spectrum of pop-science literature it is quite far removed from Michio Kaku’s light writing (e.g. Parallel Worlds: A Journey through Creation, Higher Dimensions, and the Future of the Cosmos) and much closer to Brian Cox’s level of detail (The Quantum Universe: Everything That Can Happen Does Happen), though Cox’s book was made even more obscure than it had to be by weird thought experiments meant to make it easier for the reader to visualise things, and failing. Rovelli doesn’t bother with thought experiments, he just ‘says it as it is’ in grand style.By no means am I trying to say that reading this book was a waste of my time. Quite the contrary, I did get a slightly better insight to how physicists think, even if I failed – as usual – to comprehend the essentials. Also, this book is the first one I’ve read that talks about an alternative hypothesis to the popular string theory: the loop theory, Rovelli’s (and others) intellectual child. Perhaps the lack of infinite universes makes it less cool in people’s eyes, but I find it comforting that there may not be, after all, countless other ‘mes’ capable of screwing up in innumerable ways!"

Carlo Rovelli has done a remarkable job to put down such complicated concepts into simple, easy to understand language. One of best thing about book is style of connecting all the dots throughout history, right from Democritus's theory of atoms in 400BC to Quantum gravity loop in modern era. Definitely, a must-read for anyone who loves Physics."

But this, this whole book is exactly what I have been looking for for very nearly the past ten years. It opens with a very brief (well, not too brief; it does take about half of what is actually a very short book) overview of classical physics, then general and special relativity, then quantum mechanics, and then dives right in to the heart of the matter: quantum gravity, or loop gravity, or loop quantum gravity; even Rovelli seems to use the terms interchangeably. The writing style was amazing. Fantastic. So light and breezy and conversational. Funny, even (there's really - and I am convinced of this - a ""The name of that man? Albert Einstein."" joke somewhere in chapter 2, and I lost my mind laughing), but still concise. The reader was great; his emphasis was spot-on. I'm half-tempted to listen to it over again and I wish my to-read list wasn't so long because I genuinely would. I enjoyed it that much.I won't lie - I didn't... quite catch on.At no point during this did I feel confused. At all. In fact, I almost feel like maybe the way Rovelli explained quantum gravity seemed... too easy? Space is granular, check. I follow. Time is what happens because we can't understand everything that's happening all the time. That's highly speculative and still, check, I gotcha, I follow. But if you wanted me to tell you what you what quantum gravity is right now? I'm not sure I could. Maybe that's okay though. Maybe that's okay because this is the first book like this - or at least the first one I've been able to get my hands on - and soon I'll be able to devour books on loop quantum gravity the same way I had the chance to eat up string theory before I realized that the point that it was getting to was indeed no point at all (I had to get one in there, so sue me). Maybe Carlo Rovelli is the Brian Greene of quantum gravity. I sure hope so. I could use a lot more books like this."

Statements like the one I used in the epigraph, about human infinite ignorance, resonate with me. I teach mathematics at a university, I have quite an extensive exposure to classical physics, yet my ignorance about modern physics is certainly limitless. (By the way, there is no better way to understand the vastness of one's ignorance than being a professor.)While I will not rate this book by Dr. Rovelli as a masterpiece like 
Seven Brief Lessons on Physics
, it is still a great read and I have learned a lot from it - not only about my lack of knowledge. The author begins with a story about Anaximander of Miletus (450 BCE) whose work contributed to the foundations of Western science and philosophy.  ""The Milesians understand that by shrewdly using observation and reason, rather than searching for answers in fantasy, ancient myths, or religion - and above all by using critical thought in a discriminating way - it is possible to repeatedly correct our worldview and to discover new aspects of reality that are hidden to the common view.""  Progressing through time, we read about Democritus, then through Copernicus, Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, we follow the evolution of human models of reality. Then come Einstein, Heisenberg, Bohr, Dirac - fathers of the modern physics - and we arrive at the ""two pillars of twentieth-century physics - general relativity and quantum mechanics."" General relativity is ""a simple and coherent vision of gravity, space, and time."" Quantum mechanics unveils the three aspects of reality: ""granularity, indeterminism, and relationality.""Part Three, Quantum Space and Relational Time is to me the most fascinating part of the book. General relativity and quantum mechanics, ""the two jewels that the twentieth century has left us,"" seem to contradict each other. ""They cannot both be true, at least not in their present forms."" Chapters 5 through 7 provide an introduction to the loop quantum gravity theory in whose development the author has played one of the key roles.  ""[...] the world described by the theory is far from the one we are familiar with. There is no longer space that ""contains"" the world, and no longer time ""during the course of which"" events occur.""  Part Four, Beyond Space and Time, discusses such aspects of cosmology as Big Bang and black holes. I found the chapter Information the most illuminating. Information is defined as the number of possible alternatives, connections to Boltzmann's statistical mechanics are shown, and the author presents yet another crucial idea - thermal time and its connection with the concept of irreversibility. The author's succinct summary is stunning:  ""Time is an effect of our overlooking the physical microstates of things. Time is the information we don't have. Time is our ignorance.""  I absolutely love the powerful final chapter, Mystery, with its convincing argument why nothing but science can be reliable:  ""The answers given by science [...] are not reliable because they are definitive. They are reliable because they are not definitive.  This is the most powerful argument I have ever heard against all kinds of mumbo-jumbo that ignores science, which is particularly important in the times of a pandemic. The author provides two fascinating historical vignettes: the first about a ""race"" to formalize Einstein's theory between David Hilbert, one of the most famous mathematicians in history, and Albert Einstein. The other vignette is about a little known Belgian priest, Georges Lemaître, who showed that both Einstein in his skepticism about the expansion of the universe as well as pope Pius XII in his declaration that the Big Bang confirms the account of Creation given in Genesis were wrong.Fascinating read!Four-and-a-quarter stars."
152,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4277032-d,5,"I wholeheartedly agree with Manny's review.Applying Occam's razor clearly favors Loop Quantum Gravity (LCG) theory over String theory with its 11 or more dimensions. Amazingly, dropping the 'background' of empty space and time as basic notions simplifies obtaining LCG as a theory that makes General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics compatible. There are even some cosmological experiments that could test LCG: e.g. observing a black hole that expands again (bounces back) would suggest that space/matter is granular, making everything finite, again simplifying matters considerably, it seems. However this experiment shows that, if true, the size of a matter/space quantum should be really small: 10-48m (10 to the power of -48), much smaller than the Planck scale."

I have mixed feelings about the book. Rovelli's prose is quite poetic at times (and perhaps a little damaged in translation from the Italian). I found the historical background quite clear, but when he got to describing quantum gravity, and how space/time do not exist at the most basic level I was lost. That's a shame, because it's the most interesting part of the book. It would also have been nice to have a somewhat broader view of the rest of physics (e.g., String Theory; how does Dark Matter or Dark Energy fit in?). I was also a bit disturbed to read in other reviews that the form of Quantum Gravity being presented here is only the flavor that Rovelli is working on and he has left out other competing versions, which view time quite differently.Finally, and most annoyingly, large chunks of text are reused almost word for word from his previous book Seven Brief Lessons on Physics. If you have read the first, you have already third-to-half of this one (hence 2-stars)."

For decades, the only approach dominating to resolve the grand unification problem was the string theory and if like me you saw Brian Greene's dramatically made TV documentary then you might have been fooled into believing we have indeed solved it. But when our friendly particle collider @ Geneva, didn't throw out a bunch of predicted supersymmetric particles, the long suspected truth came into the reality that - String theory is not the last word! In contrast to string theory, LQG has been steadily building up and has found much stronger footing. Carlo starts from antiquity in ancient Greece to the original apple guy Newton and to our generation's greatest genius maverick Einstein, before introducing LQG.

158,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22241323-judy,3,"Rovelli tells the reader that he’s written with a particular reader in mind: someone who knows little or nothing about today’s physics but is curious to find out what we know, as well as what we don’t yet understand, about the elementary weave of the world. (p 8)I need to acknowledge that Physics has never been my favorite branch of science. However, I've always been intrigued by how Physicists think, so when my niece gave this book 3-stars and said it was ""pretty good,"" I decided to give it a try. I'm reading her copy of the book, so I can't write in it, but I am noting quite a few page numbers, most of which indicate something I want to give some thought. This isn’t going to be a review but rather a list of ideas that are food for thought (to me anyway).p 21: Our life is a combination of atoms, our thoughts are made up of thin atoms, our dreams are the products of atoms; our hopes and our emotions are written in a language formed by combinations of atoms; …That is true at a very fundamental level. (Thin atoms?)p 29: The definitive proof of the ‘atomic hypothesis’ had to wait until 1905. It was found by a rebellious 25 year-old who had studied physics but had not been able to find employment as a scientist …Einstein, of course.p 33: The closure of the ancient schools such as those of Athens and Alexandria, and the destruction of all the texts not in accordance with Christian ideas was vast and systematic …Apparently Plato and Aristotle were viewed as pagans. Democritus was even “worse.” I’d like to read more about these ancient thinkers.p 39: In the world of Democritus as sung by Lucretius -There is no fear of the gods; … There is a deep love of nature, a serene immersion within it; a recognition that we are profoundly part of it; that men, women, animals, plants, and clouds are organic threads of a marvelous whole, without hierarchies.In the Biological or Chemical use of the word, clouds wouldn’t be considered organic, … but this is a Physicist writing. (I think I like Democritus.)p 44: Mathematics allows the world to be described and the future to be predicted.Oh, my!p 47: A reminder:Experimental science begins with Galileo. His experiment is simple: he lets objects fall … and seeks to measure precisely their falling speed.p 69: I don't know enough to appreciate statements such as this one.Newton’s mechanics are not compatible with the existence of a fundamental velocity, because what enters Newton’s equations is acceleration, not velocity.p 81: Einstein, in an “extraordinary stroke of genius” asks:What if Newton’s space is nothing more than the gravitational field? This extremely simple, beautiful, brilliant idea is the theory of general relativity.The words are straightforward, but I can’t appreciate the significance.p 93: For Einstein, the theory of general relativity is a mental image of the world arduously translated into equations.And here’s another idea that seems really important, but I don’t fully grasp.p 153: Rovelli made a valiant attempt at explaining the scale of matter that is the subject of this book … and it surpasses my imagination.It is at this extremely minute scale that quantum gravity manifests itself. To give an idea of the smallness of the scale we are discussing: if we enlarged a walnut shell until it had become as big as the whole observable universe, we would still not see the Planck length. Even after having been enormously magnified thus, it would still be a million times smaller than the actual walnut shell was before magnification. At this scale, space and time change their nature. The become something different; they become ‘quantum space and time.’p 172:  Quanta of gravity are not in space; they are themselves space.Whew! That’s a lot to take in.p 176: If I wanted to pursue time travel, I suspect that I would need a solid understanding of these ideas:Time emerges, like space, from the quantum gravitational field. … The moment we take quantum mechanics into account, we recognize that time too must have those aspects of probabilistic indeterminacy, granularity, and relationality, which are common to all of reality. It becomes a ‘time’ markedly different from all that we have hitherto meant by the word.p 192: Here’s something that both blows me away and strikes me as totally incomprehensible.Every cubic centimeter of space, and every second that passes, is the result of this dancing foam of extremely small quanta. …. Light is formed by quanta of a field; space is nothing more than a field, which is also made of quanta; and time emerges from the processes of this same field. In other words, the world is made entirely from quantum fields.p 225: Ahh, something I do understand (at least to some extent):Stephen Hawking theoretically deduced that black holes are “hot.” They behave like hot bodies: they emit heat. In doing so, they lose energy and hence mass (since energy and mass are the same thing), becoming progressively smaller. They “evaporate.”. This is Hawking’s most important discovery.Maybe, if I read this another three or four or five or … times, just maybe I could summarize the big ideas. But I can’t do that now."
159,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"I had come across references to Carlo Rovelli previously, probably in the books I read by Lee Smolin, so when I saw this come into the library I was interested in checking it out. Rovelli is a leader in research into the ""Loop Quantum Gravity"" approach to fundamental physics, and this book describes that perspective in fairly simple non-mathematical terms, rather than in depth. The book is aimed at the layperson with little knowledge of physics, so it takes the historical approach starting with Democritus and explaining the differences between Newton, relativity and quantum mechanics before getting into the new story. (I hadn't known that LQG was actually first proposed in the early thirties by a Soviet physicist Matvei Bronstejn, who was murdered by Stalin in 1938.) Rovelli represents LQG as the most conservative of the approaches to quantum gravity, being based only on synthesizing general relativity, Standard Model quantum theory and thermodynamics rather than postulating new extra dimensions and totally unknown entities such as strings and branes as string theorists do. Nevertheless it is very radical in what it proposes: that rather than the world existing in space and time, space and time are constructed from the interactions of atomic quantum events. (Atomic in the sense of ""indivisible"", not as in the modern sense of nucleus and electrons; these ""atomic"" quanta of space are millions of time smaller than an atom.) His description of the theory was more understandable than the description by Smolin in the earlier Three Roads to Quantum Gravity, I think partly because the theory has become more developed in the meantime. (This book was published in 2014 in Italian, but since the text mentions the discovery of gravity waves last year it was obviously revised for the English translation.) Of course, without the mathematics I couldn't really understand it (and with the mathematics I certainly couldn't have understood it) but it did give an idea of what the theory is about. Judging by Smolin and Rovelli, LQG theorists are better philosophers than string theorists are; I'm not sure whether that's good or bad for a physicist's reputation."
160,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22926162-in-s-chamarro,4,"I am a lawyer and most certainly a scientific layman, but I am determined to remain an informed fan of science and this is definitely not my first science book. Relativity I can fathom, more or less, quantum physics I am familiar with up to a certain degree, I don't know the Standard Model intimately but at least I recognize what people are talking about when they use the name, string theory I could never really follow but occasionally I keep trying, I am mostly fine with cosmology. It is, however, my first book on loop quantum gravity, and on that level I acknowledge myself speechless. Time is destroyed. Matter is presented as spinfoam, which is even stranger than it sounds. And there are some aspects on information theory I don't think I had heard before, either (then again, information theory gives me headaches, mostly when applied to black holes, so I might have missed out on stuff there earlier). Well. Surprising to say the least. One would think there would have been an announcement or something. The first hundred or so pages are an easy read, as a historical overview of the progress from Democritus to Einstein. From then onwards it becomes a bit of a struggle. I managed to read the historical overview in a day and it took me two weeks to go through the other hundred and fifty pages. I almost gave up twice. However, if you are interested in the subject, have some foreknowledge and you hang on to it you will probably get to it in the end. Personally I think I am going to need a second book on the subject after this introduction. Not sure if am seeking a second explanation or a second medical opinion, really, but the theory does seem worth exploring more in depth."

WHAT?!Do things that happen in nature require a cause in order to be properly explained? The answer to this was a resounding yes back in the days of Newton. This seems rather straightforward and our intuitions back it up. But what we are now finding out from quantum gravity is utterly shocking, and a blow to the cause-and-effect paradigm that helps us make sense of our world. This is a book about the fundamental nature of the universe: what is reality? What is reality made out of? How does it relate with what we know? What does reality mean for our own existence? Why did the universe bang into existence? Will the universe be there forever? What is forever anyway?Once someone thinks things through, then it becomes easy to understand what they are saying because they'll be able to tell you something that is condensed. The author has properly thought through the concepts that explain reality and in this book he summarizes them very well. I had no trouble understanding what he was saying up until the last chapter on Information Theory, but that's okay because he said the theory is not yet solidified. Aside from simplicity, it was also beautiful.It seems that the theories are pointing towards a non-dualistic structure of nature. I hope someday we'll have a grand theory that explains everything.The truth is in the depths. — Democritus"

I thoroughly enjoyed this introduction to the theory behind loop quantum gravity. I thought the author, Carlo Rovelli, did an excellent job of illustrating some complex theoretical physics in a manner that is easy for anybody to understand, whether you are a physics pro or you have very little background in or aptitude for physics. To do this feat, Rovelli started way back in the beginning, way back in Ancient Greece, with Aristotle and Archimedes, and he revisited Greece many times throughout the book. He took a great deal of the book to explain the physics of Einstein in a way that made it even more clear to me, even though I’ve studied relativity before, and the same with the quantum revolution. Rovelli introduced quantum gravity with a high level discussion fit for everybody, flowing language to make it slide down easy, and some excellent illustrations. Although the concepts are difficult and theoretical in nature, the poetic illustrations Rovelli provided made these ideas tangible for anyone to grasp. I listened to the audio version, which was very well done. "

165,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,5,"It is always a pleasure when one comes across a book such as this. Theoretical physicist Rovelli, who works in the area relating to Quantum Gravity, goes out of his way to introduce key concepts of his chosen discipline, and successfully manages to communicate its mysteries to us laypersons in language that is clear and informative. We are all made wiser and more appreciative as a result.Rovelli sees his current profession as being the result of a history of ideas about the nature of reality, and he lightly traces out this history, quickly arrives at the Miletians (Thales, Anaximander, etc) and then circa 450 BCE on to Leucippus and his young disciple Democritus and the idea of atomism. In a sense, the stage is now set for the development of further ideas that will ultimately result in Quantum theory and Quantum mechanics. Rovelli traces the acceptance, denial, dismissal, revival of these and associated ideas in a sweeping through-the-centuries overview that is exciting and adventurous, and we soon arrive at Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, and then Einstein and all the other associated physicists we may be more knowledgeable about today.Each step along the way is spelled out clearly and simply. Of course, this is not to say that the reader necessarily understands all the possible implications, but we do begin to see the links between: Space, Time and Spacetime; Particles and Fields; how Spacetime and Fields link to form Covariant Fields; and Fields and Particles combine to form Quantum Fields; and ultimately how Quantum Fields and Spacetime unite to form the “single ingredient”, Covariant Quantum Fields, which Rovelli considers to be the answer to the question “What is the word made of?”This is the conclusion that the author comes to, and his arguments form the rationale of the first three parts of this book. At the same time, he is aware that this view is not necessarily the accepted view of every physicist. His understanding based on loop-theory/loop-quantum-gravity suggests that at the very deepest level his research has lead him, time might very well not exist, nor even particles or quanta (he uses terms such as “Spacetime sushi” and “Spinfoams”) — the suspicion, perhaps, that we may all need to reconsider and/or reevaluate the validity of all current models of reality.Yet Rovelli pushes the envelope even more in Part Four, which is entitled “Beyond Space and Time”, where he explores other issues such as Beyond the Big Bang, Quantum Cosmology, Quantum Black Holes, and the End of Infinity. His final chapter is entitled “Mystery”, where he essentially reminds his readers that there remain more and more unknowns that need to be explored.For the cynics among us (and I would consider myself to be partial to the odd cynicism at times!) all the above is just a load of speculative bull that has no relevance whatever to “real” reality, i.e. what we might call the “four dimensional” Space-Time Continuum. This is the “place” where we as individuals need to position ourselves and negotiate our way about in order to survive and live our lives as happily as possible. Even on this level the title of this book (“Reality Is Not What It Seems”) makes sense — we can be deceived and/or misled by our senses (and even, sometimes, by our intelligence) with very unfortunate results… It could be that thinking too deeply on the “nature” of physical reality is not good for our health and well-being — pretty much the same as, say, for people suffering from schizophrenia or paranoia, or even for a whole slew of physiological, social, religious and psychological reasons: they believe that their experiences are real: for them Reality is exactly what it seems!Whatever one might think about this, it doesn’t mean that this book must needs be dismissed. If you want to know what Quantum Gravity physicists are on about, then this book strikes me as being a very good place to start."

Now I know what the universe is made of, and how to reconcile quantum gravity with the standard model. I truly expected to be left dangling at the end of this book, which takes the reader on a beautifully written, often funny, often moving journey from the ancient greeks to modern day, building up a picture of what we understand are the building blocks of the universe. There's a little bit of maths, but nothing that ought to daunt anyone who did maths in high-school and still remembers it, but mostly it's just a wonderfully written, and incredibly informative narrative.The original text was written in Italian and has been translated, and I could not help reading most of it with an Italian accent.

Rovelli says, ""I don't criticize those who prefer to believe in [Truth and certainty]"" but he says they are ""immersed in ignorance."" He says ""we don't have absolute certainty"" about reality, the hallmark of science, except for his own certainty that what is written in the ""Great Book"" is silly. And somehow for reasons unexplained, being a quantum physicist gives him the means by which to apply the scientific method to all moral questions whatever, where ""it makes little sense to ask whether a half-cut fingernail is still 'me,' or has become 'not-me' . . . or precisely when a child's life begins."" If there is always universal uncertainty for any question whatever, which Rovelli clearly does not confine to questions of science, then by what standard can you judge any action or any belief? "

All the tests, last 100 years, have proven general relativity and quantum mechanics correct. The problem happens when we look at extremes they can't be both correct. Especially gravity. Quantum gravity removes infinity, removes singularity and takes Democritus to the word. Basic component of space is the ATOM. And it is the size of the Planck length. As for time, there is not time, there is entropy."

172,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32544970-raf,5,"✨✨⭐ 10 out of 10 ⭐✨✨I just found my new favourite popular science author after Michio Kaku. I love Rovelli's writing so much! ❤️❤️❤️ Keywords: popular science, physics, astronomy, cosmology, general relativity, loop quantum gravity, big bounce   ""The curiousity to learn, to discover, to look over the next hill, the desire to taste the apple; these are the things which make us human.""   REVIEW  Have you ever heard about Big Bounce? It's an alternate theory to Big Bang, that maybe the universe as we know it is a result of contracting and expanding explosion. Reality is Not What it Seems, tells about this theory and the theory that become the core of big bounce: loop quantum gravity. Loop quantum gravity is a theory that will unite relativity and quantum mechanics, two which are very opposite of each other.  The Explanation is Easy to Understand  This book is written in very clear and slow explanations. Things are explained in layman terms, that even people who doesn't know physics will understand. His topic escalate slowly, from the foundation to the hardest part of the theory. From what is atoms, to what is field, gravitation, time, universe and so on escalate until quantum loop gravity. He often compares today's scientific theories with philosophies from ancient time; mentioned ancient philosophers and tells us their contribution to building of nowadays's science. There are many new insights I didn't know before and albeit the topic of quantum loop gravity itself very hard, I can quite grasp the bigger picture due to this book.  I love his humility  I also love how Carlo Rovelli is very humble. He always mentioned that he himself is not certain. Do not believe something with blind faith because our scientific knowledges have a limit and what we thought is true may be proven otherwise later. He encourage scientific thinking, that is to never fear of learning and unlearning things that we know. Conclusion  The topic of this book is very specific so unless you really curious about it you might not enjoy it. But the explanation is easy to understand so you don't need to fear that it will be hard to read. I recommend this to those who want to know more about astronomy, astrophysics, or physics itself in general.   ""Science is continual exploration of ways of thinking. Its strength is its visionary capacity to demolish preconceived ideas, to reveal new regions of reality, and to construct novel and more effective images of the world. This adventure rests upon the entirety of past knowledge, but at its heart is change. The world is boundless and iridescent, we want to go and see it. We are immersed in its mystery and in its beauty, and over the horizon there is unexplored territory. The incompleteness and the uncertainty of our knowledges, our precariousness, suspended over the abyss of the immensity of what we don't know, doesn't render life meaningless, it makes it interesting and precious.""

173,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"Carlo Rovelli's first book (aside from 7 Brief Lessons...), Reality is Not What it Seems, is a beautiful narrative regarding the foundational human conceptions of the fabric of reality ranging from Democritus and Anaximander's conception of the apeiron (""the primal substance of which everything is formed"") and concluding at the precipice of modern theoretic physics: Quantum Gravity. Rovelli begins by setting the stage of modern theoretical physics by first introducing the historical conceptions of the nature of reality, discussing ideas from ancient minds such as Democritus, Lucretius, and Anaximander who together postulated an astoundingly clarivoyant theory that everything was comprised of super-small components called ""atoms"" (humanity would have to wait for proof of such a claim until 1905). With a brief digression into some pleasing philosophical musings of the aforementioned thinkers, necessitated by the inability to test any of these theories, Rovelli moves on to explain the original of classical mechanics.Moving forwards in time (inside joke-- read the book!), Rovelli elegantly and relevantly presents the origins of several seminal ideas in classical mechanics like gravity (Galileo + Newton) planetary motion (Copernicus & Newton), the mathematical foundations upon which such theories were based (Plato/Aristotle/Pythagoras/etc - that physical processes could be modeled with mathematics), and the physical and philosophical implications of the new ways of thinking about the world. Not even a few centuries go by before Faraday, Maxwell, and their co-intellectuals of the 1800s arrive on the scene and postulate the notion of an ""Electro-Magnetic Field"", solving some of the greatest mysteries about the forces of electricity and magnetism by presenting a mathematical model of particles and fields that move through space and time. Upon the shoulders of such great conceivers, Einstein publishes a series of seminal papers that almost literally invoke a formal conception of ""atomic physics"", or ""particle physics""-- not only does Einstein prove that atoms exist, he also proves (via irrefutable mathematical models that predict reality down to the ump-teenth decimal place) that time is not consistent for all matter within space, AND that space and time themselves may be constituted by the notion of a Gravitational Field (with a stroke of genius, he applies Maxwell's conception of fields and particles to gravity!). The descriptions of special relativity, quantum mechanics, and general relativity are all eloquently and concisely explained by Rovelli, thus I choose to not digress here into any explanation of such awesome theories of reality and instead implore you to read the book! Throughout this section, short digressions into the theories and contributions of seminal quantum physicists such as Dirac, Heisenberg, Bohr, Wheeler, Feyman, etc., are discussed for support and insight for the nuanced non-intuitive conceptions of reality portrayed. This section is concluded with a thorough yet concise explanation of the three pillars of quantum mechanics: granularity, indeterminacy, and relationality. Perhaps the most intriguing of which to me was the notion that our universe is finite-but-without-boundaries: Einstein conceived of such a property of the universe with the notion of a 3-sphere-- yet again I implore you to read the book!The 3rd section of the book and, in my opinion, crown jewel, is focused on an elaboration of the theory of Quantum Gravity. Without diving too deep, in an attempt to let Rovelli's art stand on its own: The theory of quantum gravity, along with its components (loop theory, spin-networks, spinfoam, etc), is an incredibly intriguing conception of physical reality with which a quantum-field theory of spacetime is theorized. No longer is space some inert container, but is comprised of quanta and the relationships between them; No longer is time a parameter to the functions and equations of such a physics, but is simply the evolution of the relations of said quanta! A human's conception of space and time emerge as the manifestation of the evolution of such relationships between the inconceivably small quanta (particles) of the quantum field of space time itself-- such quanta are not IN space, nor are they evolving IN time: the quanta and their relationships ARE space, and their (indeterminate) evolutions PRODUCE the conception of time. Admittedly, I had to re-read chapters of this section due to the non-intuitive nature of such a conception of reality; But, I reread them because I wanted to, and was so deeply intrigued by the subject matter during the first pass that I felt compelled to go back and read this section (all 50 pages) a second time around in an attempt to understand it better. I, like Rovelli, believe that to understand a theory in any scientific domain, one must first become familiar with the ""episteme"" (- Foucault) or underlying scientific and philosophical framework from whence the theories came; Thus, I thoroughly enjoyed the progression of the book, and the attention to detail that Rovelli gave to ancient (Greek) conceptions of what reality might be comprised, and how these conceptions evolved through the centuries, discovered or invented by the great minds such as Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, Einstein, and now, quantum gravity theorists! I finished this book with a greater holistic understanding of ways in which to think about physical reality, and excitedly: a potential theory that might traverse the chasm between general relativity and quantum mechanics!Rovelli concludes the book by pushing even further into the unknown. He first discusses how the new theory of Quantum Gravity is being tested, confirming certain theories about the inception (or continuation) of our universe (think: The Big Bang... or, The Big Bounce!), and how it may play large role in the future of astronomy, ultimately better describing our universe at a macro scale than general relativity does! Venturing even further, Rovelli postulates interesting techniques for interpreting still-confounding aspects of reality with ideas such as the potential application of information theory to quantum mechanics, how time might be best quantified by (and even integrated mathematically into) thermodynamic phenomena, and how the notion of infinity (within any conception of physical reality) might have a place after all: reality might be truly be finite, at the most foundational level.I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did. It has presented to me a world of ideas-- the greater understanding of which I will pursue for the rest of my life-- in addition to the universe of ways (hopefully a finite 3-sphere) in which to better conceive reality."
174,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38087945-farha-crystal,4,"Are we so imprisoned in our consciousness, like the slaves in Plato's Cave, can't break loose of our chains?I can never make peace with Zeno's paradox. Oh! Rovelli, for peace and order's sake, can you please at least talk some sweet words to forget my misery for the chaos driven by Zeno's paradox? :) The concept of Infinity, as well as time, is only our ignorance, our limitations. In this book, Rovelli talks about the basic ideas behind loop quantum gravity, considering the feature of granularity, indeterminacy and probabilistic behavior. Loop quantum gravity, tries to combine general relativity with quantum field theory. In the world of Quantum Gravity, the principle of cause and effect no longer holds. Space, particles, quanta only exist when they interact only probabilistically. The book does not get into any quantitative detail for the knowledgeable reader but maybe it can at least provide the outline for the laypersons. It doesn't matter if complex issues like loop quantum gravity or superstrings are best possible answers for the intense situations like blackhole or the beginning of our known universe but this book is a poem. In fact, when Rovelli recites his poem I couldn't stop myself to put his beautiful lyrics into my mouth and suck it like a strawberry. He plays the chord of esoteric quantum gravity in an amazing way that the music infused through my veins to mandate a cosmic orgasm. :)Favorite line:  ""It is only in interactions that nature draws the world."" "
175,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40566664-knowlton-murphy,4,"A book on quantum physics for dumb people! Right up my alley. I do not have a brain for math or physics, so I am deeply indebted to the kind of work Rovelli has produced. I am absolutely sure I did not understand everything, but it was a fun and thought-provoking ride, and the fact that I understood anything is more a mark of Rovelli's skill in communication than my own acuity. The book is worth reading for its summary of the history of physics, and for its accessible explanation of quantum gravity. Rovelli, in general, writes clearly, and entertainingly. My favorite aspect of loop theory is its central prediction that ""...space is not a continuum, it is not divisible ad infinitum, it is formed of 'atoms of space'..."" (168) That is, ""...arbitrarily small chunks of space do not exist. There is a lower limit to the divisibility of space."" (169) What do you know. As a Christian, this is an interesting point because of its theological value: it draws that much more of a distinction between Creator and Created. Finitude is woven into the fabric of our created existence. There is nothing physical we can look to that compares to the infinitude of God. As a human with practical concerns in daily life, this matches my experience of life...I don't have to traverse an infinity of atomic infinities to reach my mug of tea. I can finally stop thinking about swift Achilles chasing that slow tortoise, forever doomed to fail! My second favorite concept is that of reality being relational. It is something I have thought about culturally in seeking to understand my own culture, but Rovelli helped me think about the relational nature of reality beyond the sociological sense. Again, this raised a theological point for me. As a Christian of my particular theological convictions, it makes sense to see the world in terms of relationships, because I believe God is a Trinity, a being who exists eternally in relationship.I was fascinated by Rovelli's guidance through the history of physics. It was cool to see how Democritus' idea of atomic/granular reality has become so validated. I do think that his atomic worldview is nightmarish, though:""There is no finality, no purpose, in this endless dance of atoms. We, just like the rest of the natural world, are one of many products of this infinite dance--the product, that is, of an accidental combination...Our life is a combination of atoms, our thoughts are made up of thin atoms, our dreams are the products of atoms; our hopes and our emotions are written in a language formed by combinations of atoms, which bring us images."" (21, summary by Rovelli)Rovelli returns to Democritus in his penultimate chapter to point out that ""...it is not just a question of these atoms but also of the order in which they are arranged...We are not atoms: we are orders in which atoms are arranged, capable of mirroring other atoms and mirroring ourselves."" (256) For me, this raises a cause for concern. Rovelli can speak romantically about human nature all he wants, but the only hope any of us have for reflecting the kind of good humanity he envisions is for our atoms to order themselves properly. Which according to Democritus is completely subject to accidental chance. Rovelli says atoms can think about themselves (256). This is quite a leap to me, but Rovelli manages it with graceful ease. Random accidents of atomic chance not only create the ordered world I inhabit, but align in such a way to lead to my sentient experience of it...seven billion times over. But I am not a theoretical physicist, so perhaps I just don't have enough faith. Speaking of faith, Rovelli has a flawed view of religion. He seems to think that the role of religion is primarily that of comfort for people who cannot bear the harsh nature of reality. He never suspects that people might be interested in religion as a means of pursuing truth. ""Ignorance can be scary. Out of fear, we tell ourselves calming stories: up there beyond the stars there is an enchanted garden, with a gentle father who will welcome us into his arms. It doesn't matter if it's true--it is reassuring."" Precisely what is reassuring about this system? This isn't historic Christianity, for example, which by and large holds sacred texts like 1 John 1:1-4 and 2 Peter 1:16 (which appeal to the reality of eyewitness as a grounds for believing in truth) or 1 Timothy 4:7 (which specifically tells us to not waste time with myths). Rather, Rovelli is describing existentialism...looking at the absurdity of our existence and seeking comfort in a fabricated view of reality, all the while knowing deep down that it is a lie. Incidentally, that's exactly what Rovelli does. He is convinced that men are not made ""...to live like brutes, but to seek virtue and knowledge"" (263-64, quote from Dante), but never bothers explaining why.Rovelli repeatedly says he wants to keep an open mind in case he is wrong. Clearly his idea of open-mindedness could never entertain supernaturality, though, so one wonders how genuine his claim is, especially in a world where materialists are minorities. Ironically, one of his suggestions for why people choose to be religious is that they ""...prefer to believe in a story just because it was believed by the tribe's ancestors, rather than bravely accept uncertainty."" (262) Wait. What about ancient Democritus, patriarch of the materialism, being right about atomic reality, which was counter-intuitive, and that magnificent list of heroes upon whose shoulders we sit (chapters 1-4)? Does Rovelli really have no mechanism for seeing the parallel? Ah well. The biggest awkward elephant in the room is of course that he doesn't really bother speculating where atoms come from. The closest he comes to saying where our current atoms come from is The Big Bounce (206-07), but it is funny for him to spend so much time talking about how the universe is finite only to gently acknowledge it is also eternal."
176,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5861984-judyta-szaci-o,5,"I can’t really explain what it is that drives me to keep reading books about things I stand no chance to comprehend. This one is probably the most incomprehensible of all that I’ve read on the subject of quantum physics so far, though, admittedly, it is also very skillfully written. Beautifully woven phrases intermingle with claims, terms and equations that I’m not equipped to understand. Even though it is still a pop-science book, on the spectrum of pop-science literature it is quite far removed from Michio Kaku’s light writing (e.g. Parallel Worlds: A Journey through Creation, Higher Dimensions, and the Future of the Cosmos) and much closer to Brian Cox’s level of detail (The Quantum Universe: Everything That Can Happen Does Happen), though Cox’s book was made even more obscure than it had to be by weird thought experiments meant to make it easier for the reader to visualise things, and failing. Rovelli doesn’t bother with thought experiments, he just ‘says it as it is’ in grand style.By no means am I trying to say that reading this book was a waste of my time. Quite the contrary, I did get a slightly better insight to how physicists think, even if I failed – as usual – to comprehend the essentials. Also, this book is the first one I’ve read that talks about an alternative hypothesis to the popular string theory: the loop theory, Rovelli’s (and others) intellectual child. Perhaps the lack of infinite universes makes it less cool in people’s eyes, but I find it comforting that there may not be, after all, countless other ‘mes’ capable of screwing up in innumerable ways!"

Carlo Rovelli has done a remarkable job to put down such complicated concepts into simple, easy to understand language. One of best thing about book is style of connecting all the dots throughout history, right from Democritus's theory of atoms in 400BC to Quantum gravity loop in modern era. Definitely, a must-read for anyone who loves Physics."

But this, this whole book is exactly what I have been looking for for very nearly the past ten years. It opens with a very brief (well, not too brief; it does take about half of what is actually a very short book) overview of classical physics, then general and special relativity, then quantum mechanics, and then dives right in to the heart of the matter: quantum gravity, or loop gravity, or loop quantum gravity; even Rovelli seems to use the terms interchangeably. The writing style was amazing. Fantastic. So light and breezy and conversational. Funny, even (there's really - and I am convinced of this - a ""The name of that man? Albert Einstein."" joke somewhere in chapter 2, and I lost my mind laughing), but still concise. The reader was great; his emphasis was spot-on. I'm half-tempted to listen to it over again and I wish my to-read list wasn't so long because I genuinely would. I enjoyed it that much.I won't lie - I didn't... quite catch on.At no point during this did I feel confused. At all. In fact, I almost feel like maybe the way Rovelli explained quantum gravity seemed... too easy? Space is granular, check. I follow. Time is what happens because we can't understand everything that's happening all the time. That's highly speculative and still, check, I gotcha, I follow. But if you wanted me to tell you what you what quantum gravity is right now? I'm not sure I could. Maybe that's okay though. Maybe that's okay because this is the first book like this - or at least the first one I've been able to get my hands on - and soon I'll be able to devour books on loop quantum gravity the same way I had the chance to eat up string theory before I realized that the point that it was getting to was indeed no point at all (I had to get one in there, so sue me). Maybe Carlo Rovelli is the Brian Greene of quantum gravity. I sure hope so. I could use a lot more books like this."

Statements like the one I used in the epigraph, about human infinite ignorance, resonate with me. I teach mathematics at a university, I have quite an extensive exposure to classical physics, yet my ignorance about modern physics is certainly limitless. (By the way, there is no better way to understand the vastness of one's ignorance than being a professor.)While I will not rate this book by Dr. Rovelli as a masterpiece like 
Seven Brief Lessons on Physics
, it is still a great read and I have learned a lot from it - not only about my lack of knowledge. The author begins with a story about Anaximander of Miletus (450 BCE) whose work contributed to the foundations of Western science and philosophy.  ""The Milesians understand that by shrewdly using observation and reason, rather than searching for answers in fantasy, ancient myths, or religion - and above all by using critical thought in a discriminating way - it is possible to repeatedly correct our worldview and to discover new aspects of reality that are hidden to the common view.""  Progressing through time, we read about Democritus, then through Copernicus, Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, we follow the evolution of human models of reality. Then come Einstein, Heisenberg, Bohr, Dirac - fathers of the modern physics - and we arrive at the ""two pillars of twentieth-century physics - general relativity and quantum mechanics."" General relativity is ""a simple and coherent vision of gravity, space, and time."" Quantum mechanics unveils the three aspects of reality: ""granularity, indeterminism, and relationality.""Part Three, Quantum Space and Relational Time is to me the most fascinating part of the book. General relativity and quantum mechanics, ""the two jewels that the twentieth century has left us,"" seem to contradict each other. ""They cannot both be true, at least not in their present forms."" Chapters 5 through 7 provide an introduction to the loop quantum gravity theory in whose development the author has played one of the key roles.  ""[...] the world described by the theory is far from the one we are familiar with. There is no longer space that ""contains"" the world, and no longer time ""during the course of which"" events occur.""  Part Four, Beyond Space and Time, discusses such aspects of cosmology as Big Bang and black holes. I found the chapter Information the most illuminating. Information is defined as the number of possible alternatives, connections to Boltzmann's statistical mechanics are shown, and the author presents yet another crucial idea - thermal time and its connection with the concept of irreversibility. The author's succinct summary is stunning:  ""Time is an effect of our overlooking the physical microstates of things. Time is the information we don't have. Time is our ignorance.""  I absolutely love the powerful final chapter, Mystery, with its convincing argument why nothing but science can be reliable:  ""The answers given by science [...] are not reliable because they are definitive. They are reliable because they are not definitive.  This is the most powerful argument I have ever heard against all kinds of mumbo-jumbo that ignores science, which is particularly important in the times of a pandemic. The author provides two fascinating historical vignettes: the first about a ""race"" to formalize Einstein's theory between David Hilbert, one of the most famous mathematicians in history, and Albert Einstein. The other vignette is about a little known Belgian priest, Georges Lemaître, who showed that both Einstein in his skepticism about the expansion of the universe as well as pope Pius XII in his declaration that the Big Bang confirms the account of Creation given in Genesis were wrong.Fascinating read!Four-and-a-quarter stars."
182,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4277032-d,5,"I wholeheartedly agree with Manny's review.Applying Occam's razor clearly favors Loop Quantum Gravity (LCG) theory over String theory with its 11 or more dimensions. Amazingly, dropping the 'background' of empty space and time as basic notions simplifies obtaining LCG as a theory that makes General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics compatible. There are even some cosmological experiments that could test LCG: e.g. observing a black hole that expands again (bounces back) would suggest that space/matter is granular, making everything finite, again simplifying matters considerably, it seems. However this experiment shows that, if true, the size of a matter/space quantum should be really small: 10-48m (10 to the power of -48), much smaller than the Planck scale."

I have mixed feelings about the book. Rovelli's prose is quite poetic at times (and perhaps a little damaged in translation from the Italian). I found the historical background quite clear, but when he got to describing quantum gravity, and how space/time do not exist at the most basic level I was lost. That's a shame, because it's the most interesting part of the book. It would also have been nice to have a somewhat broader view of the rest of physics (e.g., String Theory; how does Dark Matter or Dark Energy fit in?). I was also a bit disturbed to read in other reviews that the form of Quantum Gravity being presented here is only the flavor that Rovelli is working on and he has left out other competing versions, which view time quite differently.Finally, and most annoyingly, large chunks of text are reused almost word for word from his previous book Seven Brief Lessons on Physics. If you have read the first, you have already third-to-half of this one (hence 2-stars)."

But when our friendly particle collider @ Geneva, didn't throw out a bunch of predicted supersymmetric particles, the long suspected truth came into the reality that - String theory is not the last word! In contrast to string theory, LQG has been steadily building up and has found much stronger footing.

188,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22241323-judy,3,"Rovelli tells the reader that he’s written with a particular reader in mind: someone who knows little or nothing about today’s physics but is curious to find out what we know, as well as what we don’t yet understand, about the elementary weave of the world. (p 8)I need to acknowledge that Physics has never been my favorite branch of science. However, I've always been intrigued by how Physicists think, so when my niece gave this book 3-stars and said it was ""pretty good,"" I decided to give it a try. I'm reading her copy of the book, so I can't write in it, but I am noting quite a few page numbers, most of which indicate something I want to give some thought. This isn’t going to be a review but rather a list of ideas that are food for thought (to me anyway).p 21: Our life is a combination of atoms, our thoughts are made up of thin atoms, our dreams are the products of atoms; our hopes and our emotions are written in a language formed by combinations of atoms; …That is true at a very fundamental level. (Thin atoms?)p 29: The definitive proof of the ‘atomic hypothesis’ had to wait until 1905. It was found by a rebellious 25 year-old who had studied physics but had not been able to find employment as a scientist …Einstein, of course.p 33: The closure of the ancient schools such as those of Athens and Alexandria, and the destruction of all the texts not in accordance with Christian ideas was vast and systematic …Apparently Plato and Aristotle were viewed as pagans. Democritus was even “worse.” I’d like to read more about these ancient thinkers.p 39: In the world of Democritus as sung by Lucretius -There is no fear of the gods; … There is a deep love of nature, a serene immersion within it; a recognition that we are profoundly part of it; that men, women, animals, plants, and clouds are organic threads of a marvelous whole, without hierarchies.In the Biological or Chemical use of the word, clouds wouldn’t be considered organic, … but this is a Physicist writing. (I think I like Democritus.)p 44: Mathematics allows the world to be described and the future to be predicted.Oh, my!p 47: A reminder:Experimental science begins with Galileo. His experiment is simple: he lets objects fall … and seeks to measure precisely their falling speed.p 69: I don't know enough to appreciate statements such as this one.Newton’s mechanics are not compatible with the existence of a fundamental velocity, because what enters Newton’s equations is acceleration, not velocity.p 81: Einstein, in an “extraordinary stroke of genius” asks:What if Newton’s space is nothing more than the gravitational field? This extremely simple, beautiful, brilliant idea is the theory of general relativity.The words are straightforward, but I can’t appreciate the significance.p 93: For Einstein, the theory of general relativity is a mental image of the world arduously translated into equations.And here’s another idea that seems really important, but I don’t fully grasp.p 153: Rovelli made a valiant attempt at explaining the scale of matter that is the subject of this book … and it surpasses my imagination.It is at this extremely minute scale that quantum gravity manifests itself. To give an idea of the smallness of the scale we are discussing: if we enlarged a walnut shell until it had become as big as the whole observable universe, we would still not see the Planck length. Even after having been enormously magnified thus, it would still be a million times smaller than the actual walnut shell was before magnification. At this scale, space and time change their nature. The become something different; they become ‘quantum space and time.’p 172:  Quanta of gravity are not in space; they are themselves space.Whew! That’s a lot to take in.p 176: If I wanted to pursue time travel, I suspect that I would need a solid understanding of these ideas:Time emerges, like space, from the quantum gravitational field. … The moment we take quantum mechanics into account, we recognize that time too must have those aspects of probabilistic indeterminacy, granularity, and relationality, which are common to all of reality. It becomes a ‘time’ markedly different from all that we have hitherto meant by the word.p 192: Here’s something that both blows me away and strikes me as totally incomprehensible.Every cubic centimeter of space, and every second that passes, is the result of this dancing foam of extremely small quanta. …. Light is formed by quanta of a field; space is nothing more than a field, which is also made of quanta; and time emerges from the processes of this same field. In other words, the world is made entirely from quantum fields.p 225: Ahh, something I do understand (at least to some extent):Stephen Hawking theoretically deduced that black holes are “hot.” They behave like hot bodies: they emit heat. In doing so, they lose energy and hence mass (since energy and mass are the same thing), becoming progressively smaller. They “evaporate.”. This is Hawking’s most important discovery.Maybe, if I read this another three or four or five or … times, just maybe I could summarize the big ideas. But I can’t do that now."
189,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"I had come across references to Carlo Rovelli previously, probably in the books I read by Lee Smolin, so when I saw this come into the library I was interested in checking it out. Rovelli is a leader in research into the ""Loop Quantum Gravity"" approach to fundamental physics, and this book describes that perspective in fairly simple non-mathematical terms, rather than in depth. The book is aimed at the layperson with little knowledge of physics, so it takes the historical approach starting with Democritus and explaining the differences between Newton, relativity and quantum mechanics before getting into the new story. (I hadn't known that LQG was actually first proposed in the early thirties by a Soviet physicist Matvei Bronstejn, who was murdered by Stalin in 1938.) Rovelli represents LQG as the most conservative of the approaches to quantum gravity, being based only on synthesizing general relativity, Standard Model quantum theory and thermodynamics rather than postulating new extra dimensions and totally unknown entities such as strings and branes as string theorists do. Nevertheless it is very radical in what it proposes: that rather than the world existing in space and time, space and time are constructed from the interactions of atomic quantum events. (Atomic in the sense of ""indivisible"", not as in the modern sense of nucleus and electrons; these ""atomic"" quanta of space are millions of time smaller than an atom.) His description of the theory was more understandable than the description by Smolin in the earlier Three Roads to Quantum Gravity, I think partly because the theory has become more developed in the meantime. (This book was published in 2014 in Italian, but since the text mentions the discovery of gravity waves last year it was obviously revised for the English translation.) Of course, without the mathematics I couldn't really understand it (and with the mathematics I certainly couldn't have understood it) but it did give an idea of what the theory is about. Judging by Smolin and Rovelli, LQG theorists are better philosophers than string theorists are; I'm not sure whether that's good or bad for a physicist's reputation."
190,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22926162-in-s-chamarro,4,"I am a lawyer and most certainly a scientific layman, but I am determined to remain an informed fan of science and this is definitely not my first science book. Relativity I can fathom, more or less, quantum physics I am familiar with up to a certain degree, I don't know the Standard Model intimately but at least I recognize what people are talking about when they use the name, string theory I could never really follow but occasionally I keep trying, I am mostly fine with cosmology. It is, however, my first book on loop quantum gravity, and on that level I acknowledge myself speechless. Time is destroyed. Matter is presented as spinfoam, which is even stranger than it sounds. And there are some aspects on information theory I don't think I had heard before, either (then again, information theory gives me headaches, mostly when applied to black holes, so I might have missed out on stuff there earlier). Well. Surprising to say the least. One would think there would have been an announcement or something. The first hundred or so pages are an easy read, as a historical overview of the progress from Democritus to Einstein. From then onwards it becomes a bit of a struggle. I managed to read the historical overview in a day and it took me two weeks to go through the other hundred and fifty pages. I almost gave up twice. However, if you are interested in the subject, have some foreknowledge and you hang on to it you will probably get to it in the end. Personally I think I am going to need a second book on the subject after this introduction. Not sure if am seeking a second explanation or a second medical opinion, really, but the theory does seem worth exploring more in depth."

WHAT?!Do things that happen in nature require a cause in order to be properly explained? The answer to this was a resounding yes back in the days of Newton. This seems rather straightforward and our intuitions back it up. But what we are now finding out from quantum gravity is utterly shocking, and a blow to the cause-and-effect paradigm that helps us make sense of our world. This is a book about the fundamental nature of the universe: what is reality? What is reality made out of? How does it relate with what we know? What does reality mean for our own existence? Why did the universe bang into existence? Will the universe be there forever? What is forever anyway?Once someone thinks things through, then it becomes easy to understand what they are saying because they'll be able to tell you something that is condensed. The author has properly thought through the concepts that explain reality and in this book he summarizes them very well. I had no trouble understanding what he was saying up until the last chapter on Information Theory, but that's okay because he said the theory is not yet solidified. Aside from simplicity, it was also beautiful.It seems that the theories are pointing towards a non-dualistic structure of nature. I hope someday we'll have a grand theory that explains everything.The truth is in the depths. — Democritus"

I thoroughly enjoyed this introduction to the theory behind loop quantum gravity. I thought the author, Carlo Rovelli, did an excellent job of illustrating some complex theoretical physics in a manner that is easy for anybody to understand, whether you are a physics pro or you have very little background in or aptitude for physics. To do this feat, Rovelli started way back in the beginning, way back in Ancient Greece, with Aristotle and Archimedes, and he revisited Greece many times throughout the book. He took a great deal of the book to explain the physics of Einstein in a way that made it even more clear to me, even though I’ve studied relativity before, and the same with the quantum revolution. Rovelli introduced quantum gravity with a high level discussion fit for everybody, flowing language to make it slide down easy, and some excellent illustrations. Although the concepts are difficult and theoretical in nature, the poetic illustrations Rovelli provided made these ideas tangible for anyone to grasp. I listened to the audio version, which was very well done. "

Suffice to say the information was dizzying yet compelling, and if I had the mathematical ability, I'd jump head first into theoretical physics, because it aims to reveal the very nature of reality, which to me, is more fascinating than anything else."
194,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20923295-anton,5,I am in absolute awe. Best read of the year for me. More detailed review to follow.This book is incredible!
195,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,5,"It is always a pleasure when one comes across a book such as this. Theoretical physicist Rovelli, who works in the area relating to Quantum Gravity, goes out of his way to introduce key concepts of his chosen discipline, and successfully manages to communicate its mysteries to us laypersons in language that is clear and informative. We are all made wiser and more appreciative as a result.Rovelli sees his current profession as being the result of a history of ideas about the nature of reality, and he lightly traces out this history, quickly arrives at the Miletians (Thales, Anaximander, etc) and then circa 450 BCE on to Leucippus and his young disciple Democritus and the idea of atomism. In a sense, the stage is now set for the development of further ideas that will ultimately result in Quantum theory and Quantum mechanics. Rovelli traces the acceptance, denial, dismissal, revival of these and associated ideas in a sweeping through-the-centuries overview that is exciting and adventurous, and we soon arrive at Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, and then Einstein and all the other associated physicists we may be more knowledgeable about today.Each step along the way is spelled out clearly and simply. Of course, this is not to say that the reader necessarily understands all the possible implications, but we do begin to see the links between: Space, Time and Spacetime; Particles and Fields; how Spacetime and Fields link to form Covariant Fields; and Fields and Particles combine to form Quantum Fields; and ultimately how Quantum Fields and Spacetime unite to form the “single ingredient”, Covariant Quantum Fields, which Rovelli considers to be the answer to the question “What is the word made of?”This is the conclusion that the author comes to, and his arguments form the rationale of the first three parts of this book. At the same time, he is aware that this view is not necessarily the accepted view of every physicist. His understanding based on loop-theory/loop-quantum-gravity suggests that at the very deepest level his research has lead him, time might very well not exist, nor even particles or quanta (he uses terms such as “Spacetime sushi” and “Spinfoams”) — the suspicion, perhaps, that we may all need to reconsider and/or reevaluate the validity of all current models of reality.Yet Rovelli pushes the envelope even more in Part Four, which is entitled “Beyond Space and Time”, where he explores other issues such as Beyond the Big Bang, Quantum Cosmology, Quantum Black Holes, and the End of Infinity. His final chapter is entitled “Mystery”, where he essentially reminds his readers that there remain more and more unknowns that need to be explored.For the cynics among us (and I would consider myself to be partial to the odd cynicism at times!) all the above is just a load of speculative bull that has no relevance whatever to “real” reality, i.e. what we might call the “four dimensional” Space-Time Continuum. This is the “place” where we as individuals need to position ourselves and negotiate our way about in order to survive and live our lives as happily as possible. Even on this level the title of this book (“Reality Is Not What It Seems”) makes sense — we can be deceived and/or misled by our senses (and even, sometimes, by our intelligence) with very unfortunate results… It could be that thinking too deeply on the “nature” of physical reality is not good for our health and well-being — pretty much the same as, say, for people suffering from schizophrenia or paranoia, or even for a whole slew of physiological, social, religious and psychological reasons: they believe that their experiences are real: for them Reality is exactly what it seems!Whatever one might think about this, it doesn’t mean that this book must needs be dismissed. If you want to know what Quantum Gravity physicists are on about, then this book strikes me as being a very good place to start."

Now I know what the universe is made of, and how to reconcile quantum gravity with the standard model. I truly expected to be left dangling at the end of this book, which takes the reader on a beautifully written, often funny, often moving journey from the ancient greeks to modern day, building up a picture of what we understand are the building blocks of the universe. There's a little bit of maths, but nothing that ought to daunt anyone who did maths in high-school and still remembers it, but mostly it's just a wonderfully written, and incredibly informative narrative.The original text was written in Italian and has been translated, and I could not help reading most of it with an Italian accent. In parts I caught myself waving my hands around as I read it.Makes me want to go and read more by Lee Smolin now."

Rovelli says, ""I don't criticize those who prefer to believe in [Truth and certainty]"" but he says they are ""immersed in ignorance."" He says ""we don't have absolute certainty"" about reality, the hallmark of science, except for his own certainty that what is written in the ""Great Book"" is silly. And somehow for reasons unexplained, being a quantum physicist gives him the means by which to apply the scientific method to all moral questions whatever, where ""it makes little sense to ask whether a half-cut fingernail is still 'me,' or has become 'not-me' . . . or precisely when a child's life begins."" If there is always universal uncertainty for any question whatever, which Rovelli clearly does not confine to questions of science, then by what standard can you judge any action or any belief? "

All the tests, last 100 years, have proven general relativity and quantum mechanics correct. The problem happens when we look at extremes they can't be both correct. Especially gravity. Quantum gravity removes infinity, removes singularity and takes Democritus to the word. Basic component of space is the ATOM. And it is the size of the Planck length. As for time, there is not time, there is entropy."

I love Rovelli's writing so much! ❤️❤️❤️ Keywords: popular science, physics, astronomy, cosmology, general relativity, loop quantum gravity, big bounce   ""The curiousity to learn, to discover, to look over the next hill, the desire to taste the apple; these are the things which make us human.""   REVIEW  Have you ever heard about Big Bounce? It's an alternate theory to Big Bang, that maybe the universe as we know it is a result of contracting and expanding explosion. Reality is Not What it Seems, tells about this theory and the theory that become the core of big bounce: loop quantum gravity. Loop quantum gravity is a theory that will unite relativity and quantum mechanics, two which are very opposite of each other.  The Explanation is Easy to Understand  This book is written in very clear and slow explanations. Things are explained in layman terms, that even people who doesn't know physics will understand. His topic escalate slowly, from the foundation to the hardest part of the theory. From what is atoms, to what is field, gravitation, time, universe and so on escalate until quantum loop gravity. He often compares today's scientific theories with philosophies from ancient time; mentioned ancient philosophers and tells us their contribution to building of nowadays's science. There are many new insights I didn't know before and albeit the topic of quantum loop gravity itself very hard, I can quite grasp the bigger picture due to this book.  I love his humility  I also love how Carlo Rovelli is very humble. He always mentioned that he himself is not certain. Do not believe something with blind faith because our scientific knowledges have a limit and what we thought is true may be proven otherwise later. He encourage scientific thinking, that is to never fear of learning and unlearning things that we know. Conclusion  The topic of this book is very specific so unless you really curious about it you might not enjoy it. But the explanation is easy to understand so you don't need to fear that it will be hard to read. I recommend this to those who want to know more about astronomy, astrophysics, or physics itself in general.   ""Science is continual exploration of ways of thinking. Its strength is its visionary capacity to demolish preconceived ideas, to reveal new regions of reality, and to construct novel and more effective images of the world. This adventure rests upon the entirety of past knowledge, but at its heart is change. The world is boundless and iridescent, we want to go and see it. We are immersed in its mystery and in its beauty, and over the horizon there is unexplored territory. The incompleteness and the uncertainty of our knowledges, our precariousness, suspended over the abyss of the immensity of what we don't know, doesn't render life meaningless, it makes it interesting and precious.""  "
203,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"Carlo Rovelli's first book (aside from 7 Brief Lessons...), Reality is Not What it Seems, is a beautiful narrative regarding the foundational human conceptions of the fabric of reality ranging from Democritus and Anaximander's conception of the apeiron (""the primal substance of which everything is formed"") and concluding at the precipice of modern theoretic physics: Quantum Gravity. Rovelli begins by setting the stage of modern theoretical physics by first introducing the historical conceptions of the nature of reality, discussing ideas from ancient minds such as Democritus, Lucretius, and Anaximander who together postulated an astoundingly clarivoyant theory that everything was comprised of super-small components called ""atoms"" (humanity would have to wait for proof of such a claim until 1905). With a brief digression into some pleasing philosophical musings of the aforementioned thinkers, necessitated by the inability to test any of these theories, Rovelli moves on to explain the original of classical mechanics.Moving forwards in time (inside joke-- read the book!), Rovelli elegantly and relevantly presents the origins of several seminal ideas in classical mechanics like gravity (Galileo + Newton) planetary motion (Copernicus & Newton), the mathematical foundations upon which such theories were based (Plato/Aristotle/Pythagoras/etc - that physical processes could be modeled with mathematics), and the physical and philosophical implications of the new ways of thinking about the world. Not even a few centuries go by before Faraday, Maxwell, and their co-intellectuals of the 1800s arrive on the scene and postulate the notion of an ""Electro-Magnetic Field"", solving some of the greatest mysteries about the forces of electricity and magnetism by presenting a mathematical model of particles and fields that move through space and time. Upon the shoulders of such great conceivers, Einstein publishes a series of seminal papers that almost literally invoke a formal conception of ""atomic physics"", or ""particle physics""-- not only does Einstein prove that atoms exist, he also proves (via irrefutable mathematical models that predict reality down to the ump-teenth decimal place) that time is not consistent for all matter within space, AND that space and time themselves may be constituted by the notion of a Gravitational Field (with a stroke of genius, he applies Maxwell's conception of fields and particles to gravity!). The descriptions of special relativity, quantum mechanics, and general relativity are all eloquently and concisely explained by Rovelli, thus I choose to not digress here into any explanation of such awesome theories of reality and instead implore you to read the book! Throughout this section, short digressions into the theories and contributions of seminal quantum physicists such as Dirac, Heisenberg, Bohr, Wheeler, Feyman, etc., are discussed for support and insight for the nuanced non-intuitive conceptions of reality portrayed. This section is concluded with a thorough yet concise explanation of the three pillars of quantum mechanics: granularity, indeterminacy, and relationality. Perhaps the most intriguing of which to me was the notion that our universe is finite-but-without-boundaries: Einstein conceived of such a property of the universe with the notion of a 3-sphere-- yet again I implore you to read the book!The 3rd section of the book and, in my opinion, crown jewel, is focused on an elaboration of the theory of Quantum Gravity. Without diving too deep, in an attempt to let Rovelli's art stand on its own: The theory of quantum gravity, along with its components (loop theory, spin-networks, spinfoam, etc), is an incredibly intriguing conception of physical reality with which a quantum-field theory of spacetime is theorized. No longer is space some inert container, but is comprised of quanta and the relationships between them; No longer is time a parameter to the functions and equations of such a physics, but is simply the evolution of the relations of said quanta! A human's conception of space and time emerge as the manifestation of the evolution of such relationships between the inconceivably small quanta (particles) of the quantum field of space time itself-- such quanta are not IN space, nor are they evolving IN time: the quanta and their relationships ARE space, and their (indeterminate) evolutions PRODUCE the conception of time. Admittedly, I had to re-read chapters of this section due to the non-intuitive nature of such a conception of reality; But, I reread them because I wanted to, and was so deeply intrigued by the subject matter during the first pass that I felt compelled to go back and read this section (all 50 pages) a second time around in an attempt to understand it better. I, like Rovelli, believe that to understand a theory in any scientific domain, one must first become familiar with the ""episteme"" (- Foucault) or underlying scientific and philosophical framework from whence the theories came; Thus, I thoroughly enjoyed the progression of the book, and the attention to detail that Rovelli gave to ancient (Greek) conceptions of what reality might be comprised, and how these conceptions evolved through the centuries, discovered or invented by the great minds such as Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, Einstein, and now, quantum gravity theorists! I finished this book with a greater holistic understanding of ways in which to think about physical reality, and excitedly: a potential theory that might traverse the chasm between general relativity and quantum mechanics!Rovelli concludes the book by pushing even further into the unknown. He first discusses how the new theory of Quantum Gravity is being tested, confirming certain theories about the inception (or continuation) of our universe (think: The Big Bang... or, The Big Bounce!), and how it may play large role in the future of astronomy, ultimately better describing our universe at a macro scale than general relativity does! Venturing even further, Rovelli postulates interesting techniques for interpreting still-confounding aspects of reality with ideas such as the potential application of information theory to quantum mechanics, how time might be best quantified by (and even integrated mathematically into) thermodynamic phenomena, and how the notion of infinity (within any conception of physical reality) might have a place after all: reality might be truly be finite, at the most foundational level.I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did. It has presented to me a world of ideas-- the greater understanding of which I will pursue for the rest of my life-- in addition to the universe of ways (hopefully a finite 3-sphere) in which to better conceive reality."
204,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38087945-farha-crystal,4,"Are we so imprisoned in our consciousness, like the slaves in Plato's Cave, can't break loose of our chains?I can never make peace with Zeno's paradox. Oh! Rovelli, for peace and order's sake, can you please at least talk some sweet words to forget my misery for the chaos driven by Zeno's paradox? :) The concept of Infinity, as well as time, is only our ignorance, our limitations. In this book, Rovelli talks about the basic ideas behind loop quantum gravity, considering the feature of granularity, indeterminacy and probabilistic behavior. Loop quantum gravity, tries to combine general relativity with quantum field theory. In the world of Quantum Gravity, the principle of cause and effect no longer holds. Space, particles, quanta only exist when they interact only probabilistically. The book does not get into any quantitative detail for the knowledgeable reader but maybe it can at least provide the outline for the laypersons. It doesn't matter if complex issues like loop quantum gravity or superstrings are best possible answers for the intense situations like blackhole or the beginning of our known universe but this book is a poem. In fact, when Rovelli recites his poem I couldn't stop myself to put his beautiful lyrics into my mouth and suck it like a strawberry. He plays the chord of esoteric quantum gravity in an amazing way that the music infused through my veins to mandate a cosmic orgasm. :)Favorite line:  ""It is only in interactions that nature draws the world."" "
205,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40566664-knowlton-murphy,4,"A book on quantum physics for dumb people! Right up my alley. I do not have a brain for math or physics, so I am deeply indebted to the kind of work Rovelli has produced. I am absolutely sure I did not understand everything, but it was a fun and thought-provoking ride, and the fact that I understood anything is more a mark of Rovelli's skill in communication than my own acuity. The book is worth reading for its summary of the history of physics, and for its accessible explanation of quantum gravity. Rovelli, in general, writes clearly, and entertainingly. My favorite aspect of loop theory is its central prediction that ""...space is not a continuum, it is not divisible ad infinitum, it is formed of 'atoms of space'..."" (168) That is, ""...arbitrarily small chunks of space do not exist. There is a lower limit to the divisibility of space."" (169) What do you know. As a Christian, this is an interesting point because of its theological value: it draws that much more of a distinction between Creator and Created. Finitude is woven into the fabric of our created existence. There is nothing physical we can look to that compares to the infinitude of God. As a human with practical concerns in daily life, this matches my experience of life...I don't have to traverse an infinity of atomic infinities to reach my mug of tea. I can finally stop thinking about swift Achilles chasing that slow tortoise, forever doomed to fail! My second favorite concept is that of reality being relational. It is something I have thought about culturally in seeking to understand my own culture, but Rovelli helped me think about the relational nature of reality beyond the sociological sense. Again, this raised a theological point for me. As a Christian of my particular theological convictions, it makes sense to see the world in terms of relationships, because I believe God is a Trinity, a being who exists eternally in relationship.I was fascinated by Rovelli's guidance through the history of physics. It was cool to see how Democritus' idea of atomic/granular reality has become so validated. I do think that his atomic worldview is nightmarish, though:""There is no finality, no purpose, in this endless dance of atoms. We, just like the rest of the natural world, are one of many products of this infinite dance--the product, that is, of an accidental combination...Our life is a combination of atoms, our thoughts are made up of thin atoms, our dreams are the products of atoms; our hopes and our emotions are written in a language formed by combinations of atoms, which bring us images."" (21, summary by Rovelli)Rovelli returns to Democritus in his penultimate chapter to point out that ""...it is not just a question of these atoms but also of the order in which they are arranged...We are not atoms: we are orders in which atoms are arranged, capable of mirroring other atoms and mirroring ourselves."" (256) For me, this raises a cause for concern. Rovelli can speak romantically about human nature all he wants, but the only hope any of us have for reflecting the kind of good humanity he envisions is for our atoms to order themselves properly. Which according to Democritus is completely subject to accidental chance. Rovelli says atoms can think about themselves (256). This is quite a leap to me, but Rovelli manages it with graceful ease. Random accidents of atomic chance not only create the ordered world I inhabit, but align in such a way to lead to my sentient experience of it...seven billion times over. But I am not a theoretical physicist, so perhaps I just don't have enough faith. Speaking of faith, Rovelli has a flawed view of religion. He seems to think that the role of religion is primarily that of comfort for people who cannot bear the harsh nature of reality. He never suspects that people might be interested in religion as a means of pursuing truth. ""Ignorance can be scary. Out of fear, we tell ourselves calming stories: up there beyond the stars there is an enchanted garden, with a gentle father who will welcome us into his arms. It doesn't matter if it's true--it is reassuring."" Precisely what is reassuring about this system? This isn't historic Christianity, for example, which by and large holds sacred texts like 1 John 1:1-4 and 2 Peter 1:16 (which appeal to the reality of eyewitness as a grounds for believing in truth) or 1 Timothy 4:7 (which specifically tells us to not waste time with myths). Rather, Rovelli is describing existentialism...looking at the absurdity of our existence and seeking comfort in a fabricated view of reality, all the while knowing deep down that it is a lie. Incidentally, that's exactly what Rovelli does. He is convinced that men are not made ""...to live like brutes, but to seek virtue and knowledge"" (263-64, quote from Dante), but never bothers explaining why.Rovelli repeatedly says he wants to keep an open mind in case he is wrong. Clearly his idea of open-mindedness could never entertain supernaturality, though, so one wonders how genuine his claim is, especially in a world where materialists are minorities. Ironically, one of his suggestions for why people choose to be religious is that they ""...prefer to believe in a story just because it was believed by the tribe's ancestors, rather than bravely accept uncertainty."" (262) Wait. What about ancient Democritus, patriarch of the materialism, being right about atomic reality, which was counter-intuitive, and that magnificent list of heroes upon whose shoulders we sit (chapters 1-4)? Does Rovelli really have no mechanism for seeing the parallel? Ah well. The biggest awkward elephant in the room is of course that he doesn't really bother speculating where atoms come from. The closest he comes to saying where our current atoms come from is The Big Bounce (206-07), but it is funny for him to spend so much time talking about how the universe is finite only to gently acknowledge it is also eternal."
206,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5861984-judyta-szaci-o,5,"I can’t really explain what it is that drives me to keep reading books about things I stand no chance to comprehend. This one is probably the most incomprehensible of all that I’ve read on the subject of quantum physics so far, though, admittedly, it is also very skillfully written. Beautifully woven phrases intermingle with claims, terms and equations that I’m not equipped to understand. Even though it is still a pop-science book, on the spectrum of pop-science literature it is quite far removed from Michio Kaku’s light writing (e.g. Parallel Worlds: A Journey through Creation, Higher Dimensions, and the Future of the Cosmos) and much closer to Brian Cox’s level of detail (The Quantum Universe: Everything That Can Happen Does Happen), though Cox’s book was made even more obscure than it had to be by weird thought experiments meant to make it easier for the reader to visualise things, and failing. Rovelli doesn’t bother with thought experiments, he just ‘says it as it is’ in grand style.By no means am I trying to say that reading this book was a waste of my time. Quite the contrary, I did get a slightly better insight to how physicists think, even if I failed – as usual – to comprehend the essentials. Also, this book is the first one I’ve read that talks about an alternative hypothesis to the popular string theory: the loop theory, Rovelli’s (and others) intellectual child. Perhaps the lack of infinite universes makes it less cool in people’s eyes, but I find it comforting that there may not be, after all, countless other ‘mes’ capable of screwing up in innumerable ways!"

Carlo Rovelli has done a remarkable job to put down such complicated concepts into simple, easy to understand language. One of best thing about book is style of connecting all the dots throughout history, right from Democritus's theory of atoms in 400BC to Quantum gravity loop in modern era. Definitely, a must-read for anyone who loves Physics."

209,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4461733-paperclippe,5,"Thank goodness for Carlo Rovelli and thank goodness for quantum gravity.I am and have been so sick and tired of pop-sci books and their final parts and chapters always being about string theory (readers of my reviews will undoubtedly know this by now). But this, this whole book is exactly what I have been looking for for very nearly the past ten years. It opens with a very brief (well, not too brief; it does take about half of what is actually a very short book) overview of classical physics, then general and special relativity, then quantum mechanics, and then dives right in to the heart of the matter: quantum gravity, or loop gravity, or loop quantum gravity; even Rovelli seems to use the terms interchangeably. The writing style was amazing. Fantastic. So light and breezy and conversational. Funny, even (there's really - and I am convinced of this - a ""The name of that man? Albert Einstein."" joke somewhere in chapter 2, and I lost my mind laughing), but still concise. The reader was great; his emphasis was spot-on. I'm half-tempted to listen to it over again and I wish my to-read list wasn't so long because I genuinely would. I enjoyed it that much.I won't lie - I didn't... quite catch on.At no point during this did I feel confused. At all. In fact, I almost feel like maybe the way Rovelli explained quantum gravity seemed... too easy? Space is granular, check. I follow. Time is what happens because we can't understand everything that's happening all the time. That's highly speculative and still, check, I gotcha, I follow. But if you wanted me to tell you what you what quantum gravity is right now? I'm not sure I could. Maybe that's okay though. Maybe that's okay because this is the first book like this - or at least the first one I've been able to get my hands on - and soon I'll be able to devour books on loop quantum gravity the same way I had the chance to eat up string theory before I realized that the point that it was getting to was indeed no point at all (I had to get one in there, so sue me). Maybe Carlo Rovelli is the Brian Greene of quantum gravity. I sure hope so. I could use a lot more books like this."

But then, who really does??This is the first physics text I've read clearly written after the Higgs boson was found and super symmetry was not confirmed at the LHC, which seems to have shifted the balance between the competing theories of loop quantum gravity and string theory."
211,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2989615-lukasz-pruski,4,"""The only truly infinite thing is our ignorance.""I love reading works by Carlo Rovelli, one of the world's top physicists, and - in my view - the best ever popularizer of modern physics. Statements like the one I used in the epigraph, about human infinite ignorance, resonate with me. I teach mathematics at a university, I have quite an extensive exposure to classical physics, yet my ignorance about modern physics is certainly limitless. (By the way, there is no better way to understand the vastness of one's ignorance than being a professor.)While I will not rate this book by Dr. Rovelli as a masterpiece like 
Seven Brief Lessons on Physics
, it is still a great read and I have learned a lot from it - not only about my lack of knowledge. The author begins with a story about Anaximander of Miletus (450 BCE) whose work contributed to the foundations of Western science and philosophy.  ""The Milesians understand that by shrewdly using observation and reason, rather than searching for answers in fantasy, ancient myths, or religion - and above all by using critical thought in a discriminating way - it is possible to repeatedly correct our worldview and to discover new aspects of reality that are hidden to the common view.""  Progressing through time, we read about Democritus, then through Copernicus, Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, we follow the evolution of human models of reality. Then come Einstein, Heisenberg, Bohr, Dirac - fathers of the modern physics - and we arrive at the ""two pillars of twentieth-century physics - general relativity and quantum mechanics."" General relativity is ""a simple and coherent vision of gravity, space, and time."" Quantum mechanics unveils the three aspects of reality: ""granularity, indeterminism, and relationality.""Part Three, Quantum Space and Relational Time is to me the most fascinating part of the book. General relativity and quantum mechanics, ""the two jewels that the twentieth century has left us,"" seem to contradict each other. ""They cannot both be true, at least not in their present forms."" Chapters 5 through 7 provide an introduction to the loop quantum gravity theory in whose development the author has played one of the key roles.  ""[...] the world described by the theory is far from the one we are familiar with. There is no longer space that ""contains"" the world, and no longer time ""during the course of which"" events occur.""  Part Four, Beyond Space and Time, discusses such aspects of cosmology as Big Bang and black holes. I found the chapter Information the most illuminating. Information is defined as the number of possible alternatives, connections to Boltzmann's statistical mechanics are shown, and the author presents yet another crucial idea - thermal time and its connection with the concept of irreversibility. The author's succinct summary is stunning:  ""Time is an effect of our overlooking the physical microstates of things. Time is the information we don't have. Time is our ignorance.""  I absolutely love the powerful final chapter, Mystery, with its convincing argument why nothing but science can be reliable:  ""The answers given by science [...] are not reliable because they are definitive. They are reliable because they are not definitive.  This is the most powerful argument I have ever heard against all kinds of mumbo-jumbo that ignores science, which is particularly important in the times of a pandemic. The author provides two fascinating historical vignettes: the first about a ""race"" to formalize Einstein's theory between David Hilbert, one of the most famous mathematicians in history, and Albert Einstein. The other vignette is about a little known Belgian priest, Georges Lemaître, who showed that both Einstein in his skepticism about the expansion of the universe as well as pope Pius XII in his declaration that the Big Bang confirms the account of Creation given in Genesis were wrong.Fascinating read!Four-and-a-quarter stars."
212,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4277032-d,5,"I wholeheartedly agree with Manny's review.Applying Occam's razor clearly favors Loop Quantum Gravity (LCG) theory over String theory with its 11 or more dimensions. Amazingly, dropping the 'background' of empty space and time as basic notions simplifies obtaining LCG as a theory that makes General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics compatible. There are even some cosmological experiments that could test LCG: e.g. observing a black hole that expands again (bounces back) would suggest that space/matter is granular, making everything finite, again simplifying matters considerably, it seems. However this experiment shows that, if true, the size of a matter/space quantum should be really small: 10-48m (10 to the power of -48), much smaller than the Planck scale."
213,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,2,"39th book for 2017. A relatively quick read on modern physics starting with the Ancient Greeks and ending with Quantum Gravity. I have mixed feelings about the book. Rovelli's prose is quite poetic at times (and perhaps a little damaged in translation from the Italian). I found the historical background quite clear, but when he got to describing quantum gravity, and how space/time do not exist at the most basic level I was lost. That's a shame, because it's the most interesting part of the book. It would also have been nice to have a somewhat broader view of the rest of physics (e.g., String Theory; how does Dark Matter or Dark Energy fit in?). I was also a bit disturbed to read in other reviews that the form of Quantum Gravity being presented here is only the flavor that Rovelli is working on and he has left out other competing versions, which view time quite differently.Finally, and most annoyingly, large chunks of text are reused almost word for word from his previous book Seven Brief Lessons on Physics. If you have read the first, you have already third-to-half of this one (hence 2-stars)."
214,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4482895-shabbeer-hassan,5,"Move over string theory, here comes your replacement - LQG (Loop Quantum Gravity)! For decades, the only approach dominating to resolve the grand unification problem was the string theory and if like me you saw Brian Greene's dramatically made TV documentary then you might have been fooled into believing we have indeed solved it. But when our friendly particle collider @ Geneva, didn't throw out a bunch of predicted supersymmetric particles, the long suspected truth came into the reality that - String theory is not the last word! In contrast to string theory, LQG has been steadily building up and has found much stronger footing. Carlo starts from antiquity in ancient Greece to the original apple guy Newton and to our generation's greatest genius maverick Einstein, before introducing LQG. A short book with beautiful explanations of some rather tough concepts. A fun read, to say the least!My Rating - 5/5"

218,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22241323-judy,3,"Rovelli tells the reader that he’s written with a particular reader in mind: someone who knows little or nothing about today’s physics but is curious to find out what we know, as well as what we don’t yet understand, about the elementary weave of the world. (p 8)I need to acknowledge that Physics has never been my favorite branch of science. However, I've always been intrigued by how Physicists think, so when my niece gave this book 3-stars and said it was ""pretty good,"" I decided to give it a try. I'm reading her copy of the book, so I can't write in it, but I am noting quite a few page numbers, most of which indicate something I want to give some thought. This isn’t going to be a review but rather a list of ideas that are food for thought (to me anyway).p 21: Our life is a combination of atoms, our thoughts are made up of thin atoms, our dreams are the products of atoms; our hopes and our emotions are written in a language formed by combinations of atoms; …That is true at a very fundamental level. (Thin atoms?)p 29: The definitive proof of the ‘atomic hypothesis’ had to wait until 1905. It was found by a rebellious 25 year-old who had studied physics but had not been able to find employment as a scientist …Einstein, of course.p 33: The closure of the ancient schools such as those of Athens and Alexandria, and the destruction of all the texts not in accordance with Christian ideas was vast and systematic …Apparently Plato and Aristotle were viewed as pagans. Democritus was even “worse.” I’d like to read more about these ancient thinkers.p 39: In the world of Democritus as sung by Lucretius -There is no fear of the gods; … There is a deep love of nature, a serene immersion within it; a recognition that we are profoundly part of it; that men, women, animals, plants, and clouds are organic threads of a marvelous whole, without hierarchies.In the Biological or Chemical use of the word, clouds wouldn’t be considered organic, … but this is a Physicist writing. (I think I like Democritus.)p 44: Mathematics allows the world to be described and the future to be predicted.Oh, my!p 47: A reminder:Experimental science begins with Galileo. His experiment is simple: he lets objects fall … and seeks to measure precisely their falling speed.p 69: I don't know enough to appreciate statements such as this one.Newton’s mechanics are not compatible with the existence of a fundamental velocity, because what enters Newton’s equations is acceleration, not velocity.p 81: Einstein, in an “extraordinary stroke of genius” asks:What if Newton’s space is nothing more than the gravitational field? This extremely simple, beautiful, brilliant idea is the theory of general relativity.The words are straightforward, but I can’t appreciate the significance.p 93: For Einstein, the theory of general relativity is a mental image of the world arduously translated into equations.And here’s another idea that seems really important, but I don’t fully grasp.p 153: Rovelli made a valiant attempt at explaining the scale of matter that is the subject of this book … and it surpasses my imagination.It is at this extremely minute scale that quantum gravity manifests itself. To give an idea of the smallness of the scale we are discussing: if we enlarged a walnut shell until it had become as big as the whole observable universe, we would still not see the Planck length. Even after having been enormously magnified thus, it would still be a million times smaller than the actual walnut shell was before magnification. At this scale, space and time change their nature. The become something different; they become ‘quantum space and time.’p 172:  Quanta of gravity are not in space; they are themselves space.Whew! That’s a lot to take in.p 176: If I wanted to pursue time travel, I suspect that I would need a solid understanding of these ideas:Time emerges, like space, from the quantum gravitational field. … The moment we take quantum mechanics into account, we recognize that time too must have those aspects of probabilistic indeterminacy, granularity, and relationality, which are common to all of reality. It becomes a ‘time’ markedly different from all that we have hitherto meant by the word.p 192: Here’s something that both blows me away and strikes me as totally incomprehensible.Every cubic centimeter of space, and every second that passes, is the result of this dancing foam of extremely small quanta. …. Light is formed by quanta of a field; space is nothing more than a field, which is also made of quanta; and time emerges from the processes of this same field. In other words, the world is made entirely from quantum fields.p 225: Ahh, something I do understand (at least to some extent):Stephen Hawking theoretically deduced that black holes are “hot.” They behave like hot bodies: they emit heat. In doing so, they lose energy and hence mass (since energy and mass are the same thing), becoming progressively smaller. They “evaporate.”. This is Hawking’s most important discovery.Maybe, if I read this another three or four or five or … times, just maybe I could summarize the big ideas. But I can’t do that now."
219,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"I had come across references to Carlo Rovelli previously, probably in the books I read by Lee Smolin, so when I saw this come into the library I was interested in checking it out. Rovelli is a leader in research into the ""Loop Quantum Gravity"" approach to fundamental physics, and this book describes that perspective in fairly simple non-mathematical terms, rather than in depth. The book is aimed at the layperson with little knowledge of physics, so it takes the historical approach starting with Democritus and explaining the differences between Newton, relativity and quantum mechanics before getting into the new story. (I hadn't known that LQG was actually first proposed in the early thirties by a Soviet physicist Matvei Bronstejn, who was murdered by Stalin in 1938.) Rovelli represents LQG as the most conservative of the approaches to quantum gravity, being based only on synthesizing general relativity, Standard Model quantum theory and thermodynamics rather than postulating new extra dimensions and totally unknown entities such as strings and branes as string theorists do. Nevertheless it is very radical in what it proposes: that rather than the world existing in space and time, space and time are constructed from the interactions of atomic quantum events. (Atomic in the sense of ""indivisible"", not as in the modern sense of nucleus and electrons; these ""atomic"" quanta of space are millions of time smaller than an atom.) His description of the theory was more understandable than the description by Smolin in the earlier Three Roads to Quantum Gravity, I think partly because the theory has become more developed in the meantime. (This book was published in 2014 in Italian, but since the text mentions the discovery of gravity waves last year it was obviously revised for the English translation.) Of course, without the mathematics I couldn't really understand it (and with the mathematics I certainly couldn't have understood it) but it did give an idea of what the theory is about. Judging by Smolin and Rovelli, LQG theorists are better philosophers than string theorists are; I'm not sure whether that's good or bad for a physicist's reputation."
220,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22926162-in-s-chamarro,4,"I am a lawyer and most certainly a scientific layman, but I am determined to remain an informed fan of science and this is definitely not my first science book. Relativity I can fathom, more or less, quantum physics I am familiar with up to a certain degree, I don't know the Standard Model intimately but at least I recognize what people are talking about when they use the name, string theory I could never really follow but occasionally I keep trying, I am mostly fine with cosmology. It is, however, my first book on loop quantum gravity, and on that level I acknowledge myself speechless. Time is destroyed. Matter is presented as spinfoam, which is even stranger than it sounds. And there are some aspects on information theory I don't think I had heard before, either (then again, information theory gives me headaches, mostly when applied to black holes, so I might have missed out on stuff there earlier). Well. Surprising to say the least. One would think there would have been an announcement or something. The first hundred or so pages are an easy read, as a historical overview of the progress from Democritus to Einstein. From then onwards it becomes a bit of a struggle. I managed to read the historical overview in a day and it took me two weeks to go through the other hundred and fifty pages. I almost gave up twice. However, if you are interested in the subject, have some foreknowledge and you hang on to it you will probably get to it in the end. Personally I think I am going to need a second book on the subject after this introduction. Not sure if am seeking a second explanation or a second medical opinion, really, but the theory does seem worth exploring more in depth."

WHAT?!Do things that happen in nature require a cause in order to be properly explained? The answer to this was a resounding yes back in the days of Newton. This seems rather straightforward and our intuitions back it up. But what we are now finding out from quantum gravity is utterly shocking, and a blow to the cause-and-effect paradigm that helps us make sense of our world. This is a book about the fundamental nature of the universe: what is reality? What is reality made out of? How does it relate with what we know? What does reality mean for our own existence? Why did the universe bang into existence? Will the universe be there forever? What is forever anyway?Once someone thinks things through, then it becomes easy to understand what they are saying because they'll be able to tell you something that is condensed. The author has properly thought through the concepts that explain reality and in this book he summarizes them very well. I had no trouble understanding what he was saying up until the last chapter on Information Theory, but that's okay because he said the theory is not yet solidified. Aside from simplicity, it was also beautiful.It seems that the theories are pointing towards a non-dualistic structure of nature. I hope someday we'll have a grand theory that explains everything.The truth is in the depths. — Democritus"

I thoroughly enjoyed this introduction to the theory behind loop quantum gravity. I thought the author, Carlo Rovelli, did an excellent job of illustrating some complex theoretical physics in a manner that is easy for anybody to understand, whether you are a physics pro or you have very little background in or aptitude for physics. To do this feat, Rovelli started way back in the beginning, way back in Ancient Greece, with Aristotle and Archimedes, and he revisited Greece many times throughout the book. He took a great deal of the book to explain the physics of Einstein in a way that made it even more clear to me, even though I’ve studied relativity before, and the same with the quantum revolution. Rovelli introduced quantum gravity with a high level discussion fit for everybody, flowing language to make it slide down easy, and some excellent illustrations. Although the concepts are difficult and theoretical in nature, the poetic illustrations Rovelli provided made these ideas tangible for anyone to grasp. I listened to the audio version, which was very well done. "

225,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,5,"It is always a pleasure when one comes across a book such as this. Theoretical physicist Rovelli, who works in the area relating to Quantum Gravity, goes out of his way to introduce key concepts of his chosen discipline, and successfully manages to communicate its mysteries to us laypersons in language that is clear and informative. We are all made wiser and more appreciative as a result.Rovelli sees his current profession as being the result of a history of ideas about the nature of reality, and he lightly traces out this history, quickly arrives at the Miletians (Thales, Anaximander, etc) and then circa 450 BCE on to Leucippus and his young disciple Democritus and the idea of atomism. In a sense, the stage is now set for the development of further ideas that will ultimately result in Quantum theory and Quantum mechanics. Rovelli traces the acceptance, denial, dismissal, revival of these and associated ideas in a sweeping through-the-centuries overview that is exciting and adventurous, and we soon arrive at Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, and then Einstein and all the other associated physicists we may be more knowledgeable about today.Each step along the way is spelled out clearly and simply. Of course, this is not to say that the reader necessarily understands all the possible implications, but we do begin to see the links between: Space, Time and Spacetime; Particles and Fields; how Spacetime and Fields link to form Covariant Fields; and Fields and Particles combine to form Quantum Fields; and ultimately how Quantum Fields and Spacetime unite to form the “single ingredient”, Covariant Quantum Fields, which Rovelli considers to be the answer to the question “What is the word made of?”This is the conclusion that the author comes to, and his arguments form the rationale of the first three parts of this book. At the same time, he is aware that this view is not necessarily the accepted view of every physicist. His understanding based on loop-theory/loop-quantum-gravity suggests that at the very deepest level his research has lead him, time might very well not exist, nor even particles or quanta (he uses terms such as “Spacetime sushi” and “Spinfoams”) — the suspicion, perhaps, that we may all need to reconsider and/or reevaluate the validity of all current models of reality.Yet Rovelli pushes the envelope even more in Part Four, which is entitled “Beyond Space and Time”, where he explores other issues such as Beyond the Big Bang, Quantum Cosmology, Quantum Black Holes, and the End of Infinity. His final chapter is entitled “Mystery”, where he essentially reminds his readers that there remain more and more unknowns that need to be explored.For the cynics among us (and I would consider myself to be partial to the odd cynicism at times!) all the above is just a load of speculative bull that has no relevance whatever to “real” reality, i.e. what we might call the “four dimensional” Space-Time Continuum. This is the “place” where we as individuals need to position ourselves and negotiate our way about in order to survive and live our lives as happily as possible. Even on this level the title of this book (“Reality Is Not What It Seems”) makes sense — we can be deceived and/or misled by our senses (and even, sometimes, by our intelligence) with very unfortunate results… It could be that thinking too deeply on the “nature” of physical reality is not good for our health and well-being — pretty much the same as, say, for people suffering from schizophrenia or paranoia, or even for a whole slew of physiological, social, religious and psychological reasons: they believe that their experiences are real: for them Reality is exactly what it seems!Whatever one might think about this, it doesn’t mean that this book must needs be dismissed. If you want to know what Quantum Gravity physicists are on about, then this book strikes me as being a very good place to start."

Now I know what the universe is made of, and how to reconcile quantum gravity with the standard model. I truly expected to be left dangling at the end of this book, which takes the reader on a beautifully written, often funny, often moving journey from the ancient greeks to modern day, building up a picture of what we understand are the building blocks of the universe. There's a little bit of maths, but nothing that ought to daunt anyone who did maths in high-school and still remembers it, but mostly it's just a wonderfully written, and incredibly informative narrative.The original text was written in Italian and has been translated, and I could not help reading most of it with an Italian accent. In parts I caught myself waving my hands around as I read it.Makes me want to go and read more by Lee Smolin now."
227,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1920850-nate-ahern,3,"Good and interesting but gets too big for its britches in the last chapter. Rovelli says, ""I don't criticize those who prefer to believe in [Truth and certainty]"" but he says they are ""immersed in ignorance."" He says ""we don't have absolute certainty"" about reality, the hallmark of science, except for his own certainty that what is written in the ""Great Book"" is silly. And somehow for reasons unexplained, being a quantum physicist gives him the means by which to apply the scientific method to all moral questions whatever, where ""it makes little sense to ask whether a half-cut fingernail is still 'me,' or has become 'not-me' . . . or precisely when a child's life begins."" If there is always universal uncertainty for any question whatever, which Rovelli clearly does not confine to questions of science, then by what standard can you judge any action or any belief? "

All the tests, last 100 years, have proven general relativity and quantum mechanics correct. The problem happens when we look at extremes they can't be both correct. Especially gravity. Quantum gravity removes infinity, removes singularity and takes Democritus to the word. Basic component of space is the ATOM. And it is the size of the Planck length. As for time, there is not time, there is entropy."

I love Rovelli's writing so much! ❤️❤️❤️ Keywords: popular science, physics, astronomy, cosmology, general relativity, loop quantum gravity, big bounce   ""The curiousity to learn, to discover, to look over the next hill, the desire to taste the apple; these are the things which make us human.""   REVIEW  Have you ever heard about Big Bounce? It's an alternate theory to Big Bang, that maybe the universe as we know it is a result of contracting and expanding explosion. Reality is Not What it Seems, tells about this theory and the theory that become the core of big bounce: loop quantum gravity. Loop quantum gravity is a theory that will unite relativity and quantum mechanics, two which are very opposite of each other.  The Explanation is Easy to Understand  This book is written in very clear and slow explanations. Things are explained in layman terms, that even people who doesn't know physics will understand. His topic escalate slowly, from the foundation to the hardest part of the theory. From what is atoms, to what is field, gravitation, time, universe and so on escalate until quantum loop gravity. He often compares today's scientific theories with philosophies from ancient time; mentioned ancient philosophers and tells us their contribution to building of nowadays's science. There are many new insights I didn't know before and albeit the topic of quantum loop gravity itself very hard, I can quite grasp the bigger picture due to this book.  I love his humility  I also love how Carlo Rovelli is very humble. He always mentioned that he himself is not certain. Do not believe something with blind faith because our scientific knowledges have a limit and what we thought is true may be proven otherwise later. He encourage scientific thinking, that is to never fear of learning and unlearning things that we know. Conclusion  The topic of this book is very specific so unless you really curious about it you might not enjoy it. But the explanation is easy to understand so you don't need to fear that it will be hard to read. I recommend this to those who want to know more about astronomy, astrophysics, or physics itself in general.   ""Science is continual exploration of ways of thinking. Its strength is its visionary capacity to demolish preconceived ideas, to reveal new regions of reality, and to construct novel and more effective images of the world. This adventure rests upon the entirety of past knowledge, but at its heart is change. The world is boundless and iridescent, we want to go and see it. We are immersed in its mystery and in its beauty, and over the horizon there is unexplored territory. The incompleteness and the uncertainty of our knowledges, our precariousness, suspended over the abyss of the immensity of what we don't know, doesn't render life meaningless, it makes it interesting and precious.""

233,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"Carlo Rovelli's first book (aside from 7 Brief Lessons...), Reality is Not What it Seems, is a beautiful narrative regarding the foundational human conceptions of the fabric of reality ranging from Democritus and Anaximander's conception of the apeiron (""the primal substance of which everything is formed"") and concluding at the precipice of modern theoretic physics: Quantum Gravity. Rovelli begins by setting the stage of modern theoretical physics by first introducing the historical conceptions of the nature of reality, discussing ideas from ancient minds such as Democritus, Lucretius, and Anaximander who together postulated an astoundingly clarivoyant theory that everything was comprised of super-small components called ""atoms"" (humanity would have to wait for proof of such a claim until 1905). With a brief digression into some pleasing philosophical musings of the aforementioned thinkers, necessitated by the inability to test any of these theories, Rovelli moves on to explain the original of classical mechanics.Moving forwards in time (inside joke-- read the book!), Rovelli elegantly and relevantly presents the origins of several seminal ideas in classical mechanics like gravity (Galileo + Newton) planetary motion (Copernicus & Newton), the mathematical foundations upon which such theories were based (Plato/Aristotle/Pythagoras/etc - that physical processes could be modeled with mathematics), and the physical and philosophical implications of the new ways of thinking about the world. Not even a few centuries go by before Faraday, Maxwell, and their co-intellectuals of the 1800s arrive on the scene and postulate the notion of an ""Electro-Magnetic Field"", solving some of the greatest mysteries about the forces of electricity and magnetism by presenting a mathematical model of particles and fields that move through space and time. Upon the shoulders of such great conceivers, Einstein publishes a series of seminal papers that almost literally invoke a formal conception of ""atomic physics"", or ""particle physics""-- not only does Einstein prove that atoms exist, he also proves (via irrefutable mathematical models that predict reality down to the ump-teenth decimal place) that time is not consistent for all matter within space, AND that space and time themselves may be constituted by the notion of a Gravitational Field (with a stroke of genius, he applies Maxwell's conception of fields and particles to gravity!). The descriptions of special relativity, quantum mechanics, and general relativity are all eloquently and concisely explained by Rovelli, thus I choose to not digress here into any explanation of such awesome theories of reality and instead implore you to read the book! Throughout this section, short digressions into the theories and contributions of seminal quantum physicists such as Dirac, Heisenberg, Bohr, Wheeler, Feyman, etc., are discussed for support and insight for the nuanced non-intuitive conceptions of reality portrayed. This section is concluded with a thorough yet concise explanation of the three pillars of quantum mechanics: granularity, indeterminacy, and relationality. Perhaps the most intriguing of which to me was the notion that our universe is finite-but-without-boundaries: Einstein conceived of such a property of the universe with the notion of a 3-sphere-- yet again I implore you to read the book!The 3rd section of the book and, in my opinion, crown jewel, is focused on an elaboration of the theory of Quantum Gravity. Without diving too deep, in an attempt to let Rovelli's art stand on its own: The theory of quantum gravity, along with its components (loop theory, spin-networks, spinfoam, etc), is an incredibly intriguing conception of physical reality with which a quantum-field theory of spacetime is theorized. No longer is space some inert container, but is comprised of quanta and the relationships between them; No longer is time a parameter to the functions and equations of such a physics, but is simply the evolution of the relations of said quanta! A human's conception of space and time emerge as the manifestation of the evolution of such relationships between the inconceivably small quanta (particles) of the quantum field of space time itself-- such quanta are not IN space, nor are they evolving IN time: the quanta and their relationships ARE space, and their (indeterminate) evolutions PRODUCE the conception of time. Admittedly, I had to re-read chapters of this section due to the non-intuitive nature of such a conception of reality; But, I reread them because I wanted to, and was so deeply intrigued by the subject matter during the first pass that I felt compelled to go back and read this section (all 50 pages) a second time around in an attempt to understand it better. I, like Rovelli, believe that to understand a theory in any scientific domain, one must first become familiar with the ""episteme"" (- Foucault) or underlying scientific and philosophical framework from whence the theories came; Thus, I thoroughly enjoyed the progression of the book, and the attention to detail that Rovelli gave to ancient (Greek) conceptions of what reality might be comprised, and how these conceptions evolved through the centuries, discovered or invented by the great minds such as Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, Einstein, and now, quantum gravity theorists! I finished this book with a greater holistic understanding of ways in which to think about physical reality, and excitedly: a potential theory that might traverse the chasm between general relativity and quantum mechanics!Rovelli concludes the book by pushing even further into the unknown. He first discusses how the new theory of Quantum Gravity is being tested, confirming certain theories about the inception (or continuation) of our universe (think: The Big Bang... or, The Big Bounce!), and how it may play large role in the future of astronomy, ultimately better describing our universe at a macro scale than general relativity does! Venturing even further, Rovelli postulates interesting techniques for interpreting still-confounding aspects of reality with ideas such as the potential application of information theory to quantum mechanics, how time might be best quantified by (and even integrated mathematically into) thermodynamic phenomena, and how the notion of infinity (within any conception of physical reality) might have a place after all: reality might be truly be finite, at the most foundational level.I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did. It has presented to me a world of ideas-- the greater understanding of which I will pursue for the rest of my life-- in addition to the universe of ways (hopefully a finite 3-sphere) in which to better conceive reality."
234,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38087945-farha-crystal,4,"Are we so imprisoned in our consciousness, like the slaves in Plato's Cave, can't break loose of our chains?I can never make peace with Zeno's paradox. Oh! Rovelli, for peace and order's sake, can you please at least talk some sweet words to forget my misery for the chaos driven by Zeno's paradox? :) The concept of Infinity, as well as time, is only our ignorance, our limitations. In this book, Rovelli talks about the basic ideas behind loop quantum gravity, considering the feature of granularity, indeterminacy and probabilistic behavior. Loop quantum gravity, tries to combine general relativity with quantum field theory. In the world of Quantum Gravity, the principle of cause and effect no longer holds. Space, particles, quanta only exist when they interact only probabilistically. The book does not get into any quantitative detail for the knowledgeable reader but maybe it can at least provide the outline for the laypersons. It doesn't matter if complex issues like loop quantum gravity or superstrings are best possible answers for the intense situations like blackhole or the beginning of our known universe but this book is a poem. In fact, when Rovelli recites his poem I couldn't stop myself to put his beautiful lyrics into my mouth and suck it like a strawberry. He plays the chord of esoteric quantum gravity in an amazing way that the music infused through my veins to mandate a cosmic orgasm. :)Favorite line:  ""It is only in interactions that nature draws the world."" "
235,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40566664-knowlton-murphy,4,"A book on quantum physics for dumb people! Right up my alley. I do not have a brain for math or physics, so I am deeply indebted to the kind of work Rovelli has produced. I am absolutely sure I did not understand everything, but it was a fun and thought-provoking ride, and the fact that I understood anything is more a mark of Rovelli's skill in communication than my own acuity. The book is worth reading for its summary of the history of physics, and for its accessible explanation of quantum gravity. Rovelli, in general, writes clearly, and entertainingly. My favorite aspect of loop theory is its central prediction that ""...space is not a continuum, it is not divisible ad infinitum, it is formed of 'atoms of space'..."" (168) That is, ""...arbitrarily small chunks of space do not exist. There is a lower limit to the divisibility of space."" (169) What do you know. As a Christian, this is an interesting point because of its theological value: it draws that much more of a distinction between Creator and Created. Finitude is woven into the fabric of our created existence. There is nothing physical we can look to that compares to the infinitude of God. As a human with practical concerns in daily life, this matches my experience of life...I don't have to traverse an infinity of atomic infinities to reach my mug of tea. I can finally stop thinking about swift Achilles chasing that slow tortoise, forever doomed to fail! My second favorite concept is that of reality being relational. It is something I have thought about culturally in seeking to understand my own culture, but Rovelli helped me think about the relational nature of reality beyond the sociological sense. Again, this raised a theological point for me. As a Christian of my particular theological convictions, it makes sense to see the world in terms of relationships, because I believe God is a Trinity, a being who exists eternally in relationship.I was fascinated by Rovelli's guidance through the history of physics. It was cool to see how Democritus' idea of atomic/granular reality has become so validated. I do think that his atomic worldview is nightmarish, though:""There is no finality, no purpose, in this endless dance of atoms. We, just like the rest of the natural world, are one of many products of this infinite dance--the product, that is, of an accidental combination...Our life is a combination of atoms, our thoughts are made up of thin atoms, our dreams are the products of atoms; our hopes and our emotions are written in a language formed by combinations of atoms, which bring us images."" (21, summary by Rovelli)Rovelli returns to Democritus in his penultimate chapter to point out that ""...it is not just a question of these atoms but also of the order in which they are arranged...We are not atoms: we are orders in which atoms are arranged, capable of mirroring other atoms and mirroring ourselves."" (256) For me, this raises a cause for concern. Rovelli can speak romantically about human nature all he wants, but the only hope any of us have for reflecting the kind of good humanity he envisions is for our atoms to order themselves properly. Which according to Democritus is completely subject to accidental chance. Rovelli says atoms can think about themselves (256). This is quite a leap to me, but Rovelli manages it with graceful ease. Random accidents of atomic chance not only create the ordered world I inhabit, but align in such a way to lead to my sentient experience of it...seven billion times over. But I am not a theoretical physicist, so perhaps I just don't have enough faith. Speaking of faith, Rovelli has a flawed view of religion. He seems to think that the role of religion is primarily that of comfort for people who cannot bear the harsh nature of reality. He never suspects that people might be interested in religion as a means of pursuing truth. ""Ignorance can be scary. Out of fear, we tell ourselves calming stories: up there beyond the stars there is an enchanted garden, with a gentle father who will welcome us into his arms. It doesn't matter if it's true--it is reassuring."" Precisely what is reassuring about this system? This isn't historic Christianity, for example, which by and large holds sacred texts like 1 John 1:1-4 and 2 Peter 1:16 (which appeal to the reality of eyewitness as a grounds for believing in truth) or 1 Timothy 4:7 (which specifically tells us to not waste time with myths). Rather, Rovelli is describing existentialism...looking at the absurdity of our existence and seeking comfort in a fabricated view of reality, all the while knowing deep down that it is a lie. Incidentally, that's exactly what Rovelli does. He is convinced that men are not made ""...to live like brutes, but to seek virtue and knowledge"" (263-64, quote from Dante), but never bothers explaining why.Rovelli repeatedly says he wants to keep an open mind in case he is wrong. Clearly his idea of open-mindedness could never entertain supernaturality, though, so one wonders how genuine his claim is, especially in a world where materialists are minorities. Ironically, one of his suggestions for why people choose to be religious is that they ""...prefer to believe in a story just because it was believed by the tribe's ancestors, rather than bravely accept uncertainty."" (262) Wait. What about ancient Democritus, patriarch of the materialism, being right about atomic reality, which was counter-intuitive, and that magnificent list of heroes upon whose shoulders we sit (chapters 1-4)? Does Rovelli really have no mechanism for seeing the parallel? Ah well. The biggest awkward elephant in the room is of course that he doesn't really bother speculating where atoms come from. The closest he comes to saying where our current atoms come from is The Big Bounce (206-07), but it is funny for him to spend so much time talking about how the universe is finite only to gently acknowledge it is also eternal."

This one is probably the most incomprehensible of all that I’ve read on the subject of quantum physics so far, though, admittedly, it is also very skillfully written. Beautifully woven phrases intermingle with claims, terms and equations that I’m not equipped to understand. Even though it is still a pop-science book, on the spectrum of pop-science literature it is quite far removed from Michio Kaku’s light writing (e.g. Parallel Worlds: A Journey through Creation, Higher Dimensions, and the Future of the Cosmos) and much closer to Brian Cox’s level of detail (The Quantum Universe: Everything That Can Happen Does Happen), though Cox’s book was made even more obscure than it had to be by weird thought experiments meant to make it easier for the reader to visualise things, and failing. Rovelli doesn’t bother with thought experiments, he just ‘says it as it is’ in grand style.By no means am I trying to say that reading this book was a waste of my time. Quite the contrary, I did get a slightly better insight to how physicists think, even if I failed – as usual – to comprehend the essentials. Also, this book is the first one I’ve read that talks about an alternative hypothesis to the popular string theory: the loop theory, Rovelli’s (and others) intellectual child. Perhaps the lack of infinite universes makes it less cool in people’s eyes, but I find it comforting that there may not be, after all, countless other ‘mes’ capable of screwing up in innumerable ways!"

But this, this whole book is exactly what I have been looking for for very nearly the past ten years. It opens with a very brief (well, not too brief; it does take about half of what is actually a very short book) overview of classical physics, then general and special relativity, then quantum mechanics, and then dives right in to the heart of the matter: quantum gravity, or loop gravity, or loop quantum gravity; even Rovelli seems to use the terms interchangeably. The writing style was amazing. Fantastic. So light and breezy and conversational. Funny, even (there's really - and I am convinced of this - a ""The name of that man? Albert Einstein."" joke somewhere in chapter 2, and I lost my mind laughing), but still concise. The reader was great; his emphasis was spot-on. I'm half-tempted to listen to it over again and I wish my to-read list wasn't so long because I genuinely would. I enjoyed it that much.I won't lie - I didn't... quite catch on.At no point during this did I feel confused. At all. In fact, I almost feel like maybe the way Rovelli explained quantum gravity seemed... too easy? Space is granular, check. I follow. Time is what happens because we can't understand everything that's happening all the time. That's highly speculative and still, check, I gotcha, I follow. But if you wanted me to tell you what you what quantum gravity is right now? I'm not sure I could. Maybe that's okay though. Maybe that's okay because this is the first book like this - or at least the first one I've been able to get my hands on - and soon I'll be able to devour books on loop quantum gravity the same way I had the chance to eat up string theory before I realized that the point that it was getting to was indeed no point at all (I had to get one in there, so sue me). Maybe Carlo Rovelli is the Brian Greene of quantum gravity. I sure hope so. I could use a lot more books like this."

Statements like the one I used in the epigraph, about human infinite ignorance, resonate with me. I teach mathematics at a university, I have quite an extensive exposure to classical physics, yet my ignorance about modern physics is certainly limitless.

Seven Brief Lessons on Physics
, it is still a great read and I have learned a lot from it - not only about my lack of knowledge. The author begins with a story about Anaximander of Miletus (450 BCE) whose work contributed to the foundations of Western science and philosophy.  ""The Milesians understand that by shrewdly using observation and reason, rather than searching for answers in fantasy, ancient myths, or religion - and above all by using critical thought in a discriminating way - it is possible to repeatedly correct our worldview and to discover new aspects of reality that are hidden to the common view.""  Progressing through time, we read about Democritus, then through Copernicus, Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, we follow the evolution of human models of reality. Then come Einstein, Heisenberg, Bohr, Dirac - fathers of the modern physics - and we arrive at the ""two pillars of twentieth-century physics - general relativity and quantum mechanics."" General relativity is ""a simple and coherent vision of gravity, space, and time."" Quantum mechanics unveils the three aspects of reality: ""granularity, indeterminism, and relationality.""Part Three, Quantum Space and Relational Time is to me the most fascinating part of the book. General relativity and quantum mechanics, ""the two jewels that the twentieth century has left us,"" seem to contradict each other. ""They cannot both be true, at least not in their present forms."" Chapters 5 through 7 provide an introduction to the loop quantum gravity theory in whose development the author has played one of the key roles.  ""[...] the world described by the theory is far from the one we are familiar with. There is no longer space that ""contains"" the world, and no longer time ""during the course of which"" events occur.""  Part Four, Beyond Space and Time, discusses such aspects of cosmology as Big Bang and black holes. I found the chapter Information the most illuminating. Information is defined as the number of possible alternatives, connections to Boltzmann's statistical mechanics are shown, and the author presents yet another crucial idea - thermal time and its connection with the concept of irreversibility. The author's succinct summary is stunning:  ""Time is an effect of our overlooking the physical microstates of things. Time is the information we don't have. Time is our ignorance.""  I absolutely love the powerful final chapter, Mystery, with its convincing argument why nothing but science can be reliable:  ""The answers given by science [...] are not reliable because they are definitive. They are reliable because they are not definitive.  This is the most powerful argument I have ever heard against all kinds of mumbo-jumbo that ignores science, which is particularly important in the times of a pandemic. The author provides two fascinating historical vignettes: the first about a ""race"" to formalize Einstein's theory between David Hilbert, one of the most famous mathematicians in history, and Albert Einstein. The other vignette is about a little known Belgian priest, Georges Lemaître, who showed that both Einstein in his skepticism about the expansion of the universe as well as pope Pius XII in his declaration that the Big Bang confirms the account of Creation given in Genesis were wrong.Fascinating read!Four-and-a-quarter stars."
242,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4277032-d,5,"I wholeheartedly agree with Manny's review.Applying Occam's razor clearly favors Loop Quantum Gravity (LCG) theory over String theory with its 11 or more dimensions. Amazingly, dropping the 'background' of empty space and time as basic notions simplifies obtaining LCG as a theory that makes General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics compatible. There are even some cosmological experiments that could test LCG: e.g. observing a black hole that expands again (bounces back) would suggest that space/matter is granular, making everything finite, again simplifying matters considerably, it seems. However this experiment shows that, if true, the size of a matter/space quantum should be really small: 10-48m (10 to the power of -48), much smaller than the Planck scale."

I have mixed feelings about the book. Rovelli's prose is quite poetic at times (and perhaps a little damaged in translation from the Italian). I found the historical background quite clear, but when he got to describing quantum gravity, and how space/time do not exist at the most basic level I was lost. That's a shame, because it's the most interesting part of the book. It would also have been nice to have a somewhat broader view of the rest of physics (e.g., String Theory; how does Dark Matter or Dark Energy fit in?). I was also a bit disturbed to read in other reviews that the form of Quantum Gravity being presented here is only the flavor that Rovelli is working on and he has left out other competing versions, which view time quite differently.Finally, and most annoyingly, large chunks of text are reused almost word for word from his previous book Seven Brief Lessons on Physics.

But when our friendly particle collider @ Geneva, didn't throw out a bunch of predicted supersymmetric particles, the long suspected truth came into the reality that - String theory is not the last word! In contrast to string theory, LQG has been steadily building up and has found much stronger footing.

248,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22241323-judy,3,"Rovelli tells the reader that he’s written with a particular reader in mind: someone who knows little or nothing about today’s physics but is curious to find out what we know, as well as what we don’t yet understand, about the elementary weave of the world. (p 8)I need to acknowledge that Physics has never been my favorite branch of science. However, I've always been intrigued by how Physicists think, so when my niece gave this book 3-stars and said it was ""pretty good,"" I decided to give it a try. I'm reading her copy of the book, so I can't write in it, but I am noting quite a few page numbers, most of which indicate something I want to give some thought. This isn’t going to be a review but rather a list of ideas that are food for thought (to me anyway).p 21: Our life is a combination of atoms, our thoughts are made up of thin atoms, our dreams are the products of atoms; our hopes and our emotions are written in a language formed by combinations of atoms; …That is true at a very fundamental level. (Thin atoms?)p 29: The definitive proof of the ‘atomic hypothesis’ had to wait until 1905. It was found by a rebellious 25 year-old who had studied physics but had not been able to find employment as a scientist …Einstein, of course.p 33: The closure of the ancient schools such as those of Athens and Alexandria, and the destruction of all the texts not in accordance with Christian ideas was vast and systematic …Apparently Plato and Aristotle were viewed as pagans. Democritus was even “worse.” I’d like to read more about these ancient thinkers.p 39: In the world of Democritus as sung by Lucretius -There is no fear of the gods; … There is a deep love of nature, a serene immersion within it; a recognition that we are profoundly part of it; that men, women, animals, plants, and clouds are organic threads of a marvelous whole, without hierarchies.In the Biological or Chemical use of the word, clouds wouldn’t be considered organic, … but this is a Physicist writing. (I think I like Democritus.)p 44: Mathematics allows the world to be described and the future to be predicted.Oh, my!p 47: A reminder:Experimental science begins with Galileo. His experiment is simple: he lets objects fall … and seeks to measure precisely their falling speed.p 69: I don't know enough to appreciate statements such as this one.Newton’s mechanics are not compatible with the existence of a fundamental velocity, because what enters Newton’s equations is acceleration, not velocity.p 81: Einstein, in an “extraordinary stroke of genius” asks:What if Newton’s space is nothing more than the gravitational field? This extremely simple, beautiful, brilliant idea is the theory of general relativity.The words are straightforward, but I can’t appreciate the significance.p 93: For Einstein, the theory of general relativity is a mental image of the world arduously translated into equations.And here’s another idea that seems really important, but I don’t fully grasp.p 153: Rovelli made a valiant attempt at explaining the scale of matter that is the subject of this book … and it surpasses my imagination.It is at this extremely minute scale that quantum gravity manifests itself. To give an idea of the smallness of the scale we are discussing: if we enlarged a walnut shell until it had become as big as the whole observable universe, we would still not see the Planck length. Even after having been enormously magnified thus, it would still be a million times smaller than the actual walnut shell was before magnification. At this scale, space and time change their nature. The become something different; they become ‘quantum space and time.’p 172:  Quanta of gravity are not in space; they are themselves space.Whew! That’s a lot to take in.p 176: If I wanted to pursue time travel, I suspect that I would need a solid understanding of these ideas:Time emerges, like space, from the quantum gravitational field. … The moment we take quantum mechanics into account, we recognize that time too must have those aspects of probabilistic indeterminacy, granularity, and relationality, which are common to all of reality. It becomes a ‘time’ markedly different from all that we have hitherto meant by the word.p 192: Here’s something that both blows me away and strikes me as totally incomprehensible.Every cubic centimeter of space, and every second that passes, is the result of this dancing foam of extremely small quanta. …. Light is formed by quanta of a field; space is nothing more than a field, which is also made of quanta; and time emerges from the processes of this same field. In other words, the world is made entirely from quantum fields.p 225: Ahh, something I do understand (at least to some extent):Stephen Hawking theoretically deduced that black holes are “hot.” They behave like hot bodies: they emit heat. In doing so, they lose energy and hence mass (since energy and mass are the same thing), becoming progressively smaller. They “evaporate.”. This is Hawking’s most important discovery.Maybe, if I read this another three or four or five or … times, just maybe I could summarize the big ideas. But I can’t do that now."

Rovelli is a leader in research into the ""Loop Quantum Gravity"" approach to fundamental physics, and this book describes that perspective in fairly simple non-mathematical terms, rather than in depth. The book is aimed at the layperson with little knowledge of physics, so it takes the historical approach starting with Democritus and explaining the differences between Newton, relativity and quantum mechanics before getting into the new story. (I hadn't known that LQG was actually first proposed in the early thirties by a Soviet physicist Matvei Bronstejn, who was murdered by Stalin in 1938.) Rovelli represents LQG as the most conservative of the approaches to quantum gravity, being based only on synthesizing general relativity, Standard Model quantum theory and thermodynamics rather than postulating new extra dimensions and totally unknown entities such as strings and branes as string theorists do. Nevertheless it is very radical in what it proposes: that rather than the world existing in space and time, space and time are constructed from the interactions of atomic quantum events. (Atomic in the sense of ""indivisible"", not as in the modern sense of nucleus and electrons; these ""atomic"" quanta of space are millions of time smaller than an atom.) His description of the theory was more understandable than the description by Smolin in the earlier Three Roads to Quantum Gravity, I think partly because the theory has become more developed in the meantime. (This book was published in 2014 in Italian, but since the text mentions the discovery of gravity waves last year it was obviously revised for the English translation.) Of course, without the mathematics I couldn't really understand it (and with the mathematics I certainly couldn't have understood it) but it did give an idea of what the theory is about. Judging by Smolin and Rovelli, LQG theorists are better philosophers than string theorists are; I'm not sure whether that's good or bad for a physicist's reputation."

Relativity I can fathom, more or less, quantum physics I am familiar with up to a certain degree, I don't know the Standard Model intimately but at least I recognize what people are talking about when they use the name, string theory I could never really follow but occasionally I keep trying, I am mostly fine with cosmology. It is, however, my first book on loop quantum gravity, and on that level I acknowledge myself speechless. Time is destroyed. Matter is presented as spinfoam, which is even stranger than it sounds. And there are some aspects on information theory I don't think I had heard before, either (then again, information theory gives me headaches, mostly when applied to black holes, so I might have missed out on stuff there earlier). Well. Surprising to say the least. One would think there would have been an announcement or something. The first hundred or so pages are an easy read, as a historical overview of the progress from Democritus to Einstein. From then onwards it becomes a bit of a struggle. I managed to read the historical overview in a day and it took me two weeks to go through the other hundred and fifty pages. I almost gave up twice. However, if you are interested in the subject, have some foreknowledge and you hang on to it you will probably get to it in the end. Personally I think I am going to need a second book on the subject after this introduction. Not sure if am seeking a second explanation or a second medical opinion, really, but the theory does seem worth exploring more in depth."

WHAT?!Do things that happen in nature require a cause in order to be properly explained? The answer to this was a resounding yes back in the days of Newton. This seems rather straightforward and our intuitions back it up. But what we are now finding out from quantum gravity is utterly shocking, and a blow to the cause-and-effect paradigm that helps us make sense of our world. This is a book about the fundamental nature of the universe: what is reality? What is reality made out of? How does it relate with what we know? What does reality mean for our own existence? Why did the universe bang into existence? Will the universe be there forever? What is forever anyway?Once someone thinks things through, then it becomes easy to understand what they are saying because they'll be able to tell you something that is condensed. The author has properly thought through the concepts that explain reality and in this book he summarizes them very well. I had no trouble understanding what he was saying up until the last chapter on Information Theory, but that's okay because he said the theory is not yet solidified. Aside from simplicity, it was also beautiful.It seems that the theories are pointing towards a non-dualistic structure of nature. I hope someday we'll have a grand theory that explains everything.The truth is in the depths. — Democritus"

I thoroughly enjoyed this introduction to the theory behind loop quantum gravity. I thought the author, Carlo Rovelli, did an excellent job of illustrating some complex theoretical physics in a manner that is easy for anybody to understand, whether you are a physics pro or you have very little background in or aptitude for physics. To do this feat, Rovelli started way back in the beginning, way back in Ancient Greece, with Aristotle and Archimedes, and he revisited Greece many times throughout the book. He took a great deal of the book to explain the physics of Einstein in a way that made it even more clear to me, even though I’ve studied relativity before, and the same with the quantum revolution. Rovelli introduced quantum gravity with a high level discussion fit for everybody, flowing language to make it slide down easy, and some excellent illustrations. Although the concepts are difficult and theoretical in nature, the poetic illustrations Rovelli provided made these ideas tangible for anyone to grasp. I listened to the audio version, which was very well done. "

Suffice to say the information was dizzying yet compelling, and if I had the mathematical ability, I'd jump head first into theoretical physics, because it aims to reveal the very nature of reality, which to me, is more fascinating than anything else."
254,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20923295-anton,5,I am in absolute awe. Best read of the year for me. More detailed review to follow.This book is incredible!
255,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,5,"It is always a pleasure when one comes across a book such as this. Theoretical physicist Rovelli, who works in the area relating to Quantum Gravity, goes out of his way to introduce key concepts of his chosen discipline, and successfully manages to communicate its mysteries to us laypersons in language that is clear and informative. We are all made wiser and more appreciative as a result.Rovelli sees his current profession as being the result of a history of ideas about the nature of reality, and he lightly traces out this history, quickly arrives at the Miletians (Thales, Anaximander, etc) and then circa 450 BCE on to Leucippus and his young disciple Democritus and the idea of atomism. In a sense, the stage is now set for the development of further ideas that will ultimately result in Quantum theory and Quantum mechanics. Rovelli traces the acceptance, denial, dismissal, revival of these and associated ideas in a sweeping through-the-centuries overview that is exciting and adventurous, and we soon arrive at Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, and then Einstein and all the other associated physicists we may be more knowledgeable about today.Each step along the way is spelled out clearly and simply. Of course, this is not to say that the reader necessarily understands all the possible implications, but we do begin to see the links between: Space, Time and Spacetime; Particles and Fields; how Spacetime and Fields link to form Covariant Fields; and Fields and Particles combine to form Quantum Fields; and ultimately how Quantum Fields and Spacetime unite to form the “single ingredient”, Covariant Quantum Fields, which Rovelli considers to be the answer to the question “What is the word made of?”This is the conclusion that the author comes to, and his arguments form the rationale of the first three parts of this book. At the same time, he is aware that this view is not necessarily the accepted view of every physicist. His understanding based on loop-theory/loop-quantum-gravity suggests that at the very deepest level his research has lead him, time might very well not exist, nor even particles or quanta (he uses terms such as “Spacetime sushi” and “Spinfoams”) — the suspicion, perhaps, that we may all need to reconsider and/or reevaluate the validity of all current models of reality.Yet Rovelli pushes the envelope even more in Part Four, which is entitled “Beyond Space and Time”, where he explores other issues such as Beyond the Big Bang, Quantum Cosmology, Quantum Black Holes, and the End of Infinity. His final chapter is entitled “Mystery”, where he essentially reminds his readers that there remain more and more unknowns that need to be explored.For the cynics among us (and I would consider myself to be partial to the odd cynicism at times!) all the above is just a load of speculative bull that has no relevance whatever to “real” reality, i.e. what we might call the “four dimensional” Space-Time Continuum. This is the “place” where we as individuals need to position ourselves and negotiate our way about in order to survive and live our lives as happily as possible. Even on this level the title of this book (“Reality Is Not What It Seems”) makes sense — we can be deceived and/or misled by our senses (and even, sometimes, by our intelligence) with very unfortunate results… It could be that thinking too deeply on the “nature” of physical reality is not good for our health and well-being — pretty much the same as, say, for people suffering from schizophrenia or paranoia, or even for a whole slew of physiological, social, religious and psychological reasons: they believe that their experiences are real: for them Reality is exactly what it seems!Whatever one might think about this, it doesn’t mean that this book must needs be dismissed. If you want to know what Quantum Gravity physicists are on about, then this book strikes me as being a very good place to start."

Now I know what the universe is made of, and how to reconcile quantum gravity with the standard model. I truly expected to be left dangling at the end of this book, which takes the reader on a beautifully written, often funny, often moving journey from the ancient greeks to modern day, building up a picture of what we understand are the building blocks of the universe. There's a little bit of maths, but nothing that ought to daunt anyone who did maths in high-school and still remembers it, but mostly it's just a wonderfully written, and incredibly informative narrative.The original text was written in Italian and has been translated, and I could not help reading most of it with an Italian accent. In parts I caught myself waving my hands around as I read it.Makes me want to go and read more by Lee Smolin now."
257,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1920850-nate-ahern,3,"Good and interesting but gets too big for its britches in the last chapter. Rovelli says, ""I don't criticize those who prefer to believe in [Truth and certainty]"" but he says they are ""immersed in ignorance."" He says ""we don't have absolute certainty"" about reality, the hallmark of science, except for his own certainty that what is written in the ""Great Book"" is silly. And somehow for reasons unexplained, being a quantum physicist gives him the means by which to apply the scientific method to all moral questions whatever, where ""it makes little sense to ask whether a half-cut fingernail is still 'me,' or has become 'not-me' . . . or precisely when a child's life begins."" If there is always universal uncertainty for any question whatever, which Rovelli clearly does not confine to questions of science, then by what standard can you judge any action or any belief? "

All the tests, last 100 years, have proven general relativity and quantum mechanics correct. The problem happens when we look at extremes they can't be both correct. Especially gravity. Quantum gravity removes infinity, removes singularity and takes Democritus to the word. Basic component of space is the ATOM. And it is the size of the Planck length. As for time, there is not time, there is entropy."

262,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32544970-raf,5,"✨✨⭐ 10 out of 10 ⭐✨✨I just found my new favourite popular science author after Michio Kaku. I love Rovelli's writing so much! ❤️❤️❤️ Keywords: popular science, physics, astronomy, cosmology, general relativity, loop quantum gravity, big bounce   ""The curiousity to learn, to discover, to look over the next hill, the desire to taste the apple; these are the things which make us human.""   REVIEW  Have you ever heard about Big Bounce? It's an alternate theory to Big Bang, that maybe the universe as we know it is a result of contracting and expanding explosion. Reality is Not What it Seems, tells about this theory and the theory that become the core of big bounce: loop quantum gravity. Loop quantum gravity is a theory that will unite relativity and quantum mechanics, two which are very opposite of each other.  The Explanation is Easy to Understand  This book is written in very clear and slow explanations. Things are explained in layman terms, that even people who doesn't know physics will understand. His topic escalate slowly, from the foundation to the hardest part of the theory. From what is atoms, to what is field, gravitation, time, universe and so on escalate until quantum loop gravity. He often compares today's scientific theories with philosophies from ancient time; mentioned ancient philosophers and tells us their contribution to building of nowadays's science. There are many new insights I didn't know before and albeit the topic of quantum loop gravity itself very hard, I can quite grasp the bigger picture due to this book.  I love his humility  I also love how Carlo Rovelli is very humble. He always mentioned that he himself is not certain. Do not believe something with blind faith because our scientific knowledges have a limit and what we thought is true may be proven otherwise later. He encourage scientific thinking, that is to never fear of learning and unlearning things that we know. Conclusion  The topic of this book is very specific so unless you really curious about it you might not enjoy it. But the explanation is easy to understand so you don't need to fear that it will be hard to read. I recommend this to those who want to know more about astronomy, astrophysics, or physics itself in general.   ""Science is continual exploration of ways of thinking. Its strength is its visionary capacity to demolish preconceived ideas, to reveal new regions of reality, and to construct novel and more effective images of the world. This adventure rests upon the entirety of past knowledge, but at its heart is change. The world is boundless and iridescent, we want to go and see it. We are immersed in its mystery and in its beauty, and over the horizon there is unexplored territory. The incompleteness and the uncertainty of our knowledges, our precariousness, suspended over the abyss of the immensity of what we don't know, doesn't render life meaningless, it makes it interesting and precious.""  "
263,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"Carlo Rovelli's first book (aside from 7 Brief Lessons...), Reality is Not What it Seems, is a beautiful narrative regarding the foundational human conceptions of the fabric of reality ranging from Democritus and Anaximander's conception of the apeiron (""the primal substance of which everything is formed"") and concluding at the precipice of modern theoretic physics: Quantum Gravity. Rovelli begins by setting the stage of modern theoretical physics by first introducing the historical conceptions of the nature of reality, discussing ideas from ancient minds such as Democritus, Lucretius, and Anaximander who together postulated an astoundingly clarivoyant theory that everything was comprised of super-small components called ""atoms"" (humanity would have to wait for proof of such a claim until 1905). With a brief digression into some pleasing philosophical musings of the aforementioned thinkers, necessitated by the inability to test any of these theories, Rovelli moves on to explain the original of classical mechanics.Moving forwards in time (inside joke-- read the book!), Rovelli elegantly and relevantly presents the origins of several seminal ideas in classical mechanics like gravity (Galileo + Newton) planetary motion (Copernicus & Newton), the mathematical foundations upon which such theories were based (Plato/Aristotle/Pythagoras/etc - that physical processes could be modeled with mathematics), and the physical and philosophical implications of the new ways of thinking about the world. Not even a few centuries go by before Faraday, Maxwell, and their co-intellectuals of the 1800s arrive on the scene and postulate the notion of an ""Electro-Magnetic Field"", solving some of the greatest mysteries about the forces of electricity and magnetism by presenting a mathematical model of particles and fields that move through space and time. Upon the shoulders of such great conceivers, Einstein publishes a series of seminal papers that almost literally invoke a formal conception of ""atomic physics"", or ""particle physics""-- not only does Einstein prove that atoms exist, he also proves (via irrefutable mathematical models that predict reality down to the ump-teenth decimal place) that time is not consistent for all matter within space, AND that space and time themselves may be constituted by the notion of a Gravitational Field (with a stroke of genius, he applies Maxwell's conception of fields and particles to gravity!). The descriptions of special relativity, quantum mechanics, and general relativity are all eloquently and concisely explained by Rovelli, thus I choose to not digress here into any explanation of such awesome theories of reality and instead implore you to read the book! Throughout this section, short digressions into the theories and contributions of seminal quantum physicists such as Dirac, Heisenberg, Bohr, Wheeler, Feyman, etc., are discussed for support and insight for the nuanced non-intuitive conceptions of reality portrayed. This section is concluded with a thorough yet concise explanation of the three pillars of quantum mechanics: granularity, indeterminacy, and relationality. Perhaps the most intriguing of which to me was the notion that our universe is finite-but-without-boundaries: Einstein conceived of such a property of the universe with the notion of a 3-sphere-- yet again I implore you to read the book!The 3rd section of the book and, in my opinion, crown jewel, is focused on an elaboration of the theory of Quantum Gravity. Without diving too deep, in an attempt to let Rovelli's art stand on its own: The theory of quantum gravity, along with its components (loop theory, spin-networks, spinfoam, etc), is an incredibly intriguing conception of physical reality with which a quantum-field theory of spacetime is theorized. No longer is space some inert container, but is comprised of quanta and the relationships between them; No longer is time a parameter to the functions and equations of such a physics, but is simply the evolution of the relations of said quanta! A human's conception of space and time emerge as the manifestation of the evolution of such relationships between the inconceivably small quanta (particles) of the quantum field of space time itself-- such quanta are not IN space, nor are they evolving IN time: the quanta and their relationships ARE space, and their (indeterminate) evolutions PRODUCE the conception of time. Admittedly, I had to re-read chapters of this section due to the non-intuitive nature of such a conception of reality; But, I reread them because I wanted to, and was so deeply intrigued by the subject matter during the first pass that I felt compelled to go back and read this section (all 50 pages) a second time around in an attempt to understand it better. I, like Rovelli, believe that to understand a theory in any scientific domain, one must first become familiar with the ""episteme"" (- Foucault) or underlying scientific and philosophical framework from whence the theories came; Thus, I thoroughly enjoyed the progression of the book, and the attention to detail that Rovelli gave to ancient (Greek) conceptions of what reality might be comprised, and how these conceptions evolved through the centuries, discovered or invented by the great minds such as Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, Einstein, and now, quantum gravity theorists! I finished this book with a greater holistic understanding of ways in which to think about physical reality, and excitedly: a potential theory that might traverse the chasm between general relativity and quantum mechanics!Rovelli concludes the book by pushing even further into the unknown. He first discusses how the new theory of Quantum Gravity is being tested, confirming certain theories about the inception (or continuation) of our universe (think: The Big Bang... or, The Big Bounce!), and how it may play large role in the future of astronomy, ultimately better describing our universe at a macro scale than general relativity does! Venturing even further, Rovelli postulates interesting techniques for interpreting still-confounding aspects of reality with ideas such as the potential application of information theory to quantum mechanics, how time might be best quantified by (and even integrated mathematically into) thermodynamic phenomena, and how the notion of infinity (within any conception of physical reality) might have a place after all: reality might be truly be finite, at the most foundational level.I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did. It has presented to me a world of ideas-- the greater understanding of which I will pursue for the rest of my life-- in addition to the universe of ways (hopefully a finite 3-sphere) in which to better conceive reality."
264,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38087945-farha-crystal,4,"Are we so imprisoned in our consciousness, like the slaves in Plato's Cave, can't break loose of our chains?I can never make peace with Zeno's paradox. Oh! Rovelli, for peace and order's sake, can you please at least talk some sweet words to forget my misery for the chaos driven by Zeno's paradox? :) The concept of Infinity, as well as time, is only our ignorance, our limitations. In this book, Rovelli talks about the basic ideas behind loop quantum gravity, considering the feature of granularity, indeterminacy and probabilistic behavior. Loop quantum gravity, tries to combine general relativity with quantum field theory. In the world of Quantum Gravity, the principle of cause and effect no longer holds. Space, particles, quanta only exist when they interact only probabilistically. The book does not get into any quantitative detail for the knowledgeable reader but maybe it can at least provide the outline for the laypersons. It doesn't matter if complex issues like loop quantum gravity or superstrings are best possible answers for the intense situations like blackhole or the beginning of our known universe but this book is a poem. In fact, when Rovelli recites his poem I couldn't stop myself to put his beautiful lyrics into my mouth and suck it like a strawberry. He plays the chord of esoteric quantum gravity in an amazing way that the music infused through my veins to mandate a cosmic orgasm. :)Favorite line:  ""It is only in interactions that nature draws the world."" "
265,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40566664-knowlton-murphy,4,"A book on quantum physics for dumb people! Right up my alley. I do not have a brain for math or physics, so I am deeply indebted to the kind of work Rovelli has produced. I am absolutely sure I did not understand everything, but it was a fun and thought-provoking ride, and the fact that I understood anything is more a mark of Rovelli's skill in communication than my own acuity. The book is worth reading for its summary of the history of physics, and for its accessible explanation of quantum gravity. Rovelli, in general, writes clearly, and entertainingly. My favorite aspect of loop theory is its central prediction that ""...space is not a continuum, it is not divisible ad infinitum, it is formed of 'atoms of space'..."" (168) That is, ""...arbitrarily small chunks of space do not exist. There is a lower limit to the divisibility of space."" (169) What do you know. As a Christian, this is an interesting point because of its theological value: it draws that much more of a distinction between Creator and Created. Finitude is woven into the fabric of our created existence. There is nothing physical we can look to that compares to the infinitude of God. As a human with practical concerns in daily life, this matches my experience of life...I don't have to traverse an infinity of atomic infinities to reach my mug of tea. I can finally stop thinking about swift Achilles chasing that slow tortoise, forever doomed to fail! My second favorite concept is that of reality being relational. It is something I have thought about culturally in seeking to understand my own culture, but Rovelli helped me think about the relational nature of reality beyond the sociological sense. Again, this raised a theological point for me. As a Christian of my particular theological convictions, it makes sense to see the world in terms of relationships, because I believe God is a Trinity, a being who exists eternally in relationship.I was fascinated by Rovelli's guidance through the history of physics. It was cool to see how Democritus' idea of atomic/granular reality has become so validated. I do think that his atomic worldview is nightmarish, though:""There is no finality, no purpose, in this endless dance of atoms. We, just like the rest of the natural world, are one of many products of this infinite dance--the product, that is, of an accidental combination...Our life is a combination of atoms, our thoughts are made up of thin atoms, our dreams are the products of atoms; our hopes and our emotions are written in a language formed by combinations of atoms, which bring us images."" (21, summary by Rovelli)Rovelli returns to Democritus in his penultimate chapter to point out that ""...it is not just a question of these atoms but also of the order in which they are arranged...We are not atoms: we are orders in which atoms are arranged, capable of mirroring other atoms and mirroring ourselves."" (256) For me, this raises a cause for concern. Rovelli can speak romantically about human nature all he wants, but the only hope any of us have for reflecting the kind of good humanity he envisions is for our atoms to order themselves properly. Which according to Democritus is completely subject to accidental chance. Rovelli says atoms can think about themselves (256). This is quite a leap to me, but Rovelli manages it with graceful ease. Random accidents of atomic chance not only create the ordered world I inhabit, but align in such a way to lead to my sentient experience of it...seven billion times over. But I am not a theoretical physicist, so perhaps I just don't have enough faith. Speaking of faith, Rovelli has a flawed view of religion. He seems to think that the role of religion is primarily that of comfort for people who cannot bear the harsh nature of reality. He never suspects that people might be interested in religion as a means of pursuing truth. ""Ignorance can be scary. Out of fear, we tell ourselves calming stories: up there beyond the stars there is an enchanted garden, with a gentle father who will welcome us into his arms. It doesn't matter if it's true--it is reassuring."" Precisely what is reassuring about this system? This isn't historic Christianity, for example, which by and large holds sacred texts like 1 John 1:1-4 and 2 Peter 1:16 (which appeal to the reality of eyewitness as a grounds for believing in truth) or 1 Timothy 4:7 (which specifically tells us to not waste time with myths). Rather, Rovelli is describing existentialism...looking at the absurdity of our existence and seeking comfort in a fabricated view of reality, all the while knowing deep down that it is a lie. Incidentally, that's exactly what Rovelli does. He is convinced that men are not made ""...to live like brutes, but to seek virtue and knowledge"" (263-64, quote from Dante), but never bothers explaining why.Rovelli repeatedly says he wants to keep an open mind in case he is wrong. Clearly his idea of open-mindedness could never entertain supernaturality, though, so one wonders how genuine his claim is, especially in a world where materialists are minorities. Ironically, one of his suggestions for why people choose to be religious is that they ""...prefer to believe in a story just because it was believed by the tribe's ancestors, rather than bravely accept uncertainty."" (262) Wait. What about ancient Democritus, patriarch of the materialism, being right about atomic reality, which was counter-intuitive, and that magnificent list of heroes upon whose shoulders we sit (chapters 1-4)? Does Rovelli really have no mechanism for seeing the parallel? Ah well. The biggest awkward elephant in the room is of course that he doesn't really bother speculating where atoms come from. The closest he comes to saying where our current atoms come from is The Big Bounce (206-07), but it is funny for him to spend so much time talking about how the universe is finite only to gently acknowledge it is also eternal."

This one is probably the most incomprehensible of all that I’ve read on the subject of quantum physics so far, though, admittedly, it is also very skillfully written. Beautifully woven phrases intermingle with claims, terms and equations that I’m not equipped to understand. Even though it is still a pop-science book, on the spectrum of pop-science literature it is quite far removed from Michio Kaku’s light writing (e.g. Parallel Worlds: A Journey through Creation, Higher Dimensions, and the Future of the Cosmos) and much closer to Brian Cox’s level of detail (The Quantum Universe: Everything That Can Happen Does Happen), though Cox’s book was made even more obscure than it had to be by weird thought experiments meant to make it easier for the reader to visualise things, and failing. Rovelli doesn’t bother with thought experiments, he just ‘says it as it is’ in grand style.By no means am I trying to say that reading this book was a waste of my time. Quite the contrary, I did get a slightly better insight to how physicists think, even if I failed – as usual – to comprehend the essentials. Also, this book is the first one I’ve read that talks about an alternative hypothesis to the popular string theory: the loop theory, Rovelli’s (and others) intellectual child. Perhaps the lack of infinite universes makes it less cool in people’s eyes, but I find it comforting that there may not be, after all, countless other ‘mes’ capable of screwing up in innumerable ways!"

Carlo Rovelli has done a remarkable job to put down such complicated concepts into simple, easy to understand language.

But this, this whole book is exactly what I have been looking for for very nearly the past ten years. It opens with a very brief (well, not too brief; it does take about half of what is actually a very short book) overview of classical physics, then general and special relativity, then quantum mechanics, and then dives right in to the heart of the matter: quantum gravity, or loop gravity, or loop quantum gravity; even Rovelli seems to use the terms interchangeably. The writing style was amazing. Fantastic. So light and breezy and conversational. Funny, even (there's really - and I am convinced of this - a ""The name of that man?

I'm half-tempted to listen to it over again and I wish my to-read list wasn't so long because I genuinely would. I enjoyed it that much.I won't lie - I didn't... quite catch on.At no point during this did I feel confused. At all. In fact, I almost feel like maybe the way Rovelli explained quantum gravity seemed... too easy? Space is granular, check. I follow. Time is what happens because we can't understand everything that's happening all the time. That's highly speculative and still, check, I gotcha, I follow. But if you wanted me to tell you what you what quantum gravity is right now? I'm not sure I could. Maybe that's okay though. Maybe that's okay because this is the first book like this - or at least the first one I've been able to get my hands on - and soon I'll be able to devour books on loop quantum gravity the same way I had the chance to eat up string theory before I realized that the point that it was getting to was indeed no point at all (I had to get one in there, so sue me). Maybe Carlo Rovelli is the Brian Greene of quantum gravity. I sure hope so. I could use a lot more books like this."

But then, who really does??This is the first physics text I've read clearly written after the Higgs boson was found and super symmetry was not confirmed at the LHC, which seems to have shifted the balance between the competing theories of loop quantum gravity and string theory."

Statements like the one I used in the epigraph, about human infinite ignorance, resonate with me. I teach mathematics at a university, I have quite an extensive exposure to classical physics, yet my ignorance about modern physics is certainly limitless. (By the way, there is no better way to understand the vastness of one's ignorance than being a professor.)While I will not rate this book by Dr. Rovelli as a masterpiece like 
Seven Brief Lessons on Physics
, it is still a great read and I have learned a lot from it - not only about my lack of knowledge. The author begins with a story about Anaximander of Miletus (450 BCE) whose work contributed to the foundations of Western science and philosophy.  ""The Milesians understand that by shrewdly using observation and reason, rather than searching for answers in fantasy, ancient myths, or religion - and above all by using critical thought in a discriminating way - it is possible to repeatedly correct our worldview and to discover new aspects of reality that are hidden to the common view.""  Progressing through time, we read about Democritus, then through Copernicus, Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, we follow the evolution of human models of reality. Then come Einstein, Heisenberg, Bohr, Dirac - fathers of the modern physics - and we arrive at the ""two pillars of twentieth-century physics - general relativity and quantum mechanics."" General relativity is ""a simple and coherent vision of gravity, space, and time."" Quantum mechanics unveils the three aspects of reality: ""granularity, indeterminism, and relationality.""Part Three, Quantum Space and Relational Time is to me the most fascinating part of the book. General relativity and quantum mechanics, ""the two jewels that the twentieth century has left us,"" seem to contradict each other. ""They cannot both be true, at least not in their present forms."" Chapters 5 through 7 provide an introduction to the loop quantum gravity theory in whose development the author has played one of the key roles.  ""[...] the world described by the theory is far from the one we are familiar with. There is no longer space that ""contains"" the world, and no longer time ""during the course of which"" events occur.""  Part Four, Beyond Space and Time, discusses such aspects of cosmology as Big Bang and black holes. I found the chapter Information the most illuminating. Information is defined as the number of possible alternatives, connections to Boltzmann's statistical mechanics are shown, and the author presents yet another crucial idea - thermal time and its connection with the concept of irreversibility. The author's succinct summary is stunning:  ""Time is an effect of our overlooking the physical microstates of things. Time is the information we don't have. Time is our ignorance.""  I absolutely love the powerful final chapter, Mystery, with its convincing argument why nothing but science can be reliable:  ""The answers given by science [...] are not reliable because they are definitive. They are reliable because they are not definitive.  This is the most powerful argument I have ever heard against all kinds of mumbo-jumbo that ignores science, which is particularly important in the times of a pandemic. The author provides two fascinating historical vignettes: the first about a ""race"" to formalize Einstein's theory between David Hilbert, one of the most famous mathematicians in history, and Albert Einstein. The other vignette is about a little known Belgian priest, Georges Lemaître, who showed that both Einstein in his skepticism about the expansion of the universe as well as pope Pius XII in his declaration that the Big Bang confirms the account of Creation given in Genesis were wrong.Fascinating read!Four-and-a-quarter stars."
272,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4277032-d,5,"I wholeheartedly agree with Manny's review.Applying Occam's razor clearly favors Loop Quantum Gravity (LCG) theory over String theory with its 11 or more dimensions. Amazingly, dropping the 'background' of empty space and time as basic notions simplifies obtaining LCG as a theory that makes General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics compatible. There are even some cosmological experiments that could test LCG: e.g. observing a black hole that expands again (bounces back) would suggest that space/matter is granular, making everything finite, again simplifying matters considerably, it seems. However this experiment shows that, if true, the size of a matter/space quantum should be really small: 10-48m (10 to the power of -48), much smaller than the Planck scale."
273,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,2,"39th book for 2017. A relatively quick read on modern physics starting with the Ancient Greeks and ending with Quantum Gravity. I have mixed feelings about the book. Rovelli's prose is quite poetic at times (and perhaps a little damaged in translation from the Italian). I found the historical background quite clear, but when he got to describing quantum gravity, and how space/time do not exist at the most basic level I was lost. That's a shame, because it's the most interesting part of the book. It would also have been nice to have a somewhat broader view of the rest of physics (e.g., String Theory; how does Dark Matter or Dark Energy fit in?). I was also a bit disturbed to read in other reviews that the form of Quantum Gravity being presented here is only the flavor that Rovelli is working on and he has left out other competing versions, which view time quite differently.Finally, and most annoyingly, large chunks of text are reused almost word for word from his previous book Seven Brief Lessons on Physics. If you have read the first, you have already third-to-half of this one (hence 2-stars)."

For decades, the only approach dominating to resolve the grand unification problem was the string theory and if like me you saw Brian Greene's dramatically made TV documentary then you might have been fooled into believing we have indeed solved it. But when our friendly particle collider @ Geneva, didn't throw out a bunch of predicted supersymmetric particles, the long suspected truth came into the reality that - String theory is not the last word! In contrast to string theory, LQG has been steadily building up and has found much stronger footing. Carlo starts from antiquity in ancient Greece to the original apple guy Newton and to our generation's greatest genius maverick Einstein, before introducing LQG. A short book with beautiful explanations of some rather tough concepts. A fun read, to say the least!My Rating - 5/5"

278,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22241323-judy,3,"Rovelli tells the reader that he’s written with a particular reader in mind: someone who knows little or nothing about today’s physics but is curious to find out what we know, as well as what we don’t yet understand, about the elementary weave of the world. (p 8)I need to acknowledge that Physics has never been my favorite branch of science. However, I've always been intrigued by how Physicists think, so when my niece gave this book 3-stars and said it was ""pretty good,"" I decided to give it a try. I'm reading her copy of the book, so I can't write in it, but I am noting quite a few page numbers, most of which indicate something I want to give some thought. This isn’t going to be a review but rather a list of ideas that are food for thought (to me anyway).p 21: Our life is a combination of atoms, our thoughts are made up of thin atoms, our dreams are the products of atoms; our hopes and our emotions are written in a language formed by combinations of atoms; …That is true at a very fundamental level. (Thin atoms?)p 29: The definitive proof of the ‘atomic hypothesis’ had to wait until 1905. It was found by a rebellious 25 year-old who had studied physics but had not been able to find employment as a scientist …Einstein, of course.p 33: The closure of the ancient schools such as those of Athens and Alexandria, and the destruction of all the texts not in accordance with Christian ideas was vast and systematic …Apparently Plato and Aristotle were viewed as pagans. Democritus was even “worse.” I’d like to read more about these ancient thinkers.p 39: In the world of Democritus as sung by Lucretius -There is no fear of the gods; … There is a deep love of nature, a serene immersion within it; a recognition that we are profoundly part of it; that men, women, animals, plants, and clouds are organic threads of a marvelous whole, without hierarchies.In the Biological or Chemical use of the word, clouds wouldn’t be considered organic, … but this is a Physicist writing. (I think I like Democritus.)p 44: Mathematics allows the world to be described and the future to be predicted.Oh, my!p 47: A reminder:Experimental science begins with Galileo. His experiment is simple: he lets objects fall … and seeks to measure precisely their falling speed.p 69: I don't know enough to appreciate statements such as this one.Newton’s mechanics are not compatible with the existence of a fundamental velocity, because what enters Newton’s equations is acceleration, not velocity.p 81: Einstein, in an “extraordinary stroke of genius” asks:What if Newton’s space is nothing more than the gravitational field? This extremely simple, beautiful, brilliant idea is the theory of general relativity.The words are straightforward, but I can’t appreciate the significance.p 93: For Einstein, the theory of general relativity is a mental image of the world arduously translated into equations.And here’s another idea that seems really important, but I don’t fully grasp.p 153: Rovelli made a valiant attempt at explaining the scale of matter that is the subject of this book … and it surpasses my imagination.It is at this extremely minute scale that quantum gravity manifests itself. To give an idea of the smallness of the scale we are discussing: if we enlarged a walnut shell until it had become as big as the whole observable universe, we would still not see the Planck length. Even after having been enormously magnified thus, it would still be a million times smaller than the actual walnut shell was before magnification. At this scale, space and time change their nature. The become something different; they become ‘quantum space and time.’p 172:  Quanta of gravity are not in space; they are themselves space.Whew! That’s a lot to take in.p 176: If I wanted to pursue time travel, I suspect that I would need a solid understanding of these ideas:Time emerges, like space, from the quantum gravitational field. … The moment we take quantum mechanics into account, we recognize that time too must have those aspects of probabilistic indeterminacy, granularity, and relationality, which are common to all of reality. It becomes a ‘time’ markedly different from all that we have hitherto meant by the word.p 192: Here’s something that both blows me away and strikes me as totally incomprehensible.Every cubic centimeter of space, and every second that passes, is the result of this dancing foam of extremely small quanta. …. Light is formed by quanta of a field; space is nothing more than a field, which is also made of quanta; and time emerges from the processes of this same field. In other words, the world is made entirely from quantum fields.p 225: Ahh, something I do understand (at least to some extent):Stephen Hawking theoretically deduced that black holes are “hot.” They behave like hot bodies: they emit heat. In doing so, they lose energy and hence mass (since energy and mass are the same thing), becoming progressively smaller. They “evaporate.”. This is Hawking’s most important discovery.Maybe, if I read this another three or four or five or … times, just maybe I could summarize the big ideas. But I can’t do that now."
279,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"I had come across references to Carlo Rovelli previously, probably in the books I read by Lee Smolin, so when I saw this come into the library I was interested in checking it out. Rovelli is a leader in research into the ""Loop Quantum Gravity"" approach to fundamental physics, and this book describes that perspective in fairly simple non-mathematical terms, rather than in depth. The book is aimed at the layperson with little knowledge of physics, so it takes the historical approach starting with Democritus and explaining the differences between Newton, relativity and quantum mechanics before getting into the new story. (I hadn't known that LQG was actually first proposed in the early thirties by a Soviet physicist Matvei Bronstejn, who was murdered by Stalin in 1938.) Rovelli represents LQG as the most conservative of the approaches to quantum gravity, being based only on synthesizing general relativity, Standard Model quantum theory and thermodynamics rather than postulating new extra dimensions and totally unknown entities such as strings and branes as string theorists do. Nevertheless it is very radical in what it proposes: that rather than the world existing in space and time, space and time are constructed from the interactions of atomic quantum events. (Atomic in the sense of ""indivisible"", not as in the modern sense of nucleus and electrons; these ""atomic"" quanta of space are millions of time smaller than an atom.) His description of the theory was more understandable than the description by Smolin in the earlier Three Roads to Quantum Gravity, I think partly because the theory has become more developed in the meantime. (This book was published in 2014 in Italian, but since the text mentions the discovery of gravity waves last year it was obviously revised for the English translation.) Of course, without the mathematics I couldn't really understand it (and with the mathematics I certainly couldn't have understood it) but it did give an idea of what the theory is about. Judging by Smolin and Rovelli, LQG theorists are better philosophers than string theorists are; I'm not sure whether that's good or bad for a physicist's reputation."

It is, however, my first book on loop quantum gravity, and on that level I acknowledge myself speechless. Time is destroyed. Matter is presented as spinfoam, which is even stranger than it sounds. And there are some aspects on information theory I don't think I had heard before, either (then again, information theory gives me headaches, mostly when applied to black holes, so I might have missed out on stuff there earlier). Well. Surprising to say the least. One would think there would have been an announcement or something. The first hundred or so pages are an easy read, as a historical overview of the progress from Democritus to Einstein. From then onwards it becomes a bit of a struggle. I managed to read the historical overview in a day and it took me two weeks to go through the other hundred and fifty pages. I almost gave up twice. However, if you are interested in the subject, have some foreknowledge and you hang on to it you will probably get to it in the end. Personally I think I am going to need a second book on the subject after this introduction. Not sure if am seeking a second explanation or a second medical opinion, really, but the theory does seem worth exploring more in depth."

WHAT?!Do things that happen in nature require a cause in order to be properly explained? The answer to this was a resounding yes back in the days of Newton. This seems rather straightforward and our intuitions back it up. But what we are now finding out from quantum gravity is utterly shocking, and a blow to the cause-and-effect paradigm that helps us make sense of our world. This is a book about the fundamental nature of the universe: what is reality? What is reality made out of? How does it relate with what we know? What does reality mean for our own existence? Why did the universe bang into existence? Will the universe be there forever? What is forever anyway?Once someone thinks things through, then it becomes easy to understand what they are saying because they'll be able to tell you something that is condensed. The author has properly thought through the concepts that explain reality and in this book he summarizes them very well. I had no trouble understanding what he was saying up until the last chapter on Information Theory, but that's okay because he said the theory is not yet solidified. Aside from simplicity, it was also beautiful.It seems that the theories are pointing towards a non-dualistic structure of nature. I hope someday we'll have a grand theory that explains everything.The truth is in the depths. — Democritus"

I thoroughly enjoyed this introduction to the theory behind loop quantum gravity. I thought the author, Carlo Rovelli, did an excellent job of illustrating some complex theoretical physics in a manner that is easy for anybody to understand, whether you are a physics pro or you have very little background in or aptitude for physics. To do this feat, Rovelli started way back in the beginning, way back in Ancient Greece, with Aristotle and Archimedes, and he revisited Greece many times throughout the book. He took a great deal of the book to explain the physics of Einstein in a way that made it even more clear to me, even though I’ve studied relativity before, and the same with the quantum revolution. Rovelli introduced quantum gravity with a high level discussion fit for everybody, flowing language to make it slide down easy, and some excellent illustrations. Although the concepts are difficult and theoretical in nature, the poetic illustrations Rovelli provided made these ideas tangible for anyone to grasp. I listened to the audio version, which was very well done. "

285,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,5,"It is always a pleasure when one comes across a book such as this. Theoretical physicist Rovelli, who works in the area relating to Quantum Gravity, goes out of his way to introduce key concepts of his chosen discipline, and successfully manages to communicate its mysteries to us laypersons in language that is clear and informative. We are all made wiser and more appreciative as a result.Rovelli sees his current profession as being the result of a history of ideas about the nature of reality, and he lightly traces out this history, quickly arrives at the Miletians (Thales, Anaximander, etc) and then circa 450 BCE on to Leucippus and his young disciple Democritus and the idea of atomism. In a sense, the stage is now set for the development of further ideas that will ultimately result in Quantum theory and Quantum mechanics. Rovelli traces the acceptance, denial, dismissal, revival of these and associated ideas in a sweeping through-the-centuries overview that is exciting and adventurous, and we soon arrive at Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, and then Einstein and all the other associated physicists we may be more knowledgeable about today.Each step along the way is spelled out clearly and simply. Of course, this is not to say that the reader necessarily understands all the possible implications, but we do begin to see the links between: Space, Time and Spacetime; Particles and Fields; how Spacetime and Fields link to form Covariant Fields; and Fields and Particles combine to form Quantum Fields; and ultimately how Quantum Fields and Spacetime unite to form the “single ingredient”, Covariant Quantum Fields, which Rovelli considers to be the answer to the question “What is the word made of?”This is the conclusion that the author comes to, and his arguments form the rationale of the first three parts of this book. At the same time, he is aware that this view is not necessarily the accepted view of every physicist. His understanding based on loop-theory/loop-quantum-gravity suggests that at the very deepest level his research has lead him, time might very well not exist, nor even particles or quanta (he uses terms such as “Spacetime sushi” and “Spinfoams”) — the suspicion, perhaps, that we may all need to reconsider and/or reevaluate the validity of all current models of reality.Yet Rovelli pushes the envelope even more in Part Four, which is entitled “Beyond Space and Time”, where he explores other issues such as Beyond the Big Bang, Quantum Cosmology, Quantum Black Holes, and the End of Infinity. His final chapter is entitled “Mystery”, where he essentially reminds his readers that there remain more and more unknowns that need to be explored.For the cynics among us (and I would consider myself to be partial to the odd cynicism at times!) all the above is just a load of speculative bull that has no relevance whatever to “real” reality, i.e. what we might call the “four dimensional” Space-Time Continuum. This is the “place” where we as individuals need to position ourselves and negotiate our way about in order to survive and live our lives as happily as possible. Even on this level the title of this book (“Reality Is Not What It Seems”) makes sense — we can be deceived and/or misled by our senses (and even, sometimes, by our intelligence) with very unfortunate results… It could be that thinking too deeply on the “nature” of physical reality is not good for our health and well-being — pretty much the same as, say, for people suffering from schizophrenia or paranoia, or even for a whole slew of physiological, social, religious and psychological reasons: they believe that their experiences are real: for them Reality is exactly what it seems!Whatever one might think about this, it doesn’t mean that this book must needs be dismissed. If you want to know what Quantum Gravity physicists are on about, then this book strikes me as being a very good place to start."

Now I know what the universe is made of, and how to reconcile quantum gravity with the standard model. I truly expected to be left dangling at the end of this book, which takes the reader on a beautifully written, often funny, often moving journey from the ancient greeks to modern day, building up a picture of what we understand are the building blocks of the universe. There's a little bit of maths, but nothing that ought to daunt anyone who did maths in high-school and still remembers it, but mostly it's just a wonderfully written, and incredibly informative narrative.The original text was written in Italian and has been translated, and I could not help reading most of it with an Italian accent.

Rovelli says, ""I don't criticize those who prefer to believe in [Truth and certainty]"" but he says they are ""immersed in ignorance."" He says ""we don't have absolute certainty"" about reality, the hallmark of science, except for his own certainty that what is written in the ""Great Book"" is silly. And somehow for reasons unexplained, being a quantum physicist gives him the means by which to apply the scientific method to all moral questions whatever, where ""it makes little sense to ask whether a half-cut fingernail is still 'me,' or has become 'not-me' . . . or precisely when a child's life begins."" If there is always universal uncertainty for any question whatever, which Rovelli clearly does not confine to questions of science, then by what standard can you judge any action or any belief? "

All the tests, last 100 years, have proven general relativity and quantum mechanics correct. The problem happens when we look at extremes they can't be both correct. Especially gravity. Quantum gravity removes infinity, removes singularity and takes Democritus to the word. Basic component of space is the ATOM. And it is the size of the Planck length. As for time, there is not time, there is entropy."

I love Rovelli's writing so much! ❤️❤️❤️ Keywords: popular science, physics, astronomy, cosmology, general relativity, loop quantum gravity, big bounce   ""The curiousity to learn, to discover, to look over the next hill, the desire to taste the apple; these are the things which make us human.""   REVIEW  Have you ever heard about Big Bounce? It's an alternate theory to Big Bang, that maybe the universe as we know it is a result of contracting and expanding explosion. Reality is Not What it Seems, tells about this theory and the theory that become the core of big bounce: loop quantum gravity. Loop quantum gravity is a theory that will unite relativity and quantum mechanics, two which are very opposite of each other.  The Explanation is Easy to Understand  This book is written in very clear and slow explanations. Things are explained in layman terms, that even people who doesn't know physics will understand. His topic escalate slowly, from the foundation to the hardest part of the theory. From what is atoms, to what is field, gravitation, time, universe and so on escalate until quantum loop gravity. He often compares today's scientific theories with philosophies from ancient time; mentioned ancient philosophers and tells us their contribution to building of nowadays's science. There are many new insights I didn't know before and albeit the topic of quantum loop gravity itself very hard, I can quite grasp the bigger picture due to this book.  I love his humility  I also love how Carlo Rovelli is very humble. He always mentioned that he himself is not certain. Do not believe something with blind faith because our scientific knowledges have a limit and what we thought is true may be proven otherwise later. He encourage scientific thinking, that is to never fear of learning and unlearning things that we know. Conclusion  The topic of this book is very specific so unless you really curious about it you might not enjoy it. But the explanation is easy to understand so you don't need to fear that it will be hard to read. I recommend this to those who want to know more about astronomy, astrophysics, or physics itself in general.   ""Science is continual exploration of ways of thinking. Its strength is its visionary capacity to demolish preconceived ideas, to reveal new regions of reality, and to construct novel and more effective images of the world. This adventure rests upon the entirety of past knowledge, but at its heart is change. The world is boundless and iridescent, we want to go and see it. We are immersed in its mystery and in its beauty, and over the horizon there is unexplored territory. The incompleteness and the uncertainty of our knowledges, our precariousness, suspended over the abyss of the immensity of what we don't know, doesn't render life meaningless, it makes it interesting and precious.""

293,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"Carlo Rovelli's first book (aside from 7 Brief Lessons...), Reality is Not What it Seems, is a beautiful narrative regarding the foundational human conceptions of the fabric of reality ranging from Democritus and Anaximander's conception of the apeiron (""the primal substance of which everything is formed"") and concluding at the precipice of modern theoretic physics: Quantum Gravity. Rovelli begins by setting the stage of modern theoretical physics by first introducing the historical conceptions of the nature of reality, discussing ideas from ancient minds such as Democritus, Lucretius, and Anaximander who together postulated an astoundingly clarivoyant theory that everything was comprised of super-small components called ""atoms"" (humanity would have to wait for proof of such a claim until 1905). With a brief digression into some pleasing philosophical musings of the aforementioned thinkers, necessitated by the inability to test any of these theories, Rovelli moves on to explain the original of classical mechanics.Moving forwards in time (inside joke-- read the book!), Rovelli elegantly and relevantly presents the origins of several seminal ideas in classical mechanics like gravity (Galileo + Newton) planetary motion (Copernicus & Newton), the mathematical foundations upon which such theories were based (Plato/Aristotle/Pythagoras/etc - that physical processes could be modeled with mathematics), and the physical and philosophical implications of the new ways of thinking about the world. Not even a few centuries go by before Faraday, Maxwell, and their co-intellectuals of the 1800s arrive on the scene and postulate the notion of an ""Electro-Magnetic Field"", solving some of the greatest mysteries about the forces of electricity and magnetism by presenting a mathematical model of particles and fields that move through space and time. Upon the shoulders of such great conceivers, Einstein publishes a series of seminal papers that almost literally invoke a formal conception of ""atomic physics"", or ""particle physics""-- not only does Einstein prove that atoms exist, he also proves (via irrefutable mathematical models that predict reality down to the ump-teenth decimal place) that time is not consistent for all matter within space, AND that space and time themselves may be constituted by the notion of a Gravitational Field (with a stroke of genius, he applies Maxwell's conception of fields and particles to gravity!). The descriptions of special relativity, quantum mechanics, and general relativity are all eloquently and concisely explained by Rovelli, thus I choose to not digress here into any explanation of such awesome theories of reality and instead implore you to read the book! Throughout this section, short digressions into the theories and contributions of seminal quantum physicists such as Dirac, Heisenberg, Bohr, Wheeler, Feyman, etc., are discussed for support and insight for the nuanced non-intuitive conceptions of reality portrayed. This section is concluded with a thorough yet concise explanation of the three pillars of quantum mechanics: granularity, indeterminacy, and relationality. Perhaps the most intriguing of which to me was the notion that our universe is finite-but-without-boundaries: Einstein conceived of such a property of the universe with the notion of a 3-sphere-- yet again I implore you to read the book!The 3rd section of the book and, in my opinion, crown jewel, is focused on an elaboration of the theory of Quantum Gravity. Without diving too deep, in an attempt to let Rovelli's art stand on its own: The theory of quantum gravity, along with its components (loop theory, spin-networks, spinfoam, etc), is an incredibly intriguing conception of physical reality with which a quantum-field theory of spacetime is theorized. No longer is space some inert container, but is comprised of quanta and the relationships between them; No longer is time a parameter to the functions and equations of such a physics, but is simply the evolution of the relations of said quanta! A human's conception of space and time emerge as the manifestation of the evolution of such relationships between the inconceivably small quanta (particles) of the quantum field of space time itself-- such quanta are not IN space, nor are they evolving IN time: the quanta and their relationships ARE space, and their (indeterminate) evolutions PRODUCE the conception of time. Admittedly, I had to re-read chapters of this section due to the non-intuitive nature of such a conception of reality; But, I reread them because I wanted to, and was so deeply intrigued by the subject matter during the first pass that I felt compelled to go back and read this section (all 50 pages) a second time around in an attempt to understand it better. I, like Rovelli, believe that to understand a theory in any scientific domain, one must first become familiar with the ""episteme"" (- Foucault) or underlying scientific and philosophical framework from whence the theories came; Thus, I thoroughly enjoyed the progression of the book, and the attention to detail that Rovelli gave to ancient (Greek) conceptions of what reality might be comprised, and how these conceptions evolved through the centuries, discovered or invented by the great minds such as Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, Einstein, and now, quantum gravity theorists! I finished this book with a greater holistic understanding of ways in which to think about physical reality, and excitedly: a potential theory that might traverse the chasm between general relativity and quantum mechanics!Rovelli concludes the book by pushing even further into the unknown. He first discusses how the new theory of Quantum Gravity is being tested, confirming certain theories about the inception (or continuation) of our universe (think: The Big Bang... or, The Big Bounce!), and how it may play large role in the future of astronomy, ultimately better describing our universe at a macro scale than general relativity does! Venturing even further, Rovelli postulates interesting techniques for interpreting still-confounding aspects of reality with ideas such as the potential application of information theory to quantum mechanics, how time might be best quantified by (and even integrated mathematically into) thermodynamic phenomena, and how the notion of infinity (within any conception of physical reality) might have a place after all: reality might be truly be finite, at the most foundational level.I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did. It has presented to me a world of ideas-- the greater understanding of which I will pursue for the rest of my life-- in addition to the universe of ways (hopefully a finite 3-sphere) in which to better conceive reality."

Oh! Rovelli, for peace and order's sake, can you please at least talk some sweet words to forget my misery for the chaos driven by Zeno's paradox? :) The concept of Infinity, as well as time, is only our ignorance, our limitations. In this book, Rovelli talks about the basic ideas behind loop quantum gravity, considering the feature of granularity, indeterminacy and probabilistic behavior. Loop quantum gravity, tries to combine general relativity with quantum field theory. In the world of Quantum Gravity, the principle of cause and effect no longer holds. Space, particles, quanta only exist when they interact only probabilistically. The book does not get into any quantitative detail for the knowledgeable reader but maybe it can at least provide the outline for the laypersons. It doesn't matter if complex issues like loop quantum gravity or superstrings are best possible answers for the intense situations like blackhole or the beginning of our known universe but this book is a poem. In fact, when Rovelli recites his poem I couldn't stop myself to put his beautiful lyrics into my mouth and suck it like a strawberry. He plays the chord of esoteric quantum gravity in an amazing way that the music infused through my veins to mandate a cosmic orgasm. :)Favorite line:  ""It is only in interactions that nature draws the world.""

295,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40566664-knowlton-murphy,4,"A book on quantum physics for dumb people! Right up my alley. I do not have a brain for math or physics, so I am deeply indebted to the kind of work Rovelli has produced. I am absolutely sure I did not understand everything, but it was a fun and thought-provoking ride, and the fact that I understood anything is more a mark of Rovelli's skill in communication than my own acuity. The book is worth reading for its summary of the history of physics, and for its accessible explanation of quantum gravity. Rovelli, in general, writes clearly, and entertainingly. My favorite aspect of loop theory is its central prediction that ""...space is not a continuum, it is not divisible ad infinitum, it is formed of 'atoms of space'..."" (168) That is, ""...arbitrarily small chunks of space do not exist. There is a lower limit to the divisibility of space."" (169) What do you know. As a Christian, this is an interesting point because of its theological value: it draws that much more of a distinction between Creator and Created. Finitude is woven into the fabric of our created existence. There is nothing physical we can look to that compares to the infinitude of God. As a human with practical concerns in daily life, this matches my experience of life...I don't have to traverse an infinity of atomic infinities to reach my mug of tea. I can finally stop thinking about swift Achilles chasing that slow tortoise, forever doomed to fail! My second favorite concept is that of reality being relational. It is something I have thought about culturally in seeking to understand my own culture, but Rovelli helped me think about the relational nature of reality beyond the sociological sense. Again, this raised a theological point for me. As a Christian of my particular theological convictions, it makes sense to see the world in terms of relationships, because I believe God is a Trinity, a being who exists eternally in relationship.I was fascinated by Rovelli's guidance through the history of physics. It was cool to see how Democritus' idea of atomic/granular reality has become so validated. I do think that his atomic worldview is nightmarish, though:""There is no finality, no purpose, in this endless dance of atoms. We, just like the rest of the natural world, are one of many products of this infinite dance--the product, that is, of an accidental combination...Our life is a combination of atoms, our thoughts are made up of thin atoms, our dreams are the products of atoms; our hopes and our emotions are written in a language formed by combinations of atoms, which bring us images."" (21, summary by Rovelli)Rovelli returns to Democritus in his penultimate chapter to point out that ""...it is not just a question of these atoms but also of the order in which they are arranged...We are not atoms: we are orders in which atoms are arranged, capable of mirroring other atoms and mirroring ourselves."" (256) For me, this raises a cause for concern. Rovelli can speak romantically about human nature all he wants, but the only hope any of us have for reflecting the kind of good humanity he envisions is for our atoms to order themselves properly. Which according to Democritus is completely subject to accidental chance. Rovelli says atoms can think about themselves (256). This is quite a leap to me, but Rovelli manages it with graceful ease. Random accidents of atomic chance not only create the ordered world I inhabit, but align in such a way to lead to my sentient experience of it...seven billion times over. But I am not a theoretical physicist, so perhaps I just don't have enough faith. Speaking of faith, Rovelli has a flawed view of religion. He seems to think that the role of religion is primarily that of comfort for people who cannot bear the harsh nature of reality. He never suspects that people might be interested in religion as a means of pursuing truth. ""Ignorance can be scary. Out of fear, we tell ourselves calming stories: up there beyond the stars there is an enchanted garden, with a gentle father who will welcome us into his arms. It doesn't matter if it's true--it is reassuring."" Precisely what is reassuring about this system? This isn't historic Christianity, for example, which by and large holds sacred texts like 1 John 1:1-4 and 2 Peter 1:16 (which appeal to the reality of eyewitness as a grounds for believing in truth) or 1 Timothy 4:7 (which specifically tells us to not waste time with myths). Rather, Rovelli is describing existentialism...looking at the absurdity of our existence and seeking comfort in a fabricated view of reality, all the while knowing deep down that it is a lie. Incidentally, that's exactly what Rovelli does. He is convinced that men are not made ""...to live like brutes, but to seek virtue and knowledge"" (263-64, quote from Dante), but never bothers explaining why.Rovelli repeatedly says he wants to keep an open mind in case he is wrong. Clearly his idea of open-mindedness could never entertain supernaturality, though, so one wonders how genuine his claim is, especially in a world where materialists are minorities. Ironically, one of his suggestions for why people choose to be religious is that they ""...prefer to believe in a story just because it was believed by the tribe's ancestors, rather than bravely accept uncertainty."" (262) Wait. What about ancient Democritus, patriarch of the materialism, being right about atomic reality, which was counter-intuitive, and that magnificent list of heroes upon whose shoulders we sit (chapters 1-4)? Does Rovelli really have no mechanism for seeing the parallel? Ah well. The biggest awkward elephant in the room is of course that he doesn't really bother speculating where atoms come from. The closest he comes to saying where our current atoms come from is The Big Bounce (206-07), but it is funny for him to spend so much time talking about how the universe is finite only to gently acknowledge it is also eternal."
296,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5861984-judyta-szaci-o,5,"I can’t really explain what it is that drives me to keep reading books about things I stand no chance to comprehend. This one is probably the most incomprehensible of all that I’ve read on the subject of quantum physics so far, though, admittedly, it is also very skillfully written. Beautifully woven phrases intermingle with claims, terms and equations that I’m not equipped to understand. Even though it is still a pop-science book, on the spectrum of pop-science literature it is quite far removed from Michio Kaku’s light writing (e.g. Parallel Worlds: A Journey through Creation, Higher Dimensions, and the Future of the Cosmos) and much closer to Brian Cox’s level of detail (The Quantum Universe: Everything That Can Happen Does Happen), though Cox’s book was made even more obscure than it had to be by weird thought experiments meant to make it easier for the reader to visualise things, and failing. Rovelli doesn’t bother with thought experiments, he just ‘says it as it is’ in grand style.By no means am I trying to say that reading this book was a waste of my time. Quite the contrary, I did get a slightly better insight to how physicists think, even if I failed – as usual – to comprehend the essentials. Also, this book is the first one I’ve read that talks about an alternative hypothesis to the popular string theory: the loop theory, Rovelli’s (and others) intellectual child. Perhaps the lack of infinite universes makes it less cool in people’s eyes, but I find it comforting that there may not be, after all, countless other ‘mes’ capable of screwing up in innumerable ways!"
297,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18234199-prateek-saini,5,"A magnificent read. Carlo Rovelli has done a remarkable job to put down such complicated concepts into simple, easy to understand language. One of best thing about book is style of connecting all the dots throughout history, right from Democritus's theory of atoms in 400BC to Quantum gravity loop in modern era. Definitely, a must-read for anyone who loves Physics."

Basically ""can we see gravity as a quantum field too and what would the solutions look like?""The picture of time in this setting pretty closes matches my intuitive ""running theory"" :0Cool to hear it described with some more physical fidelity.I highly recommend the book :) (And it will probably help if reading the maths too :))"
299,0241257964,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4461733-paperclippe,5,"Thank goodness for Carlo Rovelli and thank goodness for quantum gravity.I am and have been so sick and tired of pop-sci books and their final parts and chapters always being about string theory (readers of my reviews will undoubtedly know this by now). But this, this whole book is exactly what I have been looking for for very nearly the past ten years. It opens with a very brief (well, not too brief; it does take about half of what is actually a very short book) overview of classical physics, then general and special relativity, then quantum mechanics, and then dives right in to the heart of the matter: quantum gravity, or loop gravity, or loop quantum gravity; even Rovelli seems to use the terms interchangeably. The writing style was amazing. Fantastic. So light and breezy and conversational. Funny, even (there's really - and I am convinced of this - a ""The name of that man? Albert Einstein."" joke somewhere in chapter 2, and I lost my mind laughing), but still concise. The reader was great; his emphasis was spot-on. I'm half-tempted to listen to it over again and I wish my to-read list wasn't so long because I genuinely would. I enjoyed it that much.I won't lie - I didn't... quite catch on.At no point during this did I feel confused. At all. In fact, I almost feel like maybe the way Rovelli explained quantum gravity seemed... too easy? Space is granular, check. I follow. Time is what happens because we can't understand everything that's happening all the time. That's highly speculative and still, check, I gotcha, I follow. But if you wanted me to tell you what you what quantum gravity is right now? I'm not sure I could. Maybe that's okay though. Maybe that's okay because this is the first book like this - or at least the first one I've been able to get my hands on - and soon I'll be able to devour books on loop quantum gravity the same way I had the chance to eat up string theory before I realized that the point that it was getting to was indeed no point at all (I had to get one in there, so sue me). Maybe Carlo Rovelli is the Brian Greene of quantum gravity. I sure hope so. I could use a lot more books like this."
