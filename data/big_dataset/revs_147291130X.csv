0,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10592271-brokentune,5,"In a courtroom in France a few years before the murder in question, a prosecuting lawyer who was unsuccessfully trying to prove a case of murder by morphine declared thus: ‘Henceforth, let us tell would-be poisoners … use plant poisons. Fear nothing; your crime will go unpunished. There is no corpus delecti [physical evidence], for it cannot be found.’A is for Arsenic is one of those books that I will look forward to consulting again while I read my way through the the Agatha Christie novels. It is the perfect companion that explains (mostly without spoilers!) the science behind the poisons used in Christie's mysteries.While the book is written for readers / fans of Dame Agatha, Harkup makes sure to also include real life stories about the poisons, a description of their history, the science behind them, and information about detection and antidotes (where they exist!). I loved everything about this book - the content, the way Harkup relates information without overbearing and without expecting readers to have a full working knowledge of chemistry (tho a little understanding of chemistry and biology is required), and the way that each topic is structured into different sections (background, chemistry, link to Christie, antidotes).This was as entertaining as it was informative - and it even made me look up some more information about chemical compounds, which very few books or people have managed before. This is exactly the sort of book that I wish I had read when studying chemistry at school because it may actually have helped to give context to some of the theory about how things react with each other.Loved, loved, LOVED this."

If you go into the book with knowledge of chemistry, there is probably no problem, but I did not. I still really enjoyed learning about how all these poisons work and real life cases with them involved. It was also neat to see how Agatha Christie utilized them in her books."
2,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1109068-susanna---censored-by-goodreads,4,"Harkup knows her poisons *and* her Christie. (In most cases, she describes the cases without spoilers. In those cases where there are spoilers, this is clearly marked.)Christie also knew her poisons. She was by training a pharmacist, and poison was her preferred form of literary homicide. (She confessed that she didn't like to use murder by gun, as ""I know nothing of ballistics."") In most cases she was absolutely correct in her descriptions of the effects of various poisons - her most notable lapse was probably in her account of ricin poisoning. Harkup's footnotes are as worth reading as her text, by the way."
3,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21413858-k-j-charles,0,"A good overview of poisons--what they are, how they work, some famous poisoning cases, and how Agatha Christie used them in her books--mostly with incredible accuracy, but she was a trained pharmacist's assistant. Well written with a fun, breezy style that helps us across some really horrifying stuff about what various substances can do to the body. "
4,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/900340-nancy-oakes,4,"A is For Arsenic is most definitely a niche read, but it's a must-have for diehard Christie fans. I count myself in that category, and so does the book's author, Kathryn Harkup: she's described on the back-cover blurb as a ""chemist, author and Agatha Christie fanatic."" She combines all of these attributes in this book which focuses on fourteen different poisons (arsenic through Veronal -- alpha by poison) used by Christie to kill off several of her victims in her novels and short stories. After a brief introduction in which we discover (among other things) that Agatha Christie was a trained apothecary's assistant (dispenser) with an incredibly in-depth knowledge of poisons, Harkup wastes no time getting into the meat of this book. Let's take the opening chapter, which happens to be ""A is for Arsenic."" Each entry follows pretty much the same pattern, so I'll just offer a brief look at the first. The Christie title she associates with arsenic is Murder is Easy (aka Easy to Kill). Harkup start with a short summary of the book (no spoilers) then moves into ""the arsenic story,"" which gives a bit of info about the history of this poison, ""long the preserve of the rich and powerful."" This particular part also goes into past crimes where arsenic was the poison of choice, as well as how scientists came up with tests designed to prove forensically that arsenic was used. From there it's ""How Arsenic Kills,"" which gets into arsenic's chemistry, the symptoms one might show when poisoned with it, and the resulting consequences and effects on the body. The next section asks ""Is there an antidote?"" followed by ""Some real-life cases."" [As a sidebar, I'll just mention that Harkup mentions one of my favorite cases here, that of Madeleine Smith, the Glasgow poisoner who got away with murder.] Then we move to ""Agatha and arsenic,"" where the author goes back to Murder is Easy, once again spoiler free.As an added bonus, there's an entire appendix in the back, ""Christie's Causes of Death,"" which is a table listing each story or novel written by Christie: the UK title, the murder method of choice, followed by the American title. If you want to see a sample photo, click  here. The only drawback I can see with this book is that each chapter has a subsection about the science of the particular poison -- scientific jargon that I'll admit goes over my head at times. I'll also admit to skimming through many of these sections precisely because I am a liberal arts person, and science mystifies me at times. However, aside from that aspect, the book is one I'd highly recommend to anyone who is a true Christie devotee, and it's a very welcome addition to my quickly-growing collection of crime-fiction reference books.

5,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"‘A is for Arsenic’ is a book written in 2015 comprehensively describing all of the poisons used by the murder mystery author Agatha Christie in her books (around 72 novels). Kathryn Harkup, the author of this encyclopedic work, is a chemist, having completed a doctorate. Christie was a volunteer nurse in the World War I and passed examinations to qualify as an Apothecary’s Assistant in 1917.There were fourteen drugs used in many of Christie’s murder mysteries, so there are fourteen chapters in this interesting book. Each chapter names the novel(s) where Christie used the poison under discussion, describes the mystery’s plot and how the fictional murders occurred (but not who done it), and adds in real-life murders in which cases were suspected as either source material for Christie or that had happened maybe because of Christie’s novel. Harkup goes into detail about the history of the drug and how the drug kills (mostly by disrupting various atomic or cellular chemical activities throughout the body). Observed physical effects are gone into detail as well, which mostly are horrific. She also describes the chemical structure, including drawings, of the poison’s molecule. The book includes: an Appendix of Christie’s causes of death in every book whether poison or not; an Appendix of some drawings of the chemicals; a selected Bibliography; and an Index. A brief biography of Christie is included, too. There are also many informative notes per chapter. Did anyone notice I did not mention much about antidotes? Most of these poisons have no antidotes, although the author mentions what was, alas, tried and found to be ineffectual.The poisons are: Arsenic, Belladonna, Cyanide, Digitalis, Eserine, Hemlock, Monkshood, Nicotine, Opium, Phosphorus, Ricin, Strychnine, Thallium, Veronal.Personally I function in the world mostly with a Liberal Arts brain, so the chemistry bits went a wee bit over my head. I diligently studied everything schoolteachers threw at me, so, I wasn’t entirely at sea. I skimmed a few paragraphs, though.Anyway. The book is basically an interesting 300-page encyclopedia of selected poisons, as well as a companion book for readers of Agatha Christie novels. According to Harkup, Christie gets it right almost 100% of the time.The only lingering effect this book seems to have had on me is I currently will not eat or drink anything until I watch someone else go first - primarily my oblivious husband. Shhh."
6,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50173206-thomas-clairmont,4,It was a very interesting and informative book about poisons and how Agatha Christie used them in her novels/short stories.This is the perfect book for Agatha Christie fans but you don't need to have read the books to find this book very informative/interesting!
7,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/672756-book-her-danno,4,"A IS FOR ARSENIC is probably exactly the sort of book you will be expecting after reading the book blurbs... and more.A IS FOR ARSENIC is going to appeal to a wide audience. Fans of the mystery writer, Agatha Christie, are going to find the analysis of Christie's pharmaceutical background interesting (I had no idea), as well as how accurately she portrayed the toxins at work in her books. (She made some missteps but was extremely knowledgeable.)Budding-Mystery authors are going to find this a valuable research tool. And regular folk, if we can call those of us who are curious about such things 'regular', are going to enjoy the real crime descriptions that are included in A IS FOR ARSENIC, in addition to the Christie information. As well, I think we're going to be mesmerized by Harkup's histories of the toxins -- who discovered them, developed variations, and more importantly developed tests for detecting the poisons-- and descriptions of their effects and how they can be, or must be, administered so that they can do their dirty work.There are some deep technical paragraphs in each chapter that talk about real chemistry --valences and such-- for those of you with a chemistry background, but don't let that put others of you off. It is very very easy to skim over this super detailed information and keep turning pages. You won't feel cheated at all if you aren't interested in this part of the book.I found A IS FOR ARSENIC well organized and very interesting.... Don't get any ideas.~review copy"
8,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22733865-stephanie,3,"Very interesting, especially the history of the various drugs / poisons. Annoying that ""A Pocket Full of Rye"" was completely skipped, though."
9,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89242656-diana,5,"A is for Arsenic: The Poisons of Agatha Christie [2015] – ★★★★★15 September 2020 marks 130 years since the birth of Agatha Christie in 1890, and this review is meant to pay tribute to the ultimate Queen of Crime. The author of A is for Arsenic is Kathryn Harkup, a chemist by profession, who decided to plunge into all the poisons that Christie used in her books to come up with her perfect crimes. In A is for Arsenic, we first read about the scientific properties of each of the poisons used by Christie in her fiction, from arsenic and belladonna to opium and phosphorus (including their histories and the ways they kill), before the author illuminates the real cases involving these poisons, and finally talks about the fictitious cases in Agatha Christie’s books. It is clear that reading about different poisons has never been as morbidly fun or interesting as with this book since Harkup is an intelligent and succinct writer with a great sense of humour. A is for Arsenic is sure to fascinate and delight this Halloween season.Agatha Christie was always a very considerate writer who liked to research her books thoroughly before penning them. Once trained as a nurse, Christie knew something about poisons and their applications, and the knowledge she lacked she liked to gather. Harkup says that Christie’s “murders” and their solutions were almost always scientifically-plausible and that element alone made her books stand above one’s average detective thriller. Christie also liked to experiment, and some of her crimes in books are committed by rather unusual means where often the poison is either left untraceable or can be taken for an accidental overdose of a common prescribed medication.Kathryn Harkup structures her book in the following order: (i) a brief synopsis of a book by Agatha Christie where a poison was used; (ii) a history of a particular poison; (iii) the scientific characteristic of a poison, including the nature of its compound and how exactly it kills its victim; (iv) some real-life examples or famous real cases where that poison was administered to kill; and, finally (v) Agatha Christie’s fiction and how a particular poison was used by a murderer in the story. Each poison is listed in an alphabetic order, and we read about such dangerous compounds and plants as arsenic, belladonna, cyanide and hemlock. Their histories are often as illustrious as their reputation. For example, eserine is derived from beans grown in West Africa and were often used by local people to conduct trials by ordeal (to prove either guilt or innocence of an individual who swallows the beans). Similarly, we read how the poisonous hemlock may be mistaken for cow parsley, and how Socrates might have died by swallowing a concoction made of hemlock.Since the author is a PhD in chemistry, we read detailed and well-explained passages on the nature of chemicals in poisonous compounds and how they interact with other substances. What exactly produces a poisonous reaction; is there an antidote?; and what is the history behind scientific discoveries of each compound so far? In this vein, we read how the compound ricin is produced by the castor oil plant ricinus communis, which grows in the world’s tropical regions, and find out how the use of white phosphorus in match-making factories in the 1880s was responsible for one horrific disease – the phosphorus necrosis of the jaw or “phossy jaw”. There has always been a fine line between the medicine that gets us better and the compound that kills – a harmless stimulant may turn into a poisonous killer in an instant and with just a few more milligrams of the same compound. Thus, it is the doctors who have often straddled that fine line, and that may explain their high number as characters in Christie’s literary creations.Both the scope and depth of Harkup’s book is impressive, but, more impressive still is the research, especially her research into some very little-known real cases of poisoning by some very rare substances. The amazing thing is that the real cases presented in the book seem even more bewildering and unbelievable than any fiction that Christie penned. To that effect, we read about the exploits of the infamous George Henry Lamson, a doctor who poisoned his victim using aconitine (devil’s helmet or monkshood) in a cake, and even about one rare case of poisoning by nicotine! from the year 1850. When Harkup finally returns to Christie’s stories, she speculates on how the murderer there could have obtained the poison and whether it all is sufficiently realistic given all the science. The great thing here is that the author never gives out any spoilers – she says just enough to whet our appetites so that we will rush to pick up this or that detective story.The conclusion is that A is for Arsenic is a “must-read” for any fan of Agatha Christie, as well as for all those who either like to marvel at all things macabre in science or crime, or who are simply interested in various poisons and their effect on the human body."
10,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"As someone who writes a lot about quantum physics, where systems can be in more than one state at a time, I want to give this book a superposition of star ratings: it's a beautiful book, excellently researched and painstakingly detailed, which gets it a solid four stars, but the nature of the contents makes it more like a mini-encyclopedia, rather than something that reads well from end to end, hence the three stars.The book has a lot of promise to hit the spot. If, like me, you are interested in both science and crime writing, a study of the poisons used in Agatha Christie's books seems a natural fascinator. Kathryn Harkup takes us through a whole range, from familiar favourites (as it were) like arsenic and strychnine to more unusual possibilities like nicotine, phosphorous and ricin. Each poison has its own section, where we learn how Christie used it, how the poison works, what's an antidote (if anything), real life examples of using the poison and then return to Christie for more details of the way that the poison fits with her plots.We start with some really interesting biographical material on why Christie was so good on the subject of poisons (she was trained as a pharmacist's dispenser), and once we settle down into the individual poison sections there is some genuinely fascinating material, particularly in the real life poisonings. But the repeated format does become a trifle tiresome after a while. This particularly applies to the bits that describe how the poison attacks the body (which can be somewhat repetitious) and also when Harkup describes the Christie plots - not because these are spoilers (though sometimes they are), but more because descriptions of novel plots are almost always tedious to read.I am reminded of the two different ways books have approached the elements of the periodic table. Some work through element by element - and reading such titles gets to be a bit of grind. But others, notably Sam Kean's excellent The Disappearing Spoon, are story driven and meander around without the same rigid structure. That approach is so much better to read because even non-fiction books need a narrative to be readable, and an encyclopedia-like repeated format can't deliver that.So there's nothing wrong with this book. It is beautifully made - one of the most elegant popular science books I've ever seen with a gorgeous textured cover and elegant chapter heading graphics. And Harkup combines some interesting stories of real life poisoning with a generally light and highly readable tone. But the format naggingly gets in the way of this being a true popular science masterpiece.All Agatha Christie fans, and many with an interest in poisons and true crime will enjoy the book and will want it in their collection, but it could have been even better."
11,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6945307-damaskcat,5,"This is a well written and very informative book about poisons and how Agatha Christie used them in her novels and short stories. You don't need to have read the books to find this book interesting as it will be of interest to anyone who reads crime novels. Christie did have professional knowledge of poisons before she started writing full time so it is perhaps not surprising that the details in her books are accurate.Each poison has a section to itself and the author relates the history of the substance and its uses, if any, in medicine as well as a poison. How easy or difficult it would have been to obtain the poison at the time Christie's books or stories were written is also detailed together with the ways the law has changed since then. Real life poisoning cases are also detailed. How the poison works and its chemical make up are also covered and I have to confess to skipping some of the more technical passages as I found my O level chemistry was not really up to the task.But the chemical details make up a very small part of the text and not always being able to understand these small sections did not spoil my enjoyment of the whole book which is a mine of information. There are two appendices to the book - one a detailed list of all Christie's books with causes of death of the victims and the other one showing chemical diagrams for all the poisons discussed. There is a bibliography and an index as well.This is a fascinating book for anyone who loves Agatha Christie's writing and for anyone who reads crime novels or true crime. "
12,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1864004-iona-sharma,5,"I found this book utterly fascinating. The author identifies several different poisons used in Agatha Christie's books and spends a chapter on each, explaining the history of the poison, the science behind it and notable murders that have been committed with it! In some ways I don't think this even needed the connection with Agatha Christie - each chapter is very interesting in its own right and the author struggles writing about each book or short story without spoiling who the murderer is! - but it is also interesting to hear about each poison in the context of the early-to-mid twentieth century, when you could buy arsenic and strychnine over the counter. Some of the poisons I hadn't heard of - eg. eserine and thallium (the chapter on thallium includes details of a real-life poisoner which are UTTERLY DISTURBING) and others are very familiar, like arsenic and hemlock, but I learned a lot from it all. "
13,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1720603-baal-of,5,"This is another popular science book that hit the sweet spot for me. I liked the organization by poison, with the internal structure per poison of historical and scientific breakdown including discovery, isolation, detection, and mechanism by which the poison kills, followed by real life cases and then how Christie employed the poison in her fiction. The writing is clear, concise, and easy to read, and I appreciate the level of detail Harkup chooses when discussing the chemistry. I did not know that Christie had such extensive knowledge about drugs, and it makes me want to go back and read more of her novels. I respect authors who strive for scientific accuracy in their stories."
14,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3848561-anatl,5,"An edifying read for Agatha Christie fans and for anyone who is interested in forensics. Also this book makes for a good companion read to The Poisoner's Handbook by Deborah Blum, both dealing with true crime stories that advanced the science of poison study as well as explaining the difficulty in finding chemical evidence of poisonings. Both books make chemistry and science accessible and fascinating while highlighting the history of dangerous chemicals and compounds in our gardens or homes."
15,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43064352-justin,4,"Wow. What an interesting look into the poisons the Queen of mystery, Agatha Christie, used in her books. Poisons have always been interesting to me but this book really went down a rabbit hole with the different kinds. Incredibly fascinating! One of the most intriguing nonfiction books I’ve ever read. A MUST for any Christie lover. "
16,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"I avoided picking this up for quite a while, mostly because I’m just not that interested in Agatha Christie’s work — she wrote some great mysteries, but I’m more interested in characters, and I’m not overly fond of any of hers. (Poirot and his mannerisms drive me mad, sorry.) It turns out that while this does talk a lot about Christie’s work, it also relates her ideas to actual chemistry — of which she’d have been aware of as an assistant in a dispensing chemist — and actual murders that she may have found inspiration from.All in all, it becomes a rather entertaining little package, not just focused on recounting the plots of Agatha Christie’s books. The chemistry involved was pretty easy for me to follow, but bear in mind that I am in my last year of a science degree! It might get a little too involved for people who are interested in this from the Agatha Christie end of the equation (while not, I think, being worth reading just for the explanations of how poisons work, because there’s a lot of social info and stuff about Christie and her plots as well). Fortunately, if you are a fan of Christie, Harkup doesn’t spoil any of her plots — or in the rare cases she has to for the sake of explaining things properly, she warns you in advance.I still would’ve liked to see it be about the Golden Age crime fiction in general, and then Harkup would’ve had a great one to analyse in the shape of Sayers’ Strong Poison… but that’s beside the point.Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."
17,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5492833-theravenking,4,"Agatha Christie killed a lot of people in her books and her murderers often used poison to achieve their means. Christie knew what she was writing about, after all she had been a nurse during World War I., and her works have been praised for their scientific accuracy when it comes to the effects of poisons. A is For Arsenic walks us through some of the Queen of Crimes’ most effective toxins. The chapters start with a scientific overview of the various poisons’ origins and their history before telling us how Christie utilized them in some specific works. We learn about strychnine, veronal, arsenic or cyanide. I found the chapter T is for Thallium particularly fascinating. It deals not only with the novel The Pale Horse but also tells the real life case of British serial-killer Graham Young who used this toxic element to kill several people. I just recently came across Young in one of Peter Lovesey’s mystery novels, and it was interesting to learn more about him. There are some omissions. Most notably my favourite (if you can call it that) poison taxine used in a Pocket Full of Rye. A is For Arsenic might not be for everyone. It helps if you have a scientific mind and a certain interest in chemistry, since the book can be a tad dry, but is nonetheless a worthy addition to any mystery fan’s library. "
18,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800824-michele,4,"Well-written, engaging, and interesting. More than just a catalog of poisons, the author integrates history, chemistry, and true crime, so you get a real sense of context. Each chapter has a section on the substance's physical/chemical effects (i.e., exactly how it kills you!), what medical uses it had and what superseded it, how easy it would have been to obtain back then (and now), real-life instances of use, how and where Christie uses it, how accurate her depiction is, etc. And she does it all without spoilers!"
19,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4929450-amanda,4,"I didn't know what to expect when I picked this book up. Harkup writes about some of the poisons Christie used in her stories. In each chapter, she introduces a poison used in one (or more) Christie stories and then expounds extensively about the poison, its chemical makeup, the effects of the poison, and its antidotes, if any. She goes on to refer to true crime cases that may have influenced Christie's stories, and then describes the story/stories in which Christie used the poison. If she is using spoilers, she states ahead of time to skip pages. The explanations about the chemical makeup of the poison sometimes went way above my head and wasn't really what I was wanting out of the book but I was really intrigued by most of the writing as a whole. I most especially enjoyed reading about Christie's background as a pharmacist technician in the interwar period. In most of her stories her descriptions about poisoning and its effects were detailed and correct. Sometimes she left out details that could leave matters open to interpretation but rarely was she ever outright incorrect.This story reminded me a bit of The Radium Girls: The Dark Story of America's Shining Women. It was throughly enlightening."
20,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8459833-atiya,4,"As a total Christie nerd (used to read one a week in school), I really enjoyed this study of 14 poisons that she used throughout her novels. The writer is a chemist herself and in each chapter she details the history, etymology, usage, real-life cases of murder and how accurate Christie was in her novel; for each poison. If there was such a thing as non-fictional fan fiction this is a pretty fun book to read. But of course the fun is if you have read all the novels mentioned in the book which is why I rated it four stars for not being that accessible."
21,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14855080-nazima-nasrullah,4," This book is well researched and well written, link between Agantha Christie's novels and real life poisoning cases added more fascination to it. Chemistry of poisons always fascinates me and this book hooked me till the very end. "
22,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5082359-bev,4,"A Is for Arsenic: The Poisons of Agatha Christie by Kathryn Harkup is a very good read for anyonewith an interest in poisons-- whether scientifically or because you're plotting your very own Golden Age style mystery--and/or Agatha Christie. Harkup gives the reader an A through V (Arsenic through Veronal) look at the poisons the Queen of Crime used in her stories. Each chapter features a new poison with a historical look at its development/discovery, actual murders committed using the poison, and the most pertinent Christie novel to incorporate the concoction in a crime. A handy list in the appendix gives a more detailed look at all the stories and the murder methods employed. For most of the chapters she manages to explain the poisonous substances and their use by Christie without spoilers and in cases where spoilers are unavoidable she gives fair warning so no one need fear having an unread Christie (is there such a thing?) ruined.She also gives a great deal of detail on Christie's extensive knowledge of poisons and medications which the author gained through her work as a nurse and apothecary's assistant during the First World War and as a dispenser at the University College Hospital during World War II. While, Christie did make some errors in her stories, she was correct most of the time with a high percentage of her scientific errors being due to a lack of information about the drugs at the time she wrote. And many doctors and critics of the time praised her for getting her details right.The most tedious portions of this book were the sections within each chapter that gave all the scientific details of each poison--chemical makeup, how to distill it (if distilling is necessary), how many different compounds were related, all the gory details of how the poison acts on the human body (details about the copious vomiting, extreme muscle spasms, etc. that Dame Agatha spares her readers), etc. I was far more interested in the relationship between Christie's knowledge and her usage in the books and the connections between her fictional murders and any real-life murders that occurred either before her books were written (and which may have influenced her stories) or the murders that occurred after publication (and which some critics tried to say might not have happened if Christie hadn't highlighted such-and-such poison).Overall, a thoroughly researched book that, for the most part, presents the subject matter in an engaging format. The scientific explanations, while a bit tedious to me, were not so technical that they went over my head and are written in language that the average reader should understand. It is particularly engaging for the Christie enthusiast who is looking for insight on her crimes.First posted on my blog My Reader's Block. Please request permission before reposting. Thanks."
23,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8706020-beth-cato,5,"If you have any interest in poisons and/or Agatha Christie, do check out this new book. It's absolutely fascinating. It goes into deep detail about the history of the poisons, how they work, if there are antidotes, and how Christie used the poison and her accuracy (which tends to be quite high). A is for Arsenic is a fast read. The chapters are short, and the way that it mixes Christie's fiction with fact works very well.I would categorize the book along with The Poisoner's Handbook by Deborah Blum for how it tackles history and science together; needless to say, I love Poisoner's Handbook as well. It's a book I have referred to multiple times in my writing. Harkup's book will likewise gain reference use. It actually already made me pause, as I think I need to make corrections to a manuscript I'll be editing soon.This is definitely one of my favorite nonfiction reads for the year. If you write fiction that involves poison, get it. If you love mysteries, get it. If you want to catch odd glances in public, get it (bonus points for how it has a cool vintage-style cover, too)"
24,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16294266-madhulika-liddle,4,"Agatha Christie’s very first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, when it was finally published in 1920, was reviewed by The Pharmaceutical Journal. Kathryn Harkup, in A is for Arsenic: The Poisons of Agatha Christie, writes: ‘This novel has the rare merit of being correctly written’, the reviewer stated. He believed the author must have had pharmaceutical training, or had called in an expert.The reviewer had guessed right: Agatha Christie was indeed trained—and she put that training to good use in many of her works (an exhaustive list of which forms one of the appendices to this book, which includes details of the method of murder in each Christie book). But, while the murder victims in Christie’s works are bludgeoned, stabbed, pushed down stairs and whatnot, a staggeringly large number of them are poisoned. The almost frightening accuracy with which Agatha Christie deals with poisons (as displayed in The Mysterious Affair at Styles) goes a long way in making these stories so convincing, and so entertaining. In A is for Arsenic, Harkup, herself a chemist, sets out to examine the poisons Christie uses in her books. Beginning with arsenic, through belladonna, cyanide, digitalis… to morphine, nicotine, phosphorus, strychnine, and thalium, Harkup discusses fourteen poisons that Christie’s killers use in her books. Harkup employs a systematic approach to each poison: its history (for example, in the case of plant-based poisons like ricin and nicotine, where it was first used, how it was used, and so on); how it works on the human body and how it kills; what antidotes exist (if any); what real-life cases—of murders, suicides, and accidental poisonings—there have been, and an analysis of Christie’s use of the poison in her books. I will admit to never having been good at chemistry; through school, that was one subject I could barely make sense of. So the chemistry angle of this book went a bit over my head (though I hasten to add: Harkup does make an effort to dumb it down for the lay reader, even supplying interesting everyday parallels to explain concepts). Other than that, though, everything else was very gripping, obviously well-researched, and thoroughly entertaining. Plus, I learnt a lot (for instance, why alcohol-based gels are used as hand sanitizers. Besides the detailed discussion on the poisons and their appearance in real life, Harkup delves deep into the use of the poison in Christie’s books. How it was possibly administered, what are the symptoms, what could the coroner (or other investigator) have deduced, what antidotes might have saved the victim, and whether the case is a plausible one or not. Except for a couple of cases—one, notably, of ricin, in The House of Lurking Death, where Christie seems to have been somewhat ham-handed with her use of the poison, how it would be procured, and so on— Christie seems to have been exceptionally conscientious about the factual element of what she wrote. An enlightening, very readable and interesting book. If you’re a fan of Agatha Christie, this is a must-read. "
25,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32687708-katheryn-thompson,4,"I have wanted to read this book ever since I heard about it, since I love both Agatha Christie and non-fiction books in fields I know little about, especially such fascinating (and potentially useful!) fields as poisons.In A is for Arsenic, Kathryn devotes a chapter to each of the fourteen poisons used by the Queen of Crime, explaining the role the poison plays in the murder mystery, background information on the poison itself, and real-life cases Agatha might have been inspired by or might even have inadvertently inspired. It is also worth noting that few spoilers are included, and the ones that are are very clearly marked as such.Kathryn writes clearly, concisely, and with a much-needed sense of humour, and her love for Agatha Christie shines out from the book as much as her knowledge of poisons does. I would highly recommend A is for Arsenic, although I have to warn you that it will make you want to read all of Agatha Christie's wonderful mysteries again."
26,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46920502-tara,4,"An interesting, if highly scientific background on the various poisons employed in Agatha Christie's mysteries. Presented in alphabetical order (hence A is for Arsenic), each chapter describes the scientific composition, symptoms, antidotes, real-life cases, and of course, the examples used by the Queen of Crime herself. There is also a neat chart in the appendix that lists all of the murder methods utilized in every Christie mystery (including non-poisonous ones). Certainly an enjoyable read, but more skewed towards those interested in chemistry."
27,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4977671-linz,4,"Good read, can be a bit bogged down with facts in places but well structured in its approach to the original stories."
28,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4814399-judy-lesley,5,"I was amazed at all the information in this book. Concentrating on the types of poisons used by Agatha Christie in her novels had to be pretty much a labor of love for British chemist Kathryn Harkup because you can tell immediately that she is also a fan of this great icon of crime fiction. The book is written from the British point of view with changes in book titles noted for the American market. I really had my doubts that this subject matter could be presented in such a way that it held my attention for the time it took to read the book, but by the end I found myself wishing there was just one more chapter. But then I would have wanted another and another.The book is very stylishly presented with artwork which is wonderfully evocative of the 1930s art deco style that I somehow assign to the Christie novels even though they were not all written during, or for, that time period. Maybe the really good television series has something to do with that. Each chapter deals with one specific poison beginning with arsenic, then belladonna, cyanide, digitalis, eserine, hemlock, monkshood, nicotine, opium, phosphorus, ricin, strychnine, thallium, and veronal. Each chapter leads off with a brief synopsis of the major novel, or in one instance a short story, the author will be using as an example of the use of that specific poison, then moves on to the story (history) of the poison, how the poison works in the body to kill, whether there is an antidote, some real-life cases, and then how Christie used the poison. I had been afraid the chemistry associated with where the poison comes from and how it works within the body would have been either too technical or too boring for me to enjoy. Wow, was I ever wrong. I discovered all kinds of wonderful facts. This book is wonderfully readable by those of us who aren't trained in the science of chemicals. Plus Kathryn Harkup has a very wry sense of humor which caused me to get some strange looks when I was sitting in a doctor's waiting room laughing out loud while reading a book about poisons. Let's just say the chairs on each side of me became vacant when someone asked what book I was reading. This is the type of book Agatha Christie fans will keep right on the shelf with all their copies of the novels for reference during future re-readings of the novels. Because let's face it, if you love Agatha Christie novels you don't read them just once.Another fascinating section of the book is Appendix 1: Christie's Causes of Death. This is a chart listing each novel and short story written by Agatha Christie and the method of the murder in that story. Sometimes, with multiple victims there are multiple murder methods. I found this absolutely fascinating and used the list to make sure I do own each story Christie wrote. Actually I own them multiple times over, but there is no need to go into my personal addiction here.In discussing how Christie used the poisons the author has revealed some spoilers, but she always warns the reader to skip ahead to another section if they aren't familiar with the story and don't want to know who and how. I really appreciated how Harkup complimented Christie on her thoroughness and knowledge when it was warranted, but she didn't hesitate on several occasions to point out that Christie had gotten some things wrong. Interesting for me was how seldom Christie made mistakes in her information.This book is most definitely aimed at the devoted Agatha Christie fan. I found it fascinating and if you didn't, well........I challenge you to a duel with the infamous Calabar bean!"
29,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3162627-cleopatra-pullen,5,"This book was an absolute delight to read combining my love of Agatha Christie’s novels with a wealth of information about the poisons she chose to dispose of her victims. For any of my potential dinner guests who may be wary, do not fear, the author warns us off using the poisons she carefully and concisely explains at various points throughout the book!Any present-day poisoner wishing to use some of the methods suggested by Christie will be disappointed to discover that even these underhand methods are unlikely to be successful, as increased checks and balances have since been put in place.A is for Arsenic features the fourteen poisons deployed by the Queen of Crime in her various books, some of course were used more than once! She starts the book off by talking about Agatha Christie’s time as a working in the dispensary in her local Torquay hospital during World War I and her training to become as an apothecary’s assistant. It was here that she her interest in poison began and coupled with some inspiration of real-life cases many of her books featured some hapless person falling victim to one or other of her chosen poisons.Each chapter starts off with a piece about the book, or books that the particular poison starred in followed by a bit about the discovery, chemical make-up and tests for presence of the poison featured. We then move on to how the poison kills, without I’m pleased to confirm overly descriptive passages concerning the symptoms which can be quite grim in reality. It is here that Kathryn Harkup indicates how Agatha Christie spared her readers too. For those who are on the receiving end of the poison, next up is any antidote or at the very least what your doctor should do to help support life while the body gets rid of the poison. We are then treated to some real life cases including Glasgow socialite Madeline Smith who was suspected poisoning of poor old Pierre Emile L’Anglier who came from Jersey because she was worried about him showing her love letters to her parents but instead stood accused of putting some grains of arsenic in his cocoa.Despite the sometimes complex chemistry which the author manages to explain without sounding condescending but does so clearly enough that I could follow most of it, the book is for the most part pure entertainment – here is another warning about why you should resist the lure of poison:But before you rush to take out hefty life-insurance policies on your closest and wealthiest relatives, or start growing foxgloves in your garden, remember that the drug is detectable even in minute quantities.with comments from the side lines when things get a bit heavy:The elderly spinster consistently displays a worryingly detailed knowledge of pharmaceuticals and poison.I have to admit I really enjoyed the final part of each chapter which returns to Agatha Christie’s novels including the victim, the suspects and the potential methods employed to deliver the poison to the right person, at the right time.Fortunately the murderer confesses, and even goes on to explain how the deed was done, the poison was added to Mrs Horton’s tea by one of her visitors. Arsenic trioxide is poorly soluble in cold water, but is much more soluble in hot water. By dissolving the arsenic in tea the killer was able to ensure that no suspicious gritty powder was left at the bottom of the cup.I started by making a list of the books featured that I felt I simply must read right away, and then realised I would need to read Agatha Christie back to back for weeks to get through them all!! Well there are worse things I could be reading!"
30,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6297140-lili,5,"From Netgalley for a Review:I absolutely loved this book, but I had a strong suspicion that I would because I have an (almost) life-long fascination with toxicology. All of it fascinates me, from the way it affects the body, to the history, to the chemistry, to the way it is used in medicine, all of it! Though I do admit to my 'area of study' to mostly be focused on plant based poisons because it was gardening and foraging that led me to learning about poisons in the first place. Even though I have never read anything by Agatha Christie (for shame, I know, I just have never been a mystery kinda gal) I still found this book immensely enjoyable, even inspired to read some of her work, so points in its favor. See, this is not just a book about the stories the Queen of Crime wrote and how her experience with pharmaceuticals helped shape her use of poisons, no, this is a true exploration into the poisons used. It starts with a brief introduction to the story(ies) featuring the poison in question, then the book goes on to explain the science behind what the poison is (plant based alkaloid, metal, and such) and how it affects the body, can it be traced, the history of the poison (and how poison detection and treatment has evolved) and things of that nature. It is surprisingly thorough with some dense science at times that might not be the most enjoyable to everyone. Luckily the science is explained in a way that even a lay person can grasp, so it is not all just techno babble. So, if you like Agatha Christie's work and want to know more about her usage of poisons or just want to learn more about toxicology in general, I recommend this book highly! "
31,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29512613-charissa-wilkinson,4,"I received this book as part of the Goodreads First Reads Program for the purpose of a fair review.Overview: Fans of Agatha Christi can rejoice. The Queen of Mystery seems to have had a favorite way to dispose of her victims, and that was poison. So how close was Ms. Christi to the actual effects of poison? Well, considering that she was a pharmacist, or at least that’s how her job during that time was described, she seems to have had a good way to research the situations.Likes: This book definitely portrays the purpose of the writer’s rule ‘write what you know.’ Ms. Christi had a way of writing, and--by her own admission--she preferred to knock off her victims in ways that she was familiar with. It’s why she didn’t have many shooting victims. This book had a nice setup with the poisons, the way they killed, real life cases--if at all possible--, and how Ms. Christi used the poison. For the most part, Ms. Harkup didn’t spoil the stories that she used for examples of Ms. Christi’s work. Every now and then, she was unable to refer to the poisonings without saying who did it.Dislikes: Some of the actual poison killers were some cold people. They needed to have suffered the same way that they asked their victims.Conclusion: I never answered my question of how close Ms. Christi was at using her poisons. Maybe Nurse Marsha Maitland can let you know."
32,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/602581-bronwyn,5,"(Sort of) for my birthday, so thought I'd read it finally. :) <3This was a really interesting book. It's perfect if you like Agatha Christie and/or are interested in true crime/murder. I've been reading Agatha Christie or watching adaptations for about as long as I can remember, so plus one from me. I've been interested in forensics and poison and murder and detective stories since elementary or middle school when I took a forensics summer class and we learned about how different things worked and got to write a short story using this information, so plus two for that.I admit I didn't always understand all of the science Harkup discussed, how the different poisons operated on the body, etc. But the effects were really interesting to learn about, and the real life cases involving each poison were really fascinating too. Harkup also gives a bit of each story, many of which I am familiar, but you really don't have to be.This was a really interesting book and a pretty quick read!"
33,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52698390-t-a-henry,4,"Harkup takes 14 poisons A.C. uses and breaks it all down. How the poison actually works, who discovered it and by what process, known antidotes and when they became available, what A.C. would have known at the time she was writing, real cases of murder by the poison that may have influenced A.C. and cases clearly influenced by A.C.Scientific geek combined with total love for Agatha Christie. sigh. I was in heaven.I will share one bit. There are a number of verified cases where a person reading A Pale Horse, recognized the symptoms of thallium poisoning from the book, and was able to apply them to someone in their life, get the person to hospital, and tell the doctors it’s thallium poisoning….and it was…and the friend or family member lived because of it. Now that’s making a difference with your writing. Damn.This book is hard to rate. I loved it and would give it a solid Five Pages. But if you are not a science geek and a huge A.C. fan, this book will not charm you. So be forewarned."
34,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2640825-autumn,4,"This book made my nerdy heart happy. Harkup is a scientist and does an excellent job of explaining the minute workings of the different poisons. For each poison, she gives a history, shares real life poisoning cases, and then explains how Christie used the poison in her stories. She is very carefulow to not give away any plot spoilers and if she does, she gives you ample warning. I also loved how she wove in little pop-science facts like how Cyanide is used in making Cyanotypes. Or how ""going cold turkey"" comes from the goosebumps herione perpetually have when in withdrawl. If you like murder mysteries, then you will absolutely love this one."
35,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7769243-karrie-stewart,5,"I read this book for my libraries Non-Fiction book club ""Stranger Then Fiction"".WOW. Now that was a book overflowing with information! If you've ever been curious about the poisons of the world, this book is for you. Ms Harkup did an excellent job explaining each one and not getting to complicated with the chemistry aspect. She also warned you if she was going to spoil the ending of one of Agatha's books. Awesome job and can't wait to read more from her."
36,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,4,"This book is a sheer joy. I had no idea the grande dame of mystery writing was also a knowledgble chemist. It turns out Miss Christie volunteered to serve as a nurse at a local hospital in World War I and found she enjoyed it. She was then offered a position as an apothecary's assistant, for which she had to study to pass qualifying examinations in 1917. In those days prescriptions were mixed by hand, and mistakes were occasionally made. Miss Christie seemed to take to the work and used an interesting variety of pharmaceuticals and other poisons to kill off hundred of characters in her brilliant novels, which are both easy to read and intelligent. (Interestingly, author Kathryn Harkup notes that when Christie entered the field, metric was used throughout Europe but Britain was still in the process of converting from its standard Imperial system of measurement. ""Christie didn't trust the metric system because, as she said, ""The great danger ... is that if you go wrong, you go ten times wrong."")Harkup tells us that Miss Christie's first book, ""The Mysterious Affair at Styles,"" published in 1920, prompted ""her most cherished complement when it was reviewed in the Pharmaceutical Journal an Pharmacist. 'This novel has the rare merit of being correctly written,' the reviewer stated. He believed the author must have had pharmaceutical training, or had called in an expert. A is for Arsenic takes us from arsenic to veronal and amusingly and intriguingly explains the effects of many of the poisons used by Agatha Christie to bump off more than 300 charactors. Although Christie herself was too gentile to graphically describe the more gory details of the effects of her various toxins, author Harkup fills us in thoroughly. I suppose in polite society one does not vomit, involuntarily soil ones pants, or engage in violent convulsions; the more gentile among us have the courtesy to quietly die in our sleep to be discovered by our upstairs maid the next morning. Although in one of Dame Agatha's novels, a victim, before she died, was observed at a seance emitting glowing wisps of vapor from her mouth. At the time, this was regarded as simply a ghostly presence, which apparently is the whole point of having a seance; Hercule Poirot, though, was smart enough to surmise that the victim, a wealthy old spinster, has died from phosphate poisoning. For each poison Harkup examines, she informs the reader of how it kills, antidotes and treatments, the circumstances of death in Christie's victims (there are a few spoilers, but she warns us to skip ahead if we don't want to know) and real-life cases of poisoning, which sometimes resulted in hanging but probably often went unsolved, with the evidence buried or cremated with the body.Fun and very informative book for anyone who likes Christie and/or chemistry. a"
37,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3402896-becky-loader,4,"My friend Gail gave me this book. Let's just say that she is safe from anything I learned therein.I am a fan of the Flavia deLuce books because I love her spunky, chemistry-loving, bike-riding personality. She knows a lot about poisons. Enough to rival Agatha Christie.Agatha Christie knew a lot about poisons. She worked in chemists' shops (for you Americans, that would be pharmacies) as a dispenser, and she absorbed information like a sponge. Later, Dame Agatha used many poisons in her stories, and she used them accurately.Want to learn about poisons? This is the book for you!BTW: all those Iris I grow? Hmmmmm. Orris root is a deadly poison. The razzle-frazzin' 45 pound bunnies in my garden know better than to chew on the Iris."
38,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66406058-annabel-frazer,3,"As a total layperson, I'm fascinated by poisons and perhaps we all are. I greatly enjoyed this exploration of Agatha Christie's use of fourteen different poisons. Given my lack of scientific knowledge, I could perhaps have done with more about the plots and the plausibility of the various murder methods and less on the chemical processes behind each poison, but this book is very clearly described as a book about chemistry not one of literary criticism, so that's fair enough.A word of warning - the one thing that made me slightly uncomfortable was the many casual references to the use of animal testing to understand how various poisons work. I suppose to the author, this stuff is natural and unremarkable, but to me, it came as an unpleasant reminder of the dark side of science."
39,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2939010-pscribe,3,"This book was way more scientific than I thought it would be, so it took me longer to get through it then I originally thought it would. However, it was still enjoyable even if it was in a genre that I normally don't read. I appreciate the research that the author put into this book, taking care to explain exactly how the various poisons work in our bodies and what they do to cause death. I also appreciated how there were so few spoilers and on the rare occasion one had to be given to explain how the poison worked, the author warned us to skip ahead. So you can still read the novels knowing the weapon but not the motive or who. One thing that was really interesting to me is how easy it was to get these poisons in earlier years, and how much they were apart of our life. The titular poison use to be in wallpapers for example before it was learned how dangerous it was. And it was a bit scary to see how fine the line was between something being helpful and harmful. Overall a good read especially if you're one who enjoys science. For me, it took a bit to get into it since I am normally not a non-fiction reader and when I do I don't tend to gravitate towards Applied Sciences. But still a good read although I wouldn't classify it as a 'weekend' one. "
40,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30575518-sandra,3,"This was a difficult book to rate. For some reason it is not quite what I was expecting.On the one hand it is very informative and well researched, but it is a bit difficult follow at times without a background in medicine and lets not forget some of these real life cases reminds one of the just how many cruel people there are out there. Which is far from cheerful obviously.So an informative read, but by no means a light read in any regard. It is not a book I recommend reading before you go to sleep. It is chilling. However, and I must say this the cover design fits perfectly with the art deco vibe that Agatha Christie will always be associated with."
41,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22091598-kelly,2,"The title of this book is so great, and it sounds so fun. The book itself...not so fun. I found the scientific descriptions of the poisons and how they work to be boring overall, even though I expected it to be more interesting. I think that being able to write about science in an entertaining way is a real skill, and it just didn't really happen successfully here. I did like the premise of the book and how she looked at real-life cases and whether Agatha was accurate about how poisons work. "
42,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50868550-sarah-thearomaofbooks,4," I was immediately attracted the combination of a nonfiction book on a rather random topic, and learning more about the science behind Agatha Christie's murders.  This book did not disappoint. It was informative and engaging, full of fascinating information without becoming too lecture-y.The format of each chapter made each poison accessible.  Each starts with an incident of Christie using the poison in a story, followed by the history of the poison, a scientific explanation of how the poison actually kills someone, the antidote (if any!), famous real-life cases of the poison being used, and then tying back in to Christie's use of the poison in her stories.  Throughout, I was consistently impressed with the overall accuracy of Christie's use of poisons and descriptions of their symptoms.Although reading this book made my husband nervous, Harkup is quite clear that (in most cases), science has advanced enough to make it difficult to get away with poisoning, although I was genuinely quite astonished at the fact that ricin, found in castor bean plants, is so very poisonous.  I've always heard the old saying that if you don't like someone you can make them some castor-bean tea, but after reading this book it does seem that these plants should come with a more thorough warning, especially for families with small children who like to play in the garden!Overall, this book was a surprisingly engaging read.  My only real complaint is that while Harkup did provide a interesting introduction, the book ended rather abruptly - a few closing comments would have been nice to sort of tie everything back together.  Still, with so much information presented in such an interesting manner, I really can't complain too much.  Definitely recommended for people interested in bumping someone off or just learning more about the science behind Christie's works."
43,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102517-emily,4,"I've read a few Agatha Christie novels, mostly Poirot and his adorable grey cells, but I'd recommend this even if you haven't read any. The joy is accessible science, bizarre history (seriously, Victorians, as always: what the heck?), and human ingenuity at its worst and best. "

45,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8385692-dindy,2,"I was really hoping to like this book because I am a huge Agatha Christie fan and consider her to be one of the greatest mystery writers ever, and absolutely the best at plotting her ""crimes."" When I saw this book about the poisons used by Christie in her books, I grabbed it because I am interested in medicine as well, so I thought this would be a good combo of two of my interests. It seemed fitting that this book is being released in time for the 125th anniversary of Agatha Christie's birth.Unfortunately, I found the book to be tedious and boring, weighed down by more information than I needed or wanted about the chemistry of the various poisons and their reactions within the body.I did like the summations of the relevant Christie books, but it has been a long time since I have read any of them. I didn't remember enough of the details on my own to put most of the references into context, and since the identify of the poisoner and the method of administration is key to understanding the books, the fact that Harkup left this information out, no doubt for fear of being accused of releasing spoilers, detracted from my enjoyment of the book. Given that most people who read this book are probably going to be diehard Christie fans who have read most, if not all, of her books, I think spoilers would have been acceptable and would have made the book seem more complete.I also enjoyed the stories about real life uses of the various poisons in actual murder or attempted murder cases. However, as I reached the halfway point, I realized I just wasn't enjoying the book that much and was skipping over huge swaths of chemical information. I decided that rather than reading a book about the poisons used by Agatha Christie, I'd be better off grabbing some Christie books off the shelf and enjoying reading about the poisons first hand.Disclaimer: A free copy of this book was received from Amazon Vine in exchange for an honest review."
46,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16103061-kathleen,3,"This one was fun. I admit the chemical parts lost me a little, but Harkup is an entertaining writer and I really enjoyed this.A is for Arsenic takes readers on a scientific journey through the poisons of Agatha Christie's novels, from arsenic at the beginning to veronal at the end. Harkup starts by laying out a case of poisoning in one of the novels: arsenic, for example, killed a victim in Murder is Easy, and the murder is laid out in detail, though not the murderer. The chapter then moves into a history of the poison, followed by a scientific and chemical explanation of how the poison kills. If there's an antidote, it is detailed next, followed by some real life poisoning cases that Christie may have drawn from. Finally, Harkup talks about the poisoning in Christie's novel in more detail. Bonus for Harkup here: her descriptions are almost entirely spoiler free, and when spoilers must be provided, she marks them clearly and warns unwary readers to look away.This was a fun read. Recommended for Christie fans, people who like poison, or both."
47,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16473096-sunsettowers,4,"This is a really unique non-fiction read, with Harkup examining Agatha Christie's novels through the poisons she chose for her murderers to use.Each chapter is centered around a different poison and a different Christie mystery. In each chapter, Harkup gives the scientific background of the poison, as well as examples of real-life cases where the poison was used. The end of every chapter is an analysis of the ways the poison was used in Christie's books.If you are a fan of Agatha Christie, I strongly recommend this read. Even if you think you might be put off by the science aspects, give it a go. I am in no way a science expert, and haven't taken a science class since high school, but I still found this book fascinating."

The author also demonstates Agatha's obvious technical knowledge of these substances and discusses true crimes that may or may not have inspired Christie's writing. A must read for any Christie fan and anyone interested in the chemistry/toxicology aspect of true crimes."
49,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5215903-amanda,4,"Both entertaining and educational. A look at some of the things used to poison people in Christie's novels which is both scientific and amusing. Chemical composition and the actions of the compounds on the body are combined with stories of real-life cases of accidental or deliberate poisoning, including a few where the toxin was identified due to some's familiarity with Christie's fictional use of it!Includes a fascinating appendix of all the ways people die in Christie's work (she shot way more people with arrows than I realized)."
50,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,3,"Fascinating but not important. This is an enjoyable read. Even the detailed descriptions of chemistry and biological reactions to the poisons are well balanced with anecdotes about the their use in both real life and in Christie's books. But books about poisons have been done before. Other than a myriad of small facts about these 14 poisons and their use, I felt I didn't learn anything. Nothing about the use of poisons generally or about the fascination humans have for them. I just felt vaguely disappointed when I finished the book."
51,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43543774-sandra,4,I think it had a good balance of history and nods back to Christie and explaining the chemistry behind how the poisons interact with the body.More for people who can read true crime without qualms. Probably awesome for someone writing murder mysteries. For me reading the science of how we die freaked me out a little (so many ways in such detail) so it was a slow book of reading a chapter or so and putting it down for awhile.
52,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75783481-sian-whitby,3,I received this book as a Christmas present and it was a good read. I enjoyed learning more about different types of poison. I haven't read any Agatha Christie books so the references to them did really mean anything to me. Only downside is that the chemistry is very detailed and I felt aimed more towards people that already understand the scientific side. 
53,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47185965-zita,2,"I read this book as an avid Agatha Christie fan. It is a scientific text though so I found large parts of it too intense for me. Parts of it were extremely interesting and it confirmed to me how intelligent an author Agatha was. However, I skipped large portions as I was bored. "

57,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5528346-kate-n-ewing,3,"This was an interesting book, but I’m still kind of scratching my head over its purpose. Harkup obviously has a lifetime obsession with Agatha Christie’s novels, and is also a chemist interested in the history and use of poisons. However, I was thinking it would be more about why Christie used various poisons, and not so much the history and chemical properties of the poisons thrmselves. It seems like Harkup’s concern over revealing murderers and thus ruining the reader’s delight prevents her from really going into how Christie’s murderers obtained and used the poisons. This attempt to avoid “spoilers” as much as possible seems unnecessary to me because surely anyone who would actually pick up a book devoted to Christie’s use of poisons and read it cover to cover would be enamoured enough by Christie’s mysteries to have read most of them already. On the other hand, the book can’t really serve as a go-to reference for authors of murder mysteries, because everything is discussed in context of the times in which the poisons were used, and the history of their uses. If I wanted to write a murder mystery using poison, I’d want to use a much more thorough, up-to-date and vetted reference for my information. So, it seems like the purpose of the book is simply to indulge Harker’s interest in and knowledge of these poisons, and to give access to her meanderings to whoever else might want to come along on the journey. Consequently, I think the book is uneven, and doesn’t have a real ending conclusion. It goes into far too much detail about the chemistry of these poisons for a non-chemist like myself to fully comprehend and enjoy, yet left me wanting more about Christie and her books. I would have preferred a book that was more focused on Christie - is there research available about what she said about the poisons she used or why certain poisons fit certain plots/ murderers better? That being said, and having skimmed over the molecular bonding parts, I did still enjoy this book, probably due to my insidious interest in murder real and fictional, the inclusion of various real murders using some of these poisons and Harkup’s dry humor which caused more than one delighted giggle here and there."
58,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,3,"Kathryn Harkup has written a lovely book that explores the poisons used by Agatha Christie in her novels. The introductory chapter provides some interesting biographical material of Christie and why she knew so much about poisons. Harkup then dedicates the next 14 chapters to a specific poison, such as arsenic, belladonna, cyanide, digitalis, eserine, hemlock, monkshood, nicotine, opium, phosphorus ricin, strychnine, thallium and veronal (a type of barbiturate). Each chapter describes how Christie used the poison in her novels, how the poison works, if there is an antidote, and examples of the poison used in real life. I am not an Agatha Christie fan so found the sections describing Christie's novels and their plot summaries didn't particularly appeal to me, and also became tedious after a while. Reading several plot summaries does not make for thrilling reading. Harukp managed to avoid spoilers for the most part, or at least warned of spoilers before discussing pertinent Christie novels. This will no doubt be appreciated for Christie fans who haven't read all of her novels. The sections that describe how each poison effects the body were more interesting to me. Harkup provided enough science to understand why substances were toxic without bogging the lay reader down with irrelevant detail. Many poisons have similar effects on the body (i.e. they impair nerve functioning), so some sections were a bit repetitive by necessity. Appendix 2 provides structures of a few of the chemicals described in the book, which was a nice addition.The real life poisoning attempts were also interesting, especially the manner in which the poisoners were eventually caught.This book would appeal to fans of Agatha Christie and for those who would like to know how a variety of poisons work. There is no overall narrative, and each chapter can be read separately and out of order. None the less, this is an interesting, informative and enjoyable book."
59,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32055084-marcella-wigg,4,"Agatha Christie's favorite method of murder in her many novels is poison; she always disliked the violence of weapons like guns, and conveniently, she had prior experience with poisons as a pharmacist's assistant in both world wars. Her oeuvre is a veritable guide to most of the common poisons in early to mid-twentieth century Britain; some of her books have such accurate depictions of poisonings that they have been used as educational material in toxicology courses. In A is for Arsenic, Harkup takes a look at each of the significant poisons Christie uses in her books, including true cases that may have inspired or been inspired by Christie's novel containing the poison; a description of how it is used in the novel(s) in which it is most relevant; a scientific explanation of the poison's method of action; potential antidotes; and other interesting details. Harkup knows her Christie, that's for sure, but she is generally very good at avoiding spoilers for any of the cases she discusses, unless spoilers are necessary for the explanation (all of these are well-marked). I loved the analysis of cases that may have inspired Christie, in particular, as that was fascinating, and also the ways in which potential treatments and non-poison uses for the poisons have changed over time. The organization of the book (chapters discussing each poison) also lends itself to gradual reading over time.My only objections were that some of the scientific explanations were a little dry, and the chapters seemed to become shorter as the book progressed, when the thoroughness in the earlier chapters would have been enjoyable throughout. Still, I really enjoyed this, think it offers a truly refreshing perspective on true crime and toxicology, and am excited to read more Christie after this! Christie's works may not be considered the pinnacle of literary achievement, but as Harkup demonstrates, they are remarkable for the general accuracy with which they portray poison."

Agatha Christie used poison to kill her characters more often than any other crime fiction writer. The poison was a central part of the novel, and her choice of deadly substances was far from random; the chemical and physiological characteristics of each poison provide vital clues to the discovery of the murderer. Christie demonstrated her extensive chemical knowledge (much of it gleaned by working in a pharmacy during both world wars) in many of her novels, but this is rarely appreciated by the reader.People are fascinated by murder.

It should appeal to those who are interested in the biochemistry of poisons; Agatha Christie fans and anyone interested in reading about crime etc. The book discusses the poisons that are mentioned in the novels of Christie, who had an good knowledge of their uses and properties. She developed this from her time as a dispensary assistant (when being a pharmacist seemed to involve real chemistry!).The author discusses relevant cases from the pages of Christie novels as well as real life cases. I was a little surprised that poisoning is actually a very rare means of murder. This is probably due to difficulty in getting hold of the poisons themselves, uncertainties over doses and other practical difficulties. Historic and modern cases are discussed.

63,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8400193-karry,4,"This was not only an interesting book about Agatha Christie and her many mysteries, it was also a fascinating read about poisons and the scientific facts of them. It turns out the the Old Lady of Mysteries was quite intelligent when it came to her poisons. She had several jobs that required her to learn the details about different poisons and she learned these details used them on the job and then wrote about them in many of her novels. The book breaks the information down by first telling the reader which books the specific poisons were used in and then gives a detailed, but not dry, description of the scientific make-up and how they react in the body of a human. There's a section on antidotes and a section on how Christie used the particular poison in several of her books, mostly focusing on the one the author chose for that specific poison. I enjoyed it a lot, perhaps part of it was because my husband is a chemist and he was right there to answer any questions I might have, also I may have picked up some of the chemistry lingo just by living with him for almost 30 years :) Read the book, you'll like it."
64,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36570203-astra-crompton,5,"A is for Arsenic combines science, medicine, anecdote, and history to run through a list of poisons. Each poison is explored through its relation to Agatha Christie's writing, with appreciation and context. For those who love Christie's work, this book will certainly deepen one's appreciation for her mastery of the mystery crime genre. For those less experienced with her work, it will certainly heighten curiosity to see how she pulled all of these clues together in her narratives. Kathryn Harkup clearly has done her due diligence in researching both the source material and the properties of each poison, but presents each with ease, humour and logic. Even readers with limited chemical or medical understanding will be able to follow how the poison kills. I learned so many fascinating anecdotes that it quickly became a conversation starter at the office, and inspired further research. For example, I'm amazed I'd never heard of Count Bocarmé before; there should definitely be a film adaptation!I highly recommend this book, especially for fellow writers."
65,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6811689-shannon,3,"Rating: 2.5 rounded up for gorgeous art deco cover! I just want to thank the author, Kathryn Harkup, for giving me a crash course in chemistry and incidentally reminding me why I could NEVER be a doctor or pharmacist! The chapters on various poisons used in Agatha Christie's books & stories were quite detailed as they provided chemical analysis, case histories and how they were used as murder weapons. Some of the case histories were too horrific for me to handle...I enjoy murder as escape reading, NOT as reality. But if true crime is your thing, then they were related in a straightforward, clinical manner.What I took away from this book is that poison is really, really nasty stuff and almost all of them result in a vicious death, unless immediate steps are taken to reverse or mitigate the inevitable progression. People who would heartlessly subject anyone to the kind of appalling death that comes from almost any kind of poisoning, are truly monsters.Agatha Christie is to be recommended for her encyclopedic knowledge of poisons...her dispensary experience was put to excellent use!"
66,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3943605-rebecca,4,"I received an ARC of this from the publisher through Goodread's giveaways.This book was really fun to read, even for someone like me who has never actually read any books by Christie. The author was really good with explaining the chemistry and biology behind the poisons, with a lot of the history, medicine, and real life cases involving each one, alongside her use of them in the books. I found the scientific information easy to follow and understand, although I do have a medical background which does give me an advantage. I also appreciated the author's efforts to not spoil who any of the murderers were, aside from one case which was clearly marked, and so could be avoided if possible. Obviously she did go into detail about the actual mechanics of the murder in relation to the poisoning, but that section of each chapter could be easily avoided if the reader didn't want that information either."
67,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1013594-robyn,4,"Birthday gift from Rebecca! | Fascinating, and actually a good reference for aspiring mystery writers in itself, possibly too scientific for some readers. | I found every bit of this interesting, but readers who only care about the fictional use of these poisons and any tales of true-crime murders will have a lot of scientific and medical information to skim past. There's a lot of good information on how each substance works in the body, how it's detected, what its historical uses have been, etc. It's particularly interesting to take an overview and note how some of the poisons are antidotes to each other. Worth the read even if you're not a Christie fan, as I am, and Harkup either leaves solutions to the books out or gives fair warning to avoid spoilers. For us lovers of Christie's works, it's even better."
68,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45366873-miku,4,"This was a very educational book. I didn't think the science was too hard to grasp, but it does help to take an introductory chemistry course before reading. I don't think all science should be ""accessible"" since if you want to get advanced enough, you have to have previous knowledge. I have never read any of Agatha Christie's books, but still enjoyed A is for Arsenic. I loved how she showed the juxtoposition between the poisonous side of the compound/element with the therapeutic side. Though one thing I was annoyed by was how she assured everyone on that most current medicines with these poisons were safe now, but she has the right to her opinion and I know that most chemists are biased toward defending use of chemicals since that's how they get paid. Anyway this was a very interesting book, and I'll probably flip through it again and do further research on these poisons. "
69,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/719416-julia-garcia,5,"Okay. It only took me almost two years to finish reading this book, but that doesn't mean it was a bad book. It just means I was taking a plethora of notes. Because... Writing research! Yay!  Not only does this book have a stunning cover, but the content is very informative too. It does get a bit sciencey in parts, going over the chemical make-up of the poisons and how it affects the human body, but the author does a good job in breaking it down into fairly easy-to-understand terms. I'm not a science person and I was able to understand it.  Now that this book is finished, I'm going to try and see if there are books on the subject that are written this way. 10/10 for an engaging book on a fascinating subject. "
70,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14118218-merit,3,"A short and punchy analysis of 14-odd poisons that Agatha Christie used in her writing over her extensive career. It details how Christie, with her background in pharmacy in both WWI and WWII, utilised the poisons, how the poisons were first discovered and how the poisons were largely used for mundane purposes before their more dire impacts were reckoned by society. As Harkup is a chemist by background, it goes rather into detail about the make-up of the poisons which was not my favourite element. I really appreciated the societal impact of poisons and widely accepted a whole range of were as sleeping aids, household poisons and even more. Largely spoiler free on the killers, however it does reveal who was poisoned and how, so if you're spoiler adverse may be something to avoid."

This plant is mentioned in the Bible and in several Shakespeare plays, and was even grown in the greenhouses at Harry Potter’s school, Hogwarts. (page 51, B is for Belladonna) and that’s how the book got 5 stars. I like the author’s way with words. Since I’m already interested in the topic, it doesn’t take much to get my attention. The book is very informative and engaging. The chemistry part is easy to follow. And I like how Harkup injects humor to a deadly serious topic."

Each chapter covers a specific poison and the mystery book/short story it is used in. Then, Harkup goes into the history and science of the poison, how long it has been around, historical uses, if any, the chemical makeup of the poison, what it does chemically in the body, any tests/antidotes/cures for the poison, and how realistic the book deals with the poison. Very good, but the science makes it a little slow going."
73,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3127538-liz,3,"Very interesting book. Agatha Christie was qualified to dispense drugs in England and worked in the field for many years. And used that knowledge in her many mysteries where poison was a favorite method. The book is arranged by an alphabetical listing of poisons, and that author gives basic scientific knowledge, history, symptoms in real life and then looks at the Christie stories. Like how she evaluated Christie’s accuracy and also got into the stories without giving away the details."

The author clearly knows her stuff and the text was very detailed, but not so much as to be bogged down. I loved that each chapter included details on the poison's history, medicinal/cultural uses, chemical composition and biological effects on the body, real life cases, as well as how and where it occurred in Christie's novels. "
75,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88944753-andy,4,"Written by a chemist, this book shows not only the poisons but also how Agatha Christie learned about them and used them in her books. She also writes about the antidotes which is something Agatha never mentions. The reason it only gets four stars is that its a bit chemistry heavy, but a very good read all the same. I did like the little excerpts of the Christie books to show that Agatha knew what she was talking about."
76,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4167615-miklos,3,"An intriguing concept for a book, aimed at Agatha Christie fans who may also be interested in the poisons so often included. I was hoping to give it 4 stars but left it at 3.5 because it becomes more of a reference guide than anything else and aside from the poisons featured and regular mentions of which Christie books they're in, it begins to lose its appeal over time. One more recommendation for Christie fans."

The book breaks the information down by first telling the reader which books the specific poisons were used in and then gives a detailed, but not dry, description of the scientific make-up and how they react in the body of a human. There's a section on antidotes and a section on how Christie used the particular poison in several of her books, mostly focusing on the one the author chose for that specific poison. I enjoyed it a lot, perhaps part of it was because my husband is a chemist and he was right there to answer any questions I might have, also I may have picked up some of the chemistry lingo just by living with him for almost 30 years :) Read the book, you'll like it."

Some of the case histories were too horrific for me to handle...I enjoy murder as escape reading, NOT as reality. But if true crime is your thing, then they were related in a straightforward, clinical manner.What I took away from this book is that poison is really, really nasty stuff and almost all of them result in a vicious death, unless immediate steps are taken to reverse or mitigate the inevitable progression. People who would heartlessly subject anyone to the kind of appalling death that comes from almost any kind of poisoning, are truly monsters.Agatha Christie is to be recommended for her encyclopedic knowledge of poisons...her dispensary experience was put to excellent use!"

For an absolute fan of Dame Agatha Christie, to read this book in the nick of time, I was dancing with joy while listening to this brilliantly written, well-searched book. Agatha Christie used poison to kill her characters more often than any other crime fiction writer. The poison was a central part of the novel, and her choice of deadly substances was far from random; the chemical and physiological characteristics of each poison provide vital clues to the discovery of the murderer. Christie demonstrated her extensive chemical knowledge (much of it gleaned by working in a pharmacy during both world wars) in many of her novels, but this is rarely appreciated by the reader.People are fascinated by murder. The popularity of murder mystery books, TV series, and even board games show that there is an appetite for death, and the more unusual or macabre the method, the better. With gunshots or stabbings, the cause of death is obvious, but poisons are inherently more mysterious. How are some compounds so deadly in such tiny amounts?All of the above and more are discussed thoroughly by the great Kathryn Harkup. A is for Arsenic to look at why certain chemicals kill, how they interact with the body, and the feasibility of obtaining, administering, and detecting these poisons, both when Christie was writing and today.I seriously cannot recommend it enough.

It should appeal to those who are interested in the biochemistry of poisons; Agatha Christie fans and anyone interested in reading about crime etc. The book discusses the poisons that are mentioned in the novels of Christie, who had an good knowledge of their uses and properties. She developed this from her time as a dispensary assistant (when being a pharmacist seemed to involve real chemistry!).The author discusses relevant cases from the pages of Christie novels as well as real life cases. I was a little surprised that poisoning is actually a very rare means of murder. This is probably due to difficulty in getting hold of the poisons themselves, uncertainties over doses and other practical difficulties. Historic and modern cases are discussed. For example, the murders of Harold Shipman are discussed.I would describe the presentation as efficient: each poison is discussed in turn. This makes for a clear but somewhat predictable format. One knows what to expect . However, this is a minor quibble. Overall a very interesting book that I can recommend. There is a good bibliography and recommended reading section.

I have to admit to getting a bit lost in some of the more technical/scientific sections but really enjoyed the analysis in each chapter of whether Agatha Christie got it right.Each chapter is headed with the name of a poison (Arsenic, Thallium, Veronal etc) attached to the plot of a particular novel. We get the historiography of the poison, how it works on the human body, real-life examples of its use, whether there is an antidote, and then an in depth treatment of the way it is used in the novel. Quite often the sleuth is Hercule Poirot.Of interest too will be Appendix 1: Christie's Causes of Death, a table listing all of the Agatha Christie novels and short stories in order of publication, and the cause of death in each of them. My Kindle Paper White didn't handle this graphic all that well, but my iPad reader does better.For the technically minded there is Appendix 2: structures of some of the chemicals in this book.By no means a quick read, but an interesting one from many points of view."

It turns out the the Old Lady of Mysteries was quite intelligent when it came to her poisons. She had several jobs that required her to learn the details about different poisons and she learned these details used them on the job and then wrote about them in many of her novels.

There's a section on antidotes and a section on how Christie used the particular poison in several of her books, mostly focusing on the one the author chose for that specific poison.

Each poison is explored through its relation to Agatha Christie's writing, with appreciation and context. For those who love Christie's work, this book will certainly deepen one's appreciation for her mastery of the mystery crime genre. For those less experienced with her work, it will certainly heighten curiosity to see how she pulled all of these clues together in her narratives. Kathryn Harkup clearly has done her due diligence in researching both the source material and the properties of each poison, but presents each with ease, humour and logic. Even readers with limited chemical or medical understanding will be able to follow how the poison kills. I learned so many fascinating anecdotes that it quickly became a conversation starter at the office, and inspired further research. For example, I'm amazed I'd never heard of Count Bocarmé before; there should definitely be a film adaptation!I highly recommend this book, especially for fellow writers."
155,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6811689-shannon,3,"Rating: 2.5 rounded up for gorgeous art deco cover! I just want to thank the author, Kathryn Harkup, for giving me a crash course in chemistry and incidentally reminding me why I could NEVER be a doctor or pharmacist! The chapters on various poisons used in Agatha Christie's books & stories were quite detailed as they provided chemical analysis, case histories and how they were used as murder weapons. Some of the case histories were too horrific for me to handle...I enjoy murder as escape reading, NOT as reality. But if true crime is your thing, then they were related in a straightforward, clinical manner.What I took away from this book is that poison is really, really nasty stuff and almost all of them result in a vicious death, unless immediate steps are taken to reverse or mitigate the inevitable progression. People who would heartlessly subject anyone to the kind of appalling death that comes from almost any kind of poisoning, are truly monsters.Agatha Christie is to be recommended for her encyclopedic knowledge of poisons...her dispensary experience was put to excellent use!"
156,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3943605-rebecca,4,"I received an ARC of this from the publisher through Goodread's giveaways.This book was really fun to read, even for someone like me who has never actually read any books by Christie. The author was really good with explaining the chemistry and biology behind the poisons, with a lot of the history, medicine, and real life cases involving each one, alongside her use of them in the books. I found the scientific information easy to follow and understand, although I do have a medical background which does give me an advantage. I also appreciated the author's efforts to not spoil who any of the murderers were, aside from one case which was clearly marked, and so could be avoided if possible. Obviously she did go into detail about the actual mechanics of the murder in relation to the poisoning, but that section of each chapter could be easily avoided if the reader didn't want that information either."
157,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1013594-robyn,4,"Birthday gift from Rebecca! | Fascinating, and actually a good reference for aspiring mystery writers in itself, possibly too scientific for some readers. | I found every bit of this interesting, but readers who only care about the fictional use of these poisons and any tales of true-crime murders will have a lot of scientific and medical information to skim past. There's a lot of good information on how each substance works in the body, how it's detected, what its historical uses have been, etc. It's particularly interesting to take an overview and note how some of the poisons are antidotes to each other. Worth the read even if you're not a Christie fan, as I am, and Harkup either leaves solutions to the books out or gives fair warning to avoid spoilers. For us lovers of Christie's works, it's even better."
158,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45366873-miku,4,"This was a very educational book. I didn't think the science was too hard to grasp, but it does help to take an introductory chemistry course before reading. I don't think all science should be ""accessible"" since if you want to get advanced enough, you have to have previous knowledge. I have never read any of Agatha Christie's books, but still enjoyed A is for Arsenic. I loved how she showed the juxtoposition between the poisonous side of the compound/element with the therapeutic side. Though one thing I was annoyed by was how she assured everyone on that most current medicines with these poisons were safe now, but she has the right to her opinion and I know that most chemists are biased toward defending use of chemicals since that's how they get paid. Anyway this was a very interesting book, and I'll probably flip through it again and do further research on these poisons. "
159,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/719416-julia-garcia,5,"Okay. It only took me almost two years to finish reading this book, but that doesn't mean it was a bad book. It just means I was taking a plethora of notes. Because... Writing research! Yay!  Not only does this book have a stunning cover, but the content is very informative too. It does get a bit sciencey in parts, going over the chemical make-up of the poisons and how it affects the human body, but the author does a good job in breaking it down into fairly easy-to-understand terms. I'm not a science person and I was able to understand it.  Now that this book is finished, I'm going to try and see if there are books on the subject that are written this way. 10/10 for an engaging book on a fascinating subject. "

It details how Christie, with her background in pharmacy in both WWI and WWII, utilised the poisons, how the poisons were first discovered and how the poisons were largely used for mundane purposes before their more dire impacts were reckoned by society. As Harkup is a chemist by background, it goes rather into detail about the make-up of the poisons which was not my favourite element. I really appreciated the societal impact of poisons and widely accepted a whole range of were as sleeping aids, household poisons and even more. Largely spoiler free on the killers, however it does reveal who was poisoned and how, so if you're spoiler adverse may be something to avoid."

This plant is mentioned in the Bible and in several Shakespeare plays, and was even grown in the greenhouses at Harry Potter’s school, Hogwarts. (page 51, B is for Belladonna) and that’s how the book got 5 stars. I like the author’s way with words. Since I’m already interested in the topic, it doesn’t take much to get my attention. The book is very informative and engaging. The chemistry part is easy to follow. And I like how Harkup injects humor to a deadly serious topic."
162,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57248457-becky-tatar,3,"This book is a medical forensics coverage of the poisons Agatha Christie used in her books to kill off people. Each chapter covers a specific poison and the mystery book/short story it is used in. Then, Harkup goes into the history and science of the poison, how long it has been around, historical uses, if any, the chemical makeup of the poison, what it does chemically in the body, any tests/antidotes/cures for the poison, and how realistic the book deals with the poison. Very good, but the science makes it a little slow going."
163,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3127538-liz,3,"Very interesting book. Agatha Christie was qualified to dispense drugs in England and worked in the field for many years. And used that knowledge in her many mysteries where poison was a favorite method. The book is arranged by an alphabetical listing of poisons, and that author gives basic scientific knowledge, history, symptoms in real life and then looks at the Christie stories. Like how she evaluated Christie’s accuracy and also got into the stories without giving away the details."

The author clearly knows her stuff and the text was very detailed, but not so much as to be bogged down. I loved that each chapter included details on the poison's history, medicinal/cultural uses, chemical composition and biological effects on the body, real life cases, as well as how and where it occurred in Christie's novels. "
165,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88944753-andy,4,"Written by a chemist, this book shows not only the poisons but also how Agatha Christie learned about them and used them in her books. She also writes about the antidotes which is something Agatha never mentions. The reason it only gets four stars is that its a bit chemistry heavy, but a very good read all the same. I did like the little excerpts of the Christie books to show that Agatha knew what she was talking about."
166,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4167615-miklos,3,"An intriguing concept for a book, aimed at Agatha Christie fans who may also be interested in the poisons so often included. I was hoping to give it 4 stars but left it at 3.5 because it becomes more of a reference guide than anything else and aside from the poisons featured and regular mentions of which Christie books they're in, it begins to lose its appeal over time. One more recommendation for Christie fans."

Some of the case histories were too horrific for me to handle...I enjoy murder as escape reading, NOT as reality. But if true crime is your thing, then they were related in a straightforward, clinical manner.What I took away from this book is that poison is really, really nasty stuff and almost all of them result in a vicious death, unless immediate steps are taken to reverse or mitigate the inevitable progression. People who would heartlessly subject anyone to the kind of appalling death that comes from almost any kind of poisoning, are truly monsters.Agatha Christie is to be recommended for her encyclopedic knowledge of poisons...her dispensary experience was put to excellent use!"

For an absolute fan of Dame Agatha Christie, to read this book in the nick of time, I was dancing with joy while listening to this brilliantly written, well-searched book. Agatha Christie used poison to kill her characters more often than any other crime fiction writer. The poison was a central part of the novel, and her choice of deadly substances was far from random; the chemical and physiological characteristics of each poison provide vital clues to the discovery of the murderer. Christie demonstrated her extensive chemical knowledge (much of it gleaned by working in a pharmacy during both world wars) in many of her novels, but this is rarely appreciated by the reader.People are fascinated by murder. The popularity of murder mystery books, TV series, and even board games show that there is an appetite for death, and the more unusual or macabre the method, the better. With gunshots or stabbings, the cause of death is obvious, but poisons are inherently more mysterious. How are some compounds so deadly in such tiny amounts?All of the above and more are discussed thoroughly by the great Kathryn Harkup. A is for Arsenic to look at why certain chemicals kill, how they interact with the body, and the feasibility of obtaining, administering, and detecting these poisons, both when Christie was writing and today.I seriously cannot recommend it enough. READ IT"

It should appeal to those who are interested in the biochemistry of poisons; Agatha Christie fans and anyone interested in reading about crime etc. The book discusses the poisons that are mentioned in the novels of Christie, who had an good knowledge of their uses and properties. She developed this from her time as a dispensary assistant (when being a pharmacist seemed to involve real chemistry!).The author discusses relevant cases from the pages of Christie novels as well as real life cases. I was a little surprised that poisoning is actually a very rare means of murder. This is probably due to difficulty in getting hold of the poisons themselves, uncertainties over doses and other practical difficulties. Historic and modern cases are discussed. For example, the murders of Harold Shipman are discussed.I would describe the presentation as efficient: each poison is discussed in turn. This makes for a clear but somewhat predictable format. One knows what to expect . However, this is a minor quibble. Overall a very interesting book that I can recommend. There is a good bibliography and recommended reading section. This is always welcome."

I have to admit to getting a bit lost in some of the more technical/scientific sections but really enjoyed the analysis in each chapter of whether Agatha Christie got it right.Each chapter is headed with the name of a poison (Arsenic, Thallium, Veronal etc) attached to the plot of a particular novel. We get the historiography of the poison, how it works on the human body, real-life examples of its use, whether there is an antidote, and then an in depth treatment of the way it is used in the novel. Quite often the sleuth is Hercule Poirot.Of interest too will be Appendix 1: Christie's Causes of Death, a table listing all of the Agatha Christie novels and short stories in order of publication, and the cause of death in each of them. My Kindle Paper White didn't handle this graphic all that well, but my iPad reader does better.For the technically minded there is Appendix 2: structures of some of the chemicals in this book.By no means a quick read, but an interesting one from many points of view."

She had several jobs that required her to learn the details about different poisons and she learned these details used them on the job and then wrote about them in many of her novels.

For those who love Christie's work, this book will certainly deepen one's appreciation for her mastery of the mystery crime genre. For those less experienced with her work, it will certainly heighten curiosity to see how she pulled all of these clues together in her narratives. Kathryn Harkup clearly has done her due diligence in researching both the source material and the properties of each poison, but presents each with ease, humour and logic. Even readers with limited chemical or medical understanding will be able to follow how the poison kills. I learned so many fascinating anecdotes that it quickly became a conversation starter at the office, and inspired further research. For example, I'm amazed I'd never heard of Count Bocarmé before; there should definitely be a film adaptation!I highly recommend this book, especially for fellow writers."
245,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6811689-shannon,3,"Rating: 2.5 rounded up for gorgeous art deco cover! I just want to thank the author, Kathryn Harkup, for giving me a crash course in chemistry and incidentally reminding me why I could NEVER be a doctor or pharmacist! The chapters on various poisons used in Agatha Christie's books & stories were quite detailed as they provided chemical analysis, case histories and how they were used as murder weapons. Some of the case histories were too horrific for me to handle...I enjoy murder as escape reading, NOT as reality. But if true crime is your thing, then they were related in a straightforward, clinical manner.What I took away from this book is that poison is really, really nasty stuff and almost all of them result in a vicious death, unless immediate steps are taken to reverse or mitigate the inevitable progression. People who would heartlessly subject anyone to the kind of appalling death that comes from almost any kind of poisoning, are truly monsters.Agatha Christie is to be recommended for her encyclopedic knowledge of poisons...her dispensary experience was put to excellent use!"
246,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3943605-rebecca,4,"I received an ARC of this from the publisher through Goodread's giveaways.This book was really fun to read, even for someone like me who has never actually read any books by Christie. The author was really good with explaining the chemistry and biology behind the poisons, with a lot of the history, medicine, and real life cases involving each one, alongside her use of them in the books. I found the scientific information easy to follow and understand, although I do have a medical background which does give me an advantage. I also appreciated the author's efforts to not spoil who any of the murderers were, aside from one case which was clearly marked, and so could be avoided if possible. Obviously she did go into detail about the actual mechanics of the murder in relation to the poisoning, but that section of each chapter could be easily avoided if the reader didn't want that information either."
247,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1013594-robyn,4,"Birthday gift from Rebecca! | Fascinating, and actually a good reference for aspiring mystery writers in itself, possibly too scientific for some readers. | I found every bit of this interesting, but readers who only care about the fictional use of these poisons and any tales of true-crime murders will have a lot of scientific and medical information to skim past. There's a lot of good information on how each substance works in the body, how it's detected, what its historical uses have been, etc. It's particularly interesting to take an overview and note how some of the poisons are antidotes to each other. Worth the read even if you're not a Christie fan, as I am, and Harkup either leaves solutions to the books out or gives fair warning to avoid spoilers. For us lovers of Christie's works, it's even better."
248,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45366873-miku,4,"This was a very educational book. I didn't think the science was too hard to grasp, but it does help to take an introductory chemistry course before reading. I don't think all science should be ""accessible"" since if you want to get advanced enough, you have to have previous knowledge. I have never read any of Agatha Christie's books, but still enjoyed A is for Arsenic. I loved how she showed the juxtoposition between the poisonous side of the compound/element with the therapeutic side. Though one thing I was annoyed by was how she assured everyone on that most current medicines with these poisons were safe now, but she has the right to her opinion and I know that most chemists are biased toward defending use of chemicals since that's how they get paid. Anyway this was a very interesting book, and I'll probably flip through it again and do further research on these poisons. "
249,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/719416-julia-garcia,5,"Okay. It only took me almost two years to finish reading this book, but that doesn't mean it was a bad book. It just means I was taking a plethora of notes. Because... Writing research! Yay!  Not only does this book have a stunning cover, but the content is very informative too. It does get a bit sciencey in parts, going over the chemical make-up of the poisons and how it affects the human body, but the author does a good job in breaking it down into fairly easy-to-understand terms. I'm not a science person and I was able to understand it.  Now that this book is finished, I'm going to try and see if there are books on the subject that are written this way. 10/10 for an engaging book on a fascinating subject. "

It details how Christie, with her background in pharmacy in both WWI and WWII, utilised the poisons, how the poisons were first discovered and how the poisons were largely used for mundane purposes before their more dire impacts were reckoned by society. As Harkup is a chemist by background, it goes rather into detail about the make-up of the poisons which was not my favourite element. I really appreciated the societal impact of poisons and widely accepted a whole range of were as sleeping aids, household poisons and even more. Largely spoiler free on the killers, however it does reveal who was poisoned and how, so if you're spoiler adverse may be something to avoid."

This plant is mentioned in the Bible and in several Shakespeare plays, and was even grown in the greenhouses at Harry Potter’s school, Hogwarts. (page 51, B is for Belladonna) and that’s how the book got 5 stars. I like the author’s way with words. Since I’m already interested in the topic, it doesn’t take much to get my attention. The book is very informative and engaging. The chemistry part is easy to follow. And I like how Harkup injects humor to a deadly serious topic."
252,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57248457-becky-tatar,3,"This book is a medical forensics coverage of the poisons Agatha Christie used in her books to kill off people. Each chapter covers a specific poison and the mystery book/short story it is used in. Then, Harkup goes into the history and science of the poison, how long it has been around, historical uses, if any, the chemical makeup of the poison, what it does chemically in the body, any tests/antidotes/cures for the poison, and how realistic the book deals with the poison. Very good, but the science makes it a little slow going."
253,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3127538-liz,3,"Very interesting book. Agatha Christie was qualified to dispense drugs in England and worked in the field for many years. And used that knowledge in her many mysteries where poison was a favorite method. The book is arranged by an alphabetical listing of poisons, and that author gives basic scientific knowledge, history, symptoms in real life and then looks at the Christie stories. Like how she evaluated Christie’s accuracy and also got into the stories without giving away the details."

The author clearly knows her stuff and the text was very detailed, but not so much as to be bogged down. I loved that each chapter included details on the poison's history, medicinal/cultural uses, chemical composition and biological effects on the body, real life cases, as well as how and where it occurred in Christie's novels. "
255,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88944753-andy,4,"Written by a chemist, this book shows not only the poisons but also how Agatha Christie learned about them and used them in her books. She also writes about the antidotes which is something Agatha never mentions. The reason it only gets four stars is that its a bit chemistry heavy, but a very good read all the same. I did like the little excerpts of the Christie books to show that Agatha knew what she was talking about."

I was hoping to give it 4 stars but left it at 3.5 because it becomes more of a reference guide than anything else and aside from the poisons featured and regular mentions of which Christie books they're in, it begins to lose its appeal over time. One more recommendation for Christie fans."

For those less experienced with her work, it will certainly heighten curiosity to see how she pulled all of these clues together in her narratives. Kathryn Harkup clearly has done her due diligence in researching both the source material and the properties of each poison, but presents each with ease, humour and logic. Even readers with limited chemical or medical understanding will be able to follow how the poison kills. I learned so many fascinating anecdotes that it quickly became a conversation starter at the office, and inspired further research. For example, I'm amazed I'd never heard of Count Bocarmé before; there should definitely be a film adaptation!I highly recommend this book, especially for fellow writers."
275,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6811689-shannon,3,"Rating: 2.5 rounded up for gorgeous art deco cover! I just want to thank the author, Kathryn Harkup, for giving me a crash course in chemistry and incidentally reminding me why I could NEVER be a doctor or pharmacist! The chapters on various poisons used in Agatha Christie's books & stories were quite detailed as they provided chemical analysis, case histories and how they were used as murder weapons. Some of the case histories were too horrific for me to handle...I enjoy murder as escape reading, NOT as reality. But if true crime is your thing, then they were related in a straightforward, clinical manner.What I took away from this book is that poison is really, really nasty stuff and almost all of them result in a vicious death, unless immediate steps are taken to reverse or mitigate the inevitable progression. People who would heartlessly subject anyone to the kind of appalling death that comes from almost any kind of poisoning, are truly monsters.Agatha Christie is to be recommended for her encyclopedic knowledge of poisons...her dispensary experience was put to excellent use!"
276,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3943605-rebecca,4,"I received an ARC of this from the publisher through Goodread's giveaways.This book was really fun to read, even for someone like me who has never actually read any books by Christie. The author was really good with explaining the chemistry and biology behind the poisons, with a lot of the history, medicine, and real life cases involving each one, alongside her use of them in the books. I found the scientific information easy to follow and understand, although I do have a medical background which does give me an advantage. I also appreciated the author's efforts to not spoil who any of the murderers were, aside from one case which was clearly marked, and so could be avoided if possible. Obviously she did go into detail about the actual mechanics of the murder in relation to the poisoning, but that section of each chapter could be easily avoided if the reader didn't want that information either."
277,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1013594-robyn,4,"Birthday gift from Rebecca! | Fascinating, and actually a good reference for aspiring mystery writers in itself, possibly too scientific for some readers. | I found every bit of this interesting, but readers who only care about the fictional use of these poisons and any tales of true-crime murders will have a lot of scientific and medical information to skim past. There's a lot of good information on how each substance works in the body, how it's detected, what its historical uses have been, etc. It's particularly interesting to take an overview and note how some of the poisons are antidotes to each other. Worth the read even if you're not a Christie fan, as I am, and Harkup either leaves solutions to the books out or gives fair warning to avoid spoilers. For us lovers of Christie's works, it's even better."
278,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45366873-miku,4,"This was a very educational book. I didn't think the science was too hard to grasp, but it does help to take an introductory chemistry course before reading. I don't think all science should be ""accessible"" since if you want to get advanced enough, you have to have previous knowledge. I have never read any of Agatha Christie's books, but still enjoyed A is for Arsenic. I loved how she showed the juxtoposition between the poisonous side of the compound/element with the therapeutic side. Though one thing I was annoyed by was how she assured everyone on that most current medicines with these poisons were safe now, but she has the right to her opinion and I know that most chemists are biased toward defending use of chemicals since that's how they get paid. Anyway this was a very interesting book, and I'll probably flip through it again and do further research on these poisons. "
279,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/719416-julia-garcia,5,"Okay. It only took me almost two years to finish reading this book, but that doesn't mean it was a bad book. It just means I was taking a plethora of notes. Because... Writing research! Yay!  Not only does this book have a stunning cover, but the content is very informative too. It does get a bit sciencey in parts, going over the chemical make-up of the poisons and how it affects the human body, but the author does a good job in breaking it down into fairly easy-to-understand terms. I'm not a science person and I was able to understand it.  Now that this book is finished, I'm going to try and see if there are books on the subject that are written this way. 10/10 for an engaging book on a fascinating subject. "
280,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14118218-merit,3,"A short and punchy analysis of 14-odd poisons that Agatha Christie used in her writing over her extensive career. It details how Christie, with her background in pharmacy in both WWI and WWII, utilised the poisons, how the poisons were first discovered and how the poisons were largely used for mundane purposes before their more dire impacts were reckoned by society. As Harkup is a chemist by background, it goes rather into detail about the make-up of the poisons which was not my favourite element. I really appreciated the societal impact of poisons and widely accepted a whole range of were as sleeping aids, household poisons and even more. Largely spoiler free on the killers, however it does reveal who was poisoned and how, so if you're spoiler adverse may be something to avoid."
281,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13109094-ann,5,"Perhaps the most famous of the poisonous Solanaceae is the mandrake. This plant is mentioned in the Bible and in several Shakespeare plays, and was even grown in the greenhouses at Harry Potter’s school, Hogwarts. (page 51, B is for Belladonna) and that’s how the book got 5 stars. I like the author’s way with words. Since I’m already interested in the topic, it doesn’t take much to get my attention. The book is very informative and engaging. The chemistry part is easy to follow. And I like how Harkup injects humor to a deadly serious topic."
282,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57248457-becky-tatar,3,"This book is a medical forensics coverage of the poisons Agatha Christie used in her books to kill off people. Each chapter covers a specific poison and the mystery book/short story it is used in. Then, Harkup goes into the history and science of the poison, how long it has been around, historical uses, if any, the chemical makeup of the poison, what it does chemically in the body, any tests/antidotes/cures for the poison, and how realistic the book deals with the poison. Very good, but the science makes it a little slow going."
283,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3127538-liz,3,"Very interesting book. Agatha Christie was qualified to dispense drugs in England and worked in the field for many years. And used that knowledge in her many mysteries where poison was a favorite method. The book is arranged by an alphabetical listing of poisons, and that author gives basic scientific knowledge, history, symptoms in real life and then looks at the Christie stories. Like how she evaluated Christie’s accuracy and also got into the stories without giving away the details."
284,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20430577-c-a,4,"This book was a great intro to both poisons and Agatha Christie's novels. The author clearly knows her stuff and the text was very detailed, but not so much as to be bogged down. I loved that each chapter included details on the poison's history, medicinal/cultural uses, chemical composition and biological effects on the body, real life cases, as well as how and where it occurred in Christie's novels. "
285,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88944753-andy,4,"Written by a chemist, this book shows not only the poisons but also how Agatha Christie learned about them and used them in her books. She also writes about the antidotes which is something Agatha never mentions. The reason it only gets four stars is that its a bit chemistry heavy, but a very good read all the same. I did like the little excerpts of the Christie books to show that Agatha knew what she was talking about."
286,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4167615-miklos,3,"An intriguing concept for a book, aimed at Agatha Christie fans who may also be interested in the poisons so often included. I was hoping to give it 4 stars but left it at 3.5 because it becomes more of a reference guide than anything else and aside from the poisons featured and regular mentions of which Christie books they're in, it begins to lose its appeal over time. One more recommendation for Christie fans."
287,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67713906-theleoching,5,A book that demands a desire in toxicology and basic knowledge in chemistry to fully enjoy. Harkup fully breaks down the methods and reasoning behind the poisons used and all the juicy interesting details about everything. Truly a good book to read that indulges both the literary side and the scientific. 
288,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43101325-michele,4,"This is a great book for fans of Agatha Christie.I loved getting a peek at the poisons Agatha used in her books, how they worked, and famous cases involving them.The poisons reviewed in this book are: Arsenic, Belladonna, Cyanide, Digitalis, Eserine, Hemlock, Monkshood, Nicotine, Opium, Phosphorus, Ricin, Strychnine, Thallium and Veronal. "
289,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66738910-avarla,3,"It was a bit slow at times and I'm sure I'd have enjoyed it more, if I had read the Agatha Christie novels beforehand, but I liked the science and real-life murder stories. Not going to land on my favourite-science-shelf, though, as I once again realised, that chemistry just isn't the science for me."
290,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63060226-sarah,3,"This book definitely gives you insight into the mind of Dame Agatha. The breakdown of the poisons is well written but is very heavy on the chemical composition. I really wanted to call my old chemistry teacher and have her explain some of the compounds that I was reading about. All in all,this is a good book providing some new outlook on the best crime writer in history."
291,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75164064-chinalyi,5,"Very thorough for even those who have difficulties understanding chemistry. Includes the scientific history of the poison, the symptoms of the poison, the cures (if there is one) of the poison, the historical uses of the poison, and how Christie uses the poison in her novel. The author is careful not to spoil any novel for the readers and always warns the readers in advance. "
292,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30992948-mary-ann-baleva,4,"I think I read this when I was in 5th grade. Not an assignment, mind you. All I remember is that Ms Christie, Sidney Sheldon, and Emily Bronte are the authors who got me from casual to voracious reading. I'm just rating it a 4-star because it'll be too biased if I gave it a 5, given that I don't even remember the entire story. "
293,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9970413-stephanie-matthews,5,"What an absolutely revelatory book. It's quite technical - not a bad thing - but in a very readable way, and I actually came away feeling like I've learned an awful lot. Essential reading if you are interested in biochemistry, crime, Agatha Christie, plants or just fancy a good book. Mine is going on the ""will be read again one day"" shelf."
294,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2072300-megan,4,"Read as research for an upcoming panel on poisons. Good fun! Harkup gets a little into the physiology and biochem of it all, but not too much, and rather miraculously doesn't spoil most of the Christie mysteries she discusses. Plus, did you guys know that Christie worked in a dispensary during the First World War and as a pharmacy assistant during the Second? She really knew her poisons!"
295,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1030319-coral,5,"The author blurb on the back of the book states that Harkup is ""a chemist, author, and Agatha Christie fanatic"" - and the book did nothing but drive that point home. I loved it. It's the perfect mix of straight up science, fictional murder mysteries, actual crimes, and humor.While Christie fans will get a lot out of reading this, reading any of her works is not a prerequisite by any means."
296,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66905447-louie,3,"While I think that A is For Arsenic is a very intriguing read, and I enjoyed how the author used multiple ways to discuss the poisons, like how they work, how Christie used them in her novels, and how they were used in real crimes, I just wish that it could have flowed a bit more smoothly and have been easier to understand."
297,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91994910-justin-allard,5,"I loved this book. I think the science of the poisons is explained in a detailed, but graspable way. I also found the history of each poison and the historical cases surrounding each poison to be very interesting. You can tell the author really admires Agatha Christie and as a fan of her books as well I thought this book was a perfect tribute."
298,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73667396-jane-randell,4,"An alphabetical guide to Agatha Christie’s deadly dispensary, cataloguing her use of poisons to provide fodder for her clever detectives. Fascinating and informative, although sometimes very technical and slightly difficult to follow. Had me wanting to reread a number of Christie’s books, a full list is thoughtfully provided at the end of the book listing both the UK and the US titles."
299,147291130X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35793704-micebyliz,0,"how i could eat while reading this book is beyond me. I really enjoyed the analysis of each poison and the book references. Not so much the real life murders, although i know it happens. In novels at least you don't feel so badly if a snake is killed, usually they deserve it. This kind of reminds me of Ellis Peters and Brother Cadfael."
